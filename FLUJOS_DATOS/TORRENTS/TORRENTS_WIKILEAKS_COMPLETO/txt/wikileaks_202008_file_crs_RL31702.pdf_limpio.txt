persistently high inflation rates since persistent inflation is ultimately the result of monetary policy many countries in the 1990s and 2000s sought institutional reforms to their central banks to prevent return to the 1970s experience popular reform was to move from giving central banks multiple policy goals to single mandate of price stability the single mandate was accompanied by the introduction of an inflation target under which central banks aim to keep inflation within predefined numerical range the logic behind these reforms was belief among proponents that it would remove the political temptation to pump up the economy in the short run at the expense of longrun price stability and belief that fine tuning monetary policy in response to every change in economic conditions was of little value some members of congress have expressed interest in and introduced legislation on adopting price stability mandate for the federal reserve federal reserve chairman ben bernanke is longtime advocate of inflation targeting this report analyzes the success of inflation targeting abroad by comparing both the performance of targeters to nontargeters and the performance of countries before and after targeting was adopted it finds that the economic performance of targeters improved distinctly after the adoption of an inflation target particularly in terms of lower and less variable inflation when compared with nontargeters however the success is less impressive because many nontargeters also enjoyed strong economic performances in the 1990s this suggests that there could be some unidentified third factor that explains the success of inflation targeters there is little evidence supporting the theory that low inflation can be achieved only at the cost of lower and more volatile economic growth the period of disinflation that frequently accompanied the introduction of inflation targeting however was often temporarily costly in terms of higher unemployment and lower growth the report then looks more closely at four economies that have adopted price stability goal new zealand which was the first country to adopt inflation targeting canada the united kingdom and the euro area one key finding from these case studies is that in practice central banks tend to operate with greater latitude and more discretion than some targeting proponents may have envisioned for example central banks still tend to respond to decline in economic activity by lowering interest rates even though strict attention to the target might not justify it this is possible because exceptions to the targets are granted for variety of shocks and the definition of inflation being targeted often excludes price changes due to factors such as food energy and excise taxes this report will not be updated for an indepth discussion of the theoretical debate and practical issues for crafting an inflation target see crs report 9816 should the federal reserve adopt an inflation target

that bedeviled market economies during the 1970s had profound effect on both policymakers and economists it convinced the former that inflation can have serious and disruptive economic and social consequences it helped convince skeptical economics profession that while such influences as oil price shocks droughts depreciation of the dollar or excise tax hikes may boost price indexes at one time or anther sustained inflation requires at least the acquiescence of the central bank 1 the conclusion that sustained rise in the price level is monetary phenomenon is important for it places responsibility for persistent inflation on the central bank it also kindled renewed interest among economists in sorting out and accounting for the costs that inflation imposed upon society and it led to various policy proposals for controlling inflation one of these involves replacing the multiple goal directive under which many cental banks operate with directive that focuses exclusively on promoting and ensuring the achievement of price stability although the united states has not replaced the current multigoal mandate of maximum employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates 2 for monetary policy with single goal of stable prices interest in doing so has had support from both democratic and republican members of congress an early ex ample of democratic support was the zero inflation resolution introduced by congressman stephen neal of north carolina in 1989 in the 109 th congress representative jim saxton republican of new jersey introduced the price stability act of 2005 hr 498 which would mandate price stability as the primary goal of the monetary policy of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal open market committee federal reserve chairman ben bernanke is longtime advocate of inflation targeting3 the goal of price stability has become the focus of monetary policy in most industrialized countries and number of developing countries typically this goal has been carried out by giving central banks an inflation target or the central banks have given themselves such target to meet the experience of four economies new zealand canada the united kingdom european central bank ecb whose central banks have either been directed or chosen to focus on such goal will be reviewed here in some detail the reason for reviewing this experience is straightforward the proposal for single goal of price stability has been controversial both polit ically and within the economics profession with proponents claiming that it would promote low inflation and macroeconomic stability and opponents claiming that low inflation would come at the expense of macroeconomic stability furthermore while implementing directive to achieve and maintain price stability sounds simple it can involve many technical problems such as how to define the goal which price index to use in measuring price stability what exceptions if any to permit whether the target should be range or point who should set the target the period for which it should be set what type of 1 testimony of alan greenspan before the subcommittee on domestic monetary

countries in implementing and operating monetary policy under single goal to promote price stability should be of value to us policymakers for it can provide insight into problems that might be encountered in implementing such strategy as well as reduce uncertainty about how monetary policy functions under single goal regime

and stable rate of inflation second it seeks to provide economic stability while it is long standing view among economists that manipula ting the money supply cannot influence the long run growth rate of an economy it can mitigate the booms and busts of the business cycle in the short run all else equal weak spending would lead to lower inflation and vice versa so while these goals will sometimes conflict they are often compatible 5 given these two goals it may seem strange that many central banks now focus monetary policy on single goal of price stability but how to best pursue the second goal economic stability is matter of some controversy proponents of inflation targeting claim that single goal regime would lead to lower inflation and more stable business cycle this claim is based on an argument that is both political and economic in nature they argue that when central banks are not given clear policy goals they are vulnerable to political pressures to use expansionary monetary policy to boost economic growth above its sustainable rate for shortterm political gain the longrun consequences of such an opportunistic policy they argue is higher inflation and monetary policy that over time is less effective at altering aggregate demand by holding central banks to sole goal of price stability proponents claim that monetary policy can longer be abused for political purposes by preventing abuse the sole goal of price stability becomes compatible with the other goal economic stability 6 furthermore these proponents are likely to be influenced by body of literature that suggests that when central bankers fine tune monetary policy to stabilize the economy they are likely to do more harm than good because of the time lags and uncertainty inherent in monetary policy7 focusing on price stability they argue gives central bankers longterm perspective that is more appropriate opponents of inflation targeting argue that the economic stability goal should not be officially subordinated to the price stability goal they argue that doing so will exacerbate the booms and busts of the business cycle to societys detriment in particular they fear that too great focus on low inflation will lead to periods of needlessly sluggish growth and high unemployment they 4 for detailed discussion of these issues see crs report 9816 should the federal reserve adopt an inflation target by marc labonte and gail makinen 5 for an introduction to monetary policy issues see crs report rl30354 monetary policy and the federal reserve current policy and conditions by gail makinen and marc labonte 6 it should be noted that low inflation is not an end itself but means to an end there are many ways in which lower and more stable inflation could improve economic efficiency for example lower inflation would reduce tax and investment distortions reduce uncertainty in planning and divert resources away from the unproductive avoidance of inflation at the relatively low rates of inflation found in the industrialized world however these improvements in efficiency may be too small to translate into measurable increases in gdp growth indeed it is difficult to find such improvements in the data thus this report focuses on whether inflation targeting makes growth more stable rather than focusing on whether it increases growth rates for more information see crs report

responsibly they point to the economys complexity and the multitude of potential shocks that could affect an economy as rationales for giving central bankers as much discretionary decisionmaking power

both sides of the price stability debate make compelling arguments and since the arguments are partly political they cannot be settled by theory alone to an extent the argument can be settled empirically however both sides claim that their po licies would lead to or at least not prevent low and stable inflation and stable economic growth since so many foreign central banks operate under an inflation target one can look to international experience to see which argument receives the most support two pieces of evidence can be brought to bear on the argument first did countries that adopted inflation targets have lower and stabler inflation and more stable growth after the adoption of the target second did inflation targeters have lower and stabler inflation and more stable growth than nontargeters the latter question is useful because even if country saw its macroeconomic performance improve after the adoption of an inflation target it could be due to broader change in the economy or the political climate for example macroeconomic performance could have improved because voters became less tolerant of high inflation the economy was subject to fewer supply shocks or policymakers understanding of the economy improved if the improvement were due to any of these other reasons then the adoption of an inflation target by policymakers uncommitted to responsible policy would not lead to decline in inflation 8 by comparing targeters to nontargeters one can gauge whether the improvement in targeting country was part of broader trend rather than the adoption of target9 tables 1 and 2 compare the economic performance of inflation targeters and nontargeters respectively the average inflation rate indicates whether inflation has been kept low and the standard deviation of inflation over time indica tes whether it was kept stable lower standard deviation is equal to greater stability monetary policy cannot determine the longrun growth rate of the economy but it can influence its stability in terms of smoothing the ups and downs of the business cycle the output gap and standard deviation of economic growth are used to determine if economic performance was stable the output gap is measure of how far an economy is operating from full potential ie when all of its resources are employed and is measured as percentage of gdp using the average absolute value so that positive and negative output gaps 8 statisticians refer to this phenomenon as an identification problem or omitted variable bias it could be that inflation targeting did not cause responsible monetary policy rather responsible policymakers simultaneously pursued low inflation policies and adopted inflation targets because there is way to directly measure res ponsibility the improvement is attributed to the infla tion targetwhich is measurableinstead 9 for similar overviews see edwin truman inflation targeting institute for international economics october 2003 frederic mishkin and klaus

is undesirable to be above or below full potential one problem with the sample of nontargeters is that it is very small and not diverse there are only two large economies in the world that do not have an explicit or legislativelyimposed inflation target united states and japan medium sized economies and handful of small economies there is significant degree of diversity in central bank regimes among nontargeters however 10 how successful country has been at achieving price stability depends on what one considers to be the optimal rate of inflation there is widespread agreement among economists that inflation is harmful if it is higher than few percentage points per year or negative ie deflation below few percentage points however consensus breaks down some economists argue for an inflation rate of zero stressing the harmful effects that inflation has on planning and the distortions in economic activity it creates through channels such as the tax system other economists argue that low but positive inflation is beneficial to an economy because it helps grease the wheels of the economy by making it possible to have real relative price declines without requiring nominal prices to decline in addition all economists engaged in this debate recognize measurement errors in the consumer price index cpi and gdp deflator that cause inflation to be overstated if measured inflation is say two percentage points higher than actual inflation then the central bank would need to target measured inflation rate above 2 just to avoid deflation thus positive rate of measured inflation may be necessary to keep actual prices stable t able 1 economic p erf ormance of inflation t arg eters befor and after country inflation rate average inflation rate standard deviat ion

singapore experienced two years by contrast among targeters only israel and new zealand suffered from deflation one year each both targeters and nontargeters enjoyed extremely stable inflation as measured by the standard deviation of the inflation rate with the exception of israel and hong kong israel underwent major disinflation decline in the inflation rate around the time it adopted an inflation target which would make the standard deviation large hong kongs experience illustrates one of the drawbacks of currency board inflation is effectively determined by fluctuations in the demand for hong kong assets when the demand for assets is volatile the inflation rate will be volatile what about the critics claim that inflation targ eting would lead to excessively volatile economic growth as measured by the output gap and the standard deviation of the growth rate third and fourth column of table 1 four economies australia canada united kingdom euro area experienced more stable economic growth after the adoption of an inflation target two economies were less stable new zealand and israel and two had mixed experiences sweden and switzerland this may suggest that in practice the political benefits of inflation targeting eg preventing opportunistic behavior may outweigh the economic disadvantages 12 it may also suggest that most targeters do not interpret their mandate literally when faced with choice between preventing an economic downturn or preventi ng inflation from rising slightly above its target they choose the former and reduce interest rates although literal interpretation of their mandate would have them choose the latter and increase interest rates in practice inflation targeters seem to leave central banks more room for discretion and fine tuning than one might expect and this does not appear to come at the expense of maintaining price stability13 compared with nontargeters the economic growth of targeters is comparably stable few small countries were markedly more volatile than the rest four of which were targeters iceland israel new zealand and sweden and two nontargeters singapore and hong kong since smaller countries tend to be more vulnerable to external conditions beyond their control their economies would be expected to be less stable among the rest of the countries the results were broadly similar australia and great britain demonstrate that targeters can maintain economic stability for long periods of time and the united states and denmark demonstrate that nontargeters can do so as well as for the concern that an inflation target would make recession more serious there does not seem to be any correlation between inflation targeting and countries with lower growth during the 20012002 economic slowdown new zealand australia canada and the united kingdomall targetersescaped the slowdown relatively unscathed nor is there strong evidence that negative output gaps were more likely to persist in countries with inflation targets the united kingdom and new zealand had large and persistent output gaps throughout the early 1990s with an inflation target while they were still in the transition phase of the target regime 12 in the implementation of an inflation target there was transition period in many countries when the inflation rate was reduced for couple of years before it was kept within the longrun target boundaries this is likely to have caused economic growth and employment to have fallen temporarily in many countries part of the disinflation occurred before the announcement of the target regime whether the disinflation should be attributed to the pretarget regime because the need for disinflation came from the policies of the past the target regime because policymakers could have left inflation high in the absence of the target to avoi d negative gdp effects is matter of debate if the transition period is included in the targeting period one should not extrapolate that performance into the future since the disinflation is onetime event since table 1 covers 10 year period any transition effects should not affect the results 13 one way to allow central bank to respond to changes in economic activity without br eaching the target is to make the target range sufficiently wide that modest changes in inflation are not deemed concern

japan in this decade had similar difficulties without target now that the aggregate data have been analyzed it may be useful to review the individual experiences of four key economies in greater depth to gain richer understanding of how inflation targeting has worked out in practice new zealand is examined because it was the first country to adopt inflation targeting canada and the united kingdom are examined because they are important trading partners who were also earlier target adopters finally the euro area is considered since it is the worlds second largest economy 14 g16g142g160g561g28g142g138g149g138g151g141g561 among the four economies highlighted in this report new zealand has the most detailed and structured program directing its central bank the reserve bank of new zealand to follow goal of price stability15 new zealand also has the longest experience with inflation targeting on may 4 1989 the government of new zealand introduced the reserve bank of new zealand act it was passed by parliament on december 15 1989 and took effect on february 1 1990 the act declared the stability of the general level of prices shall be the overriding objective of monetary policy other subordinate objectives are men tioned in the act although the administration of the act makes it possible for the bank to focus on other goals such as gdp growth and employment under the terms of the legislation the minister of finance and the reserve bank governor are required to make periodic policy targets agreements or ptas regarding the price index to be targeted and the allowable range of inflation that is consistent with the act price stability is defined in terms of an allowable but positive inflation rate rather than stable price level which would require any inflation that occurred to be offset by deflation the inflation goal is set by the government and it is incumbent on the reserve bank to achieve it the governor of the bank is required to repor t on the inflation performance twice per year and may be dismissed for failure to achieve the target at any time during hisher fiveyear term dismissal is not however automatic as of th is date governor has been dismissed to enhance the independence of the bank the government provided for its advanced funding for fiveyear period it should be noted that this advanced funding was specified in nominal terms which should act as an added incentive to keep the inflation rate low however it would be wrong to view the bank as anything other than an agency of the government it does not have statutory independence even though it does have instrument independence in that it can vary interest rates to achieve its goal although the pta fixed the consumer price index as the index for measuring inflation it allowed the reserve bank to exclude from that measure of inflation the first round effects from changes in the international terms of trade indirect taxes natural disasters disasters due

cpi it is important to note that the reserve bank calculates the effect of these factors on the inflation rate the calculations are not made by the governments statistical agency statistics new zealand thus the reserve bank prepares the inflation numbers against which it is evaluated however when these escape clauses are invoked the bank must formally communicate this to the government the core of this regime as noted above is the pta in the first one dated march 1990 an eventual goal of holding inflation within range of 0 to 2 was expressed however as an interim the reserve bank announced that it would use as guidepost range for inflation at years end of from 3 to 5 it was emphasized that the target was intended to be true range in that both floor and ceiling were important and that special emphasis was to be placed on the midpoint in actual practice the inflation rate has frequently been near the upper bound of the range the election that took place in december 1990 resulted in new government it worked out new pta with the reserve bank under which new set of inflation goals were adopted for the next three years25 to 45 for the end of 1991 15 to 35 for the end of 1992 and 0 to 2 for the end of 1993 late in 1993 the government extended the 0 to 2 range for an indefinite period and specified that the inflation rate was to be contained within this range on continuous basis since the consumer price index is only published quarterly this means that the price stability goal must be met every quarter as opposed to being met on an average basis over the year or at the end of the year 16 the pta negotiated in december 1996 had an indefinite time horizon and broadened the target range to 0 to 3 part of the reason for broadening the range was political newly emerging political party had campaigned on the basis that the prevailing range was too restrictive and that as result it had an adverse effect on employment in the election in 1996 this party came to hold the balance of power after it joined the governing coalition the range increase took place second reason for broadening the range was operational the reserve bank complained that the narrow range and the need to meet the inflation target continuously caused undesirable instability in the instruments of monetary policy meaning that often large fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates took place these fluctuations were thought to be disruptive to output growth and employment the pta signed on september 17 2002 involved several significant changes in the conduct of monetary policy first the targeted range was changed to 1 to 3 from 0 to 3 second the target did not have to be achieved continuously it was now to be met over the medium term third there appears to subtle shift in emphasis in the sense that price stability now becomes more of means to an end with the ultimate goal to promote sustainable and balanced economic development in order to create full employment higher real income and more equitable distribution of incomes it is unclear at this time what this means in terms of compromising the price stability goal it clearly diminishes accountability it should be emphasized that throughout the period in which monetary policy has been committed to price stability goal the reserve bank has continued to acknowledge that it still has short run objective of securing the financial stability of the country and to this end is prepared to act as lenderoflastresort such necessity has not yet arisen however moreover the escape 16 technically government cannot commit future governments to specified target range thus indefinite period must be understood to be until the end of the then sitting parliament however it is increasingly the experience that maintaining the target rate is litmus test for monetary responsibility thus opposition parties during elections pledge to maintain the target if elected for this reason the target takes on life of its own

competing goals as gdp growth and unemployment for example should the bank be forced to deflate the economy in the presence of an oil price hike terms of trade shock it could have serious negative consequences for gdp growth and employment by invoking the escape clause the bank can accommodate the shock and moderate its shortrun consequences for output and employment the drawback is that the bank can potentially use escape clauses to deflect blame for policy mistakes and too many uses of the escape clause would render the inflation target meaningless the reserve bank has been aided in achieving its price stability goal by the governments commitment to program of budget deficit reductions between 1986 and 1993 the budget was in deficit each year ranging between 07 and 46 of gdp from 1994 to 2006 the budget was in surplus each year this move to budget surpluses has decreased the stress placed on the reserve bank to accommodate budget deficits giving it greater independence to focus on achieving price stability an important element of this new regime was to establish the credibility of the price stability goal in the minds of economic agents economists believe that monetary policy is more effective when the publics inflation expectations are low t hus an important element of new zealands new monetary regime is to promote transparency by providing information to the public about why monetary policy decisions are made how policy is executed to keep inflation within the targeted range and what it seeks to accomplish although as noted above there are still gaps in transparency survey data indicate that inflationary expectations in new zealand fell from doubledigit rates in the 1980s until about 1992 and were stable through the rest of the period covered by the study 17 the evidence from figure 1 suggests that the reserve bank has been able to keep the underlying inflation rate within the targeted range during most of this period the bank has invoked the terms of trade escape clause three times 19901991 1994 and 20002001 to accommodate international oil price shocks as noted above giving the bank discretion to invoke an escape clause does not come without price the transparency and credibility of policy is reduced for example the increase in oil prices in 1994 was not significant yet the bank invoked an escape clause anyway 17 murray sherwin

source int ernational moneta ry fund note inflation is measured as th consume r p rice index case can be made that inflation targeting has yielded substantial benefits for new zealand by comparing the period 19821989 with 1994200118 between those periods the average inflation rate under the new regime fell by more than 80 much of the fall in inflation occurred before inflation targeting was introduced however the fall in inflation was accompanied by rise in the average unemployment rate as seen in figure 2 averages may be deceptive however while it is true that between 1994 and 2001 unemployment averaged 66 the rate has been falling and in 2001 it averaged 53 by 2006 it had fallen to 38 in the earlier period it averaged 48 but was on the rise reaching 71 by 1990 19 the average rate of growth of gdp over the years 19942001 was 31 during the target period gdp contracted in only one year 1998 at the height of the asian financial crisis thus inflation targeting did not render new zealand immune from this major regional economic shock over the period 19821989 gdp growth averaged 28 this average was dominated by two years 1984 66 and 1987 68 in five other years it was under 2 and during 1983 gdp grew only 01 another way to measure economic performance is to see how close actual gdp is to potential or fullemployment gdp over the period 19942001 the absolute average of the output gap was 10 during the 1982 1989 period it was 19 or nearly twice as large during both 2000 and 2001 new zealands gdp was very near to its potential unemployment and economic growth data since 1980 are shown in figure 2 of course the improvement in economic performance may not have been 18 for each of the four focus countries comparisons will be made between the period in which the goal of price stability was fully implemented vs the same number of years prior to the single goal regime the transition period in which the new regime had been announced but the central bank had not yet been required to reach its ultimate inflation target is not included in either set of results since the 0 to 2 goal was to be reached at the end of 1993 we designate 1994 as the full implementation of the new regime for new zealand 19 ideally the comparison in each period should be the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the full employment rate of unemployment the latter of which might vary over the different time periods in other words since monetary policy cannot influence the full employment rate of unemployment the regime should be considered success if the unemployment rate was kept closer to the full employment rate than in the earlier period regardless of which period had the lowest unemployment rate since the full employment rate is not available for all countries we present the actual unemployment rate instead as suggestive measure

103 in 1991 and 1992 to gauge how the bank has balanced its price stability mandate with the desire for economic stability in practice it is useful to look more closely at two episodes where the regime was tested 19971998 2000 in 19971998 the bank had to react to contagion effects from the asian crisis characterized by fall in exports to leading trading partners an exchange rate appreciation with affected asian countries that put pressu re on importcompeting industries and worldwide financial unrest the bank held shortterm interest rates steady in 1997 and the first half of 1998 despite the fact that inflation was falling and well within the target range in the second half of 1997 the economy began to contract in 1998 the bank then lowered rates significantly in the second half of 1998 perhaps the bank would have reacted more strongly to the negative shock had it not been for its sole goal mandate on the other hand the effects of the crisis may have been more serious than the bank anticipated looking at the banks monetary policy statements from the time it appears that the bank initially underestimated the negative effect the crisis would have on gdp and overestimated its inflationary effects because the tradeweighted exchange rate was depreciating in late 2000 the inflation rate unexpectedly rose full percentage point above the target despite monetary tightening that began earlier in the year the rise in oil prices that year probably contributed to this rise in inflation interestingly the bank did not tighten policy further when inflation moved above the target citing the transitory nature of the oil shock in fact the bank undertook slight easing in policy in mid2001 despite the fact that inflation was still slightly above the 3 target boundary this easing was presumably in response to the contraction of gdp httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31702g18g155g146g140g142g561g21g157g138g139g146g149g146g157g162g561g507g11g151g143g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g22

an inflation rate that was above target and slowing economy the bank did not take sharp measures to rein in inflation as the sole goal mandate suggests to some the target may have made the banks response to the slowdown more moderate than it ot herwise would have been however g5g138g151g138g141g138g561 the bank of canadas commitment to goal of price stability was not the result of legislation amending the bank act to make price stability the exclusive focus of monetary policy rather the effort to commit the bank to this goal began in 1988 as personal campaign by the then bank governor john crow his efforts culminated in the joint announcement by the minister of finance and the governor of the bank on february 26 1991 of formal targets for reducing inflation and establishing price stability in canada20 the announcement date was carefully chosen to attract public attention as it was the day on which the government announced its budget thus it was policy of the government and the bank and not change in the bank of canada act such cooperative or joint effort continues to this day with the inflation target being jointly determined and announced by the government and the bank21 as in new zealand price stability was defined in terms of targeted rate of inflation rather than stable price level precise definition was not given initially to the term price stability since the government and the bank were uncertain about how the economy would behave in an environment of price stability however at the outset the bank stated that price stability meant an inflation rate below 2 the joint announcement specified that it was desired that the rate of inflation would fall between 2 and 4 by the end of 1992 some 22 months beyond the date of the announcement to between 15 and 35 by mid1994 and to between 1 and 3 by the end of 1995 the 1 to 3 range has been continuously reconfirmed to the present day 22 setting out the path to price stability in the initial announcement was thought to be important in building expectations of economic agents and the credibility of the bank in achieving such goal studying the inflationary expectations of the public over this time can determine how successful the target has been in this regard one study found evidence that inflation targeting lowered the inflationary expectations of the public quickly from over 5 shortly before the target was introduced to 2 in 1996 23 but another study found that inflation targeting had rapid effect on inflationary expectations and to the extent that expectations fell they remained above the target range24 20 joint statement of finance minister and bank governor february 26 1991 21 see also gordon theisen the canadian experience with inflation targeting in banco mexico stabilization and monetary policy 2000 p 85 22 since the canadians have estimated that the upward bias in their cpi is at most 05 something else must be behind the decision to keep the range at 1 to 3 it may lie in the fact that some of the banks research has shown that this range is sufficiently wide to accommodate control error and unexpected shocks mainly s upply in nature over and above those due to food energy and the first round effects from changes in indirect taxes we date 1996 as the beginning of the new price stability regime omitting the transition period 23 ben fung scott mitnick and eli remolona

initial target range was to apply nearly two years after the announcement this was done on the grounds that monetary changes taken today would have their effects in the future it was also done to increase the likelihood of success second the targets did not have to be met continuously over any given period they were to be achieved by some specific date third the initial announcement made it sound as though the objective to be targeted was the midpoint of the range this has not been the practice however as the bank has not moved aggressively to force the rate to the midpoint of the range when it has lingered at or below the lower bound of the range but in some circumstances in which the inflation rate was pushed above the upper bound of the targeted range the bank would be expected to return the rate to the midpoint of the range although the targeted inflation rate range is specified in terms of the total consumer price index the bank of canada in practice conducts monetary policy based on modified cpi because it is interested in the trend rate of inflation and the actual course taken by the cpi can be influenced temporarily by the prices of such volatile items as food and energy and more permanently by such onetime events as changes in indirect taxes thus the bank uses modified cpi that excludes the eight most volatile components of the cpi for example in 1994 headline inflation briefly fell below 0 but the bank interpreted the effect to be caused by reduction in sales tax rates and did not change the stance of monetary policy unlike the reserve bank of new zealand this index is computed by statistics canada rather than by the bank itself accountability in the canadian framework is weak er than that of new zealand the minister of finance cannot fire the governor of the bank for failure to achieve the inflation goal the minister can issue policy directive ordering change in policy such as moving the interest rate in given direction this possibility however must add some uncertainty to the perception of economic agents about the independence of the bank to pursue the price stability goal such directive has yet been issued and some analysts argue that the policy directive does not pose credible threat to central bank independence because the government is unlikely to ever issue directive as in new zealand the bank of canada has made large effort toward greater policy transparency by communicating to the public its assessment of the economy the role played by monetary policy in the behavior of the economy and the rationale for its decisions since 1995 the bank of canada has issued semiannual monetary policy report the government and the bank recognize that under certain circumstances the inflation targets can be breached these are not enumerated at great length as in new zealand but clearly large increases in oil prices or widespread natural disaster are possible examples whether to accommodate these shocks was left to the discretion of the bank the data in figure 3 show that the bank of canada has had good deal of success meeting its price stability target from the data it would appear that the bank of canada has managed to cope with oil price shocks and the major changes in the relationship of the canadian to the us dollar between march 1991 and november 2002 the canadian dollar fell from us086 to 064

federal budget deficitthe spending control act of 1992 significant budget deficit reductions have been achieved and as in new zealand this has reduced pressure on the bank of canada to accommodate the government thus strengthening the ability of the bank to focus monetary policy on achieving price stability25 between 1990 and 1995 the budget deficit of the federal government fluctuated between 53 and 91 of gdp in 1996 the deficit declined to 28 of gdp and from 1997 through 2006 the budget was in surplus in all but two years the performance of the canadian economy since the price stability regime was fully implemented has been impressive as shown in figure 4 the average inflation rate under the target was nearly 50 lower than in the years before the target between 1996 and 2001 real gdp grew at an average rate of 36 and was positive each year moreover canada managed to avoid the contraction in gdp experienced by the us in 2001 an unexpected result since nearly 40 of canadian gdp is exported to the united states over the period 19861991 before the target was adopted gdp growth was positive in five of the six years and averaged 21 the absolute average of the output gap during

inflation27 this followed britains withdrawal from the european exchange rate mechanism whose system of fixed exchange rates had served as an anchor for british monetary policy the announcement was made by the chancellor because the thensubordinate position of the bank of england to the government was continued the chancellor rather than the bank governor set monetary policy neither its autonomy nor independence was enhanced by the change in focus in fact this was simply policy change by the government and involved change in the statutes governing the bank thus the new policy could be reversed at any time28 according to the chancellors announcement the goal was to hold the inflation rate as measured by the retail price index less the mortgage interest component to range of 1 to 4 per year with an expectation that the rate would be below 25 by the end of the then sitting parliament which would be later than the spring of 199729 in december 2003 the targeted inflation rate was switched to the consumer price index c pi thus the index used to measure inflation 26 the contraction in monetary policy actually predated the inflation targeting regime shortterm interest rates were

include such things as oil price shocks in their target moreover there was list of special exceptions to meeting the targets for shocks such as in the new zealand legislation as the prevailing inflation rate at the time of the announcement was below 4 goal of keeping it below 4 was not thought to be very ambitious the range of the inflation target set by the chancellor was originally intended to limit the scope for both slippage and countercyclical policy later the width of the range was interpreted as representing the view that monetary policy could only imperfectly control the inflation rate in june 1995 the range of 1 to 4 was replaced by point target of 25 that was to be met on continuous basis since the point target was not and could not be continuously met it implied that some deviations were to be tolerated in this initial step to change the monetary re gime the chancellor set the inflation target the bank of england provided twoyear inflation forecast on quarterly basis based on such factors as the level of unemployment gdp growt h the fiscal position of the government and the growth rate of various measures of money together with recommendation on the base interest rate its major tool for implementing monetary policy the chancellor decided whether or not to follow the banks recommendation thus in this arrangement the policy target was not the current inflation rate but rather the rate expected to prevail two years in the future it was upon this forecast that the bank made its recommendation on the current position to take by monetary policy 30 several times during these early years the chancellor overruled the recommendations of the bank to change the base rate problem with this arrangement that was perceived early on was that since the chancellor controlled the base interest rate the policy variable refusal to raise or lower it following recommendations of the bank of england could be in terpreted in variety of ways eg that the chancellor disagreed with the banks inflation forecast or that there was difference in their respective commitments to the infl ation goal this tended to obscure transparency and weaken accountability and probably also worked to raise expectations of inflation subsequently steps were taken by the government that both increased the independence of the bank of england and provided greater information about monetary policy beginning in february 1993 the bank began to issue quarterly inflation report presenting the banks assessment of inflation prospects and the views of the staff and officers about economic matters in general the then chancellor promised not to edit these reports but allow them to become public as written by the bank subsequent to september 1992 the chancellor and the governor instituted formal consultative meetings designed to formulate the implementation of monetary policy ie changing interest rates to achieve the inflation goal in april 1994 the chancellor agreed to the publication of the minutes of these monthly meetings after lapse of six weeks rather than the previous 30 years there was doubt however that it was the chancellor who made the ultimate decision about interest rate changes even though the bank was given control over the precise timing of the changes this makes the united kingdom unique case in that it may have been the only country to adopt an inflation target without giving its central bank instrument independence ie control over interest rates since both inflation targeting and central bank independence are the two major institutional change s that have been credited with generating the worldwide decline in inflation in the 1990s it is interesting to note that britain achieved price stability with the former but not the latter 30 the reason for the twoyear lag is that current changes in monetary policy are expected to have an effect on the inflation rate only in the future

announced that from then on the bank of england would be given control over changes in the base interest rates that it felt were necessary to achieve the governments inflation target decisions on moving the base interest rate were to be made by newly created ninemember monetary policy committee five of the nine members are bank of england office rs including the governor and deputy governor the remaining four are appointed by the governme nt all serve for term of three years and are eligible for reappointment thus the bank was given instrument independence but not goal independence on june 12 1997 just prior to the first meeting of the monetary policy committee the chancellor announced that the inflation target would remain 25 but should the actual rate deviate from the target by more than one percentage point in either direction it was to trigger report from the committee explaining why this had happened what policy actions were to be taken to deal with it and when the inflation rate was expected to be back on target in december 2003 the target was changed to 2 as measured by the cpi in april 2007 the committee wrote its first report to the chancellor explaining why inflation was more than 1 higher than its target 31 there are two possible weaknesses in the current regime first the inflation target is set by the government and the bank of england is expected to achieve this target subject to an override by the government if required in the national interest the law is silent on the conditions under which such an override can be invoked this ambiguity it can be argued makes it difficult for economic agents to discern clear signal of the seriousness of the governments commitment to achieve its goal overrides have yet occurred however second government can only set an inflation target that lasts while it has majority in the parliament when parliament comes to an end question can arise whether inflation in excess of the target will be remediated or whether bygones will be bygones this and the possibility of new target can also cause uncertainty for economic agents this may be an inherent limitation of targeting for democratic government is likely to surrender its right to determine economic policy to an unelected body however as noted above adherence to target once set seems to be litmus test for monetary responsibility in spite of perceived institutional shortcomings the new emphasis of price stability has yielded impressive results since the adoption of the regime the inflation rate shown in figure 5 has been kept very close to 25 which was markedly lower than during the previous 10 years the british have had difficulty achieving price stability in spite of the inclusion of food and energy in their targeted price index quite clearly the united kingdom has now had more than decade of low inflation in marked contrast with the wide fluctuations during the preceding decade 31 mervyn writes that letter economist april 21

was enhanced there is evidence that independence had significant effect on inflationary expectations measure of inflationary expectations derived from bond yields suggests that it had trended downward

expectations have dropped from over 4 to about 25 equal to the inflation target 32 the average inflation rate has been cut by half but figure 6 shows this has not had an adverse consequence on the major performance indicators of the british economy gdp has registered positive growth in each year from 1993 through 2007 and has averaged nearly 3 per year from 1984 to 1992 gdp contracted in one year 1991 and recorded growth in another 1992 and averaged 24 due to worldwide economic dow nturn like new zealand and canada major disinflation accompanied this contraction with inflation falling

only instance in which the goal was adopted at the currencys founding 33 then again the euro is unique political development in itself on january 1 1999 the european central bank took over responsibility for monetary policy in the countries of the euro area as of 2007 13 countries have willingly given up their currency and control of their monetary policy and handed it to newly created multicountry institution the european central bank ecb which has high degree of political independence and is directly answerable only to the european union eu and not its individual member states furthermore to ensure the euros success the countries of the eu have placed significant limitations on their fiscal policy and public debt as discussed below the sole goal of price stability is enshrined in the multinational treaty between sovereign governments of the eu that brought the euro and ecb into existence this makes it much more difficult to change than the mandate of most central banks since it can only be changed if the treaty is amended the specific numerical inflation target was not specified in the treaty however it was independently chosen by the ecbs govern ing council to support the price stability goal 33 factual information from this section comes from otmar issing et monetary policy in the euro area cambridge cambridge university press 2001

the definition they chose was inflation of less than 2 not explicitly specifying whether this represented band from 0 2 and if there was preferred midpoint to the band note that the 2 target has precedence in the eu and was not chosen arbitrarily in the years leading up to the euro the council of the eu instructed all prospective members of the euro to bring their inflation rate down to 2 this is somewhat analogous to the transition period that many countries adopt when implementing an inflation target in which inflation is allowed to slowly decline down to the targeted rate many of the other details surrounding the target were not included in the treaty either the governing council decided that the inflation target should be achieved over the medium term and that inflation would be defined by the 12 month change in the harmonized index of consumer prices hicp for the euro area as whole policy will not be directed towards unique inflationary developments in individual countries the ecb decided against targeting core inflation rate or identifying escape clauses when the target would not have to be met credibility is always an important issue for central bankers and one of the main arguments used by inflation target proponents the ecb faced unique credibility problem it has past record on which to stake its reputation for political reasons many participants felt that the ecb could achieve credibility if it could establish continui ty with the bundesbank the german central bank which was known for its tough antiinflationary stance this was one reason that the sole goal of price stability was enshrined in the founding treaty it also helps explain why the growth rate of the monetary aggregates is given prominent role in the ecbs decision makingrestraining the growth of the monetary aggregates had traditionally played prominent role in bundesbank policydespite the fact that targeting the aggregates will sometimes contradict the inflation target 34 accountability and transparency are provided through annual and quarterly reports to the european parliament publication of the ecbs infl ation forecast and press releases immediately following the monthly meetings of the ecb go verning council which determine changes in monetary policy there are formal penalties in place if the inflation target is missed however and the meeting minutes and voting records of individual members of the governing council are not released as is the case with individual countries large budget deficits can make the goal of price stability more difficult for the ecb to achieve indeed shared monetary policy creates greater incentives for individual countries to run large budget deficits than would normally occur when the fiscal and monetary authorities represent the same government that is individual countries could benefit by increasing their budget deficits to the detriment of the other members of the euro area since budget deficits would tend to push interest rates up across the euro area individual countries may also be less concerned about debt default if they think the ecb would be willing to bail them out to offset the debt incentive problem the eu adopted the stability and growth pact which limits euro members to budget deficits under 3 of gdp unless the members economy shrank by at least 075 and limits member sovereign debt to less than 60 of gdp since number of 34 some economists do not consider the ecb to be true inflation targeter since it does not have sole goal of price stability it also has goal of targetin g the growth of the money supply the rationale for the latter goal however can only be understood in terms of promoting price stability

of gdp this requirement was modified to require members to adopt future debt path that would lead them to debt level of 60 of gdp to enforce the pact the eu had the right to fine offending countries up to 05 of their gdp these fiscal strictures are undoubtedly harsher than those that most other sovereign countries face us budget deficits were higher than 3 of gdp for most of the period from 1982 to 1993 and again from 2003 to 2004 however if the countries in the euro area are compared with say the state governments in the united states operating in the dollar area then the strictures do not appear particularly harsh at all nearly all american states are legally required to run balanced budgets and cannot be bailed out by the federal reserve if they default although they could theoretically be bailed out by the federal government 35 in the first three years of the euro all euro area countries met the requirements of the stability and growth pact and budget deficits were significantly smaller than in preceding years however several of the countries ran small budget deficit despite experiencing relatively robust economic growth unfortunately budget deficits grow when economic growth falls due to declines in tax revenues and automatic increases in expenditures when the euro areas economy slowed in 2002 it became clear that several countries were unlikely to fulfill the pacts requirements to date fines were assessed for these violations although the offending countries took remedial action and at this time the pacts future is in question as result as seen in figure 7 the ecb has successfully kept the inflation rate low but not as low as its target from june 2000 to 2005 the hpic was at or slightly above the upper bound of 2 in most months this occurred despite the fact that economic growth was weak from 2001 to 2005 as seen in figure 8 growth was relatively robust in 1999 and 2000 but over the last decade it has fallen short of the growth rates enjoyed by the ited states the overall growth rate in the 2000s masks the fact that the countries on the periphery such as ireland and greece have enjoyed rapid rates of growth while countries at the core such as italy and germany have lagged behind average unemployment was lower in the 2000s than the previous decade but remains relatively high as it has been since the 1980s research suggests that inflation targeting has had little effect so far on inflationary expectations although inflationary expectations reached their lowest point in 15 years in 2000 they reached their highest pointwell

significant criticism37 critics charge that the bank has been too slow to respond to changing economic conditions these critics have become particularly vocal since economic growth in the euro area began to slow in 2001 growth was below 2 from 2001 to 2005 in some countries such as germany and italy growth has been lower than the average the critics claim that the ecb should have cut interest rates more aggressively as the fed did to counte r the downturn from october 2000 to june 2003 the ecb cut the overnight interest rate from 475 to 2 during that time the federal reserve lowered overnight interest rates by 55 percentage points to 1 critics have also claimed that the bank has not been sufficiently transparent po inting to the fact that financial markets have expected more expansionary policy than the bank has delivered the irony of this criticism is that the bank appears to be doing exactly what would be expected from central bank whose sole goal is price stability from june 2000 to 2005 the hpic was typically at or above the upper bound of 2 although the economic slowdown would be expected to quell inflationary pressures it did not do so enough to offset other developments that were boosting prices such as the oil price spike it is difficult to see how the bank could have cut interest rates more aggressively without ignoring its target and since it never deviated from its target its actions should have been transparent in this light the misperception on the part of financial markets seems to be due to their belief that the bank would pursue its mandate less aggressively than it did g14g146g157g142g155g138g157g158g155g142g561g20g142g159g146g142g160g561 in his previous academic career chairman bernan ke and his coauthors devised series of tests to answer the question how successful has inflation targeting been first they ask does inflation targeting make disinflation less costly in other words does the shortrun tradeoff between inflation and unemployment improve under an inflation targeting regime to answer this question they look at the predicted tradeoff based on data prior to the regime and compare it with the actual tradeoff after the regime they do not find compelling evidence that inflation targeting improves the shortrun tradeoff second they ask does adoption of inflation targeting reduce inflationary expectations based on survey and interest rate data they find that inflationary expectations declined in all targeting countries after the adoption of the target but not immediately however during that time inflationary expectations declined in nontargeting countries as well suggesting there could be some other force driving expectations 38 finally they ask does inflation targeting change the behavior of inflation for example they hypothesize that if targeting improves central bank credibility and inflationary expectations then there would 37 for example see hugh williamson germany to urge

to answer this question they forecast inflation rates based on data prior to the adoption of the targeting regime and compare it with actual rates achieved after the regime they find that the actual rates are better than forecasted suggesting targeting may improve the inflationary process in benign way however actual rates were better than forecasted in many nontargeting countries as well this suggests that more prudent central banking in general rather than inflation targeting in particular has changed the behavior of inflation 39 economist michael dotsey argues that direct comparison of targeters and nontargeters underestimates the effectiveness of inflation targeting because the countries that choose to become targeters are more likely to have had problems with high inflation in the past he argues better way to judge inflation targeting is by comparing the change in inflation before and after inflation targeting is adopted to the change in inflation in nontargeting countries over the same period of time when this comparison is made he finds that inflation targeters experience much larger decline in inflation than nontargeters this conclusion begs the question of why some countries have been able to keep inflation low without inflation targeting however it may also imply that country that has already achieved low inflation such as the united states has little to gain from adopting an inflation target 40 economists dueker and fischer compare thre targeting countries new zealand united kingdom and canada to three nontargeters australia germany and the united states and find little statistical difference between the two groups in both groups inflation fell and the inflation performance of the targeter closely matched its nontargeting counterpart41 economists neumann and von hagen empirically estimate how monetary policymaking changed after the adoption of inflation targeting they find th at interest rates rose more when inflation rose in australia new zealand the united kingdom and sweden after targeting was adopted but find contradictory evidence for canada compared with nontargeters monetary policy is not significantly more responsive to inflation in targeting countries than in germany but it is more responsive than in switzerland and the united states although some of this evidence is not statistically significant monetary policy is most responsive to the output gapwhich would not occur under strict inflation targetin two targeters australia and canada and two non targeters switzerland and the united states 42 economists ball and sheridan argue that countries show reduction in inflation after adopting target because of reversion to meancountries with high inflation one year are more likely to have low inflation in the next year independent of policy choices the authors also found statistical evidence that targeting countries had more stable inflation or economic growth than nontargeting countries after adjusting for mean reversion therefore they argue that the benefits of inflation targeting are overestimated by looking at reductions in inflation by stressing the role 39 ben s bernanke et inflation targeting

argument seems to downplay the direct effect that monetary policy has on inflation outcomes however43 focus on price stability requires that monetary policy be less oriented toward another traditional goalexchange rate stability economist andrew rose provides evidence that inflation targeting economies are not more prone to exchange rate volatility or current account imbalances than economies with other types of monetary regimes however this evidence is mostly not statistically significant furthermore rose argues that inflation targeting although still fairly new has so far proven to be more durable and less crisis prone than fixed exchange rate regimes in fact unlike many fixed exchange rate regimes inflation targeting regime has been involuntarily abandoned to date 44 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 overall there is conclusive evidence that economic performance improved for industrialized countries after the adoption of an explicit inflation target as expected inflation fell and became more stable after the adoption of the target but this improvement did not come at the expense of significant macroeconomic instability as critics claimed it would one sign of inflation targetings success is that country has involuntarily abandoned it to date however when compared with similar countries that did not explicitly target inflation it is not clear that the performance of targeters was superior the possibility that good economic performance may have been due to other factors that occurred at the time inflation targeting was introduced cannot be ruled out the evidence suggests that good monetary policy depends above all on the intentions and commitment of the central bank whether inflation targeting is useful way to reinforce that commitment is subject to debate and probably hinges highly on the political institutions particular to each country furthermore the execution of monetary policy under inflation targeting may not appreciably differ from the practice in other coun tries countries without formal inflation targets like the united states have been described as implicit inflation targeters in the sense that there is widespread perception that the fed will increase interest rates whenever inflation exceeds 3 4 countries that are already implicit inflation targeters may find little difference in performance following the adoption of an explicit target many of the countries surveyed adopted inflation targets in response to the failure of the previous monetary policy regime sweden and the united kingdom adopted targets soon after having their exchange rate forced out of the european exchange rate mechanism erm new zealand adopted its target after experiencing several years of double digit inflation under such circumstances these countries presumably had more to gain from regime purportedly designed to promote stability and credibility if the introduction of an inflation target coincides with disinflationary monetary policy intended to reduce the inflation rate temporary losses in output and employment are likely to occur in the four economies surveyed in this report most or all of the

coincided with the worldwide recessions of the early 1990s and it is not clear to what extent the disinflations were planned and to what extent they were the byproduct of those recessions the recessions were brief and it is difficult to find evidence that the disinflation left negative lasting effects on economic growth although in some targeting countries average unemployment was higher in the 1990s than 1980s since us inflation has been low for over decade it is unlikelybarring changes in monetary policythat disinflationary period would need to accompany the introduction of an inflation target domestically thus the temporary losses in output and employment experienced abroad would not be experienced in the united states and should not be used as an argument against inflation targeting here in practice inflation targets have not taken the pure form that some of their proponents may have envisioned when stressing the regimes purportedly positive effect on transparency accountability credibility and the depoliticization of monetary policy exceptions to the target have proven to be the norm and target ranges have been made relatively wide to prevent interest rate and exchange rate instability incidents where the inflation rate moved slightly outside the target range have not resulted in abrupt changes in policy likewise target regimes do not live up to opponents worst fearscentral banks under targets have still been willing to use monetary policy to counteract economic slowdowns at most it could be argued that the targeters caused policymakers to counteract the slowdowns less aggres sively than they should have for example in the 20012002 slowdown the european central bank lowered interest rates more slowly and less aggressively than the federal reserve the authors would like to thank heather negley for valuable research assistance g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561
