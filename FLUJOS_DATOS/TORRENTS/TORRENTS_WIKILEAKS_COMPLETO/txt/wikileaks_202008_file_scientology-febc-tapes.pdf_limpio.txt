just want to say hello i cant tal k just ba sically i want to say hell well thats better thats better and you some f you have been in s tate of study away wit hout talking to ron about your troubles and i thou ght it was about time that we br oke the ice here little bit and gave you some inkl ing f whe re we ar going to and why you ar here you probably know that alr eady but i know better why you are her and i knew previously we are in quite ye ar here in 1970 we are in quite year this year didnt look lik it was going to amount to much when 196 9 was bu sy expiring and the amount of admin and devt that has been goin g bac k and forth across the lines her didnt look lik things we re going so well but the wild part of it is that 19 70 has been about the biggest breakthrough year in terms of administrative techno logy and in terms in actu fact of auditing technol ogy that we have had since 50 easily ill give you some kind of an idea i was just br eaking through nine and ten t levels youve never even heard of them but our lower level technol ogy is now puttin g into view an ideal and dream wh ich we sometimes s ee but which doesnt wo rk out consistently in organizati ons and we feel that by processing an or ganiz ational st aff members efficiency and ability to get his jo b done will be imp roved and weve of ten dreamed of that and we very very often see it lay an egg and we audit the guy and he doesnt you know he feels better hes happier and he s till turns out pr oduct that s an overt act so ther is in the works right this minute and is in test on flag relatively simple techno logy which puts th at dream well within your poss ession at fairly low level of auditor traini ng and now when you re working in the field and when you re working in orgs you dont neces sarily well actu ally its p robably completely impossible to read all of the m aterial that comes thr ough your lines or to keep jenned in on what is going on you actu ally have the public bangin g on your front door and you have all of the gener ated noise of the disor ganized unrecruited under manned misfi led or ganization in you r vicin ity and you have all kind s of demand s com ing in one day somebody cou nted these nd said there were twenty nine command channels into single or g you we re talking or ders and or g was taking rders f rom twenty nine sep arate sour ces and that woul d be enou gh to that alone would give you enough noise to distract you r attention from the fact that somethin g is go ing on other than th atfight and ther been plenty thats been going on febctapes 4 011004 now you come here to flag and you find that in the sunny calm atmospher of now here much this noise d rops out of your ears and of f of your eyeb alls and you have chance to draw long breath and put your attention on what is go ing on so youre actually jumping considerable gap and so on theres considerable gap youve seen som of this information wh ich you re getting here come through your lines the opp ortun ity to see it assembled and coor dinated s been practically zero to see it in action and see how it all fits together is quite another thing now your here at time when and this wil l alway s be true whe re organization is being improved and rganization comm and channels at this moment are just now g oing out into very smoother much smoothe r state f organization for instance just now ive just pulled out of my traffic here dispatch f rom the d ata bu reau angeles and they head of the data bur eau said w are now able to provide you any info rmation you care to have on any us org wow see now that isnt just in formatio n thats evaluations of information thats condensed pack s they re in busines s now to be able to give us extreme conditi on packs on anythin g well thats thats ter rific advanc the office rs of some f the ar eas of these liaison offices have just now left three of them lef t this mor ning and the rg boar d of the bur eaus just w been hung up so your here at very oppo rtune time this is the time this is being exported now the patter n on which were operating is something that you should have some in formation on and this p atter n itself is f imp ortance and it will serve you in your stead ther is an f so called expand and cont rol and that gives the sequence of expan sion and that is wel l put flagship here and the flagship puts flag org here and the flag org puts control points in continental areas and those cont rol points in continental ar eas put orgs the re and the or gs put public there i want you to look at this as sequence of action and per hapsitll give you some idea of whats behind some of the things you see going on now as far as you in your futur positi on you will be putting there what ther is wher you are and from that fir m positi on will be putti ng the re an xtended posit ion now that even applies to divisio ns you put the re s table ter minal from which you can expand by puttin g in stable ter minals to expand to now this then m akes s equence of stable terminals now your looking at it here on flag on planet wide basi s in an ar ea you look at it on an area ba sis in an org you l ook at it at divisio nal ba sis and it all works the sa way you will only get tr ouble from those ar eas whe re you have not taken those steps and if you re gettin g trouble from any ar ea then you have t taken those step s so you go back and you set up an office and then fr om that you set up an hco and from that you set up this div ision that divisio n the other div ision and all the time you re doing this of course you have to cope with anything that is goin g on its about fifty percent organize and fif ty percent handle what s going alright now lets say som ething goes w rong lets s ay something goes wrong and you just don t seem to ever be able to get in the publ ic div isions and the ne xt thing you know youre out on the str eet handing out cards an org boar d not only reads from left to right an org boar d slides fr om lef t to right and you can slide down that or g board faster than scat febctapes 5 011004 we hav standin g joke on ships of trying to figure out while singlehandedly conn ing the s hip how to also stir the cr ews soup now that is matter of just slidi ng do wn org boar ds now the s equence is one that is of ten missed and the r eason why it gets sed is an individual has his attention way over the re and he seldom puts his attention right here now weve all seen the housewi fe who has gr eat deal to say about thei r neighb ors and then one day we open the closet d oor and st years diapers and everything else falls out on the floorwe dont even dar open the f ront door of such house now it is one of the thin gs th at we do on flag consistently and tinuo usly is r eassert the idea if we c ant make it go right he re we have right what soever telling anybody else elsewher to ma ke it go right and that s good maxim anywher you perate so one day you find yourself sliding down the or g boar d by all means handle the situatio n but always put in two other steps is you r house in good order ar your lines straight d oes your in ba sket contain st ale dates are you r lines running smoot hly if you straighten that out why you wi ll also be able to organize then the area which you re having so much trouble handlin g so cope there is always cope and the other steps are put you r own immediate ar ea str aight and rganize and put there the ar ea you re having trouble wit h they re cop ing you re cop ing in your own area that will conti nue theres alw ays little bit of copecampbells ivory soap ninety nine and fortyfour one hund redths per cent pure i dont think wed ever get so organized that we wouldn t have that remaini ng pe rcent impu re it woul d still be cope because ther in any xpansion this trick alway s occu rs its horrible thing you think youve got it all or ganized and then becau you ve got it organized expands and any expansion will find every wea k spot youve got and ther will be blow up at every one of those wea k spots and you could actually go in some kind of wild cycle lik this if you werent completely organized and if you didnt know instinctively exactly what to do about any given situation youre doing alright now youve actually got your cashbills rati so it is in some kind of st ate ou know what it is and you re actu ally gettin g in som traffic the or g seems to be viable and then suddenly you get mo re traffic and the mor traffic catches you without an xpansion potential you didnt have anybody in training to take ove r some of those xtra s pots you didnt have any backlog of audito rsthat you could call on you lately the cademy snt been gradu ating many people there arent many audit ors to grab ont body has been trained in ca supervision to take over that cou rse and it goes bl lbllblbl now if your on the b all if you re on the ball you wi ll able to organize it sufficiently so that it doesnt go backwar ds but the cycle thats liable to happen is the addit ional traffic and additi onal busines s hits you all the spots ar ound the or ganizati on that ar slac k or sour or could go sour that were just bar ely functi oning blow up and you retract ou don t expand you contract so you try to expand ag ain and ther mo re traff ic and it blows up the r emainin g spots and now you really contract and you dont do job of expan sion you do job of starting to expand cont racting starting to expand contracting and i f you do that actually you go downhi ll because people get red and they wear out febctapes 6 011004 so what you do is you have to be sufficiently on the b all that every time such ar eas blow up and they wi ll blow up you re right on the b all and you know exactly what youve got to do at this particu lar st age of the game and you beat that ar ea up so th at it copes and organize s quickly to take up the slac k and you hold that xpansion and the ne xt time the res little bit more expansion and things st art to blow up you re suffic iently on the ball so that you cope with it get it organized and itl l hold and that is the cycle actually which an feb c student should realize hes bein g trained to do hes not being trained to be good student hes trained to be somebody who is on the b all so that at any given instant why he can cope and get rganization steps in to it fast theres two horrible errors that you can ma ke one is to do nothin g but organize and you can go on doing thing but rganize you know the art definit ion the def inition of art or communicati on it was accept able communication you see and youll get amongst artist perfect ionists and they never do release one of thei r pictu res the author never does pub lishone of his stories becau it isnt perfect yet now you can get that sa frame of mind in the field of organization and it is absolutely gruesome the or ganizati on isnt ready to go yet it isnt well enough organized they dont have enough auditors trained yet to really put out the public ity becau it isnt well enough organized thats wonderf ul way to die the first l angeles fou ndation not under my trol the first angeles fo undation at twenty six hundr ed south hoove r failed because the head of it who by the w ay was rear admiral and r etired from the navy closed it for ten days to find out if the legal organization was correct the re was threat there was nothing happening but it just wasnt well enough organized and they ccumulated an indebted ness from wh ich they never recove red their payr oll was too hig h they just shut the doo rs for ten day s we hav organizations in south africa whic h close thei r doors couple of weeks year r used to and went on holiday and all of that wa s great except if you just look over their stats you will find out that it takes them ages fter that to get the stats go ing again an organizations runnin g machine and when you hold it up it seems to get sand in its wheel s now its perfectly alright for peop to go on vac ations but what ar you doin g not being well enough organized that half the rganization cant go on the vac ation and the othe r half go on the ot her vac ation i mean why arent you organized that w ay see thats all po int in organizati on so organizati on is basic ally foresight and predict ion and putting in stable terminals that wi ll handle the flo ws now the re are better definit ions and mo re precise definit ions f organization but if you study from that poi nt of view you wi ll have lot of succe ss wh at belongs wher you wi ll be inter ested to know that lot of propag anda set in in the last few years concer ning policy policy tended to drop out of sight it tended to vanish it wasnt given adequ ate importance and just as happened in tech at saint hi lls peo ple began to say that isold po licy they i don t know maybe they were like audito rs that thought techno logy was simply process and you simply read the p rocess off the bulleti n and then somehow or other auditin g occur red but they didnt know why it occu rred and they had nothing to do actu ally febctapes 7 011004 with the ssion except to mouth thes magic phra ses the trut h of the matter is that the admin tech is thing not which you lear n by rote but which you get the theory bac kground of why is it l ets weigh and all of sudden somewher along the l ine in study of it your wits will suddenly congeal and you suddenly know how to play the piano it isnt that you ar being told how to play the piano by applying certain po licies your familiar ity wit h that line of count ry and your familiarity with that basic line of country at any given instant will go into play i dont know if you ever rode bicycle but ther somethin g funny about bicycles theres you cant ride bicyc you cant ride bicyc you cant ride bicycle boy theres more skinned kn ees nd bruised knuckle s and sister being impatient and all that and then all of sudden you can ride bicyc w ell thats what you re trying to do thats what youre trying to do and you w ont ride this bicycle if you have to say to yourself its good thing to know wher this mat erial is let tell you but if you have to say to yourself i think there was policy cover ed this situ ation and there was some regulation there and of course our mimeo but we hav ent had nybody in mimeo files for some time so we h avent got pack of policy and i wonder what it wa s by that time theres footprints all ove r you now what your really trying to do is get enough backgr ound know how so that you know how to put an organization there how to organize som ething how to square it around and you ll be able to know whether it s on po licy or off policy and so on and you know basically that if it doesnt work its pr obably ff policy or theres somebody got some kind f awild idea and it isnt m atter of memor izing fabulous quantity of material you have to know all the mat erial but it is matt er of being able to both know it and apply it but apply it in such way as you develop the instinct of it it has to be down to instinct level not lip readin g level i mean you re not t you know put your tongue in between your teeth try ing to well i wonder if ther wasnt somethin g that had something to do with this they em to have the some kind of trouble in the i wonder if there isnt something somewher in po licy that sa ys how you solve the ah hm and stats were dow n last wee k and oud be in bad show now you have be able to dish it out you have to be able to dish it out fast you have to be able to dish it out off the cuff you have to be able to whi p up an organizational structu re at the d rop of hat its very very inte resting that the flag bur eau rg board which is just being publ ished just now is the 19 66 compilati on seven divisio n org board now also dont get in frame of mind and if you ve it around banish it that runs l ike this this po licy letter is very vital it should be r eissued wh ats this reissue weve had one or two feb c students s how up and tell us that certain sixty five po licy letters should be reissued because they re still valid its very funny but the first run down of organizations that wa s ever written up in 19 50 oddly enough is still valid i was readin g it the other day i was quite am azed now so her s even div ision org boar d now the on ly thing the flag bureaus will do with that or g boar d is just lik it sa ys in policy letters its just like it says it says the productio n division can be any product ion so what s the productio n of the flag bureau production of the flag bu reau is dat action commun ication that is what it is doing the dat bureau of course br ings in its dat it makes its co llecti on dens ation of the data ev aluatio n of the data nd distribut ion of the d ata that is what it does and when thats done it goes to febctapes 8 011004the action bureau which does planning briefi ng and fi ring and then when its alr eady to go there it goes to the comm bur eau which is the xternal comm bu reau theres hco still handles its inter nal comm and inter nal transport and so on but this is external comm and external comm has the traffic outg oing has the missionai re outg oing has all of that outgo ing and everything thats incomin g and that s its production the end product of that is m anagement the ot her div isions all have to be ther just to back it up its an interesting l ittle clock if you l ook it over now you in an or g dont have anything to do wit h putti ng that togethe r particu larly but one of thes flag bureau or g boar ds bel ongs in the department of the lrh comm the whole org boar d belongs in ther if you have liaison ffice section in your org that is the org boar d he wil l be operating on wh ich is quite remark able that or g board was the summ ation of the xperimental org board all the other divisi ons was summ ation of the xperiment board of 1965 and when it was all whipped together and we ch anged everythin g mary sue actually wrote it up they actually l ost one f her divisions treasury division were having to rewrite it at this particu lar time fortunately somebody copied it with variations and its preserved so sh can put it back but weve s till got this org board now that org boar d was running at the heyday of saint hill when it had very very high stats when they st arted moving off of this or g boar d and it started getting lost and peo ple started talking about policy getting old and oh this techniq ue ca out last year we dont use that nymo re yes her all f you r material but we don t use it w that was what got going yes well thats ld the only reason you re studying the saint hill cou rse is for histo rical information its true true im givin g you actual quotes im not even exaggerating the tech wa s driven out and that wa s basically why thi ngs went dow n hill they lost the tech but why run any sh ame blame and r egret on it the truth of the matter was th at wegot it back now wer getting some p rotests bout so many ch anges yeah we re going to change it i dont really see how this is s uch remark able change to get back everything we all had doesnt see m to to be reasonable the other day with on ly coup or three paragraphs changed i reissued po wer p rocessing as it was originally do ne and written and it wa s received wi th va st acclaim as brand new development so all of sudden here we see the 66 org board the sev division org boar d we look ed everywhe re did anything we can we have had some of the wil dest org boards he re on bureau rg boar ds you ever saw in you r life nobody could ma ke head nor tail out f them and they didnt dove tail and f inally why i was able to push int place the old seven division org boar d and it f itted and that works and thats going in right this minute so you see the material you re studyin g is not of historical inter est its the very thing which you need t that desperate moment when you suddenly find out that you have hund red and twenty nine pc backlog which has car efully been hidden from you f or the st two months and this arise s becau the public divisio ns ar doin g nothing and fi nally in desperation you ask somebody in the public divisions why ar ent you carrying out your routine functi ons and they sa well it doesnt do any good to promote don t you see febctapes 9 011004 becau we just more pcs in and they cant be audited so we don t have to work her for some time weve d one our work now you all of sudden have problem ouve g ot three auditors its dwindled down somehow and nobody noticed ouve g ot three auditors and tech sec and ther are two peop in qual and you all of sudden have to deliver seven hund red and ninety five hours of processing tomor row how do you do this thats the type f problem that wil l all of sudden hit you in the teeth its actually in the fie ld and ar ea of rather interesting discoveriesdiscoveries lik ther hasnt been an inter nal comm run for the last three day s and we can pr obably teach you not to issue n order like get in internal comm start delive ring inter nal comm thats just your cope order its just cor rection of an er ror an omission or an out point thats just cope order your organizational action is enti rely different how come we didnt have ny inte rnal comm for three days now if you do nt have the xpertise you get int heavy ethics when hco isnt on the ball and the peop in hco don t know what theyr doing they inevitably will make the product of hco ethics and that s been go ing on w for about two or three ye ars and this year i called halt in other words it s easier to hit than to hat its much simpler to hit than to hat commev him you know shoot him fire him see its much easier its much easier to do that than to investigate much ea sier to do that than to draw up the check sh eets and put the hat on somebody do you fo llow so you get the thing of an irreduci ble min imum the principle of the ir reducib minimum it hasnt been wr itten up yet youll see this ar ound there will be talk about it around here the pr inciple of the ir reducib minimum of post post tends to r educe to only its visible points l ets ta ke lets ta ke steward now not worry about an organization foun d that r estimulates you i wouldnt want to do that and we tak the stewar d and now the stew ard has the j ob of doing bow wow and bow wow and bowwo w and they re supposed to have the wow wowf and that the linen is supposed to wowwo wf and theyr supposed to know whe re to get that and theres supposed to be certain check s heets nd so they do and ther are cert ain reports which they fill in and so f orth and there are many p reparatory actions necessary to being stew ard it isnt just the cups and saucers and so fo rth or somethin g like that appe ar on the table you all of sudden wi ll get cavein in this ar ea and you wont quite be able to figure out why and the r eason you cant quite figure out why is the visibility is still thereyouve go t cups and sa ucers sitting on the table the jo b has dropped to its ir reducib minimum below whic h it will be not iced and you ll get this tendency its rather consistent tendency its horrible tendency so hco is liable to drop to the ir reduc ible minimum at inter nal comm someb ody would notice that do you what the princ iple is in other words all of the hid den or not too visib actions r which is to say the pr eparato ry actions that makes go od produc t tend to drop away fr om post and tend to drop away from an org and you are wind up with the irreduci ble min imum and that is mer ely the visible now this r everse s when you try to get the thing runnin g all the things that ar out are invisible so i assure you you really have to know your busines s becau the visibilities ar still there ther are people at their des ks mail does get pened and distributed febctapes 10 011004 now if you r eally dont know you r busines s and know what all these little p oints ar and how you have to prepare an ction befo re it becomes pr oducti on and so fo rth this or g could comp letely baffle you ther cant be anything w rong with it all its in flinders and in shambles its stats are going out the bottom but people are at their desks and everything you seem to look at s eems to be the re alright dont open file drawer so what youve got is reduction to the ir reducib minimum it just c ant be reduced any further otherwise it woul d be ticed and you ll find out this is tendency so th at sort of thing is its not the willfulnes s of peop its actually the lack of full hat its lac k of peo ple being jenned in and trained in they d ont quite know what the job is so they just pick up the visibi lity you know they brin g the mail into the or g but they dont log it and then you madly are trying to fin d the missing money that c ame in from mrs shultz and wher the mail log and somebody looks at you and sa ys huh or som ebody l ooks t you brightly and saysoh yes well here it is and every day theres one entry and it says mail received now its out of these things that disa ster is m ade franchise s can m ake great deal f money but they do not make great of viability they do not stand up over long perio d of time one of the r easons they m ake great deal of money is becau thei r prices are very often much highe r than or g prices and theres lot of other thin gs with this way and you say now look her all this money remember ther viabil ity goes along with it to run an or g you have to run it at higher volume and you have to run it at very high vo lume and you have to run it at very xcellent product and if your product is excellent and your volume is high you will be in clover just pock eting all of the ot in the wo rld with all the quarters and so fo rth but it has to be high volume and when you get into high volume you get into sophisticati on of organiz ation the r ecept ionist cant sit there and keep it all in her head so ther efore we ar going in to the higher level of sophisticati on of how you run an or g and it can expand and an or g can expand on up the line and if you follow the pr inciples of organization it can stand on up the l ine that wou ld make standar d oil look l ike filling station and if you don t know the princ iples of organizatio n it just wont expand so it doesnt get up to the point wher it can pay its st aff members enou gh d oesnt get up to point wher it can afford the things nece ssary to do nevertheles s even as they exist at this moment they are very viable w hav ent lost any or gs except those which we ourselves cl osed out fantastic quite r ecord actually now been lot of hard work the res been lot of tears ther been lot of sweat has gone int keeping things running now theres way to run these things which makes them much more remunative which makes it much ea sier and so forth and now is the time now i might as well tell you why it is that we are suddenly launching it isnt just thetechnical breakthroughs im putt ing together organizational material and ma king some breakthr oughs partially in self defen partially gettin g stuff together and so fo rth so that we can ach an feb c there have been many s eriess of things r eleased here ther the personnel series the or g serie s part of its the p r series the or ganiz ing series these things ar quite vital in formatio n and it isnt because theyr newe st and best people around her very often are saying but you wrote all this in 1958 i say yeah i know i know i know but febctapes 11 011004 its put together in cohesive pack age and ther had been her and there an impr ovement in the commun ication of it and the imp rovement in organizati on is the commun ication of it now if im wr iting now and you get big cogn ition on the fact that the that its putt ing an or g boar d together is matter of products its pr oduct its product and product and pr oduct and so forth look at the 6 6 org board and you ll find out that its items ar all expressed s products but it had t been st ated learning how to commun icate somethin g to somebody else is very often bit of breakthrough in itself so you ll find some of this mat erial has never been communicated but is inhe rent in the pol icy whic h you are already to some degree familiar with i dont wish to get you clouded up on this it isnt that the materials ar not valu able which are being released but they ar an extension of the m aterials which already xist and are bein g gotten together and ar being used so that they wil l commun icate i discove red about eight r nine months ago that ther were certain chaps ar ound who just cou ldnt seem to get the idea of what an organization was or what or ganiz ing was or what did organiz ing consi st of do you follow and i just found out that i just wa s not gettin g that across di dnt find it out in an or g i found it ou t in an engine room and so i just st arted tentatively trying to improve the communicati on of what an or ganizatio n was and then found ou t that i was inconflict with think i found out there was n ident ificati on between suggestion an order and comment and these wer all the sa that b road p olicy that covered all situations w as exactly the sa as some ca sual comment difference and i final ly figured out that well we had better find something about logic and about apr il i rolled up my sleeve s and tackled this subject as subject and theyve wr itten an awful lot about logic its for midable subject i f you want just an xercise in headache s open the encycl opedia b ritannica and r ead what it says about logic just the encyclo pedia br itannica i mean condensed version man didnt know what l ogic was he had idea what log ic was he had some for mulas for logic each one of which coul d be th rown aside by the disar rangement of data ah well if the whole subject of logic could be thr own aside by dat what was he do ing studying formulas when he s hould be just studying what is data and that m ade br eakthr ough and that pushed us ahe ad qu ite bit so that was comp lete development all by itself youll find in an organization that your trouble is as simple as you have peop who cannot distinguish an or der from comment policy from suggestion these ar equals equals don t you see w ell ho w do you pry this apart ctually we have the technol ogy by which it is pried apart its relatively simple techno logy fortunately and we hav ent published final text on this yet actually its sitting here on my des k becaus it was advertised before it wa s complete and i hadnt r ealized anybody had offered it for sale that s somebo dy really puttin g the crush on you i havent finished this subject up and they sa its all for sale yeah gr eat oh boy so the subject of logic has gr eat deal to do with the subject of commun icating data and you f ind ou t it makes wild when you all of sudden f ind out that theyr putting all the typewriters on the f loor and so f orth and then you find out that somebody simply ca suallyremark ed that if they wanted to clean the sk tops why they cou ld put the typewrite rs febctapes 12 011004 on the fl oor see sugge stion the guy says w never can mop these sks you see and so forth well why dont you put the typewr iters on the fl oor and so on you come back in and all the typewriters are on the floor and theyve been on the floor for about day or two and som ebody sa ys what s your letter st at and its gone and why is it well we cant type lying down here on the fl oor and you sa who issued s uch silly damned or der as this and they s ay ou did youll just be very inte rested that the commun ication factor between an xecutive and staff can be so balled up that you wi ll not suspect why you are working you rself to death its marvelous you think im kiddin g i have found such orders kicking ar ound this ship as the commo dore said that the fathometer had to be lef t on all the time which traced bac k extracted f rom casual r emark dur ing watch on soundings that is to say whe re the fathometer would read wher the wat er was shallow from you ought to leave it on it was taking fellow fifteen or twenty minutes to get this thing tuned in if we w anted sounding and it well you ought to leave it on they omitted the time span out of that the time sp an wasnt understo od and so ther we had fathometer anyhow this kind f thing is is kind of wei rd but youl l be absolutely dism ayed how ften this occu rs and how this sort of thing is responsible for some of the flu bs which you the communication is out it isnt that you havent said it but it has been understo od in an entirely diffe rent conte xt than you thought it was and this c an be so baffl ing that it absolutely ruins your temper now if you r eally know you r busines s and know what this is all about it is true that you sometime s have to blast thi ngs thr ough but if you know what this is all about you will recognize that communication and r elay f information may very well be the factor whic h ismissing and whic h has caus ed an upset in some ar ea and you ll be looking for some culpri t and if hco is not really on the ball itll be wi lling to hat only when it is hit and you can get yourself all stirred up about ho w bad it is and how bad these people are and that sort of thing when as matter f fact ther just simply communication breakdown now admin istrative s kill is what i hope to talk to you about bit befor we befor you go back its just this ba sis of administrative sk ill its not subject which im willing to write up forever and nigh you will see this everywher in you r studies of administrative techno logy but its special skill admin istration its actu ally contains the est ablishment of the commun ication lines and the fl ow lines and the inf ormation lines and so on so that you can get team operation and unles s you know that you have to have commun ication line on which to relay inf ormation why the info rmation wont be relayed and therefore you ll get team br eakdown and an or ganizatio n which does not have g ood administrative gu idance c an often look very suppr essive there are two points in the or ganization which are of equal rank and each one f them has an enti rely different idea of how something should be d one and nothing is going to flow between th ose two po ints simp thing like memberships ou just never can mail membership and you can curse and damn nd swear and issue or ders and stamp up and down and sa mail those memberships and it still doesnt happen and eventually theres sudden surge and br eakdown and you fin d out that five thous and membership cards have just febctapes 13 011004 been mailed blan k and you say what silly fool see and that actually you re fight ing with phantoms these ar all phantoms you had two p oints of equal rank nd they were not in commun ication and they di dnt have s enior who was enough on the ball to see th at the commun icationline flowed between those two p oints and that those two points wer inadequate agreement so that membership is sa ying that it has to have an invo ice before it will make out member ship car d qu ite rig htly its alway s marvelous when you l ook into these things to find out how right each post wa s and youl l find ou t that ca shier is saying he s to have an actual file to know who is renewin g their memberships nd who isnt and that he cannot take this money and write an inv oice on these things unless m embership will furnish him with this or that or the other thing you im just making one up alth ough i ran int one like this it was actually simple r than this and they just cant get into agreement with each other on how they ma ke out one and both f them can be put in such bo x as he feels his head wil l be cut off if he does anything about it at all now this is wh at is known as bugged order or bugged project now if you don t understand that communicati on has great to do with it lot of your projects and rders and ctions wil l get bugged you have to know how to talk to people and you have to know ho w to ask them stions and sometimes this can be very very dism aying in washingt on one time it took two weeks to find out why nob ody could go from the registrar to testing i nob ody could go i mean that w as it i used to say d you send peop from the registrar to testing i was gettin g so int that frame of voice you see do you send people from the r egistrars sk to testing oh yes yes yes thats go od oh god up to testing do you do you r eceive people up her yes oh yes r egistrar send s them up do you test oh yes ye s yes and get the results out instantly fine why in the name of god wont this line work why wont it work why wont it work few wee ks later when id completely given up on it somebody asked fo r rul ing on something they sa id it wasnt righ t to leav this money under the blotter on the registrarsdesk in an unlock ed of fice and i said w ell what do you mean it isnt right it ll only be the re for few minutes oh its often her for couple of week s and at that moment the penny d ropped they only tested on monda so if somebody came int the org on monday fternoon they could not be pr ocessed unti l the following monday pardon couldnt be sted til the fol lowing monday even i f an auditor was available the miscommun ication was to testing and that is they wer supposed to have just little two minute test ctually meter check sort of thin g that was all they we re supposed to do and that had never been communicated to the sting post so they just test ed everybo dy on monday mor ning and natural ly it didnt matter how many pcs cam up from the registrar they still had to wait til mond ay mo rning so som ebody had d ropped the time factor out and it made psychotic situation but theres miscommunication guy di dnt know what his job was guy in testing didnt have hat th at was complete now he was doin g what he tho ught was right and believe it was costing the or g fortune and it wa s breaking tempers and ar c breaking pcs all ove r the place and we just couldn t find whe re this line is alright so communicati on you can tal k all you want to about technical know how on admin communication is still part of it is the h at complete is it real you have to realize febctapes 14 011004 that somebody isnt just def ying you if somethin g isnt happening that its bugged and you have to be able to understand that it may be the communication which is bugged and you have to clear this up r you have to have somebody in personal enhancem ent who can clear it up this post isnt runnin g right what doesnt the guy underst and about it wh at is the condit ion of this post othe r things of this character now your actu ally working with communicating entity and that commun icating entity makes am and if it isnt communicating and if you are not commun icating to itand it isnt getting the dat why it wont operate as team simple as that it isnt ho w go od their morale is its just that theyr not in commun ication with one another so you see recent innovation of such thing as flag bur eau data letter it has command value particu larly it is sent around for information but it can give you the pr ogram of an area it can give you the ev aluati on it can give you whats h appeni ng in keokuk and why joe blow was removed and why somebo dy else wa s appointed its just n information bit now you sa well you can clutter the place up with information bits to such degree that nob ody will read them because youve got jam med commun ication line that isnt necessarily true an inf ormed g roup will operate s team group which has communicati on lines will operate as team and you r agreement between p osts is essential and these ar some of the s kills f an administrator how does he get those lines flowing how does he get these guys int communicati on now you see this gr eat wide wo rld out here of super industrial ism nd you say well how is it operatin g i ll let you in on something it isnt money is inflating inflating inflating inflating now what is b ack of money in flation partially political but the other part of it is is those c ats p roduce those or nate f ronts and those beautifu l swank of fices and those hot and cold runni ng vice presidents at s uch enormous xpens in comparison to their productio n that they ar not viable and you re looking at whole civ ilizati on that isnt viable look at what you r dollar bought last year l ook what it buys this ye ar its going right up in smoke well that is bec ause pr oducti on is t being done efficiently that w ould be the fi rst thing that you would say about it actually it come s its so gr oss that it isnt its being politically interfered with and every other thing that you cou ld think of is in the road of proper smooth runnin g activity and the w orld is actu ally carried on the back s of few desperat men and po orly administered ar ea is car ried on the backs of its po or desperate xecutive snow if you r eally know you r busines s you can debug it get it to flow get it to expand if you really know your busine ss you will get absolutely fantastic amounts of coope ration from your staff it is very very inte resting i have s een somebody who knew division whose personali ty you d say was quite po or whose this was b ad and whose that was b ad and whose char m and whose this and that wasnt all that go od and ive seen him ta ke over division from som ebody who was an ab solute char mer hale fell ow well met and so on and seen the whole divisio n brighten up become very enthu siastic and on the ball and pr oducti on go up th rough the r oof the dif ference was know how the guy who knows is r espected and the guy who doesnt know can use all the p r in the wor ld and hell still fall on his face so with that i have given you as much s you can as similate at this particu lar moment with the who cou rse staring som of you in the teeth oull find out that you have febctapes 15 011004 some new study techno logy which is being handed to you some of you are really goin g to be put over the jumps on this s ubject not because you are bad student not becau you dont know your business but so that we can speed up the ability with whic h you can assimilate information and the ability to assimilate information is one of the finest skills an xecutive has now the enemy is just about r eady to give up the gh ost he s given up several ghosts lately very spectacularly they have risen in the air enemy press and that sort f thin g is gettin g desperat and so on were getting ready fo r the big push so we think it is time we grooved in the he ads of organizati on and its pr inciple executives so that they can put an organization there thatll really run and we think it is time that we p repared for the kick off becau that kick off time is now thank you than k you ok back to the old salt mines febctapes 16 011004pr be comes subje ct 7101 c18 s feb c02 18 january 1971 how are you fine thank you well some of you ar alive now what happens her this is the eighteenth of january ad 21 what happens her very often used to happen at saint hill occa sionally is the developmental line wo uld exceed the write up line and that essentially is what h as happened her and i found it best to give you very rapid rund own of the one of the veral developments which have been made in the field of administration the area of administration is comparable to auditing on the thir d dynamic and wher an auditor has one pc an administrator has whole bunch f them and he udits on st andar d procedu res and he audits t very rapid rate now if you can per ceive admin istration in this l ight as having gr eat many pr ocedur but all of them very st andar d you all of sudden get new look in the field of pr for instance the main tr ouble is that one us standar d pr its practically one the re is textbook on the s ubject one of the reasons why the xtbook is not comp letely applied is the discip line is poor in this field becau the subject itself didnt have ny great use w ell well touch on that this evening but i just w anted to give it to you as an example so that her is field the re are certain standard procedur now hardly anybo dy but sciento logist woul d know what you wer talking about i f you said standar d proced ure says oh yeah well yeah blaoah t extbook yeah you read that in schoo l and then then you go out and you do something you know xtbook snt anything to do with it that s the truth and one of the di fficulties the wo rld is in ri ght this minute is theyve th rown away the textbook of economics and ther coup of hungarians not that theres anything wrong with hungarians but its gr eat odd ity that coup of hungarians have been for the lastdecade or two wander ing around from gover nment to gover nment being employed by pr ime ministers and they give him who bunch of squirrel econom ic techno logy and the count ry goes b roke its qui s ystem and im not joking actually this s been go ing on the st place they stopped was england little earlier than that ther was fellow name of lord keans and l ord keans he had some he wa s part of the oxfo rd movem ent i think and he w as part of the fabian g roup and they had pecul iar xual ideas nd so fort h they were very strange people and lord keans took the xtbook on econom ics and wrote it backw ards or upside down crossed it with the manufactur er of fire crac kers nd the burial of dead rats and began to teach this very broadly so th at in the early thirties we begin to find keansi an econ omics being practiced very hard and fast nd furiously and by the pr ofessors only at harvar d and from harvar d it swung ou t into the r emain ing american universities and went out int other unive rsities in the w orld completely untried ivory tower p rofessorial appr oach to the field of econ omics febc03 pr becomes subject 2 18171 febctapes 18 011004 the central theme of which is c reate want so that if you create w ant econ omics all solves itself only he fo rgets that he is simply squir relling on the law of supply and demand doesnt state that forgets anything having anything to do with inflati on and deflati on and now we as group actually are conf ronted by an calating inflation and this inflation subject is very nasty subject to have much to do with inflation is pr edicted th rough the sev enties at the rate of about eight percent per annum for the us do llar well that s just nothe r method of plac ating the public because its been escalating rising much mo re rapidly than that in the st few years trouble with in flation if anybody l ooked at the ba sic textbook on the subject is it goes in an upwar d swingi ng curve and the curve gets s teeper and steeper and st eeper until it gets vertical and at that poin t thats it you bury your money now its happened with several coun tries r ecent ly and these countr ies have bitten the dust and they have not been the sa count ry afterwar ds they wer in diffe rent hands so if the pr imary financial income of ou r movement is from the united state s and som ebody is tampering with the united states dollar on the b asis of squir rel textbook peop have s uddenly woke up to it i mean it took them l ong enough 1930 forward you know p eople suddenly woke up to the fact that they re dealing with squirrel economics theres beginnin g to be fairly good hew and cry on the s ubject actu ally theyve traced it back to harvar d and it sort of theres book just been released on the subject exposing it all actually i collided with it few years ago and won dered wher all this ca from found the rest of the worl d didnt know wher it all came fr om and di d some trac king dow n on it myself somebody who was suppr essive decided to ru in lot of economics and theyve succeeded in d oing so and this gives us pr oblem now how does this come in to what i m go ing to talk to you about tonight w ell it comes int this becau im pr esenting you theres an ctual problem money wi ll be worth less and less but probably under the weir d duresses of the thing there will be ss of it worth less and less and be s of it now therefore movement which is expanding requires certain things it is expanding into we ar actu ally expanding into world which is to be make an understatement of the age bit mad and we have to exist wit hin the economic framewo rk of the society if we dont exist in the economic framework of the society well have had it for instance it might amaze you but that smirs h the world federati on of ment health the n ational as sociati on of ment health network is having an awful time w decided some time ago to cut off their supply and we ar doing so they nevertheless h ave all the g overnment appr opriation there is in the field of ment health they are dependent on lyon the bayonets of the gover nment really and to the degree that they re supported by gove rnments that ma kes very weak movement ma kes very weak movement the wheel turns the pol itical wheel turns the po litical fa shions fade bec ause they re not deliver ing anything which brings u s closer to our subject tonight their product is death now anybo dy can pr oduce that without going to university f or twelve years i can see amathea hoo d right w requiring her certificate that he has studied for twelve year s now this is not into an unsavory line they ar badly rganized they appe ar to be fairly well febc03 pr becomes subject 3 18171 febctapes 19 011004 organized but theyr not theyr badly organized theyr badly financed group such as our own going into world which is not too orderly succeed s to the degree that it is eff icient that it has work able useful technol ogy and to the deg ree that it stay s alert and handles the situations as they ari those thr ee conditi ons ar neces sary to forward movem ent and an expan sion so it has been my ba sic work her in 1970 to bring forward enough administrative in formation and enough administrative techno logy to br ing the field of administration into par wi th auditin g whic h as you know is ter ribly precise now that s been accompl ished in the theo retical and in the practical aspect s both now the refore the febc and the material which is being taught at this time leads up to these breakthroughs in the field of administratio n you ar not dealing now with somebody s idea of how the thing should be you ar dealing with some natural ba sic laws it isnt because i have an idea th at if you say do you have n arc break ar cu cdei is ther an arlier similar arcu cdei fn it isnt becau i say this wo rks or that this is true or that the mind should operate this w ay that is not that it is basic discovery it incorp orates m any parts but these things assembled come into flying rud now theres theory merging into practical applicati on with which you are allfamiliar now this c an be gor geously abu sed this is fo r pc wh has an emoti onal upset so if the pc is sitting there with high ta we sa do you have an ar c break suse of the tool so the auditor struggles ar ound and not hing much happen s and sometimes he ctually makes it and gets the t down by some othe r means which is disguised inside this subject but the truth of the m atter is is af ter hes done this with this pc few times and so on youl l find the pc is now arc broken about arc breaks the techno logy is suffic iently good to obtain recovery from that to but this is st andar d techno logy now what is this basically the situ ation is that ther is situatio n that is the first thing one has to be able to recognize that ther is situation now to know theres situatio n one must have fa miliarity with an ideal scene and with the xisting scene and he f inds the existing scene is dif ferent from the ideal scene so he knows he s situation now the situ ation can be analyzed by ta king the data r elated to the situation and narrowing it down and then we fi nd what cau sed the situ ation which we call why and having found that we can remedy it and the pc r ecovers fr om the arc break oh you thought i was talking about administration didnt you now if you put these two things then frame f reference you fin d out that we w have in ou r hands superi or admin istrative technol ogy still in develo pment stage as all progressive or dynamic technolo gies ar progressive and dynamic techno logies actually do not cease to develop they continu ously r efine that s taggers somebody if he doesnt r ealize that what is being refined is the p rogress being made by the basic law not the change of the basic law they think the law of gravity keeps changing becau somebody eventu ally develops method to ma ke anti gravity dont you see the law of gravity has not changed when you have isolated the ba sic laws you get continu ous refinement some peopleare idiotic enough to call mixing bunch f chemicals in test tube and getting soup instead of dupe basic discovery it isnt what it is is simply devel opment from basic discover ies febc03 pr becomes subject 4 18171 febctapes 20 011004 which are made ther probably has not been basic discovery made on the planet fo r the last twentyf ive ye ars except perhaps in our field this is p retty interesting all we get is developmental progress wher eby peo ple refine what they alr eady k new ther were several basic discover ies m ade in the early part f the century and the last of them probably was how you tickle the tigers tail and pluton ium to cease to exist at rapid ity and then how you man aged to make hydrogen dehyd rogize at v ast vio lence th ose took some basic and ori ginal discoveries which were not new at the time but the developmental line xposed them int practical applicati on so anyw ay there hasnt been any b asic discover ies to amount to anything nearly all these discoveries which you see ar ound they re not all these develo pment s which you see around the faster automob ile and so on is simply the r efinement of something so you can continue to expect r efinement f rom the b asic discover ies which have been put together here in the last ye ar and actually within the st twentyfive years in this field because its been under investigation now these laws which wer working with now ar not resident in just last ye ars work you will find them spatter ed all through the oec course these fundamentals now as these fundament als ar put together you approach something that appe ars to be st andar d procedu re standar d procedur is subject to refinement just as you get further wo rkability in the fiel d of publ ic relations itself we hav just s tarted the subject the subject actually did not exist xcept in somebody s imagination as an pplicable techno logy becau they did nt apply it the way they should have applied it and they di dnt know what it was for and theydidnt know its ba sic laws its very amu sing but public relations just began now every pr ofessor that teache s publ ic relations wo uld contest this madly oh it began back in the 1911 and i would say professor for the l ove of christ wi ll you please resear ch your subject it began in rome with political campaigns painted on the outside of the coliseum i dont happen to be kidding right now but as far as our written techn ology of publ ic relations is concer ned it goes bac k way bac k and as far as the writ ten technol ogy is concer ned it belongs in rome and it started out there as formal subject to get sen ators elected but theres been very dim fumb lings all the w ay along the l ine now what wou ld you do if you suddenly took this subject if you to ok this subject in so m any wads and all of sudden it had precise xact role that you couldnt get along with out what would happen all of sudden it wou ldnt be something that they hir ed six guys in this hund red million dollar firm to exploit and to mon key wit h and they sit in the bac k room and figure out how they can do this or that with this or that if any of these guy s use their standar d technolo gy theyd probably run run wel l but its very diffic ult to get these fell ows to use standar d techno logy becau they really do nt know their own xtbook too well there is textbook see but its some techno logies now what ar they for as r esult they h ave let an enti rely diffe rent part of the university walk off with about fifty per cent of their subject i can tel l you what public relations is fo r what is this subject for public relations is f or the h andling and contr ol of human emoti on and r eacti on ah weve g ot subject now yeah but look they g ave f ifty pe rcent of this away to the psychol ogist who fumbledum bled it all up and applied it to rats now theres something coming adrift so they split their subject febc03 pr becomes subject 5 18171 febctapes 21 011004 its third dynamic techn ology the psycho logist moved it all over onto another dyna miche tried to get it over onto the first dynamic and this that and the other thing so what is the central subject itself its the handling and trol of human emoti on and reacti on good well now you have to do qu ite bit with this subject immediately you have to do qu ite bit with this s ubject ah were away now oh this is what this s tuff is for good alright now what part s of what d you have to use in or der to do this well according to the publ ic relations techno logies youve go t one that runs something like this ou do survey and on the b asis of this survey you put together program and you use you r vari ous commun ication media word of mouth newspaper magazine s loud speakers and with this various communication media ba sed on this p rogram you alter human emoti on and r eacti on actually its such failure the way it s been done that in the publ ic relations xtbooks they sa people who say they ar mo lding publ ic op inion of course are just silly newsp apers think they mold public opinion you know in other words they re laughing at their own subject in that little line it says this subject has failed lets go back to science of survival and see how this thing works w do survey we put the xact arithmet ical number on each question of this survey in its response right lets as k this question do you lik dogs and the fell ow sa ys i hate dogs w put5 you got it science of survival put it down arithmetically you add up that question and its arithmetical values nd number f peop it was as ked you could do it as crude ly as then divided by the number f peop and you find exactly what tone sc ale point you are working with to contr ol tone sc ale point you move old law you move h alf tone to tone above it your campaign must then be half tone to tone above it instantly and immediately you have successful campaign which molds publ ic op inion which controls human emotion and reacti on so there we ar yeah but how do you get these stions i mean the question thatsit thats very simple theres noth ing much to this stion three questions one is the equivalent of be one is the equivalent of do one is the equivalent f have v ery good be do have thr ee questions above and below it why you could have coup of null questions youre tryin g to find out if somebody on the ssembly line l ikes automob iles hes bui lding them does he lik them well thats an ea sy one because its alr eady human emotion do you like autom obiles w ell lets find out if hes go ing to work on the assembly line lets make it little bit toughe r now wer going to find out are you going to work on the as sembly line alri ght we go around and ask the pub lic relations thing are you going to work on the ssembly line the guy sa ys and the ne xt guy says and so forth youre place so therefore you take the questions you want to know on the subject f be do have and you encode them int human emoti on using the ar c triangle we dont car whether you put or r or c after ea ch question your goin g to translate the basic question that you know into hum an emotion in order to ob tain invo lvement and you immediately have inv olvement so you get the true answer do nt you but the target of your subject is of course the control of human emoti on and r eacti on so if that is the ca then you would have to have involvement in human emotion and r eaction febc03 pr becomes subject 6 18171 febctapes 22 011004 so how do you put this question together l ets go right back to battery w this subject is the contr ol of human emot ion and reaction so ther efore the questions f you r survey have to be wh at you want to know transpor ted over into hum an emoti on and reacti on b do automo biles xist tran slate at once across for an is do you like automob iles now you wi ll get then an emoti onal r esponse which can be plo tted now why all this now you see im teaching you this backw ards im movi ng backnow the penny d rops the primary barrier to product ion is hum an emoti on and reacti on the primary bar rier to productio n all at once we know wher pr lives theres its use not in gettin g somebody to become man of extincti on by drinking seagram s whiskey to aid and assist adv ertising which wo uld be minor use but actu ally to sound out the publ ic to which the campaign is addr essed so as to handle the human emoti on and reacti on alright now ill trace it back thr ough the ba sic laws that we re invo lved with then is the pr imary bar rier to producti on is human emoti on and r eacti on public relations is the technolo gy of handling and cont rolling human emotions and reaction so you have to find out what is the human emoti on and reacti on so you get an encod ing of the question three questions one be one do one have ou translat those over int an emoti onal question by adding the ar c triangle you plot that now you get your human emoti ons in response to these questions you add them up you put your program together against the to ne sc ale one half to one band above you will have pretty uni formly succe ssful method of reach now are you willing to argue with that i all of sudden tell you that pr has suddenly become of age so the s ubject has been ar ound since r ome and it does have its own techno logies but the most ignorant people of its technolo gies ar some of the pr guys with whom ive work ed now ive been trained in this field and the oral tradit ion of the field does not contain great m any f the xtbook soluti ons the textbook techno logy is sing to very marked degr ee in much of what you call the ral traditi on when youre taught verbally by these fell ows they know what to do kind of but they find themselve s often adrif t i went bac k recently and read the xtbooks of this subject on its develo pment line mostly accumulatio ns of experient ial applicati on and i was struc k by the fact that very few peop use in this field of pr very few peo ple in this fiel d actu ally use standar d approachesthey re litt bit squir relly but ther is standard appr oach ah so now why do nt they use s tandar d appr oach well the subject wa snt oriented what is this subject for s the dumb fools go and hire psychol ogist they re the birds who control human emoti on and reacti on so they hir psycho logist i think this is m arvel ous right in their own technol ogies now these wer then insuffic iently exact s procedur to impress the practitione r they were insuff iciently exact insufficient ly precise so he thought he had some judgement involved but if you know dianetics and sciento logy and you move into this field you wi ll all of sudden find that they mour n the ab sence of science of the mind in their own field like how can you do anything with this s ubject unles s you have science of the mind that r emark is made in thei r textbooks you see types of remark s like this they mour n their lack of succe ss and ctually they don t even know ou r commun ication formula febc03 pr becomes subject 7 18171 febctapes 23 011004 our commun ication formula is vitally neces sary to the practice of this field vitally neces sary its as simple as cau distance effect if you ta ke just the short handed formula cause distance effect their publ ic relations ar commun ication media and they thi nk of themselve s as communicati on techn ology they d not have that of cause distance effect they dont have it streamlined do wn like that so when they s ay when you make survey they actually have sed if you go into some of their xtbooks theyve actually missed certain points that wer vital theres n fo right w which gives you the pr oper cycle and it does not agree with the xtbook cycle becau the textbook cycle has simply lef t out coup of step s that would have m ade somebody fail i neednt go into it any further than that its just the res the r eason why why one was tur ned out which was public relatio ns for m for submis sion fo r an okand it follows definite cycle of action wh ich is ba sed on actually the commun ication formula and so fo rth its high ly precise and that was bec ause they didnt have the commun ication formula so they couldnt write it up in their xtbook as to what you did exactly so they missed out coup of poin ts and then those two points f action would bring about failur one of the reasons why managers sometime s throw them out the fr ont door and wont have public relatio ns fir m anywher around is they very often popularize flap they don t presurvey somebo dy just gets killed in the plant newsp aper reporter calls up whats this i hear about somebody being killed in the plant bu d ou know in good english lik they use and the public relations m an gets on the phone and he s ays comment see or he says this or he sa ys th at or he says something else and he mishandles this and then he ssumes that ther is situation that the peop in the town are going to be very alarmed becau somebody has been killed in the plant by po isonous gas or something so publ ic relations at once gets out c ampaign saying how these poison ous ga ses are not very poisono us they didnt bother to survey was the re situ ation ou see what po int was missing so publ ic relations very often is inv olved in handling situations which dont exist and they very often find themselve s involved in bringi ng about situations which didn t exist lets t ake fellow who isnt good textbook in the field of public relations now he glanced at the xtbook on his w ay through clas s one day by accident now he goes out and hes work ed alongside of som guys who are old timers nd they know best and frequent change of auditors is one of the r easons why the fi rms they go to wo rk for fail by the w ay its actually just th at the company account your companys ccount is handed th rough so many ccount executives and the tur nover of account executives is so rapid that the service being rende red from that ccount is po or and this is traced as primary r eason why youshouldn t use an independent outside pub lic relations f irm frequent change of auditors goes back almost to an auditor s code d ont you so this guy he fumbles ar ound and he gets himself some kind of hes got job hes sort of trained experientially in practical as pects of it ma ybe he gets up as far as tr0 see but practical aspect s of it he puts into practice and these various practical as pects ar some litt rules that have sort of been made up and he manage s to go through wher eas matter of fact m atter of fact there was procedu re in the xtbook if he had studied it febc03 pr becomes subject 8 18171 febctapes 24 011004 which probably would have brought the situatio n off so he goes off half cocked on some kind of ca mpaign on somebody s hunch im just sur that these character s will like the wheaties with green tops instead of red tops get over in the field of market resear ch you see im just sur of that right now wer goin g to have you tear off you r mother inlaws head and s end it in and we wil l send you box top or something you see and he lay s god awful egg with this c ampaign the company puts out hundr ed and twentyth ree thousand seven hundr ed and ninetyf our dollars and sixtytwo cents nd they d ont get ny motherinlaws heads t all and then som ebody goes back nd he says say what d you know he said w did you know he gets tip some place or another you know ou should have asked people first you know yeah i gues s i shoulda as ked peop first actually they might not even get s close as for mal survey but they might get this close well alrigh t wel l call up the gallup company and af ter this when we talk about mother inlaws head s we will get s urvey made out in the public as to whether you lik this sort of thing or dont like that sort of thing and that cost s another two hund red and twenty five thousand dol lars and they get whole gallup poll survey d one and guys go aroundin the str eets nd shove microphones at people and knoc k on do ors and they get all written down and send letters to selected publics and oh they re very expensive anyhow then they find out this survey when it wa s all put to gether seemed to be very reliable but now they said to tear off the bottom of the bo x which is now purple and that they w ould the company would send the family their motherin laws he ad see and then this camp aign doesnt work either and somebo dy then gets v ast research project together and they fi nally fi nd out that peop on surveys don t tell the truth and now theyve got the bugb oo the bugaboo of survey is that peop say what they think somebody want s to hear and they sa oh yes i love whe aties wher eas matter of fact they smoke luckys you see and they find out that the l ie factor is so gr eat that they have to put lie question into the survey in order to and so on well im clow ning up s eries f examples he re but i think you comp rehend some f these xamples and this is wh at it finally amounts to this is what it finally amounts to that they didnt know what their subject was for exactly didnt know what their subject was f or so it is sort of being oddly used and its sort of off its own standar ds becau it isnt or iented so if they had the defi nition that there was human emoti on and r eacti on they wouldn t go around with questions that didn t elic it an emoti onal r esponse in the fi rst place they woul d have to know great m any refinements now im t ignorant on this subject i was actually trained by midwest rogers one time when i innocently walked in with my wide blue eye s open pu lled in as writer to the califo rnia centennial 1 849 1949 and they had to get hold of writer and they h ad to have somebody wh cou ld wr ite up the litt history books and so forth that they needed and so i said ok yeah i ll do that id been up in the mother l ode count ry i know all about that and i can look it up and youve got lot of books and wel l put them to gether andwell give you you r little manuals nd so forth so fine alright boys and so on and they said and i said wh ats the matter said well we have rule in the midwest r ogers that anybody who is working anywhe re in around centennials or things see theyr the outfit wild nam midwe st rogers it doesnt sa anything dont you see they want to refebc 03 pr become s subject 9 18171 febctapes 25 011004 main anonymous i think but they put on all of these big centennials like the squicentenn ial of texas and all f that sort of thi ng the big boom shows you see and they s ay ouve got to study the techno logy and so forth of how we w ork befo re you can work with us which is gr eat american fir ms have this down pretty pat t wo advertising agencies or an account executive in the advertising agency and his staff talking to the company advertisin g contact man put on about the wil dest show you ever wanted to see well one of them is educating the other one int what we d and then the ot her one will turn around and educate them into what we do and they get feel that they re good at this sort of thing theyve got lot of thes little gimmick s they do have techno logy see they d ont quite know whe re it fits lot of times so here they s ay to w ell yeah wh at do you think you re just writer and youve got to study what we do so you come to schoo l and the next thing you know im sitting there listening all about and doing the clay demos on exactly how you throw to gether exactly how you throw togethe r centennial now dont think ther isnt technolo gy in this field because midwest r ogers man walk s in with his little grip and hes got few litt things in ther hes got some tic kets and he s got some othe r little things with very litt money in his pock et and he walk s into this to wn and few months later they h ave the centennial its absolute creative magic if you ever saw one this is p romotional par xcellence he organizes the v arious contests he gets the busines smen the l ocal chamber ofcomme rce it all goes of f almost by checklist you do this you do that you do the other thing and then you do something r othe r and then etcetera and then when youve got that the beauty queen contest and so on and then the tickets ar sold in the stores and thats the votes for the beauty queen and you do the blablarwo f and the midwest rogers man he gets the hats nd whips what s this actually i wouldnt be able to tell you to much of the technolo gy becau its all super techno logical w could be crit icized on the same ground theyve got their speci names for everythi ng hats and whips thats the souvenir busines s so the guy who organizes the wh ole thi ng why the midwest r ogers man he r eserves to himself the hats nd whips conces sion so he sells out this h ats and whips concession and thats ho w he gets side payoff from all of this and they win d up with the doggo ndest biggest wildest centennial anybody ever hear d of so when i finished with their cou rse nd got all set wit h that and to ok my xamin ation and etcetera i was getting all ready to sit do wn to my typewri ter and write about the ar old days of 49 when black bart wa s preventing the digg ing of gold why they said say ho w would you lik sacram ento and i said wh at what ar you talking about well they said youre one of the be st agents we got here and so on youve got the highest grade s and wou

field now thats pub lic relations techn ology applied to promotion you wo uld apply that type of techno logy to cong ress or som ethin g of this sort then theres the other old daily grind techn ology

counter point effective but somewhat defiant so therefore its not very smoot h but this is dialectic material ism t use which is their mental technol ogy all ideas r esult f rom the col lision of two forces these sa it differently then they implant thet ans they use positivenegative now just s wer sitting here with the unde rcut f dialectic materialism we re sitting here with an unde rcut of propaganda now if you use the xisting standar d technolo gies of public relations and if you use the st andar d existing means and media and if you gave them just that little bit of refinement neces sary of an orientati on of the subject and what is this subject f or and you do it right straight do wn the g roove and then the peop who use it know what they re doing that is the important point you have an impingement on the society were being t reated to counter propagand campaign the like of which nobody ever heard of now som ehow or another weve got to move up to the fr ont with this and we do nt have the news media under ou r cont rol and so on were being treated to counter propaganda camp aign and have for long time th is isnt the p ress tal king this is the peo ple wh make the pr ess

longer be if certain things succeed you know hope and we find out that by our survey of the british departments and ministr ies that they think the publ ic is ter ribly well i actually had them surveyed to find out what they thou ght was b ad propaganda so i could give it to them and they an swered up and weve go t it all wri tten dow n in the bag if i ever wanted to machine gun them why the reit is becau their pr men woul d go mad and theyd just listen to what the p r man sa ys inside the line up what is public opinion public opinion are what is wr itten in the newspaper s and what your pr man s ays that s as near as politician ever comes to it gover nment is peculiar ly susceptib to clipp ing newspapers now lets go back her to this sov iet deal this soviet publ ished magazine perfectly legal they have som agreement with canada and so on this s oviet published mag azine is given the fant astic job of doing what most emb assies and so fo rth d in the field of overt intell igence they call it which is cl ipping mag azines and newsp apers they have to do all this covert to find out what is being said in the american pr ess nd in american technical journals and that sort of thi ng its nece ssary for the r ussian s to use their satellite st ates and to actually smuggle the stuff and so on and just to get what the new york t imes says it has to go back in diplomatic

edito r thats permitted to write som ethin g in canad oh so all the m aterial that goes into this is ta ken from intel ligence sources they hav fanta stic network then just to collect this m aterial and then this material s to go to moscow and s to be edited and put togethe r and the stuff written now then it has to be tur ned around and xported and all this rapidly enough for it to be timely in order to hit the pr esses of norther n neighbo rs published in canad now wer really getti ng do wn to pay dirt pr requires or ganization and it requires pretty hot organizati on and if you ever wanted to an organization have to function its pr organiz ation you really have to know administration left right and center to do pr ther are very few pr men who are ever trained in administratio n yet it s essentially an administrativesubject it is the failu re to keep their clipping book up to date that cau ses m any pr man to fail who rganize s all of the stuff that br ings this stuff in from covert ly to dip lomatic pouches to russia to get it spilled out to get it digested cli pped who k eeps the ffice running there who supplies it with enou gh personnel that c an speak the language and write it who organize s the route back into nort hern neighb ors and ta kes car of the pr to keep ca happy to having it publ ished its quite an or ganizational tour fo rce so that pr opagand of any kind r equires organization that is why by the way we knew xtremely well we knew very well that the ene my that we wer confronted wi th wa s not few random newspaper r eporte rs but it was extremely well organized becau the timing on it and so on and i made some inte resting discover ies on this becau arching for it in the field of organization i can tell you now just bout exactly what kind of an or ganizati on they have and about wher it sits and about what it does and so forth just by knowin g the rganizational requirements and they stink they stink they couldnt run kiddie car it was just failing to find them nd failing to estimate wh at they wer doing and why is what kept u s being hit by the thi ng and also they had they wer the re first and they had all the what they call the m ass media under total contr ol and under thei r thumb so of course they could say anything they pleas ed and we wer not in positio n to say anything we plea sed so how did we r everse all f this w ell w the res one lit tle sector of techno logy and ive been goin g along this ctor of techno logy showing you that you can make breakthr ough in particular field and give you some sort f an idea of it now pr come s into its own in the fie ld of product ion and the reason i am talking to you about p r is the pr imary bar rier to producti on is human emoti on and r eacti on and as you move forwar d you will find you re in collision with human emoti on and reacti on almost consistentlyand cont inuously if you do nt understand some of this that ive been telling you about pr you wi ll have an awful time of it if you think p r is go ing around and being nice fellow or talking somebody around in some fa shion or another why you might as well forget it becau pr is not being fellow pleasant fello w arc is only one little p ortion of pr pr is technol ogical activity now it alway s had techno logical procedu res so weve moved it up ont the front bur nernow im not tryin g to sell you anythin g here with pr at all im trying to give you an xample of technical breakthrough now from the basic litt laws febc03 pr becomes subject 1 3 18171 febctapes 29 011004 which i gave you on the s ubject of pr defini tion and s cope of subject you can now develop technical applications and you can develop practice s which ar based on these basic actions and laws nd formulas and which utilize anything known about the subject to date and it puts you in contr ol of human emoti on and reaction in you r immediate vicinity so ther is piece of technolo gy and as piece of techno logy it has considerable value but it gives you wher you go when you ma ke b asic b reakthrough we happen to be in the field of human emoti on and r eacti on and therefore we are in continuous collisi on wi th this particu lar fie ld being in conti nuous co llision with this fiel d wed better know something about handling it and therefore one f the adjuncts that pr oducti on officer woul d have to have woul d be pr arm of some type or kind so if he moved it up int the uppe r story and he was r eally working at volume he w ould actually have to be suppor ted by pr man if he werent suppor ted by pr man he woul d come cropper unles s you know somethin g about this and unless you know that subject exists im not talking to you to suddenly know this whole subject but youve got to know that such subject xists that it does have technol ogy and that it has found its ba sic and primary use which is an adjunct of product ion and if youknow those f acts you r inte rest in it wou ld be adequate that when you start runnin g into the problem of hum an emotion and reaction as b arrier you w ould know that ther is techn ology that can move ahe ad with this and handle the human emotion and reacti on you re running into as barrier to your producti on we hav who wo rld right now to handle it wi ll eventually go out something along the line of forwar d action ahead of whe re we ar the re will alway s be sort f pr outp ost or small pr action going on in advance of wher we ar workin g now the enemy h as been try ing very very har d with very knuckle headed pr which overran itself and began to overrun itself and got mixed up along about the time f the melbou rne inquiry and ever since that time the emy has been m aking the continu ous mist ake of hitting it too har d about that time he went too far and you ll find out theres been pr ess revulsion but l ong befor that ther was pr ess revulsion there was actu ally was publ ic revulsion so the ene my in following through various for mulas of what he tho ught it should all consist f and fo llowing them th rough very badly has done very bad job of it he has mad our name k nown the recent l ost suit in england wa s worth easily hund red th ousand pounds in advertising easily we couldn t have bought it it demonstrated that the gover nment had case ag ainst it and it demonstrated that member of parliament can say what he pleases these are disrelated fact s didnt have much to do with that but that weve attacked the gover nment appar ently made us very p opular the formula f revolution is as follows the person who is ant agon istic to ward the gover nment jo ins anyone who opposes it they as k questions about who theyr joinin g they only know that they want to blow down eventually or change or alter gover nment anybody who attack s the gove rnment then thats how revolution begins and thats why r evolutions ar usu ally betrayed the people who join revolutionsare usually betrayed because they never as k the question of who am i j oining they just j oin whoevers agin it that outfits agin it go od must be good outfit join it up that formula just went on in england the psychotic up ther minister crossman hes real spinner hes quite mad and thats not just casual insult he runs the new statesm an he think s the scient ologists ar some sort f revolutionary gr oup that are not as bad as the ippies or febc03 pr becomes subject 1 4 18171 febctapes 30 011004 something and you r ead this over why you know you re readin g guy who thinks the ma rtians are after him but he would nt be able to differentiate who we ar or what he has alr eady decided that wer against the gover nment as matter of fact it isnt even true but when they that we lost in suing the gover nment was not the point that we were against the g overnment was the point you seldom get chance to make statement w ere against the gover nment now people who are looking for raw r ed revolution of cou rse would liable to be dis appointed when they c ame to us because people are misr eading the whole situation left and right misreading the situation we have pr situation first and foremost we have pr situation therefore this is part of the technol ogy wit h which wer operating this technolo gy should be known to you but there is method of proceedin g into the public there is method of handling and cont rolling human opin ion if you dont underst and that then your own ho pes of expan sion wou ld be greatly curtai led admin istration and organization is very comp lex but there is method of extending your own basis of operati on int the gover nment into the people into the this and even int the enemy and that you shoul d know that that is that and come of f rather silly appr oach of just try ing to be g ood and eventu ally theyll recognize your worth that d oesnt work at all just has valuein the fiel d of pr good w orks well pub licized is one f the def initions which they give in textbook on the subject thats supposed to be the perfect defin ition of pr it couldn t be fu rther from the truth effective cause well demonstrated ou see theyve made few little refinements then you can ma ke forwar d progress now all the or ganization you do in the wor ld is not going to do you any good unless youre making fo rward progress into the envir onment in which you f ind yourself an or ganizati on must only expand and an or ganization which contracts dies that happens to be the way the universe is bu ilt it isnt because i sa so its becau its true and so ther efore you must ok considerably to you r various pr factors as you move on out and these should not be neglected now in the shininess and bra ssines s and newnes s of the techno logy with which you are now dealing and the administrative techno logy which your now dealing we havent yet begun to fight along this particu lar line i mean we re we re really with it why if you dont know that there is method of handlin g human emoti on and r eacti on and you dont know that that is the method by which you will extend and you dont know that that that fancy mailing you are getting out and paying lot of money for if this wa snt based on any survey hah had p roject bac k of it had campaign at all didnt do anything might as well have been thr own in the to ilet because it wasnt put out along techno logical lines d you follow ther efore the techno logy of pr is necessary because it forms one of the lar ger items in the budget of an administrator it is big and when it is neglected you fail and when it itself is bad you also fail so i am pring the subject of pr to you and im telling you that ther has been breakthr ough in this f ield im tell ing you that ther is technolo gy and im tellin g you that you will find it absolute ly vital and that you certainly somewher up the line in handling febc03 pr becomes subject 1 5 18171febctapes 31 011004 product and or ganizati on wi ll collide wit h situ ation wh ich can only be handled by pr and try as you will you wont be able to get any further with out the pr being handled and you will have h ard enough time handling it even u sing all f pr so when all seems too grim and you cant seem to get your point acr oss and you cant seem to get your product and it just w ont organize that way then you do have to ol and that to ol is called pr and it has its ow n techno logy and we hav made br eakthr ough in this subject and i actually respect the fel lows wh have work ed har d in this fiel d to make standard techno logies extant they are most over looked by their own brethren so all the technolo gy ther is in this field is adaptable p roviding you know what the s ubject is for which the pr man doesnt isnt that r emark able right lets take five minute break huh febctapes 32 011004 the org offi cer produ ct office r syste m part i 7101 c18 s feb c 3 18 january 1971 alright this is the second lectur seventeen eighteen january second lectu re eighteen january 1971 and this is the pr oduct org officer sy stem there has not been at this time sufficient time i have not had ctually suffic ient wo rk time to wr ite up all of the m aterial which has been developed in this particu lar fiel d and the material is considerable there has been conside rable development which is not at this moment recorded you will find then at this time that what i am giv ing you ar the basic s and these you wi ll not find changing these ba sics ar not going to be changing but you wi ll find that this ar ea wil l develo pnow the first facts of the ca ar again that s mall group which is well organized has good technol

the technol ogy we have wi thout any thought at all we can ma ke the san saner and the insane s ane and the b reakthr ough which xists her technically is so str ong that it actually cuts thoug h the

iar positi on now f not being able to export all the technol ogy we have becau the areas into which we would export it and the or gs into which we xport it are insuffic iently organized to be able to handle and control it now our organizational technol ogy suffered mainly by not being known people say there must be som ething w rong with the or g boar d if something or other something or other and then you go around and you ask the st aff wher is the or g boar d posted and they l ook at you org board oh yes oh we hav good org board yes its uh and you go in and you fin d something thats ye ar out of date and not general use it was the ign orance of the subject so it is igno rance of the technol ogy wh ich we have which is our greatest bug bear the org officerp roduct 2 180171 officer syst em p art i febctapes 34 011004 to over come this we have impr oved tremendously now merely by assembly of what we alr eady knew the technolo gy of how you teach course the course superviso r check sheet th at has just been developed and certain things of that character ar direct and immediate improvements whic h ma ke it p ossible for an ar ea to train its auditors better and train themso they can get results and then when they have gotten results with the material they have make it possible to put in special department department f special ca ses it doesnt matter how many by the way departments division four has you see department f special cases in div ision four and then new auditors can be br ought on and trained not the uditors who were there in the or g at the time im very sorry you will find that they ar very very neces sary becau technol ogy disappear s under this new t of audito rs can be br ought in trained up audito rs can be gradu ated up and so on and they become your class ten s pecial cases uditors they c an crac k any c ase that wal ks up the walk i f hell sit still or if anybody can hol d him down long enough to get the c ans in his hand or tie them to his feet now som of you here have had something of this new technol ogy it came ctually from the ot grade s why it an swers the question of why d oes an ot restrain hims elf and cease to behave as an ot it works be st in that band but it also works at the l ower end of the band that s why wer pushing cr ew up at the p resent moment all the w ay on up as fast s we can push them up so that when we give them the techno logy they can go for broke it works better at the to p end of the band than it does the bo ttom end of the band but it works at either end of the band so i doubt any of you have h ad the stionable pleasur of being insane and so you probably woul d not be able to experience the t remendous r esurgence which person gets when he suddenly turns sa ne it s quite raculous but that is r esidual in this technol ogy and occurs rather r outinely and i think were probably the only group in the universe as far as i know knowing the bac k track who can do this now that is on an individual basis so you have indiv idual techno logy now which turns the sic k wel l the insane turns them sane and make one li fe being immortal other wise the technol ogy doesnt have very many t argetsnow wer actually sitting her with this technol ogy now what do you do with the techno logy of cou rse you cou ld go of f and fo rget about the techno logy and that woul d be about the gr eatest overt that anybody ever pul led the overt of omission we happen to find ourselves on planet which has rather unsavory reputati on and amongst planets would be looked upon as sort of an alcatraz nd was dumping ground so there is tremendous need f or such technol ogy here but it is actually g oing into the teeth of planet that is not entirely sane about ten to twenty percent unbe knownst to st atistic ians and i cant tell you exactly what the pe rcentage is out in the general public because i havent surveyed it but i wou ld just say by estimation its ten to twenty percent f the at lar ge walking around po pulation is stark staring mad the other eighty to ninety percent whatever that factor is ar quite sa ne but ar so caved in by the mad ones that the society s an awful time getting off the launchi

lar time were in for some r eason or other peri od of peace nd its the cultu re is on the way down and its just little bi ttouch and go they give us several weve had sev eral of these litt touch and go things lik there are bunch f guys monk eying ar ound wi th this peacewar button you know and should we have war or should we have peac w ell theyve moved in on the button again and then they go off of it well of cou rse war would just fin ish any human communicati on and cultu ral lines on which anythi ng can travel so ther efore we d ont really have all the time there is w cant really sit around on ou r hands and do nothing further more the planet could be expected to resist any such movement becau the most resistance you get towar d being cured by anyone is an insan person an insane person will resist being cured harder than anybody ever heard of because he knows everybody is martians and they re all out to get him and he k nows theres help and so on of course thats what ma kes him insane certain number f these on the planet in high posit ions bring about the ditions known as war and so on now recently we trac ed by the way ho w person move s from the lower strata s of the society up to an executive positi on or pol itical posit ion of magnitude you can the patter n of it can be in your own org person cannot hold the job of central files clerk and he ar gues nd argues and fi nally moves himself over to som other portion of the or g the res very few people in that po rtion of the or g so he gets an ic in charge of something then ther isnt anybody else ar ound and he seems to be very active and he becomes departmental head he become s departmental head by accident and he actually is pushing himself up now he h as he doesnt have the motivation of helping others he just has the motivation of protecting himself and the higher he rise s on the pyramid the mo re he thinks he wi ll be protected thats part of his ins anity you get up to the top of the pyramid you spend ninety percent of your time ducking bullets but the fact s of the case are that there is sort of sy stem by whic h person whocant ho ld any post winds up wit h very high post i don t for instance know what the current president of the united states woul d be able to do in law cou rt i dont think hes ever been able to do anythin g in law court but he re he is in the pol itical arena most of these fellows who are in the pol itical arena have never studied gover nment never they wou ldnt know what you meant they wou ldnt know you re talking about yet there is technolo gy of gover nment but these ar politicians why ar they ther usu ally there for their friends and so on this makes rather queasy sc ene in which to operate now the an swer to this ope ration is to be as efficient as all go d holy hell and you have administrative techno logy which is sharp as the teeth of bear trap and what your doing with your own technol ogy must be very effective indeed and you must be able to pick up and use dat available and cont rol the human emoti on facto r in your immediate vic inity the org officerp roduct 4 180171 officer syst em p art i febctapes 36 011004 in other words if you re tremendously well organized you can not only survive but you can expand but what you have to know in order to do this and what the techno logy has to consist of and how well you have to know the technol ogy exactly deter mines the amount of expan sion you are goin g to attain given the techno logy it will only be becaus you do not have total knowled ge of it or expert ise with it that wou ld caus one to fail now you can have staff which isnt hatted and matt er how clever you are theyl l manage to make you fail they dont really know theres anything there so therefore it isnt enough for you as an xecutive to know how to do all this youve got to be able to relay it train it check peop out on it and handle it so general knowledge particular and very broad knowled ge is r equired of any person who is regulatin g any group mary sue got together some stimate s here and she s ays based upon recent figuresin relationship to the trainin g of executive directors it takes approximately three hund red and sixty hou rs to make an administrative xpert in nine divisions therefore it wou ld tak rough ly the following hours to train various or ganiz ational personnel one hund red and twenty hours an xecutive secr etary or expert in three divisions forty hou rs divisi onal cretary and xpert in one division thirteen and h alf hours department head and xpert in one third of divisio n three hours section head and expert in one fifth of department w ith staff training hours of two and half hou rs per day it woul d rough ly take the fo llowing number of days an xecutive secretary forty eight days divisio nal cretary sixteen day s department head six days nd section head two days but therefore youd have to be determined that these fello ws do get trained and you woul d have to have some program by which thes people did check out and youd have to have some system by which they did have some underst andin g of the hat and duties they we re wearing is that agr eed oud have to have that wouldn t you well supposin g you did all this and you use this sc ale and you go t everybo dy in your org hatted alm ost unimaginably almost unattainable you always have one r two guys sitting around someplace th at cant find their hat and never did have hat now if all of this wa s going on and if somebody was putting their hats on and that sort of thing im afraid you still wou ldnt have anything because the other side of the coi n is product ion now what is all of this training and so for th about is it to attain producti on that is what that is all about so the other half f this co in productio n suppor ted by the first half of this co in organization gives us the coin and we have what you could call the pr oduct officerorg officer system now undoubted ly this will be shortened up w cant call it po system becau that mean s purchase or der we might very wel l hear it called the p rodoff system but ive simplybeen callin g it the pr oduct officerorganizing officer system actually however else these things ar stated or what wor ds you used it is exactly this its the pr oduct officer not the production officer thes are the niceties f it the p roduc t officer and the or ganiz ing office r now the first thing we run int by the intr oduct ion of this s ystem is the question of is production nece ssary the or g serie s as the or g serie s goes b ack it speaks of this and ive had letter or two and dr it makes it look like very exhau sted world woul d be the the org officerp roduct 5 180171 officer syst em p art i febctapes 37 011004 result of this nobo dy ever sa ys anything to that blunt ly the res just litt bit of curve on it and this idea f product ion unfor tunately car ries with it the label which has been given to it by the communist who s tried to get at the bosse s of their existing society as product ion monsters who are swe ating the last dr op of product ion out of the poor sufferin g wo rker and we hav gotten int peri od wher that or ientation occurs and now ill tell you the cream f the jest the jest has real cr eam on it its the pr imary product ion problem of russia is how to get pr oducti on out f the po or work er and the r ussian is now going mad and he even b rought whole bunch of guys bac k from siberia and so forth becau they knew something about producti on he started go ing mad and the top men in the presidium these days are exproducti on officers because it is such crucial problem in the s oviet uni on kruschev hed sit down i dont know whether he woul d have t alked to you much about politics but if you had mentioned something about the electric light plants he would tell you exactly how you should get pr oducti on out of an electric light plant br rrrr now the c apitalist society deif ies the money lender or the money haver and tends to down grade the producer and the p roduct ion man by title in plant is not the general man ager hes not even the general man agers as sistant the plant man ager has producti onman its about eighteen echelons down the line because for some reason r othe r the guy who inher its the money was king th roughout the nineteenth century the social strata s and so forth are not quite straight the whole field you get int this in nonproduction oriented society the whole field of psychiatry and psychol ogy and so on stun k to high heav simply because they had producti on orientatio n whatsoever they merely had st atus orientation and the thing that makes these guys insufferable is they h ave st atus one of the things that ma kes spanish off icial rather insufferable is he s status and they have st atus nd they ok around and its status st atus statu s but its statu s bas ed on not hing spanish engineer gets certi ficate as an engineer and he nev er has to engineer for the r est of his life thats whats wr ong with these bir ds im line man i think ther was one once that graduated some time r othe r that did produce somethin g they produced r evolution but here here is subject now the r eason im making these litt comments on it it has many ramificati ons and in studying the or g series and in studying this wh ich i assume you all wou ld have done up to this po int since this is additional org series m aterial which i am giving you you possibly the question has pa ssed you mind product ion well its not too popular its i wonder it seems to be str ange orientati on so you find you rself in position actually if you re trying to get productio n you will usually face to some tiny degr ee some little resistance to productio n as subject becau it has been subjected to so much p ropaganda and becau it sometime s requires some swe at and the guys who are objecting to this are the birds who hoped that they woul d be able to hide in the coat closet while everyb ody else work ed anywa this then ther are social or human r eaction factors connected to the subject f product ion itself just as wor d as nam or an activity you must fac that it is subjectwhich is able to paralyze the economy of the united state s for months on end is paralyzing right w the subject the enti re british postal system right at the present moment labor man agement relations general moto rs in the united state s weeks or months of strike the larthe org officerp roduct 6 180171 officer syst em p art i febctapes 38 011004 gest busines s in the united states totally paralyzed tied up management s saying produce and the wo rker is saying wages wages c ash ca sh cash now one of the thin gs th at you wi ll run int perpetual ly and continuously is you re talking to somebody about product ion and hes talking to you about wage s hes t alking to you about r eturn for producti on these subjects do not neces sarily have nythi ng whatsoever to do with each other they are nonsequitur and thats why theres so much problem on it becau the term opter m really d oesnt match now what is this subject wh at is this subject that doesnt have to do with wage s and company contracts nd then what the hell is this subject w ell now you hold your head hol d your head on because this wil l blow it production is the ba sis of morale in the bsence of product ion you will have p roblems in morale the cu re for morale is product ion alright now lets give us some actu actions her what s happened some thi ngs that have h appened here cases and staff mo rale the pl the fn vgi pl theyr perfectly true but thats out of the field of first dynamic tech now because it says staff morale tends to throw it ove r into third dynamic tech cases and st aff morale is perfect ly true from the viewp oint of cs the number f peop that you have do ing fn vgi at the examine rs wil l to marked degr ee deter mine you r staff morale and af ter you ve got hund red percent fn vgis at the xaminer you have ccomp lished st aff morale on the fi rst dynamic and your organization is liable to be bogged mess so we sa alright we wil l have to get on you see to have staff audito rs of anykind whatsoever w ould be fat so we sa well have to get on some audito rs and theyd better audit the st aff and get all the s taff up to fn vgi status so we do that and the or g falls apart they got morale on the first but not on the thir d now the funny part of it is they really d ont have morale on the f irst they just h ave morale about that part f the fi rst which is their case now it works this way on the m anagement cycle if theyr having great of trouble wi th their case tryin g to pull them up much further than that is very difficult so you start with the fi rst factor of the man agement cycle having to do wit h wher you re really having t rouble as an or g officer dealing with the persons ca that s just the beginnin g thats the fi rst st ep up now let give you let give you the sixty four dollar punch w hold your head if the ind ividual is auditing the auditor is auditing pc and he has win the audito rs morale is good right d you agree with that hm right now if he audits the pc and he has lose the uditors morale is bad ri ght alr ight good the monitoring factor is cl othed in this ugly word producti on hes accompl ished something producti on is the evidence of the demonstratio n of competence now after youve gotten all the c ase gain ther is how do you get any other gain thats an inter esting question isnt it w ell actually it goes ca gain right up on the line to cross line and f rom there on it is competence competence is what gives the ca gain and you say well look somebody flying around out here on doing good job on t of water skis and so fo rth appears to be very happy and so fo rth he is mer ely engaged in the xhibit ion of competence his morale is up because he is m aking an expert demonstratio n of water skiing when he falls in front of the lar ge cr owd the org officerp roduct 7 180171 officer syst em p art i febctapes 39 011004 i saw the sor riest sight i ever hope to in my li fe it was command performancebefore the queen and there was clown wh had waited all of his life he was tight wi re clown and hed waited all of his life for command perfor mance the lights went up the drums r olled the clown with his umbr and his b aggy pant s climbs up gets onto the tight wire and st arts across the ght wi re ther he is total xhibition of competence twirling an umbrella between his legs and ove r his head and dancing on the wi re and at that moment the appar atus co llapsed they killed the lig hts and in that dark blackn ess removed him from the scene seen af terwar ds in the d ressing room he was one of the saddest sor riest lookin g fell ows you ever sa w in your life exhibit ion of competence p roduct ion is an exhibi tion of competence an exercise of competence play can become eventually very bo ring becau it has cycle which proves the competence cycle the re at all so he skied on water skis so the crowd cheer ed so he had to ski on water ski s so the c rowd cheer ed whats he got nothing but his mo rale went up becau he xhibited competence now producti on actually firms it one time in bunch of actors bunch of actors were under training and they were just hammer ed and po unded and pounded and hammer ed these wer hollywood actors starlets nd that sort of thing going to be the stars of tomor row and so on in theatrical training group used by the big studi and they hammer ed and poun ded those po or guys the most inval idating mean sn arling my go d stage di rector would ever be s an as those instructo rs wer sarcastic weir d mimic ry awful after about three months of it these ctors bec ame utterly impervi ous to it and wer able to exhibit competence to their own complete and their g roup satisfaction regardless of what anybody said they got so they knew competence they knew competence in themselve s their morale came w ay up they became very cock so their morale wa snt neces sarily built by everybody being nice to thempr is not nece ssarily being nice to bring peo ple out of apathy the pr camp aign would be fe ar demonstratio n of competence now ive had coup of busts by commod ores messengers her they wer trick ed by piece of electr onic equipment and so on and you never sa w anybody look so woebego ne in their l ives and drag around for the ne xt day or so but thes young characters ctually have thei r own concept of competence it is fair ly high you do nt often some f the hi lls theyr put to climb you probably see them go ing back and forth sometime you see them they g dow n the ladder and that way and then they come back and then they go down the ladder and that way and then they come back and then they go d own the ladder and that way and they come back and then they go d own the ladder that way and they come bac k have you ever this ma ybe some of you have been subjected to it what is actually go ing on is they re being asked to accumulate d ata as k questions find out what the score is get an order acr oss find out whats happening and be able to relay the thing back so that situation can be stimated and if there is situation dropped or if its ther handled r some futu re plannin g usually co or executive di rector hat is ba sically planning coordinati on hat plannin g coordinati on hat is the r eal place wher planning belongs it belongs in the xecutive directors lap and the coo rdinatio n can only be done from that st atus so youve seen one of these ch aracters go back and fo rth back and fort h now very few and thereve been quite the org officerp roduct 8 180171 officer syst em p art i febctapes 40 011004 few on that post failed to eventu ally get certain amount of aplomb and their aplomb and their morale and so on rises considerably out of proportion to thei r age ouve just seen one go out of here on mission now i imagine the re was litt ripple of shock thr ough the s hip when all of sudden that l ittle kid is going out as ssionai re well that lit tle kid canconfront mo re dumb explan ations nd more bad data and mo re false reports and know what to make out f them they got together one day and they put together little roster of everybody on the ship that did nt know what they wer doing becau they never gave them any kind of an an swer but an xplan ation their front on the thi rd dynamic is very very hi gh they continuously exhibited competence and it reflects in their mo rale now one or two have tr ied to make the grade and they havent actually go tten int the run yet and their competence didnt match it and they had r ough time moment ary well catch them some other time but competence doesnt just go you r case gain g oes up to this line and then fr om ther on up it is competence actually the competence sets in co incident with the c ase gain then the demonstratio n of competence is the basic factor of morale and producti on is the evidence of competence so in productio n one gets an xhibit ion of competence and its evidence if you want high morale activity get them to produce if you want w morale activity have them skip it oh we re just go ing to be nice to you fell ows you dont have to work nobody has to work around here i mean we dont work and you wonde r why the hell are they all falling apart why im tell ing you this becau it happen s to be true not becau im pring this subject f product ion thats the truth of the m atter now guy can run run run run run actually it wont be unti l he runs into failu re that you ll see his begin to feel red and begin to want lay of f and begin to do this and that and the othe r thing becaus people inv olved in this sort of thing are run ning bodies there are just so m any hou rs they st ay awa ke and ther just so l ong they run with out having their gas tank s filled or their batteries r echar ged or whatever type of body we re oh its eating yeah thats righ t its just so long that one can run and so it is th at sustained period of product ion normally should match the fact that you re running an intermittent type of body abody is inter mittent its on and its off do you see and that comes basically becau you have sun situation which is single sun type planet the res daylight and ther darkne ss and ther daylight and ther darknes s in earlier time s nobody wanted to move ar ound much in the darkne ss so they st arted sleeping and so f orth and youl l get some peop get this blown out and they st art working in the darkn ess and sleeping in the dayligh t and so on they get this all out of phase i have perfect cur for insomnia by the way per fect cur for insomnia get yourself from the b ookstore who bunch of fairy tales down from the b ookstore just get some fairy tales of various types fairy tales of different count ries and that sort of thin g and sit down and read yourself fairy tale and you ll go right to sleep bon g marvelous it restimulates h aving been put to sleep wit h the same stories f or so many lives dont count sheep alright so body is inter mittent so ther efore long sust ained period of product ion requires some inter mittency and thats about the only way youll get into trouble but if you try to get n enforced inter mittency and the guys ar right in the midd of cycle and you the org officerp roduct 9 180171 officer syst em p art i febctapes 41 011004 make them br eak off youve had it so you r inter mittency can only take place r eally at the end of cycles becau the completi on of cycle of action is the other major factor in product ion but when am cycle of action has been completed or one or two or three am cycles of action have been comp leted it s about time somebody said that if its all all the returns in those who have got them all in now go on twenty fou r hour break r something in other words you re matching up this is not nece ssarily native to anything but bo dies and peop wer horrified when i was trying to give plan out her i imagine it wa s received with complete horror that fif ty percent of aosh dk should be whipped up port and starboar dfiftyfifty and every weekend one f those po rt or starboar d watch why took the ship out and i imagine this w as received with som horror and so fo rth actually itd be marvelous thing so that every week end why the fo rt was held wi th the p ort watch and the starboar d watch got thems elves br eak nd they could go for sail this is the type of thing which you have to engage up on with high product ion crew now hold your hat gain you have never seen pr oducti on the w ay you will see pr oducti on with the p roduct org officer system in the first place it only functi ons with team it functi ons as tea m action so your product org officer sy stem then will speed up the vel ocity of flow to such degr ee that it appr oaches pe ak load for the indiv iduals concer ned particu larly product officer which is really something but morale matche s it youll never see so much motion and youl l never see so much high morale and youll never see so much velocity if you run the s ystem right so it is t slight breakthrough becau it comb ines right over into mo rale how did we used to have high speed organizations and here and now have low speed organizations the dif ference is the high speed rganization was produc ing the low speed organization isnt thats the only difference betwe the two organizations it has noth ing to do with what you hired on on ly supp ressives or somethin g thats the difference you hire hund red people your goin g to get fif teen or twenty suppr essive s i mean that s inevitable but the high speed organization and the low speed organizations the difference between them is product ion now when i write about this this product sy stem d you agree now that ther is some coordinati on betwe producti on getti ng something done and so forth and morale ou can see that alright now when i l ook int this writi ng this up and when i tell peop the ru of the p roduc t org officer system they get the words with out the mu sic and you can talk tothem and you can tell them nd so forth but unles s you tell them listen ther some music to be gotten here as well as the wor ds and unles s theyve actually gone into an xperiential action on short term product as part of product fficer org officer team why you d miss the whole boat ou cou ld read all about this well theres product officer and an org officer yes they have those in general motors they have strik ther and you know what they d in gener motors by the way on the ssembly line they carefully tak away from every w orker his pr oduct we found out by the way that the pr oduct officer claim s the cr edit for all of the pr oducts pr oduced and gives c redit of any kind to anybody else produc ing any of the pr oducts fo r him and if he just continues to take the cr edits all by himself his team will go to piece s if you put men on an ssembly line theyr just tightening nut and the org officerp roduct 1 0 180171 officer syst em p art i febctapes 42 011004 tightening nut and they k eep talking about the final product the final product of the utom obile final product of the utom obile theyr immediately gl ossing over the fact that this guy thats ri ght on that as sembly line has product he has s eated car r tightened bolt but he h as pr oduct they never let them have part of the p roduct so the mo rale is bad advertisedly i dont know that it is ive never wo rked on an ssembly line but therefore it is nec essary to let the people have the product the credit for the p roduct even though the product is sold or walks out or does something else theyve got the cr edit for that piece of the p roduct now we have to redefine then what is product and pr oduct is completed cycle of action which is then can be represented as having been done by defin ition see youd have to know scient ology you d have to know things l ike completed cycle of action you see for it to make any s ense so dont think you re studying gener motorssso what hav you got here you got m achine thatll run aw ay with you just that i f you dont know you r oec if you don t know your org board if you dont know everyth ing there is to know about whe re should be what and who should go which and how many be ans should be over there and so on and know this thing cold you ll never make an or g office r and if you never make an or g officer youll never ma ke pr oduct officer becau pr oduct officer by defin ition is goo d org officer now the first thing that you have to know about product officer he has to want the product second thing he s to be able to recognize the product maybe i ve got those in reverse maybe he h as to be able to recogn ize the p roduct and want the p roduc t but that s for sure if those two thi ngs ar sing skip it nothing else is go ing to happen ou have to be able to recognize the product now this is an inter esting skill all by itself becau you coul d walk down line of typewriters of peop pound ing typewr iter and not recogn ize what the p roduct is it coul d be done but it wou ld take litt bit of doing but if one is very airyfairy he wo uld say the product is an swered mail you see for the wh ole for one typist answered mail for one typist the rgs mail an swered see now lets get mo re airy fairy now lets go way outside the wh ole thi ng of cou rse nswer ed mail is product but it is sections p roduct see w have to recogn ize whose p roduct it is and to what does it apply now we go outside and we get some airy fairy stat ement like what is your product and we re talking to some clerk and he says communication lines around the world oh boy hes tele x typist hes wo rking on the w rong product all the time he isnt out there putting in communicati on along the piece hes producing sent and acknow ledged telexes one by one by one by one he can actually be producing the tele xes having to do with one cycle of administrative action but that s what hes p roduc ing now if his communication line is just to produce is just the product of an ac know ledgedtelex he got it through to the other end and he knows he got it through to the other end if that is his pr oduct you may fin d that he wi ll be too hes too lonely as member of you see hes too lone ly as an ind ividual with that produc t to have that product be total exhibition of competence because he ou get the idea he isnt looking at this as his p roduct hes thinking of something else as his product the u sual mes sed up thing that tele x operator would the org officerp roduct 1 1 180171 officer syst em p art i febctapes 43 011004 have to be part of team and it would have to be part of brie fed team thats what s imp ortant part of briefed team hed have to know why he was s ending the telexes and hed have to know what the tele x network is and what thes telexes did hed have to know great about about the rganization he wa s operatin g for in othe r words hed have to have an organization hat and hed also have to have divisi on hat hed also have to have section hat in short he woul d have to be part of the am now when you try to run bunch of indiv iduals s product fficer on their individual products only you wi ll find that you ar getti ng int very serious trouble they are bunch of individuated peop they are not team they ar not operating in team ction productio n is essentially team ctivity now youve g ot the stellar star who can water ski beautiful ly very good it is inte resting and it makes lot of other peop want to water sk i too actually the audience is doing partic ipation as they watch him water ski well that s enough status and enough expertise and is rar enough and so on to have ot her thin gs so this guys sitting there you will run into it often the r eason the tele xes don t get answer ed is becau the guy doesnt r ecognize what this p roduc t is he d oesnt know what hes doin g with this product he doesnt know what hes forwar ding with this p roduct becau hes not part of the team do you seeso hes part of several groups within one g roup the product fficer then has to be sure that his the am he is perating with is team nd this brin gs in the or g officer when they cea to be members of the am the re is the fi rst poin t wher the rg officer will find himself with problem guy isnt member f the team now fellow can become cea to be member of the am th rough failures and you can xplain it in numerous othe r way s actually if you want to really crash somebodys morale is remove him from post thats very very cruel wick ed sort of an action but in his own estim ation sometimes nec essary to do it and then you ll find out something inter esting as an or g officer that guys job is valuable and so we look fu rther into this universe nd this w orld and we fin d only those places wher people are unh atted are they unhappy so your first action of the or g officer is hattedness s m ember of the team febctapes 44 011004 the org offi cerprodu ct office r syste m part ii 7101 c18 s feb c 4 18 january 19 71 now your product officer has to be able to recog nize pr oduct and he has to want the product and the or g officer has to be able to ma ke somebody member f the team and give him enough expert ise so th at he can demonstrate his competence and if he gives him enough expertise so that he can demonstrate his competence he become s member f the team so these ar quite different funct ions ar ent they now as an xecutive di rector runn ing an or g officer and product officer you will run into this immediat problem you won t know who to give orders to you wi ll become fog gy you will sometimes give the p roduc t officer the or ders which shoul d go to the or g officeryoull som etimes give the or g officer the pr oducts which should go to the p roduc t officer now im sa ying this im not putting this up as possible aberration for you to shoot at im just tel ling you that this point exists othe rwise you ll make duck s and drakes out of this s ystem now we could write all about this in cold words and you still wouldn t have the music becau the music is speed up beyond belie f when you start these two actions togethe r its something like mixing fire and dynamite ou get speed up now as you get that spe ed up all those port ions of the ar ea first all those tea m members who are not really part f the team and so fo rth and all those po rtions of the area at lar ge in which your running this am wi ll be imp inged upon by the am because your runn ing at much highe r veloc ity level than the ar ea is runn ing and it inevitably will happen the re will even be thought like maybe we ou ght to slow this thing down its something like this its the old old story about the salt mill and the s alt mil l started gri nding out salt and it perpetually ground out salt and nobody could stop this thin g from grind ing out salt p art of an old story and it ground out so much salt that nob ody cou ld put any of the s alt anyplace so they threw it in the ocean and thats why the ocean is salty its stil l dow n ther grind ing out salt but theres some thou ght like hey somewhe re along the line you say any product officer that he all of sudden it ll be if he wishe s to trace it back hes just had little failure ten fifteen twenty minutes ago or that mor

011004 bit you know becau this is st arting to roar now that is the music that goes along with this sy stem now look at the look at the facto rs which are stacked up here the scarcest thing inthe unive rse is hat and you wi ll find first and f oremost the or g officer will find at every one of his blunder points an unw orn hat the person will have t quite taken over the hat the person will have r eally just left the hat the person is not wearing his hat w ell now that not wearing his hat is insufficient ly expletive or it doesnt xplain it enough rather for the or g officer to handle the situ ation he just goes in and he says wear you r hat you know the or g officer has got to be an expert mini hatter now you can run through an organization as an executive and you can actually hat peop with out any hat check s heet r pac k you can tell them the res your post theres where you are on the or g boar d theres the divisi on this is your boss and you re supposed to sit the re and do so and so but thats thats just lick and pr omise thats about as good as any busines s ever does and then the guy is the re for ye ar or two then he finds out what his job is maybe he actually has never been hatted now this rapid hatting is alway s you r first action of the org officer it isnt ethic s its just rapid hatting becaus the guy r eally must have some kind f doubt or misunderstoo d or he did nt qu ite know what he was doin g or he di dnt quite something or other som ethin g or other and hell get killed in the rush and its only kindne ss to hat him and h at him rapid ly becau hes something like soccer player that h as thr own hims elf across the shins of his fellow team mate s and they not only will get some sor shins they wil l start getting mad at him he becomes soci pariah very quickly and so ther efore the or g officer has to be ther to catch the ball putting the guy back in the team line now he c an always put better team member ther he can alw ays put better organizati on there now you as executive director if your operatin g with an or g officer you d have to have pr etty big sized org to be perating with pr oduct officer and an org officer normally speaking the xecutive director would be the p roduc t officer hed be both the pr oductofficer and the planning officer and hed have an org officer backing him up ou get little bi t larger hes the planning officer coordinating officer hes got product officer hes got an or g officer and you get little bit bigger than this he s to have messenger and he has to have pr man and the pr oduct office r actu ally is the person who handles the pr man and then the org office r will use the r esults f the p r and so forth becau you re doing rapid survey becau what slowed your producti on down human emoti on and r eacti on s pr suddenly swings into the line now i clari fied pr with you first so th at you wo uldnt have misunderstoo d thi nking you should be nice to people or som ething by all mean s be nice to peop but it isnt it isnt the subst ance f pr pr is that technol ogy wh ich handles human emoti on and reacti on so thats what your going to run into now why isnt this guy hatted well he could be unhatted by igno rance which is the charitable fact r he can be unhatted by hum an emotion and r eacti on yeah im t going to play im go ing to sit over here on the side l ines and so fo rth the last time they went down the field they kick ed in the ribs and theyr still sore so the or g officer is actually in the busines s of picking up the pieces and puttin g the team bac k togethe r again and the pr oduct office r is on ly interested in p roduc ts and you the org officerp roduct 3 18171 officer syst em p art ii febctapes 47 011004 as executive director have to be able to get these two things untangled so that you just know them instinct ively pongo or product officer has to know these things instinctively both of them have to know the or ganizati on inside out theres system by which you do this and whic h i advocate in org series ten the analysis of organization by p roduct we find there are four products these fou r products are the est ablish m achine the machines pr oduct the cor rected machine and the co rrected productin other words there is the established ma chine and the cor rected machine just think of generator see its putti ng the generato r ther and then ther repairing it see and then the p roduc t officer he doesnt have anything to do with this m achine except just sa ying what speed its to be run at and so f orth and so on because he s not interested in the machine hes interested in what the machine is producing its either producin g power ivered or its pr oducing electr icity or its pr oducin g something so that is what hes inte rested in see so actu ally your org officer has the tablished ment the establishm ent hes got the establishm ent he stablishes the stablishment and when it goes little awry he cor rects the establishm ent so he has pr oducts one and three and then weve got the p roduc t that the establishm ent has or the many pr oducts which it has and then the correction of the product as two and fou r the patter n that is fo llowed on this is when the product officer finds himself this is the law gover ning it when the product of ficer finds himself with product four wh ich is correctin g the est ablishment s product he immediat ely shoots it over to the or g officer organizatio nally at thr ee who tries to get it back to one so it goes four three one ou follow this w the org office r is fin ding out hes having to wh atwhatwhat wher the devi l is the wmfh and waof and waof and waof and waof well he goes right ahead and gets that he doesnt try to put the establishment together he d oesnt try to correct the est ablishment ny he can grab anybody thats p assing by and sa tally onto this waof and p roduce this waof right away do you see but at the sa time hes do ing that hes got to make some kind of notation in passing and slide it bac k hey the w aof cutter wasnt here and that goes to the rg officer and now the or g office r has some ho w or other got to get that co rrected see and these two guys work against and with each othe r on entir ely separate thingsnow the or g officer does not wo rk for the xecutive director or the co the org office r works for the pr oduct fficer the first p roduct an xecutive di rector or commanding officer is product of ficer the f irst pr oduct of the pr oduct office r is an org officer the f irst product of the or g officer is an hco area secretary and the first product of the hco area secr etary is an hco hco continues the est ablishm ent now with that in train and k eeping that in mind and trac king back to it when you find the sy stem is g oing loyadle now you just concent rate on p roduc ts as the executive di rector or pr oduct office r you just concentrate on products just p roducts thats all ou dont take your attention off of products and s ay i wonder why the organization didnt get its fp into the woggle bogs and why we didnt get any raw materials into the fuel spits nd so forth keep it on product two product tw product two each time you slide into the cor rected product of the tablishment slide it to the rg officer and s ay hey hey hey ther waffle cutter her you know w ere cutting waffles over her we don t have ny waffle cutter the org officerp roduct 4 18171 officer syst em p art ii febctapes 48 011004 now this m akes the or g officer go bit out of phase so he s four things he s the immediate action he s the medium range action he s the l ong range action and he s the very long range action which is wh ats this place go ing to look like two years from now whats it going to look l ike in six months and what ar we going to have her in six months thats you r long range action the medium range action organizationally and so forth well thats maybe couple f week s and the immediate thats anything from five minutes to day or something like that usu ally in actual practice probably about ten fif teen twenty minutes il l get you wog cutter you know something so thes operate one to the other and the rg officer lets g bac k to basics w hehas to know product when he see s one and he has to want that product and he s to get that p roduct which is the thir d line that p roduct hes got to get he might not get it on schedule it might not be as fancy as it was it might not be as big as it is but hes got to get it now one of the g reatest trainin g mechani sms which you can go through with this sy stem is to get s hort ter m close up organizational action training in flag bureau or liaison officer you actually are on very hot li ne ye s but the p roduct is not as visual in its final accomplishment for instance you r product is project wh ich is sent out let us say alrigh t thats fine it doesnt give you as neat view it gives you plenty good view and they wo rk great as teams as working wit h something wh ats my p roduct let us s ay lets ta ke s hip voyage t he pr oduct im w orking on is voyage now the voyage product somewher here ive got sample of trying to get voyage her we are product voyage now this wa s the write up this was the write up which ensu ed in try ing to get this p roduct called the voyage its actu ally flagship rder 201 its investigati on and r emedy of sailing delay all of sudden i noticed that we did nt have product now id decided this wa s go od time to get my h ands di rty on the subject f product officerorg officer system so i stepped in and much to the dismay of everybody involved and so fo rth operated as product fficer with out an or g officer for about f orty eight hours just to find out what this wa s all about and do it working on tied up product l ike voyage thats the product well we have to get the p roduc t started and the pr oduct wasnt starting ther was all kinds of wild things g oing on now becau i wasnt perating with an org officer some of those cycles ar still going on at this moment that came off of this althoug h this date is one january which was eighteen day s ago making it medium range project so after i got all this i wrote it all up and working on this try ing to get the voyagestarted the voyage had begun fif tyeight minutes late nd the faulty product of course wa s traced do wn why how come how come how come ctually it had to do with not gettin g clear ed and somebody had let customs of ficial and the gent go ashore to come back later and we found that an outnes s the re was that the re was an app arency of person scheduling the sailing of the s hip who shouldnt have been in other w ords we found counte rpolicy now by getting that out of the w ay and somehow getting the voyage started and then carrying on that voyage to comp lete that voyage as product and nothing but pr oduct and then working on pr oduct at the end of that line i was able to get hand f irst hand knowledge of this sy stem these wer the pr oducts which i work ed on one f the first things i found out is you have to be able to recogn ize the p roduc t you re working on with nonsen the org officerp roduct 5 18171 officer syst em p art ii febctapes 49 011004 youve go t to state that s the pr oduct it doesnt matter whether its in pol icy letter or not its the pr oduct you re working on at that moment youll find yourself working as product officer on typin g typist see i got produc t here i got typing typist this is the p roduct you see and youl l start wo rking on typing typist and s udden ly realize that you re working on an or g office rs pr oduct do you follow so you hastily you find yourself you cant get these mimeos out so youve got produc t in your lap which is typing typist thats an or g office r product so you prompt ly wou ld get hold of the rg officer and s ay for heaven s sakes give typin g typist so i can get my attention back on this mimeo so there you wou ld be little bit late but if you cou ldnt ident ify what p roduc t you r attention was on you might f ind you rself working wi th the w rong product which belon ged to the or g officer you see what i mean so now what wou ld have sed then is you we re tryin g to get mimeoed projectand you were trying to finish this up so th at you cou ld say period to that that is the pr oduct im working on and all of sudden you fin d you rself in four youre having to do something to correct this thing and its not coming out in the or g line then you just shif t it over its bviously three so it goes over to three you say to the or g officer get typing typist and then the or g officer can do that right away and then try to get the stablishment back into line on medium range thin g like get enough typists in mimeo you know and that might become long range of trying to empl oy some and so on and it drifts around that way but theyd have to know what theyr operating on so it is nece ssary for the pr oduct office r to make notes of everythi ng he pas ses to the org officer if you were the commanding officer in this instance you d write up somethin g like this p roduct voyage and it goes on and on and on and on and on and then this is pa ssed over to the or g officer and he can jo lly well r epair all this and patch it up now what go t in the r oad of this is the fact that the two orgs split this thing has not been total ly done yet do you see now the way you get this in l ine is to drill yourself as an executive director on this thing is to write product one the establishment pr oduct three the corrected establishment product two the est ablishments p roduct and the cor rected product f the est ablishment is four alrig ht w you get those car ds you could put them d own on your des k that s produc t one two three four with thes wordings written on them and then you put d own vo lume quality viabil ity on th ree separate c ards and every action you d just turn these car ds to the right one and all of sudden all the clou ds will come ou t of your skull on the subject and youll be able to hand the rights thi ngs to the pr oduct fficer and so on product officer can do this what am i w orking on see each one f the p roducts has volume quality and viability now this whole subject goes along on this that n intermittent or uniform now anintermittent f low is one thin g but nonuni form flow is quite something else and what wi ll really get in your hair is non uniformity on your assembly line so one of your main things of product office r is spottin g non uniformity so that he can hand it to the rg officer to get uniformities well ill give you weir d one w have staff hat fif ty percent of the staff members have one st aff hat and the other fifty percent have another staff hat entirely different they the org officerp roduct 6 18171 officer syst em p art ii febctapes 50 011004 tell them to write their dispatches in an enti rely different way and r oute them in entir ely different routin gs youve got dogs br eakfa st at once now that wou ld be gross silly example yet we hav tech services just twenty four hours ago who had some of their auditors writin g up their sessions immediately after the ssion and the bulk of their audito rs writ ing up all their ssions later some of their auditors came to tech services to ask for pc and some of the audito rs have an ar rangement wher eby the pc was s ent to the session now you see what i mean about non unifo rm flow in other words youve got non uniformity which is so great her that you cant get am funct ion when people are unhatted enti rely you get almost total non unifo rm flows and total non unifo rm flows c an become so gr eat that they practically overwhe lm an or g yet at this time that i spe ak i doubt there are very few or gs which have s taff members which have done s taff hat just the ba sic staff hat see p ractically none of them ar ound its almost an unknown action at this immediate time so you by not having in basic st aff hat or basic div ision hat or basic section hat department hat or section hat if you dont have those thi ngs youl l get nonuniform flow so your production line wont run and w youve got trouble trouble trouble so as far as the gr oup is conce rned it s the non unifo rmity of flow and different system sat work internally which then sort of block it all up and if the individ ual gets acr oss the track of the am members or the department gets acr oss the track of the team member s when it isnt wearing its hat so just r emember there are two types of hats ther the hat of the g roup and the hat of the indiv idual and if you dont have gr oup that is fairly uniformly hatted you re going to run int certain amount of trouble they have to have some kind of group hat now with that you can get tr emendous amount of action out of all of this im try ing to give you the music ou can read all the rules and laws im trying to give you the music that goes along with this thing see its wham bam bong you have to be rig ht on the ball you have to be right on the b all as product officer and as an org officer now one of the way s product officer keeps track of the or g officer is everythin g he passes to the or g officer he s ays date item date item date item date item he c an say mor than that if he want s to now he k eeps record of this he k eeps noteb ook hes got to keep notebo ok of this so that he knows if the stablishment is imp roving now how would he know if the est ablishm ent is impr oving because the tes he gave to the or g officer in the week fr om the first to the venth should be different than the notes he gives to the or g officer between the venth and the fourteenth and if they ar not then the or g office rs being ineffective now theres an immediate chec k of cou rse inst ant chec k on well staticized or g on the p roduc t officer of that org oh it is m arvel ous chec k its the stats now i hope we don t change the method of reporting of our present stats becau they give us in some myst erious way they ar not just volume st ats and they inte rlock in such way that theyr subject to an analy sis of the wh ole rg whereas the product of each department or the f our final valuable p roducts f the rg or something like this if they we re simplystaticized you might not be able to get total pictur so volume stats which do not give you any idea of viability and idea of quality can give you false pictu re the org officerp roduct 7 18171 officer syst em p art ii febctapes 51 011004 for instance we h ad som very very hi gh hou r stats wit hout any comp letions now let show you how an or g officer could change th at pictur its rather fantastic by the way i cant give you the xact to the ho ur and minute i just h ad report on it becau im not sure how far we are into this wee k what is today alr ight during the p revious week stemming bac k from last thursday they had six complet ions at fif ty eight hours each uhf rom thursday til mond ay period after it had been work ed over product officer wise and so fo rth it had imp roved to i think something on the or der of sixteen complet ions at about sixteen hou rs each now what s the quality f the comp letion w ell the policy is fairly well guaranteed becau ther isnt any complet ion permitted to go through the lines that is not an attest and we havent put down succe ss line but in your machine ry if it was put d own also as succe ss line if the success line was well in you wou ld have you r quality chec k now it cou ld be very very misleading this rganization audited four hund red and one hours well you say great w eve got one r ight now weve got an or g which has very high r ising st at of very well done auditin g hou rs and reducing stat almo st in danger on complet ions what they doi ng w ell they could easily be repairing repairs and doin g all sorts of things but i was just showi ng this that the re is s tat change as result of the pr oduct officers interventio n back ed up by an or g officer see that sure changed the hel l out of that di dnt it bong now these thin gs run very fast these things run very fast and you get into the most amazing tangle s and you get into the most wild jung you ever heard of and its enou gh todiscou rage most nybody and fell ow just ought to qu it of cou rse but what wer trying to do what were trying to do of course is bri ng about product and that pr oduct has got to be of good quality and then weve got the factor of viability now what k nocks peoples eyeballs out is viabili ty does not nece ssarily have nythi ng to do with money what coin is the div ision spending an hgc spends n audito rs hour the student hour and the instruct or minute ar the coins being spent by training division now what do they buy with it now if they owe to many her you r backlog they can be ban krupt and lot of orgs right now are runnin g on theyr bankrupt with auditing hours theres lot of orgs right this minute ar bankrupt on auditing hours has nothi ng to do with cash they owe far more auditin g hou rs than they h ave any possibil ity of ivering well whats an xchange money system you owe mo re money than you ve got brother you re bankrupt now lets ok at this in the f orm of econom ics l ets move it r ight out of the fie ld of money and youl l find out that the econom ics of this situ ation open the field of econom ics wide open youve got subject of econ omics openin g up in front of you we havent touched it but economics actually is not the buck that is publ ished in printing press someplace it has to do with viabi lity and ther in inter nal producti on viabi lity the like of which you start studying this thing you become absolute ly am azed for instance how many minutes of the ma as time buys pr oduct of corrected situation now if you add the number of corrected situations that the ma has engaged upon an investigation leading to cor rection and you divide that into the number of work minutes of the ma you have his viabili ty the org officerp roduct 8 18171 officer syst em p art ii febctapes 52 011004 now you tak the number of situations which exist that arent corrected and the verageamount of time it wi ll take to correct them and you may find yourself with bankrupt maa just lik that see now what do you owe and what do you got now an over manned post an over manned post could also be xpressed this way you have thr ee ma as and you have two situations wee k so the number f maa minutes wh ich you are spending to handle the two situations it may be that only two situations xist wee k the pol ice solve this by the w ay very well they just go out and ma ke the situations but we don t go in for that sort of thing but ther we ar so viabil ity to product fficer is what s he got to spend for gods sakes spend it and what can he buy wi th it and dont owe too much of it that he cant supply in ot her words thes are factors that ar invo lved wi th the econ omics of the job and the econom ics of the j ob is what is the coin of this division what is the co in of this section h ow many does it owe how many does it have what is it buyin g with this coi n and so on now oddly enough you ll find all this transl ates dir ectly over int money if your in commer cial society or it wou ld translate dir ectly over into shoe coup ons in commun ist society because the ba sis of money is of course money is an idea backed wit h conf idence or enforced confidence and is ctually representation the basi s of money is egg s and beans it is not gold go ld is comp lete non sequitu r wrong item because when inflation occurs what do they d rop back to when an inf lation occurs they d rop back to barter they dont drop back to go ld so the refore the basis of money is barter and what does an or g have that is barter eggs for hams milk f or shoes wh at does it have to barter with it has minutes pr oducti on minutes d you see so actually the inter nal economics of an or g is what have you got to spend are you spendin g it do you owe more than you could have to spend if you just regard an uditing hour for instance coin if you r egard the pr man s time and s taff timewhat he is buyi ng wit h the number of surveys what they re buyin g with the number of campaigns what they re buying with the number of releases nd so forth against this ignoring totally the amount of ca sh involved you will have the ctual eco logy of the p r department now the pr oduct there might wind up in final p roduct which has value if theyr working on camp aigns to sell something and so fo rth the s ales nd the investment f time and the number of products that it took that much sal gives you the econ omy of the pr man now if you want to reverse all this back to short handedne ss slopp ily you can i said slopp ily you can translate it across to money in each case but its very sloppy pr costs u s six thous and dollars month and that s what it costs u s six thousand do llars month and lets see we had thr ee stories published in the l ocal newspaper and ther efore those stor ies cost two thous and dollars apiece w ell theres some fact in this the res some fact in it but its sloppy sloppy sloppy it doesnt take into account anything about the efficiency or the clever ness or the anything else and so forth now if there was one pr man there and he got three newspaper stories published in month he wou ldnt be do ing to bad providing they we rent just death notices or somethin g you see he woul dnt be doing too bad i f he had page two page thr ee blurbs of some kind or other someb ody som actors pr man wo uld be delir iously happy with this dont you see it might cost quite little bit to do so but maybe it r equired tremendous amount of cleverthe org officerp roduct 9 18171 officer syst em p art ii febctapes 53 011004 ness so quality went int this didnt it so what wa s you r final product it was printed public ity in the ma ss news media r the tv minutes r something like this so you figure these things out you cou ld get quite dizzy doing this you could get quite dizzy doing this until all ofa sudden it become s very real oull find out such thing as the audito r who didn t audit today has just cost you five auditing hours you wi ll never get bac k its decaying coin it isnt anything could be put in the ban k thats five hours that we re never spent so they di dnt buy anything you get this kind of thing and you say w ait minute what the hel ls goin g on here see now you tur n over to the or g office r whats going on there something like that or you gets into som kind of program of action then you can fig ure out the economy of something what is the economy of section department division an or g you can get to tight to this but if you don t follow it through from the valuable final products the valuable final products wel l thats pc s students di fferent types of students course superviso rs money these ar valuable final products of an org valuable final products becau they translate into the society now we re into completely new subject they translate into the society for the wher ewithal to survive valuable f inal pr oduct by defin ition is something that c an be translated into the society for the wher ewithal to survive just by definiti on ther efore you could run an or g in commun ist society so the refore weve jumped up ahe ad of the econ omic patter n which we have been occupyi ng bef ore not that we intend to go into commun ist society but you d have it does tran slate now what do you know w had som people in washingt on and so forth who are trading furniture for auditing and that sort f thing thats b arter barter action but it translate s up into money and becau the fu rniture doesnt then translate into food its not very good deal so staff members c an eat and unless they coul d translate the so it isnt barter economy its cash economy you walked int the safeway with an over stuffed chair and it didnt buy thing it would in russia r ubles snubles who wants rubles wher myshoes man tol d thr ee years ago they had five year plan on shoes and it aint up yet so the refore i got to go two more years with shoes anyho w do you get something of what the pr oduct fficer s working with so hes actually wo rking wi th an economy what is the productio n wh at did the p roduc tion cost these ar the thin gs which he is sking for but he isnt as king f or what did the p roduct ion cost in dollars hes sking for what did the pr oduct ion cost in ter ms of the co in of what wa s produc ing it and what is the coin so pr oduct officer s to recognize the coin and the org officer has to make it valid coin lets h ave an auditing hour oh boy that s general and they re not delive ring any auditin g hou rs to amount to anything becau the pub lic doesnt come in anymo re or something or other and so on how valuable is this coin an auditing hour well bad auditin g hour would be very bad coin someho w or another the or g officer would be required to inc rease the value f the co in an auditin g hou r but the p roduct officer has also got to work on the value f this co in by getting it better applied so the res wher they get their heads tothe org officerp roduct 1 0 18171 officer syst em p art ii febctapes 54 011004 gether because theyr both into it wi th the econ omy ones got it to spend and the othe r is spending it its the pr oduct officer that sa ys wh at this divisio n should be wo rking on in the w ay of its product so the validity of the coin and the value of the coin and so forth can be disturbed by working on something that isnt very valuable as product so just as there are various nuance s and changes in an econom ic system so there is in this product officerorg officer system theyve got all of the econom ic value s theyr right there in the mid dle f the rg we produced grade two r elease today wh atd it cost i can hear it now whatd it cost w ell actually it wa s very to ugh pc and it cost fifteen auditing hoursand seven hou rs in r eview yes thats what it cost whatd we get for it how much ar we sellin g an auditing hour here for today and so fo rth w ell that was how much the value of that thing was and they all f sudden wil l find something amazing if you follow that back that wer on slightly wrong track sell ing auditing hours doesnt pay too valuable ill give you wild economy this is not an orgs economy that we operate on at flag w dont ope rate her neithe r does cl it operates on different econ omy becau its got one more via it s what c an it ma ke the or g make and can it ma ke the or g make enough to affo rd having made the rg ma ke it d you follow now ill tell you somethin g shocking and what is introduces this who thing i can tell you great more about this this is ball the re is the subject of econom ics and you want to work it out you f ool with it in your head and all of sudden you ll say w ell what what what ou know gee whiz god how can we ma ke this place mo re viable how can we ma ke that division more viable w ell you cou ld ma ke the division more viable by actually filing this stuff into the cf fol ders inste ad of lett ing it occupy floor space and then it wou ld have something to spend so you could go on wi th this conside rably along the econ omic l ines dont let detour you too far becaus the b asic thin g is the p roduc t officer gets the product and the or g puts the rg the re that gets the pr oduct and the pr oduct office r is senior to the or g officer why w ell thats bec ause the p roduct of the or g is not the or g but youve got to have an or g in order to get product now the way youd increase the quality the way you inc rease quality is increase the organization and that is ba sic law that isnt just comment you increase the rganization you inc rease the quality of the or ganizati on you inc rease the quality of the co ins the or ganizati on is spending and you will increase the quality of the p roduct so the pcs in the neighb orhoodthat you re auditing ar not feeli ng very well and theyr not happy with their gains and so fo rth how do you inc rease that do you do in and yell at the audito rs some f that wi ll serve ell at the cs you have to sit back nd project this and you wi ll find out theres something wrong with you r organizational assembly line which is another subject entirely different the red be something w rong with this the pcs come in at r ecept ion at the registrar and the r egistrar sets their schedule in auditin g and then having set the schedule in auditing there isnt much theres auditor there at that time anyh ow you have thirty five auditors who are delive ring some of them two and h alf hou rs week and you get the idea your assembly lines just b onkers so ther tech service s so that nobo dy can find the pcs fo lder so he s audited without one this the org officerp roduct 1 1 18171 officer syst em p art ii febctapes 55 011004 just gives you some of the hor ror stories that you might run along we dont know what to run on this pc so wel l run anything that comes to somebodys mind this is ter rible so you increase your organization you inc rease its effectiveness ou may h ave to increase it numerically you certainly refine the st eps and you certainly uniformize the actions one of the first thi ngs to increase the efficiency of an organization that happens is the most obv ious one which is the or g officer simply walk s up to the registrar and sa ys wh at is your hat and the registrar says schedu ling pcs w ell hes hes got it solved ri ght the re the org office rs got it solved right that minute its all solved now lets ta ke the misunderstoods out of this now heres meter and you sit ther and i ll sit here and now what does the wo rd registrar mean you could go at it that cru dely or you coul d go at it that tho roughly or you cou ld do it number of different ways but what you re trying to do is get the registrar to wear the hat of registering and selling pack ages of this and thatnow one of the thin gs th at you run into in your team wo rk of trying to do this is sometimes registrars think theyr selling pie in the s ky bec ause theyr totally unfamil iar with what p roduct there is they sign it up on this end of the line and the internal brief ings of the organization are so s carce and so rare that they don t really know what comes up out of the other end f the l ine particu larly if their resign up line is out so they dont know whats happening and ive had r egistrars thi nk they wer just selling pie in the sk when the pr eclears were just happy as jay bi rds totally out of communication so the registrar feelin g gui lty of an overt every time they sold some uditing ive actually had this happen ctually in two orgs not just one so i put the r egistrar back on an inf ormation line of the s ucces s story line and that looked very practical like the r egistrar is sitting there with packet of succe ss stories well they sa well i can read thes to the pc or som ething like that someb ody wrote them and so f orth but she obv iously is not member of the team in other words you havent got team ope rating now that was true right here we had some public divisi on peo ple wh did not know actually and we were actu ally produc ing some miracles at low level here in qual we wer actually produc ing some absolute racle s people had come down from here and ther and we we re auditing them up and all of sudden they didnt have to have their epizud icks cut out and so fo rth and they never got in on it and they did nt get in on it to the point wher they never mentioned it to anybody here you woul d think you r promot ion people actually didnt know what pr oduct you had so they of cou rse wer not very enthusia stic about pushing the p roduc t becau they didnt know what the p roduct is so an ssential in any team is brief ing the people have to know what the hel ls goin g on thats all and the pr oduct office r if he had pr he woul d have sort of cheerleaderwho kept everyb ody informed as to what w as go ing on and youd get the p r funct ion of interpreting the policies of manage ment and so forth being used as briefing staff and so on so youd get an or g mag azine and so forth well usually this f alls off to total banality its the quality of difficulties your having with products whic h wou ld deter mine that because your pub lic involved of course is your staff and theres too little briefing peop are too poorly informed when you have staff meeting why peop nya nya they want to know the org officerp roduct 1 2 18171 officer syst em p art ii febctapes 56 011004 about the new water st and thats go ing to be put in in the hall or something that isnt what they re for itd be to keep them informed as team so essential fi rst last nd always it is team now ho w does an or g become team alright well ill tell you that very rapidly the deputy secretary is the org officer the secr etary of the div ision is the pr oduct officer the re is an or g officer and the re is product office r for every division and then ther an or g officer and product officer for the org so the org officer has all the product hes got all f the number one org officers under him as conference and the p roduct officer has got all of the pr oduct officers under him as conference there are two confe rences the p roduc t confe rence senior to the or g conference so the p roduct confe rence lay s it out this is wh at wer going to do and this is ho w were going to get the products nd so forth and they wri up the projects and p roducts and plan everyth ing ou t as to what theyr goin g to do in order to get this thing out and then they make sur that they k eep that machine runn ing that way and the or g officer with your org officer confe rence theyve go t certain deadline and theyr com ing up to the planning f the next fifteen day s and so forth of operati on and thats the rg actions which wer goin g to have to take because weve got in front of us the product ference the product ferencehas decided this is what they re going to have so ther efore wer going to have to put in this action here in order to back this up now those pr ojects wou ld be immediat which are done verbal maybe with note in notebo ok maybe on scr ap of paper but it d be hot li ne then they would be medium range and then they would be lon g range and then they woul d be very long range now that makes team when you get fair sized or g thats the am youre working with the red be an executive director and or g officer product officer the deputy secretaries would make up the confe rence or organizati on handli ng products one and th ree and the product officers which of the cretaries woul d be handlin g the products which they have to push out they would find all sorts f things but thei r team work wo uld involve by deadline and team wo rk is stablished by time deadline within some reasonable facet so that you r org is alway s working on you r immediate medium long and very long range very few or gs even work on medium range its usually immediat well you want to get out of immediate if you possibly can that s what makes it am now natural ly you r product confe rence s to occur befo re you r org conference has to occur and it isnt question of whether or not the p roduc t confe rence can or der ando r the org ference can r ebut and it isnt democratic problem at all its the p roduc t confe rence orders the or g confe rence and the org confer ence tries to cope with the thi ngs that they c ant move ahead with with their project so it takes double project situation now in you r targets in your target series its the or g confer ence woul d be handli ng the primaries primary targets so the p roduct confe rence cou ld wr ite something up that they wanted in that division and the rg officer of that division wou ld have to write the pr imaries for it but the primaries can appe ar actually as on separate issue the org officerp roduct 1 3 18171 officer syst em p art iifebctapes 57 011004 now what deter mines all of this it w ould be deter mined by the plannin g officer the plannin g officer should then be ter rifically well informed you cant have n executive di rector or an xecutive di rector serving as product fficer sitting in an ivo ry towe r now produc t officers best fr iends ar his feet it s just run run run run here there so on up down back and fo rth i can k eep th ree ssenger s four messengers busy ar ound the cl ock when im runni ng along this particu lar line and so on and then i mys elf pulling back off this line and getting more service and mo re commun ication lines hav not done as much mov ing about as i might have but when i started to become product officer i found ou t i was runn ing my messengers to death and i was running too so its bas ed on the reality of the situation and if the d ata isnt comi ng in to you why you do nt have it now the data is stat the data is stat that is the data thats the data youve go t to have its stat im repeating that sever times becau its really really honest to god it is pathetic how people will fall for what we coul d call laughin gly we shouldn t use the wor d in this becau weve got ten the thin g dign ified up just pr its am azing its amazing its he artbreaking actually to trace back the r eports you erroneously operated on becau you get int wr ong why and you all of sudden hav removed gertru when her st ats wer out the r oof do you see and youve promoted gus and the ne xt guy onto the post finds ou t ther werent any files ther that he wa s raising rats do you see and what tells you is st ats but stats must be r eal stats must be actual stats do not alway s represent quality and they do not also represent viabi lity for instance you hear an auditor say why i had fif tyfive hours or something last month or something like this now we put quality on it when we said fn vgis at the xaminer that deter mined the quality of hisauditin g it doesnt alway s deter mine the quality of his uditing becau the auditor can end the ssion and the pcs so r elieved he gets fn vgis at the examiner but it does straighten up and it does k eep the l ine and all of sudden auditors had to start produc ing and better tech started comin g out of the ssembly line when that wa s the criterion now the number of lost hours you get ar also imp ortant and if you dont see those on stat they cou ld ove rwhelm you so you have to know ho w many audito rs are auditing for the stat to be real see it could totally overwhelm those well done auditin g hou rs i mean so they got fi fty wel l done auditing hours that week w ell thats gr eat great ther were five hund red and twenty five expended what kind of fiel d are you going to have very shortly so you r stat has to be real stat ou have to know what this st at is you have to be familiar with stat ou have to know the tricks of stat it isnt that you see an up stat nd you say w ell it wasnt go od quality so you cant have the stat thats your fault fo r not having good stat ther that also represented the quality alright now how much c an organization improve things were very long way f rom being perfect at this stage of the ga very very long way yet we are vested in great deal of information technical data trainin g expertise and so fo rth and we certainly have techno logy that h asnt seen the light of day befor so weve got all the to ols in the wo rld all we have to do is know those too ls and get those to ols applied all organiz ation has value to the degree that it brings about producti on an organization tends to get into trouble i dont care what or ganizatio n it is if it doesnt have pr oduct if it doesnt have pr oducti on you can sa all you want to about well there was so on so the org officerp roduct 1 4 18171 officer syst em p art ii febctapes 58 011004 on so on actually there was one or ganiz ation which ru led the planet which had the trickiestvaluable final product that ever existed marvelous marvelous valuable final product cau nobody could count it nob ody could count its stat and nob ody cou ld count the valuable final product nob ody could count the s tat in either heaven or hell the valuable final product of the christian chu rch obviously was souls gone to heaven marv elous marvelous rganization so you dont even have to be very g ood to succeed di d i sudden ly give you some margin ou dont even have to be very go od to succe ed now when you actually add it up to whe re you really have pr oduct and when you really got the laws nd rules of organization that put the thing there and then you ve got team and then youve got product system and youve got your product org officer combinati on as it runs it up the l ine and you know the ins and outs and ramificati ons of this sort of thing go d help the planet thank you ok don t be fooled by the clock its four oclock in the mo rning than k you ou bet cha how to post an org 7101 c23 s feb c 5 23 january 197 1 hello hello in view of the fact that the lectu res the other day we re popular we decided we w ould repeat the perf ormance just fo r you r special benefit its the twenty third of january ad 21 febc flag now the r eason why i want to talk to you however is not just to see your pleas ant smiling face s which i am always h appy to see but becaus having clear ed up this thin g called product office r we are as you would suppose up against the ne xt barricade now the pr oduct office rs first product is an or g officer the or g officers first pr oduct is an hco as the hco ar ea secretarys f irst pr oduct is an hco and the first pr oduct of the hco is the tablishment imagine my hor ror during the st seventy two hours to fi nd i was dealing with people who di dnt know what an stablishment wa s horror and i think its becau peop get their attention stuc k on bodiesnow many years go we used to have some dri lls which were extremely inter esting which was pat you r body and feel your body and look at you r body and ok ar ound the room and look at you r body you know that sort of thing i think you ll have to run it because all i find out an stablishment consists of is some bo dies that of course would make mortuary the ideal establishment now this is so gr oss that i think actu ally its one of those points that has to be clear ed on an or g office r becaus until some f these points were clear ed we did not find operatio n by the or g officer effective at all and when thes we alr eady have little ca histo ry on that when this po int was cle ared and why then it started to work ou t very well so weve had positive and negative run on this and the positive run in the flag bureau w as go od and the run actu ally that s occu rred in the tech division fao just now was not go od by long way but what happened wa s we wer lett ing the flag bureau clarification of these po ints go along to see if they work ed out and since that time why they hav worked out and it has not been clear ed up in the f ao or the thats the flag admin org or the f ao divisi on four thats the tech div ision has not been cle ared up in that sector and it is running you w ouldnt believe it so ther efore what im talking to you about is of very gr eat importance it is not slight and the reason i called this lectu re so suddenly was s i say not to look at your bright and smiling face s but to give you som information wh ich you cannot live with out if you try to use this pr oduct org officer sy stem wit hout this dat youre going to come cropper as an executive di rector co or product officer or an or g officer or an hco sec or an hco and not know why it all isnt workin g somehow but it is something on the order f the audit or has for gotten to tur n on his emeter i mean its grossness but it appahow to post an org 2 23171 febctapes 60 011004rently is something that need s pointi ng out it is something that needs clearing and it is som ethin g that needs dril ling now the pr oduct office r can get fused enough in tryi ng to differentiate between his job and his rg officers job because of course he s legi on of problems and so on which are bouncing up along his lines he will find himself however runn ing on short term co pe per products and his p roducts wi ll get worse and he will have more and mo re trouble and hell get very exhausted and hell eventu ally say this sy stem doesnt work somehow and its too exhausting and its too horrible and he w ont be able to sleep at night and wil l be found p rowling the str eets or sitting in park s with his head in his hands with over loads and arc breaks which cant be audited because hes too exhau sted the product fficer flag bu reau and i had t alk about this when we saw in the wee small hours of the morning when we saw that ther was something wrong with this line up and we discus sed it and kic ked it back and for th and used the practical experience s and applicati ons which we had alr eady had with regard to it and we finally isolated it and this is appar ently it and you see we f ound the why and now when we applied the why did it all work out and the an swer is yes so im giving you valid tested result now this why cant be just brushed off as an or g officers ign orance of organization or something of this sort th is is shame blam regret on the or g officers side of it it is just what d oes the or g office r have to know and what does he have to do because you see he cou ld know hundr ed million details and he ctually doesnt have to the way we wer clari fying this or iginally is the or g officer was the cheerleader oh that shif ted your gears in hell of hurry didnt it yeah well the or g consists of bodies and hats yeah l ets tak ok at this he s cheerleader now in ou r orgs particularly we ar taking car of the problems of the world wellwho takes car of ou r peo ple the rg officer when theyr over loaded nd sick and caved in and need somebody to hold their hand s who is it its the rg officer naturally when they re under paid and over work ed who handles it its the org officer naturally but to do this kind of thing the or g officer s to have it isnt that hes just chaplain far from it but that is one of the things hed have to do and that wa s the original lit tle seethrough we all of sudden s aw th rough in discu ssing it this po int of wher the org officer might fail the org office r in communicati on cont inuously with the pr oduct office r can he wou ld go right ahe ad and pick up the spe ed of trying to get it organized in order to keep up with the product officer that is for sure and he actu ally should sort f run along ahead w ere going to increase the load on this div ision producti on is going up wel l the org officer should be in ahead of that it s like your heavy traff ic war ning the first one to pick that up would be the org officer not the product fficer that wou ld be after the fact so if the or g officer does not pick this up in the first place ahead of the product officer you will get sequence of booms and depr essions whic h will consi st of this over load lines break somehow or other put it together somehow and over load lines b reak put it togethe r and so on becau the res ru that every time loads increase why those points of your organizati on wh ich ar wea k blow up and weve been observin g that her for long time how to post an org 3 23171 febctapes 61 011004 so the or g officer is ther to do product three wh ich is the co rrection of the est ablishm ent preferably befor the fact and certainly swiftly after the fact and the orgs or g officer is ther for that purp ose and the org officer of the divisi on is the re for that purp ose and hes product three man ou sa yeah well what do you an product three there are four products one product one establishment establishing the est ablishmentproduct two is the pr oduct of the stablishment it s what does the establishm ent produce product three is the cor rectio n of the est ablishment itself and pr oduct four is the cor rection of the p roduct now these ar just arbitrary fi gures and you could figure it all out backw ards and actu ally should do your org boar d backw ards you coul d rename all of thes things but these ar numbers and so on but just r ecogn ize what they are they ar simply the sequential numbers mo re or less in or der f writing the bul letin i mean ther isnt any p articular reason f or those numbers see you could say w ell theyr one and two and thr ee and four and so on so ther is point actually in discus sing the chick and the egg problem wh at come s first the tablishment r the product what comes first w ell what came first the chic ken or the egg it s pretty obvi ous pr etty obvi ous that the egg came first didnt it well the egg would have to come first becau ot herwise ther woul d have been sing sequ ence that ar rived at the chic ken so we have solved that old ancient problem just l ook over your data s eries perfect ly true ther woul d have been omitted omitted points of sequence and an altered sequence f events if the chicken came first so its quite obvious so actu ally probably the pr oduct however does come first fell ow goes out and he gets some leather and he br ings the leather in and gets an old kitchen knife and so on he cuts himself pair of sandals and somebody else w ants some sa ndals so he scr ounges som more leather and he cuts that up and eventually why ma king money f rom making sandals he is able to purchase better knife and he can lay in more raw m aterials but that better knife is when he starts into establishment and then he gets an awl and hes got more est ablishment hasnt he and he himself is gaining mo re expertise in how to do this so of cou rse that is more est ablishm ent and gradually out of the pr oduct arrives the establishm ent and the funnypart of it is this is perfect ly true you coul d probably take hund red thousand do llars establish an org in new ork city and it d promptly fail weve done it you wo nder why we alway s insist that an org ma ke its own way and every once in while we get weve on ly had couple of these in recent years somebo dy puts in proposal that flag pay th ree thousand dollars wee k to support this or g while it got on its feet and weve had couple like this and believe if you want to run something backwar ds do that thats all g reat now of course big factories do this all the time and they don t own themselve s anymor they re all owned by the ban k i won der ho w they l ost the who lousy lot w ell they just di d it backwar ds that s all and mr henry f ord starts with the bicyc factory and winds up with the f ord motor company which winds up with lot of subsidiaries so that the ford motor company at ny time might establish s ubsidiary with the cash it has at hand and it goes on and manufactur things and i notice though as time goes on the mo re the reserves ar taken out of the f ord motor company to establish subsidiary to do this that or the ot her thin g why the s the stockhol ders get and the less belong to mr ford he isnt even ther anymo re how to post an org 4 23171 febctapes 62 011004 the point im making is is the re is point at which the flow can be reversed so therefore you could say that p roduct one is r eally the p roduc t you see ther would be good reason f or reversing this numbering the p roduc t the establishment and so on however it is as it is number one is the est ablishment as product number two is the p roduc t of the est ablishment if you want to w ork all this out why just ok at generator or something like that for whi and it ll all evolve and then f cou rse you have to co rrect the est ablishment and then you have to co rrect the pr oduct its ea sier to tak it odd numbers org officer and even numbers product of ficerso what comes first the chick or the egg the egg came first and alway s will come first and its economical ly unsound not to have it fi rst the egg as first in other words two is alway s primary and senior but its pr operly number ed after all becau to get anything you have to work bac kwar ds you actu ally do you have to figure it all out backwar ds so that number ing sy stem p resses this point home if you want to work out an organization take its product and then wo rk backwar ds nd you wi ll wind up with the or g board and if you take the rg board and write it up if you havent g ot any pr oduct and you arent going to have any product and you didnt have any product and you arent go ing to have any pr oduct and that is all you got an org board you got bad heavy payr oll you got this and that org after org after org is sittin g out there and because we hav delive red an org boar d theyve put up this org board but if they h ad to really wo rk it out they would figure out what their product was and wo rk backwar ds to their org boar d we can give them the org board that they shoul d wind up with but it is posted bac kwar ds an rg boar d is alway s posted backwar ds it is not posted in such way s we put name on post ther post so we put somebody on it the res post so we put som ebody on it so theres post so we put somebody on it that is not how and is actually pointed out in your oec as an absolutely fatal way to go about it and you d wind up probably with gover nment that gover ned nob ody and nothing so what do you what do you actu ally do to put together an or g boar d even when you have one handed you you post the personnel who get the p roduct and if your organizi ng an or g you would put on these post s alrig ht why see now let give you the valuable p roducts the ba sic valuable products of an or g are audito rs pr eclears and money and they re the final valuable products that ar the obvious ones the re are some additi onal ones but thes certain ly are the obvious ones so ther eforeyou work it bac kwar ds you don t post an hco oes oes pes in three man or g who dont also wo rk somebo dy cou ld ho ld these posts but itd have to be posted backw ards youd have to put on an uditor or auditors to ma ke the pr eclears youd have to put on the course superviso rs to make the audit ors and then you d have to put on somebody to get the peop to collect the money now if we went at this very straightf orwar dly wed f ind in what ive just told you theres slight altered sequence of events so ill just show you how neat this is you would of course put on course s uperv isor and youd put on somebody even if it was the cou rse s uperviso r to get some student s to pay to be trained that gives you the money and then youd put on some audito rs who had been so trained in order to process pcs who are procured and how to post an org 5 23171 febctapes 63 011004 that gives you some money and then you train mo re audito rs and you get some money and youve now got auditors who can pr ocess mo re pcs which gives you some money and so you can buy br oader p romotion in order to mo re broadly bring peop in to be trained so you about this time youve got to have somebody hot on the pr omot ion line you get how we re postin g this thin g now and one of the little secrets of org failu res is is they d ont post the course superviso r first hes posted as an afterthou ght and they don t bother to deliver the course because it isnt primary posted action and so of course they dont get any audito rs who can udit so the re when they bring in pcs they dont get audited and then peo ple do nt pay money for service on course and service from the audito r so of cou rse you run out of money and it goes bac kwar ds becau it wasnt p osted backwar ds posted backw ards now when we sa somebody to train course we want course supervisor not somebody that once heard of something when we audit people we want n audito r what is anaudito r an audito r is somebody who attains flub less results right now about fifty percent of the field auditors maybe not that great percentage w havent done survey but it seems like that with cases coming back why the walls do wn ther in flag qual would be char red absolute ly char red were going at level of certainty which does not say well of course the reason why the ssion or the pc bla bla r easonable you know it explains ea sily i mean m arried lon g time ago and probably is still pts to som ebody in neros time ou know so of course you say ther thing you can do about it and so on and the reason that the ch ain didnt fn at the xamine r is it didnt fn at the audit ors end because it narrative or something but that doesnt have anything to do with it becau body knows what n arrative som atic is and so now let us go over this ag ain if you want an or g you would post it backwar ds you wo uld post course supervisor not somebo dy to not be ther now he woul d have to have the mat erials wouldn t he and then when we gild the lily here wed have to have somebo dy count ing the nose s of students s they wal ked in and out of the doo r and have folde rs for them and so forth so wed have to have some administrative check on all of this to find out of they wer coming to clas s at all so we would build it up from product to org office r now the pr oduct comes first but to get the pr oduct you have to have organization so were bac k the other way ar ound again chick came fi rst if you were to crash in s pace ship on god awful desolate planet and you were faced with having to build the entir civilization you woul d probably have to start with sharp rock right and f rom that over considerable period of time why you wou ld eventually get the met that bubbles out of the stone s that ar park ed around the fi re and have copper now those ar the long span s but even though you might look at this prospect and sigh and even though you might have done thisthere is reason why it cannot be done providing you st art with sharp rock in other words ther is som place to start now when you get to product org officer line you get this on you r bing bin g now somebodys got to get some potent ial student s who want to be trained who will pay for the traini ng but the moment that that action starts the org officer anticipating traffic flow has ought to have procured at that moment course s uperv isor and the materials th at the s tudents will be taught and the tape r ecorders and the tape s and the fol der supplies and the room with roof over it so the students dont get rained on and the chairs and the tables and the how to post an org 6 23171 febctapes 64 011004 clock nd the s chedule hey you say whats this pr oduct office r doing all this time well if the or g office rs that over burdened hes putt ing in product one isnt he hes putting in product one all that time so hed better unl oad pr oduct one becau hel l find it very rapid ly in over burden so he f orms his first embry onic action of an hco even if he just does it by div iding his hat p roduct one bel ongs to hco it belon gs to the org officers product hco as so whats the or g officer d w ell he got rid of it see he got rid of it and som ebodys putting the establishment ther well yeah but youd say t reasury actually buys this stuff and other thi ngs and the bo okstore orders this stuff and its all ordered up and down the rg and you havent got any or g product one the establishm ent of the establishm ent belongs to hco yeah but the or g officer got rid of that didnt he he g ot somebody there to put in the est ablishment nd so on so whats he do hes even got to get registrar and som ebody the re to pull the student s in and put this thing togethe r and so fo rth but that s you know that s hco isnt it so thats immediately at hco so its so whats this or g officer d w ell product one product one is his responsib ility buthaving taken that responsibil ity he pas ses it over to somebo dy so whats that leav him with it leav him with p roduc t three the cor rection of the est ablishment it leave s him with when the chairs do nt ar rive he gets some ther he calls the local funeral parlor and has them rents some right away brezzo zoom boom meanwhi tell ing his establishment of ficer hco you get some chairs buy some chairs so he doesnt have anybody to operate s course administrator becau if nobo dy wander ed in and it wasnt established and so fo rth that s three then isnt it so he s friend of his or somebody thats st anding ar ound wi th his mouth open and so for th suddenly finds hims elf kidnapped and on that post and ther dreadful row about this bec ause the persons actually the director of disbu rsement if hes di rector of disbursement what the hell was he doing standing there go od question and that s the or g officers rebuttal the assignment of the course administrator the hi ring of somebo dy the putt ing of somebody there under f cou rse the pr essure of the or gs org officer is of course the hco job how do we actu ally get he re ther are som other areas th at have something to do with this est ablishm ent ther is the state bur eau ah well hel l we dont have any state bureau yet we havent even glued up an or g boar d so it must be belong to what we call hco hco generat the number one establishment what s it consist of it consists of the stablishment but what is an establishm ent and right away we start to get into the ba sis of our deepest misunderstoo d you ask almost anybody what n org consi sts of hell say w ell it consists of som

23171 febctapes 65 011004 packs they re certainly not going to be pr otected f rom the we ather theres got to be some safeguar ded or protected space ther its go t to have r oof over it its got to have doors and windows and fl oors and that contains what now i cou ld go on and rattle of f list her of what but i can give you certainly the basics it consist s of the tables the chairs the des ks supplies the paper cl ips the st aplers the comm baskets the labels the machinery the typewrite rs the address m achines the cf file cabinets the cf fo lders the tent of the cf fo lders fi led in them it woul d consist f hats and it wou ld consi st of packs and tape r ecorders and it woul d consist f its various comme rcial contacts that set it up and it wo uld consist of you get the idea ou start oking around all of sudden you r eyes will open the attention of anybody youre trying to break in as an or g officer will come ff of this thing called body thats the establishm ent now you sa here well yeah of course this is this is s hip naturally and of course thats under the ship or g oh yeah its under what of the ship org ther must be somebody over there est ablishing ship s this is all very inte resting now thats when you get very sophisticated indeed up to the time that its all out its all up to hco somebody walks into hco and says wher the packs see yeah but you only got one person see ou say w ell you re div ision two today too that finishes that then you got tw hat s wh eres the pac ks yes well you see and we w rote letter and at that moment the rg officer says god damn it to hell now he deletes that becau you must be nice remember your pr dispatch is not product and it never willbe and it never wi ll get us nythin g and it is not anything that ever establishes anything it is not doingness it is gestur and the first guy that says well i wrote i sent disp atch to hco ill tell you an xact situation personnel who is facing internally here you see we have n internale xternal situation and that applies to clos the res internalexternal our org officer actually is operating little more broadly in clo to establish the stablishment unless your clos hco is competent to keep it established because the org officer is operating internally but the pr oduct officer in clo or on the flag bureau is operating xternally its slight ly different situation than you ll find in an org becaus in an org directly or in the fao here both the or g and product fficer are operatin g mo re or less internally thei r attention is inter nal now its very funny when you have personne l whose attention is external to the or g and inter nal to the or g simultaneously he tends to go bo nkers w eve already analyzed this and weve had lot of experience with this the guy whose attention is out there and in ther the guardians office for instance at this moment that i spe ak s heroically acceded to ou r pleas so that we coul d teach an feb c and hold the for t in all over the world and its much broader than you imagine has loaded onto itself gr eat many inter nal concer ns its so tryin g to hold the fo rt externally well they cant d that very l ong thats why you are getting pressure here becaus the gu ardians office will probably be hold ing the rg or the c out there will be ho lding the rg until trained personnel get bac k to that org and its not much mentio ned to students because it wou ld harass them and put them under worry and stress so im tell ing you speed up how to post an org 8 23171 febctapes 66 011004 actually the guar dians office at this xact moment all over the wor ld is holding itsbreath waiting for the feb cs to come back becau they re hol ding internal actions now they re an xternal group it wasnt the guar dians off ice in this instance but im just tell ing you the dif ference betwe external and internal the ir attentio n is out into the public their tech is wi th the ar c broken pc out there in the publ ic not in the or g so the person i was speaking to had per mitted who is an xternal personnel i found was holding several internal hats and i said would you what action have you ta ken to fill the vacant post and she said unfo rtunately i have r epeatedly wr itten dispatch to hco thats what that char red mark is right there my r eply well get the st ewar ds to polish it out and my or der to her wa s you go do wn to the personnel files and you look thr ough these personnel files unt il you fin d somebody who is suitable who is not ho lding k ey post and you ta ke that person and put that person on that post and the reason i did this is im talking to key personne l whose product is too valuable to be monk eyed with and who was per mitting herself to have n internal attention actually probably gr eat deal f percentage of her time wa s being occup ied internally now in the that s not the guar dians of fice but in the guar dians office matter and so on why the m ary sue is saying where are the feb cs where are the feb cs where are they they re perfectly willing to handle this sort of situation but youve g ot po licy knowledge and other actions of one kind r another in the guardians office at this moment holding posts of temporary xecutive director usgo is holdi ng post his commun icator is holding post in dc or was til very short time ago and so on and they re spr ead thin they re cont rolling all of africa righ t now and actu ally were telexing for help here within the last wee k or so so this is an xternalinter nal str ain so you got to figure out which is you r external and which is your inter nal personnel so you do have xternal personnel whos you r registrarnow your registrar is working for people to come in and tak that course so that they can become audito rs ri ght so shes got time to monk ey around with how the fi ar or are not straight you want to cut your income to pieces t ake an xternal facing personnel and give them inter nal distractions now that goes br oader than that ou want to cut your products to pieces t ake an or g officer who isnt anticipating or running befo re the product fficer with load lines becau your product officer will have his attenti on yan ked over onto the subject f organization now just s ther externalinternal there is the rganization of things and the p roduct ion of things the pr oduct ion of things is of course totally dependent up on the clear cut organization of thi ngs but the funny part of it is you can pr oduce without clear cut or ganizatio n and one of the w ays of stalling who org is to go int one hund red percent organize you go into hundr ed percent organize youl l chok it down every time you organize while you produce is the pr oper sequence and you p roduce while you organize is actu ally much closer to the truth now when you look over this team of the pr oduct officerorg office r you find out that the rg officer has to have fanta stically clear idea and so does an hco as have to have fanta stically clear idea of exactly what n establishment consist s of now this idea that im how to post an org 9 23171 febctapes 67 011004 talking about is just lik this what does it consist of w ell it consist s of buil ding or rooms or auditing rooms f des ks of typewrite rs of supplies of personnel of hats or hatting actions and so on the whole thing the who bang shoot and i f they do nt have total gri p on what is an stablishment the rg officer will not be able to back up the p roduc t officer becau he wi ll never detect decline he wont see it as departur from the xisting scene it isnt neces sarily staticized you know the roof falls in the res stat for the roof fallingin but it is departur from the ideal scene i assure you so ther efore the fi rst requisite of an org officer is not nece ssarily verbatim knowledge of the oec but the defin ition and the xtent f and everythin g that there is in this thing called an est ablishm ent and t only that but what is ev eryth ing in this particu lar est ablishm ent just like that now comes his knowledge of the oec bec ause that tells him how it ought to go together and how it ought to run now along wi th that is appar ently you cannot ever have sen sible hir ing or personnel postin g in an organization unles s there is list of all f the sential hats and duties of those hats in the organization which is just mini list its t even mini list its an inst ant hat list what do thes people on these post s do one in personnel can funct ion at all in personnel unles s he has such list and where does one exist r ight now the re is such list not even in the most sophisticated personne l offices anyplac what is this j ob w ell very often youll get some big corporati on and it ll have some personnel thing and so on but you wont find that list theyll say get s hop foreman so they l ook ar ound to find somebody wh has been shop f oreman now why do they do that nonsen its actu ally becau they couldnt for the life of them defi ne what ar the dut ies of shop f oreman now it migh t only take three sentences to lay out what the duties f shop foreman ar but you wont find anybody posting personnel at all sen sibly or hiring sensibly unles s they have pr etty good idea of exactly what ach post does just in the st twenty four hou rs ive run into it aboard here you woul dnt believe it i just tried to do posting to fill in suddenly somebody had class ten as requisite to somebody to file folders and to hand them out to people when the name w as on the list you wont bel ieve that im not being cr itical f this becaus were just forming up what the hell do you want class ten for well you see the duties of that post you find the post the rethe dut ies of that post are and so fo rth will host the cs ference with the audito rs hosts what ference w ell the css confer ence you see with the audito rs is held by the d of p whose ference the css confer ence with the auditors is held by the d of p he got the po int now once upo n time the d of p had as part of his hat csing well we have cs and i would like to see cla ss ten d f p who was not acquainted with the cs line of the various cases trying to hold confer ence with the uditors auditin g those pcs that w ould really be clo wn perf ormance it woul dnt matter ho w much tech this fell ow would know he is not the cs so the only person who could hold cs confe rence r css conference w ould of course be the cs but we wer ent tryin g to post cs we had cs w were trying to post d of p who wou ld ma ke up the programming f the audit ors and the pcs lists to hand to tech services and to interv iew some of the peop who were being audited who very ften have how to post an org 10 23171 febctapes 68 011004 questions and walk ar ound in mystery as to why that s being done theres nobo dy cs right w can sa litt side note contact this guy you can have the xaminer sa what did the auditor do but you cant say contact this guy and clarif what his p rogram is what his auditing program is it takes the my stery out f it well thats what you have to do on public lines and becau we re not handling actually public lines why that functi on had d ropped out but it still leav whole bunch of little mysteries when am i ever going to get udited wh at run do wn am i on ou see guy goes int session with his jaw dr opped wher hes audited with the mystery rud out you get the idea w ell thats just becau ther d of p post well theres trick to it now if confident ial mat erials were at question that would be something else but the confidential materials we re not at question the person selected wa s of the clas s neces sary tohandle fident ial mat erials also wa s trained auditor ther were two such people available idle with noth ing whatsoever to do in that very department not auditin g not anything either one f them qui cap able of perfor ming this duty but somebody had to have cla ss ten audit or to perf orm this duty i woul dnt know why ano ther duty is to hand the list to tech page and get the folde rs together tech service s see hand the list to the tech page so that he can do this list and get the fol ders of these pcs together and give them to the other this post coul dnt be filled i think bec ause the person was slow or something by reputation thats nonsens now the situ ation arose by overl oad these ar actu org product officer situations the situation ar ose by overl oad the traff ic line went way up in vo lume the stat w as go ing way up in volume the p redict would be that thes lines will break and they b roke the product officer of that division became i ll the tech service s chief of that division over loaded and with insuffic ient help went to bed with temper ature of hundr ed leaving the post empty but my effo rt to fill the post on high express ction seventy two hours after the fi rst or der that the post must be bolster ed up fa st was being done on dispatch lines during that entir period dispatch lines what the hell i suppose the world has lost feet becau its an automot ive age and when the person was put on the post somebo dy in hco develo ped pol icy that any pcs m ail incoming should be opened and r ead in ca it might enturbu late the pc and the person put on the post which was supposed to hand out the folders and the l ist wa s open ing and censori ng student mail in the tech division which is totally comp letely ff hat and il legal t that moment ther were loud xplosions all the way along the line the person put on the other post wa s doing the tech s ervices j ob becaus there wasnt anybody the re to do it in other words it s scrambled up in mes s now this is the consequence of not predict ing traff ic flow in an organization whichis just f orming now when you have an or ganizati on just forming the many outnes ses which are presented to you can completely confuse an or g officer and at that time as at othe r time must the or g office r adher to product three correction of the establishm ent and leave the est ablishment to someone to get that one get p roduct one and in fast run ning organization the to tal duty the total duty of an org officer is ar resting decl ine product three halting decline or threaten ed decline how to post an org 11 23171 febctapes 69 011004 so actu ally it works this wa when the pr oduct officer finds himself correctin g the establishm ents p roduct which is fou r this p asses t once to three who may h ave it in hand already that makes an org office r somebody with crystal ball doesnt it il l tell you just in moment ho w he doesnt have to run it with cryst ball but its almost cryst ball job by the time the p roduc t officer says the students coming off the line all seem to be limpin g in their left foot you know and they when i talk to them and sk them why they dont go write s ucces s story why they sort of look down at their feet and limp off and i think you ought to go in and what materials they ar being taught by whom becau ive got som inklin g of this becau i saw some xtbooks on yogi lying around the classroom now if that team is r eally function ing now of course im giving it to you ridiculous pitch as well as exposing some of our shame s her well believe its being straightened ou t and things will get s traightened out here much more fast as it straightens out they can go wronger and get straightened out faster than anything you ever saw in you r life but the or g officer hats wo rking on product three correction of establishm ent if he was very good wou ld be able to sa to the p roduc t officer yes i spotted that yester day we have immediately somebody coming in here from san franci sco that used to be in the org and so on hes ta king over as course supervisor and as matter of fact the commev salready been convened on the course administrator for crossing practices and if you walk into clas s at this moment you wi ll find one of the hgc audito rs who is an hdg at two oclock to ok over the cla ss thatd be very lucky product fficer wouldnt it see r eally on the ball little bit ahe ad of little bit ahe ad of is what is what the or g office r thats wher the rg officer belon gs anticipatin g the traff ic flows anticipatin g their sags anticipating this sort of thing by reason of the actions of the pr oduct officer so the product officer has to keep the rg officer pretty well informed as to what wa s going on therefore the p roduc t officer is alway s ma king notes anyth ing he runs into and af ter hes h andled kerfluff he alway s writes it up matter ho w briefly he m akes notes of this k erfluff and he pa sses the thing over and he usu ally ind icate s the rganizational action now i dont know if im clarif ying it for you to any great degr ee becau you may not believe its just that you may not believe the impo rtant poi nt that im trying to put acr oss you may believe you have if your operating as an xecutive di rector product office r you may h ave you may think you have somebody its not hard its not possible for you to believe comp letely probably becau it assaults your common sense and thats what you want to watch b oy common sense to you may ppear l ike comp lete screaming genius to somebody else it breaks down on the inabil ity of the or g officer to define l ocate and est ablish everyth ing in the tablishment includi ng the duties of every hat in the establishm ent and if youre going around in circles as to why you cant ope rate or why your product officer cant operate that is the first thought so you clear it you can actually clear it in terms of reach and withdraw from typewriters and r each and wit hdraw f rom staff members now wer not talking in theor etical li ne now becau when we h ad this conversation that clarified this poi nt and it gave us win onthe thi ng this is im not being do wn on org officers at all i mean this is this is the truth of the thi ng and this was what wa s fouling up the line how to post an org 12 23171 febctapes 70 011004 alright we get in the p roduct officers duties the pr oduct office r has to be able to recognize his p roduct pang that hes try ing to get he has to recogn ize that it is product product of the tablishment he has to be able to recogn ize that and he s to be able to get that thing out thats what he s working on he has to want that product the two mon itoring laws is is he s to recognize and he has to want it and the ction is that he s to get it doesnt even s ay how actually he has to know more about the organization than the or g office r really but wher you wi ll get break down wi ll just be on this other thing thats its other point this other point its just failu re actually to embrace what is this thing called an est ablishm ent becau if the est ablishm ent itself is not embraced then ideal scene could possibly be conce ived of and ther efore the or gs or g officer w ould not be able to spot departur from the ideal scen so as to arrest its decline and hes just in the first busines s of arresting declines and passing along back to the person wh are respo nsible f or the est ablishment itself and est ablishin g the est ablishment what wil l be required as an establishm ent now therefore he can get this thing back up to an ideal scene but hes working on three now what is pr oduct three thr ee is the pr oduct which corrects the establishm ent three is the co rrection of the establishment and it is its elf pr oduct its correction and org org officer who doesnt wo rk on p roduct three const antly and continuously and so fort h will find that the decline f an or ganizati on is not arrested and an organization will run and your gds s will all go up and your gi wi ll all go up and everything will go fine and then all of sudden the gds tails off and all of sudden another gds will tail off and all of suddenthe gi goes bo om and the or ganizati on goes all to pieces and you wonder what the hell happened and what you hit is an anticipated expansion which sought and found and exploited every weakne ss in the organization and it blew up and that is the r eason for booms nd depr essions of orgs the booms and dep ressions of org is as they expand they expand beyond their tolerance level of handling the inc reased vo lume finds all their weak points bl ows them up staff members become over loaded over worked they c ant cope with it anymo re the lines ar just too much thin gs ar too inter nally vrahh human emot ion has gotten in your road oh my god and somebody says i think ill go back to australia and sit under eucalyptus t ree becau im goin g mad what h appened is ther was nobo dy watching product three and detecting and r emedying the p oints of decline and patching them up and pushing them in to the peo ple respo nsible for the establishment so they cou ld hire it up and beef it up hat it up quick it up hco actually as the org board sits t this moment wou ld seem to be totally incapable f putti ng an establishm ent there because it has sever thing that ar not its preview that ought to be remedied but hco could remedy it right now becau they can or der they can order the other parts of the or ganizati on theyve got time machine to ma ke sur the order is comp lied with we predict at this rate f expan sion that we wi ll have used up all existing space of this building by ju ly which is f ive months f rom now you find this new building and your guys promot ing and so forth fix it up so ther every sunday m eetings teas and so f orth after we move but you find us buildi ng and so on that is not the org officers action its the or g officers spot but its the or g officers or der that something be done about this w need bigger est ablishment and thats go ing to shatter everyth ing along the lines and so forth how to post an org 13 23171 febctapes 71 011004so the decl ine of the est ablishment is arrested by or dering bigger space and mo re staff members but then somebody has got to figure out how to put this bigger est ablishment in there so the or der is simply that to arrest the decl ine it is nec essary for you to expand the space f the est ablishment econom ically so that it does not eat up everythin g that you are going to ma ke by the xpan sion febctapes 72 011004 the org offi cer and his resour ces part i 7101 c23 s feb c 6 23 january 1971 now the or g officer in highly idealized org woul d have n organizing officer in each divisio n of that or g as the deputy secretary and w ould call thes cats together and would say this is the w ay it jumps l ets hav the pr oduct he re of projects and what ar each one f you guys going to do in order to do this now the pr oduct office r at this particu lar st age of the game woul d simply be goin g on gettin g mo re product now i do this unr easonable thin g whenever im in an org and one of the reasons its very very wo rkable in an or g you will see an org go zoom ar ound it and the reason why is i never take any pity on the or ganizatio n i am the most pitiless production officer you have ever heard of absolutely pitiless and if not followed up by an organization action and compl iance with orders to organize why then i have to start operating to correct the p roduc t and cor rect the stablishment but i do it for instance every now and then you hear f dir ector of processing or cs or the head of the tech sec s aying we cant take mo re than six pcs becau we d ont have any more audito rs than th at and at that moment you wi ll find issuing an or der to promoti onat once p romote to get in all the pcs you possibly can get in from everywhe re to the r egistrar sign everyo ne up and to the tech c youve had it wher is that part of your hat that sa ys you are to empl oy audito rs how many audito rs do you know wher do you know them get them in here i think p robably your peak load will probably come in another fourteen days so you have lots of time to put on twelve additi onal audito rs get them total ly trained and g rooved in and your estate bur eau wh ever is handlin g bui ldings and so fo rth rent two more houses now what do you have to do if you do all this now we went back over the analy sis of succe ssful actions succe ssful actions and the analy sis of succe ssful actions in this particular field is complete pitiless pr oduct officer he never thinks of the organization he never thinks of its capacity except to uti lize it to its totality if hes got an id piece of machinery that ough t to be tur ning out bunjucks then by god had better st art turning out bunj ucks even though he has to grab the off ice boy and tell him to start win ding that crank and s end out the febc06 the org officer and h is 2 23171 resour ces part i febctapes 74 011004 janitor to ste raw material to put through it now that t akes hell of disor ganization doesnt it so wher your org officer that makes th at correction real and that can push it back up af ter youve done all that well the or g officer actions which i have done in an org apparently are not repeated by other people in orgs i have report from lrh comms that they continually say the greatest tr ouble they hav with an xecutive of an or g is to get them to walk thr ough their portion of the or g now that is dir ect report line and so forth just awful that s just awful thats tr eason well what the hell are they do ing sitting the re w hat are they doing sitting at that des k the xecutives f an or ganizati on im only justified in sitting at sk bec ause i have twenty four hour messengerwatch and they run lik hell thats right and im not justif ied sitting too long at that des k only i have l ines of information whic h come in from all over the place i make sur that those lines stay in but who are these line to thes lines ar not necessarily im the fell ow who violate s the externalinternal i don t know i can do it and i dont find other peop can i dont know why that is so ive not solved it particularly but i do know that i resent having to handle to much pr oduct three whi i am also having to wear some of my ow n hat s i know that ther some r esentment wi ll come up in that line sooner or later mostly because ther are only twenty four hou rs in this cockeyed planets day ther only so much you can do of course thats b ad postulate too becau as i told you befor god couldnt hold this post not possible you wi ll also be saying that you rself god cant ho ld this post unles s you listen very carefully to what i am telling you children the jabberwock the whole point in the thing is theres way s to live with this that ther are certain ways to do this and they ar very standar d now i cant imagine it assaults my r that somebody in charge of an organization would not be have all kinds of mechanis ms being familiar with the or ganization or that an executive would depend in any way shape or form on his dispatche s dispatche s are usually to forward information schedules things th at are written down need oks and that sort of thi ng dispatches ar ent there to handle thi ngs it would just be imp ossible if you werent in total communicatio n with your organization to handle it at all it just assaults my r its not possible and i have very willing group and they wr ite anything that they think i ought to know about that has the liabil ity that you mustnt act on such r eports when they contain to much enthet and so on you never act on such r eports without getting recoil once in while i do im alway s sorry that i do but it keeps inf ormation up i also have the ability to look ar ound with out g oing around too much and the net r esultof that is f airly close finger on the pulse w go back over succes sful actions when im running an org as an executive director at least once day i walk through that entir organizati on and spe ak to every person in that organization and as im normally operating f rom product point of view i nevertheless bec ause we had product org officer system t that time take the or ganization step s well im inter ested in what their product is im inter esting in what theyr doing personally im inte rested in what they need on their post in order to get their p roduct out ther are some people here wh ove do this now i som etimes miss day and so f orth but i know when ive sed day and i know when i should febc06 the org officer and h is 3 23171 resour ces part i febctapes 75 011004 get some mo re informatio n and the r esult of that is that the or g officers function is perf ormed comp letely in additio n to the pr oduct officers functi on the or g officer funct ion now an or g office r should make daily inspection around the or g finding out how the staff members ar doi ng and noti ng when theyr not hatted or slight ly unhatted and rapid ly put their hats on if theres ny trouble wit h that oull find hat is the main thi ng that goes out the res evidently scale of hats which weve suddenly evolved here i havent named any of these thin gs theyve been spontaneous evolut ion from some quarter or anothe r inside the s hip here and the res inst ant hatting ther mini hatting and then the res full hatting new nomenclatur instant hatting is sort of an action you do when you slam somebody onto post and hes got to take the load of it and so forth and you tell him what you want him to do thats just instant hatting you tell him what his post title is and what hes supposed to be do ing on that post instant hatting brrr dont get on with it and then of course hco can come along if hes going to be posted ther actually hco can come along and the first thing they wou lddo wou ld give him mini hat and if it takes mo re than about thirty minutes to get on mini hat then theres pr obably something wrong with either hco or the staff member and then they schedule him up to be ful ly hatted thats the sequence of events if theyr fully hatted they get certi ficate fo r it so thats alw ays been sing who is certified for what s having passed what hat actually it should be somethin g that happen s and is accounted for in certs and aw ards ar ea so the or g officer however is not just unhumanly inte rested in the organization the org officer is inter ested in the ind ividual as an indivi dual how he do ing how he is getting on whether he is able to do his j ob if his health is maintainin g if that post is over loaded if it needs help or if the p ost is empty and isnt getting any pr oduct how is this fel low doin g is he so s he got nothing to do on post so that he is bo red stiff has he got too much to do on post and is going down hill now lets add this up to detection of decline product th ree and with daily swing around an organization and seeing everybo dy in the or ganizati on an or g officer would of course be in posit ion he doesnt take up their time he doesnt talk to them very ng he woul d be in posit ion then to know what was cooking in the place he woul d have to know everybody in the place he would have to know what every one in the place did so that he coul d immediately detect any departur from the ideal scene but he wou ld also be interested in whether the person was getting his pay whether the person was having troubles now it isnt that this would affect effic iency it s he s inte rested in them as human being and that would be an ssential action of the org office r now its alright to have chaplain do ing this sort of thing but the trouble with having chaplain do ing this sort of thing is the or g officer wouldn t have the information wou ld he so therefore he could nt repair decline or anticipate decline s he couldnt do his product threenow as he walk s around on that sort f thing he wo uld also get look at the r est f the est ablishment wh ats it look like now he could deter mine ou t of that they di dnt have enough cleaners or people werent inter ested in cleaning or the cleaning establishment wa s febc06 the org officer and h is 4 23171 resour ces part i febctapes 76 011004 organized all backw ards cleaning establishment might have posted themselve s as cleaner in charge and have product f any kind whatsoever lik clean quarters r anything of this sort maybe all the locks are falling off the do ors w ell that obviously mean s that somebody is some maintenance h at is totally neglected around here so here is needed rganizational piece well he fi lls that in he doesnt g in and look at the rg board and sa wher are some holes in this or g boar d as matter of fact he might do quite the reverse in wanderin g around and talking to the peop and checking them off on his l ist and so forth on his rounds he might fi nd out that about thi rty percent f that or g boar d is misposted now he certainly should do something about it he can leave the or g boar d hanging there with all those posts held from above that ar inactive or hes got to deter mine whether or not those posts have ny funct ions and should be fi lled hes got to ma ke judgement th ree the decline arresting the decline alright from the arresting of the decline he can p ass information through so that those responsib for putt ing the stablishment ther who are under his orders those r esponsib for it can get together and push it back to its ideal scene r even raise the ideal scenes height so that is can handle the traff ic now do you how the lines woul d go there now the pr oducti on officer and so on is wor rying about product all this time and he will find holes and he will find what he is do ing so he k eeps notes of these thing and he while getting his p roduct passes this in formation bac k to the rg officer the rg officer ifhes mad his tours and he knows what its all about and so fo rth probably knows at that point whos idle who isnt id what he can do to instantly shift this thing go over and get somebody by the nap of the neck nd shove them over onto that post and that sort of thi ng he knows xactly wher his personnel resour ces ar he knows xactly where his supplies are as he g oes on his tou r he also knows wher all the spar typewr iters that ar ent being used ar and what st ate they ar in and the mimeo graph machine and whether the phot offset machine s got any supplies fo r it and hes got this nd hes got that and hes got the other thing and hes got his f inger on all these po ints so that he can detect an inci pient or existing decline get the now of cou rse one of the things he has to do and the bi ggest hole weve g ot in an organization is hat and that is the first thing that an org officer detect s is wrong the persons hat just like that were having trouble with the were having t rouble over here with the succes s stories and so forth he d oesnt wonder the rg officer doesnt wonder whether or not he c an almost in adv ance know that whoever is the re is either nobo dy on the line or that people on that l ine havent got their hat he c an just just lik that well unhatted good youll find out that this work work out ninety nine and fo rtyfour one hund redths per cent of the time something wrong with the h ats and so fo rth so he just does an instant hatting right away quick l ook your supposed to sit her at the des k and when the people come along and they give you these succ esses and so for th why youre supposed to have some paper he re and they wr ite dow n the succe sses and you re supposed not to snarl at them or frown at them you re supposed to be plea sant to them and they write dow n their succ esses and you take those over and you put them in this f older and so for th so that that can be staticized and so that those ar available fo r promotion so they can be cou nted ou got thatnow and the guy sa ys w ell actually so on i havent any ca gains go through this febc06 the org officer and h is 5 23171 resour ces part i febctapes 77 011004 org you see i dont have any ca gain myself i mean you know and ive just been wonde ring whether or not scientol ogy work s you see and the or g officer at that moment knows exactly what to do he knows xactly what to do at that particu lar split instant he knows exactly wher there is personnel wh isnt totally uti lized within three and half minutes flat there is another personnel sitting there and he tells this other personnel now when the peo ple come through along this line you have this piece of paper and so on and theres your ball points and her pad over here and when they write up that thin g and so on why you put in in the folder so it can be coun ted up you got that all straight now good now when peop dont come through this line lets get your hat little bi t expanded now when peop dont come through that line you go in and you tel l the xaminer to send them to you and you put sign on the xaminer s sk and if that doesnt work wel l move your desk over alongside the examine rs sk ho ws that the guy sa ys what m i supposed to be doing and you say youre the s ucces s officer youre the guy wh is supposed to monitor the succe sses peop have and so for th and you have this piece of paper and dont snarl at them and dont blabla and so on what do you do with this other guy r oute him to qual hgo says what s the s tate of the personnel in this or g today t ransferred all the lef t side ove r to the right side and the right side ove r to the lef t side you ve got to inform hco and get an authorizati on for the transfer and the reason why and so on and etcetera and its all done after the fact everythin g after the fact org office r alway s operate s he always tells people to author ize things after they have been done he runs to tally backw ardsan org office r who sits around and waits f or approvals of course is very safe until you see his stats because his s tats will be nowhe re you get the the run of the thi ng so what does he do about this person he r outes this person to qual what does he do he can now put it on dispatch line he can even give the person the dispatch take this to qual maybe the person doesnt wind up in qual but hes got to get another dispatch to hco and sa so and so has been r outed to qual w ell what s qual going to do with him that s quals p roblem qual ought to be wel l enough organized to take car of that p erson says what do i do and qual says whats it all about they can find out they also would then get som kind of if the qual c was part of the pr oduct org scene or if there was deputy qual sec as there woul d be in ideally organized org he would have the full gen on this within the ne xt day or so now the failur to publish what goes on is the fault the failure to publish and that is what you r orders of the day ar for they are really not f or those peop who have cleaning stations and so for th and bessie ann glutz was mar ried yesterday and were happy about her and so on that s nothing to do wit h this the or g officer says so and so and the product officer says so and so and they do nt have to be glo omy about it all but they certainly have the d ominant po int they hav to keep the or g informed as to their actions now theres such thing as keeping an org informed of just what is going on but certainly what affects the or g wou ld be the pr oduct fficer and or g officer so that if they don t inform the or g of whats go ing on why all hell breaks loose becau nobody knows and febc06 the org officer and h is 6 23171 resour ces part i febctapes 78 011004 they become very unst abilized and they go in and they an examine r one day and they see another examiner the ne xt day and then they go around and they think theyr talking tothe xaminer but hes now cleaning out mud b oxes or something and they thi nk he s ure looks funny as an xaminer all cove red with mud and so f orth well they d ont know they dont know sews the place with little mysteries unless its publ ished what you did now that in itself is quite an action so the action which i rehearsed on this thi ng and so on becau i actually moved in as pr oduct officer and ive been an or g officer and so on so im speaking f rom first hand in formatio n not from theo retical workout is i found out that af ter i had underta ken pr oduct and had begun to get the product at that moment i had to write up whatever i had to do in or der to get that p roduct and ma ke it known now the ball could on ly be picked up by othe r peop if that wer done so you re operating on two system s one is the lineal system and the others the tr iangular sy stem the lineal system woul d be whe re the p roduct officer is mor or less operating autonomo usly and he is wr iting up his products as he he got the pr oduct he got it going and then he made notes whi he was doing this and then he w rote it up in some fa shion or another and then he says what he thinks ought to have happened over in that or g area and it may not be what happens over in the or g area but what he has stated that he ran int will be c ared fo r because you see he didnt conduct tho rough investigation it might be som ewhat di fferent by the time its investigated but he just indicate s what he ran into and then he pa sses all of that sideway s ove r onto the org officers lines so you k eep runn ing fire of what is happenin g now he so has notes and he should mark in thes notes consi stently and cont inuously what outnesse s he fi nds now he will find certain number of flubs and he certainly carries notation of these flubs now the or g officers st ats or reputatio n depends on the r educt ion of thes flubs if the p roduct officers notes as of the first week in january ar the s ame as the p roduc t officers tes carrying the s ame flubs and nam in the third week in januarythen the or g office rs defini tely not doing his job in ot her wo rds the organization is not advancing back towar d the ideal scene becaus these flub points h ave not been handled now to some deg ree you will find that ther are alw ays some flub points that dont get handled its impossible just that ab solutes ar unobtainable and nowhere are they unobtainable so much as in an or g officers ar ea becau he s various human elements he s to produce personnel from nowhe re he has to actually cope with the fact that finance is busy telling him that the re is possible fp if you hire two more people you will decr ease our pay and we won t be able to something or other and of cou rse if you dont hire then he can sa w ell if you don t hire two mo re peop you wont have any pay at all and it goes back and forth but he has other confl icts and lines which he is tryin g to cope with in this so he doesnt always brin g it off the way the pr oduct officer thinks it ought to have been brought off because other factors may have been pr esent do you fo llow so thes things that the pr oduct officer wr ites up ar not nece ssarily orders in themselve s but they ar ind icators and what he wou ld like to have h appen and what he thinks is wrong and that gives you working basis on which to ope rate so product officer busy gettin g his p roduct why its fine he at ast s to express what hes running into an or g officer becau wer talking mainly about org officers at this time would be absolute ly up the spout if he didnt know what the p roduct officer was up to and what the p roduc t officer febc06 the org officer and h is 7 23171 resour ces part i febctapes 79 011004 had run into in trying to get this nd that he wou ld not actu ally be able to do his job very long r very well ive fo und that that wa s definitely the ca whi i was operating as product officer and i could imagine what wou ld happen if person ope rating as an or g officer was not in formed of these sudden shif ts change s actions or ders and so on which had occur redbecau it woul d look to the or g officer now lets t ake the or g officers point of view itd look to the or g officer l ike all the pr oduct office r was doing was tearing up the rganization as fast s it could be put back together again that woul d be the comp lete convict ion an org officer woul d eventually get into if the pr oduct office r didn t scribb down some notes and ma ke the thin gs available and so forth to the or g officer of what he was trying to do so therefore in order to do his j ob at all he would have to have daily cruise around the place he would have to in that d aily cru ise note such things as supplies and youd have to note such thin gs as the cond ition of equipment and machinery and whether it was being kept up or not and youd certain ly have to tice the conditi on and morale and the busines s or lack of business of the personnel inv olved and you d have to notice the dition of the commun ication lines and then the ne xt action that would have to be done there by the or g officer hed have to ensure daily that the or gs train ing program wa s being followed and that hatting on long range basi s is never sl acked off in other words is hco continu ing to do job is there s chedule in this place so th at we ev entually have fully hatted peop or are we going to go th rough life with instant hatted people or peo ple on post in total mystery fellow is looking at this st ack of folders blankly and every once in while he l ooks over and he all that st ack of folde rs and hes getting kind of allergic to that s tack of folders he doesnt know his post title and he doesnt know why those fol ders keep stacking up on his des k that would be the r educ tio ad bsurdum of the whole show so hes got to make sure that the re is some contin uous trainin g action goin g on and that hatting is occur ring he also has the idea of major cou rses becau as i told you you begin with course supervisor who makes audito rs and then the uditors you ta ke on some of those auditors and you audit pcs with those auditors do you see and he ther efore has got to make sure thatsome of the st aff member s he has ar on som kind of traini ng schedule qu ite in addition to the number of public student s who ar coming in now in sea or g org this becomes vital becau sea or g members have to be pu shed on up the line and you all f sudden find yourself organizational ly yipes we got we got eight hund red and sixtyfive pcs oh my god what the hell are we g oing to do her becau the res whoops audito rs and then they st art hirin g audito rs and then the next thin g you know why the sea or g org is all scr ambled up in some fashion or another and you cant have any sea or g member s in char ge of anything because they d ont have the technical thats peculiarly sea org problem v ery peculiar ly you all of sudden look ar ound you wind up and youve got bunch of hdcs at the most you see and what you need at th at particu lar moment is class six and then you cant youve only got hdcs so nobody has actually been pushed up the line to become qual sec and suddenly youll find that your terribly terribly thi n at the top just becau body has anticipated long range training schedule at this moment we cou ld use aboar d flag at an ab solute minimum right aboar d flag at this instant we cou ld use thr ee febcs just at this instant just to f ill in the scr eaming gaps febc06 the org officer and h is 8 23171 resour ces part i febctapes 80 011004 and then youd need some mor and we should have spare clo team all of whom should be feb cs well we hav to wo rk on new basi s and we i mean not new basis but an old basis what we do organizational ly on long range trainin g and so on is we alway s send out people who are better trained than the last am and we just w ork on that as the way we w ork towar d the ideal scene its alway s just th at better trained the art for mula applies her per fection you can work for perfectio n to poin t ofwhere you get nothi ng do ne and an or ganizi ng officer can do this oh my go d he can go for perfect ion befor he lets anything go and so on w ell that is how we do it with this time it is better than the st one and its true its work ed out over the st coup of years were always sending out better team than the st one we sent but to do that to do that you have to make sur that theres not only full hatting training but there is also some peop who are being full time trained along administrative l ines or if you cant do that certain ly part time trained along administrative lines so th at you would get nother p rogram would follow in through the back of the hat program the person would finish up his h atting program nd then wer continu ing him on to finish off his ad ministrative courses lik his oec his feb c and we do that at part time and then if we had very very alert rganizing officers in the tech divisio n who were thinking of the or ganizati on at lar ge they would scream like banshe at the idea of there being very few people on major courses and sure enough not too long ago we re scr eaming and said the res nob ody down her at all on major technical cou rse and the re hasnt been full time technical cou rse student fo r some time well they we re calling the shots and it was perfect ly true so thats part of the or ganizati on scene not on ly the hatting but also making sure that somewher up the line youll have personnel quali fied even though your doing it on part time ba sis so hes got to have some kind of programming for som futur organization and an or ganizati on is comp osed of trained peop it isnt comp osed of dead bodies the sea org does fanta stic amount of training we do fabulous amount of train ing an in compar definitely with we used to do lot of training in earlier scient ology or gs that train ing factor of the st aff is nowhe re near today what it used to be but ive managed to get it going again in sciento logy orgs over the last ye ar but it s not adequat somebody is thinking in terms of w havent got enough money we dont have enough peop wor ldpopulation explosio n we havent g ot enough peop bul l i might have believed somebody in 1705 the s carcest thing there is in the world today is hat do you think that for one moment these people on welfa re and r elief and so f orth in the united state s or in other areas and so on are happy to be suddenly relegated to hatles s life boy every time you have welfar payment s youve got unhappy peop and youve got an incipient revolution ther peop all over the place but gr oup has tendency to exclude and it shouldn t particularly group such as ours well you raise your you raise your security standar ds too high and you dont get any peop at all and you put them too low and the ne xt thing you know youve got som wild ones on your hand s alrigh t so somewher in between is the right level it not on ly never has been f ound but it never wil l be found what it takes is an alert hco and by the time the guy febc06 the org officer and h is 9 23171 resour ces part i febctapes 81 011004 thinks his post consists of breaking k etchup bottles on the funne l and so forth why you have to do som ethin g about it but you have this problem you have this problem in orgs now what n organizing officer has to do as he goes around he very easily detect s where recruitment has been or hiring s been at fault now if hes too critical f it ive seen somebody stumble around for day or two and fumble and try to find the stair case and so on and final ly actu ally wind up with r epeated instant hattings and so f orth and inf ormings and so forth finally wind up so that they had enough familiarity to do the job ive seen this happen but ive also seen it happen they just got worse and wo rse and that short of processing you see your managem ent misundersto ods see the or ganization misunderstoo ds cycle ther is something that we c an pay some attention to but th ose who ar out in orgs at this moment ar not able to pay as much att ention to it as we ar at flag becaus in the first place wer dealingwith very superio r and not to be snide about it in flag wer dealing with very superio r level of flubless uditing we do it by the bo ok and nob ody gets by anything and so on so the auditing d oesnt foul up and also wer dealing with very superio r level of tech which when rgs qualif they c an have ou wi ll be in the clover when you have got an or g well enough put to gether so it can affor d an department that could run l10s the standar d of field auditing at this pr esent moment forbids it utterly so weve got to export cou rse superviso rs course supervision weve got to support all the little tricks and expectancie s and so forth that ar done on flag how we get the results it isnt that nobody else in the worl d gets any r esults but theyve got to be uni formly good and the flub results must not be tolerated and the guy mu st make his f lub results in areas of auditing wher it doesnt mess up anything so you ll be in cl over on your organizati onal misunderstoo ds the moment that scient ology or sea or g org has achieved s ufficient well theres various eligib ility factors with regard to it and they probably will alway s exist probably be varied one way or the other certain vo lume certain succes ses certain primacies and so on becau the at this moment youre in clove r right now your neck is little bit out in that you cant probably handle the extreme cases the suppr essive s and so forth who actu ally get sideway s onto your lines and cause enturb ulation so you are still on very heavy ertness along this l ine particu larly amongst new personne l now you d ont want to hire fifteen or twenty personnel and then just keep them on fo rever the princi ple we operate on is hire lots of them and r etain those who make it and its up to the org officer then in this patr ol theres two place s in his patr ol he notes this he whats goin g on and he knows hes got somebody who is goo d or he hasnt and he can get too hig hly critical about the who thing the res nother po int wher he can detect this inhatting the person never can seem to get his hat on and so the statistics the s tudy statistics hes getting off the ind ividual have some meaning they ar not reliable it isnt the person who apparently studies very fast is not always the best personnel and the person who studies very slow is not always the best personnel but the person who cant study at all is qui something else now this wil l show up in your hatting actions so the study rate r the ability to apply the in formation which is studied is factor in selecting personnel which is often overl ooked so the or g officer also in his long range pr ogram s in his daily study and so on should also febc06 the org officer and h is 10 23171 resour ces part i febctapes 82 011004 have some kind of point stats nd that sort of thing so that he oks at it and sees whos do ing well i woul dnt go on that all by myself i would take personal observation of the post comb ined wit h how the person is doing on his s tudyi ng and so f orth makes aningful pictu re so maybe im beating that to death but the s tudy program s ill just point it out again it has two factors that an or ganiz ing fficer can get out of it not only does he ma ke sur that its occu rring but also is it bein g is anybody getting anythin g done when he does study now it is not nece ssarily true that bad personnel never goes to study now that is not true factor either very often you fi nd personnel is too drowned on his post and too responsible for his post nd doing good job on his post wi thin limits and he wil l put his post ahe ad of his study well this you cant you cant be too critical of that but you can poi nt out that the things he s having trouble with on his post ar usually handled in study and if he will affor d little bit of time to study he might have little bit better time on his post pr action that is very true i ve peo ple strugg and hav hell of time trying to get out well lets sa pr oject something l ike that when if for the love of pete they had ever spentany time whatsoever on studying the target policies or the dat series why it wou ld all come straight and the hou rs and hours they re busy wa sting on trying to turn out flubby products could very better much better be invested in some p art time study on turning out non flubby product so theres some po int of adjustment in this but you have to watch the p rogress of the staff member on his course as well as his ction on his jo b it isnt too meaningful on the course but it must occur youre mainly inter ested is it occur ring youll find some sort of silly situations develop as an or ganizin g officer youll find all kinds f silly situations lik person s started eight course s the way to handle that of course is which one requires the least time to finish go on finish it which is the ne xt one that r equires the least time to finish finish it dont let him st art new course so your monitor of that now the thir d point that we re ma king here is the handle any nd all orders fr om the product officer within the time you re given w ell that of course woul d be heav enly dream if one could but one can try one can try and if one d oes not have n establishm ent office r as different than n org office r it isnt lik ely that any ng range p rogram will ever come of f so an or g officer who isnt operating with good hco as and so f orth its very very imp robable that he wi ll be able to hell find hims elf after while thir d month on the p ost he wil l find that he is fo llowing less and s of the orders which he is getting but if hes back ed up by good has who s putting an stablishment ther behind him as he goes along he wil l find out that its ea sier and easier to do this and the dream of it is is you say l ook m an that p roduct officer says and so bo b and we xpect hund red and sixtytwo preclear s in the ne xt week and very g ood the rg officer says ou better hire hund red and sixtytw audito rs and theyr going to be so fo rth over the ne xt year f which you will have something on the or der of thirty of them wil l have to be on the job this ne xt week and immediatelywhy personnel simply sends them telegrams nd tells the peop to report to work and the ne xt monday why theyr all there report to work cause theyve already been hatted and genned in do nt you see febc06 the org officer and h is 11 23171 resour ces part i febctapes 83 011004 it could be so ea sy as you simply tell the chairman f the audito rs association that next monday you will need sev enteen additional class ivs and they will all be ther you see w ell were really dealing with an ideal scene but you see you could work it up to that it doesnt always h ave to be frantic so that is duty he s and he tries to attain as the or g officer tr ies to handle the or ders from the pr oduct office r but the other thing is is the rg officer who waits fo r orders from the pr oduct office r is alr eady f our or five feet behind the p roduct officer and he ought to be four or five feet ahe ad of him so hes got eight or ten feet that he has lost and in view of the fact which queen was it he had to run like everyth ing just to keep up in ice in wonderland the org office r has to run like everyth ing just to stay ev with the product officer what he h ave to do when he gets behind him see the burst of speed and the demand wou ld be would be fabulous so its he isnt then just waitin g for orders if he just sits ar ound and wait for the pr oduct office rs or ders why rig ht aw ay and so on i always lik to be in sa ucy posit ion as subordinate in subor dinate post v ery saucy impudent actually it takes peop ab ack its about the only way you can occupy it i dont think very many people know how to occu py s ubordinate p ost actually if the rg officers subor dinate to the pr oduct fficer its an art it s an actual art and one time i thou ght i was ive to ld you this story befor but one time i thou ght what is this every place i go and everything i do i alway s win d up in command f it im appointed the command of it is there something wrong with can it be this wa s decades go you see and i was sayingwas there something wrong with i mean is ther som ethin g pecul iar that i have to be in charge of everyth ing that i have to be the bos s i guess id been readin g freudian li teratur or something and ther must be somethin g wrong with and so on and i wou ld think well i dont know i dont remember r eally i have occasional ly made bid for that sort f thing but there must be something wrong and i was very very happy one time because i wa s physically bunged up and wasnt supposed to be ar ound at all to be put in subor dinate capacity and i was third in command i found it was breeze i was never so happy in my li fe as to discover i was just n excellent subordinate it was just piece of ca ke i didnt have to be in command f thin gs at all and so forth and in that subor dinate c apacity i was in command of ship d idnt want it didnt want anything to do wit h it actually that was the mockup but inevitably and so for th peo ple come around and ask if they were supposed to do what the capt ain said and so on i said man cool it off dont bother and so on i found out the popular valence at that time was gold brick and ive had chief petty officers and that sort of thi ng sa to mr hubbar d you ar just about the greatest go ld brick i have ever in the enti re navy pride you know dmirati on and that was becau ive apparently didnt ever work and was able to get my job done on the time when somebody else wa s eating sandwiches s ee it would just be the speed of inter nal and immediate organization dont you see so it didnt appe ar to be very stressful and got all kinds of things done lef t and right and the way to be perfect ly impudent insouc iant utterly complete ly tolerable but utterly and awfully left alone by seniors subor dinate where theyr very nice to you at parties and so forth but just little bit just little bit on the k eeveeve wher you were concer ned is oh i ve done that yes well thank you very much sir thank you febc06 the org officer and h is 12 23171 resour ces part ifebctapes 84 011004 thank you yes we handled that than k you only it has to be fact your answers to an or der are alway s past tens so you see how this fits int an or g officerproduct relatio nship product officer storms in and he says ther go ing to be hund red and sixteen pcs next week and what are we going to do about it w ell yes we actually got them and they re all l ined up all the audito rs are lined up weve got the uditing rooms nd so on were going to use the pr eclears own rented rooms when they come in for auditing rooms nd so on they re all straightened up weve got five new peop on tech s ervices and theyr being genned in this week as m atter of fact they should be hatted w as matter of fact so thank you than ks fo r telling its conf irmed is that right oh good thanks for confir ming it ther we ar you wo uld just be am azed at what this st arts do ing except you have to be on the ball and you have to do your job the who way and when you do you r job the wh ole way as an org officer you re alway s in that positi on somebody says wh at the hell are we go ing to do were goi ng to have this this we re going to have this new bunch of student s were going to run this speci course and the lite ratur and so on has been mailed and what are we g oing to do for chairs and that sort of thi ng they re bein g made now sir only probably in the or g officerproduct office r relationship you wo uldnt even us sir too close but what an enviable posit ion and what fearsome p resence now som ebody else tries to occupy your boots hes got ne ar impossibility bes sie ann is off her post i know i sent her home geor ge wil l be there in about five minutes to take car of it but operate as product office r how wou ld you lik to have n org office r that wa s like that w ouldn t that be w ouldnt that be piece of cake wouldnt that be piece of cake huh ou r gi target next month our gi target next month is twenty seven thousanda wee k alright thats all the org office rd have to hear and hed say that will take so much so and so and so and so and that s on w take some on to and wed better do so and so and so and sa the people in char ge of financial planning youd better get your financial planning jacked up along the li ne and so on because the promot ion level is g oing to be so and so and so and so were goin g to send out very heavy mailing and we need who bunch of new people here their categor ies are so nd so and so and so now the pr oduct office r wou ld actually be in his wn ri ghts to do whole wr ite up of how he wa s going to get th at product wee kly gi of twenty seven thousand by next month see hed be of his own right he cou ld plan it all out and fig ure it out and so on but hed hav to decide ho w he was going to render that much s ervice and the big idea wou ld be expect ed from him whats the big idea your going to put out int the public thats goin g to bring that many men in mr bones see you just saw one go ing out f here on and fb do and so on that s product officer penchant what s he going to sell and so on one just went out of here its big idea they re all supposed to come in and get check ed out fo r so on weve used it befor terribly succe ssful would drive the people d own on an or g so the pr oduct officers mainly in the busines s of driving people in on the or g and the or g officers j ob is to put an org there thatll handle them and he does that by preventing the decline of the existing org and forcing the hcoas to put enough org there to bui ld it up and thats the way you do the one two three febc06 the org officer and h is 13 23171 resour ces part i febctapes 85 011004 so the p roduct officer hes got to go and wham wham wham wham wham and he never thinks about ho w many people he drives in on the or g and the or g officer takes look at this and sa ys l ets s ee the gi in january wastwo thousand wee k and in february it was thr ee th ousand week and in march was fou r thousand wee k i won der why that little drop occur red there in mar ch well i know why it dropped becau wed already doub led ou r gi now if thats increasing at the rate of two thousand wee k its pr obably slight curve it probably isnt so well just str etch it ou t the rest of the year and fin d out what the gis g oing to be by ne xt january ah next janu ary at two thousand and so fo rth wer going to be aling with something on the or der of about twenty thous and gi per week and that ta kes th at many p reclear s that many auditors that many emet ers that many bo ok sales that much pr omoti on money this that the other thing well wed better get on the b all what ctions ar we ta king at this very moment to train up audito rs in this particular ar ea to go to wo rk for the or g so that s how he k eeps ah ead of the p roduc t officer he can do an xtrapolation he can figu re out what is the load and what is the l oad going to be just by xtending the curve now you also extend the down curve and he wil l find out what the load is going to be its g oing to be zero so hes not going to have ny organization at all if he xtends the gi in some of these or gs little bit fu rther alright now an org office r picks up any outness in the stablishment of the or ganization and handles nd reports to the pr oduct officer what wa s done so theres back flow here and wher large actions are required hes got to write up csw of what wa s found and recommended handlin g and so fo rth to the product of ficer now were still talking about lineal line flow that is whe re the p roduct officer is more or less doubling in brass with the co or executive director see so he woul d say look this is what were going to have or this is what we cant have but this is what i can put in and this is what i cant put in in other words hes got to give som kind of back flow here to in form keep the pr oduct fficer informed as to the facilities and this comes under the he ading actu ally of what you callcapability and the product fficer has to have some idea of his or gs capability and some idea of his personnels capabili ty not necessarily to put limitati on on the thi ng but so he can imp rove it or extend it now the c apabil ity is in the hands of the or ganizin g officer what is he capable of now that takes resou rces nd we get int the wh ole subject of resou rces they re already mentio ned in the in i think the or g series and so on the res resou rces wh at are the r esour ces you have and thats pr oduct office rs thats product officers black dog of karnak he seldom has the r esou rces to do what hes supposed to do so actually the rg officer should keep him advis ed of his resour ces well what are resour ces how many uditors can we hi re how many course superviso rs are the re how much auditing room do we have and that sort of thing these ar our resou rces i ll give you an idea r ight now i had to solve very bad problem administratively very bad pr oblem something came up and so on some stat s wer going down i had to look ar ound at once and do resour ces estimation now that actu ally is an or ganiz ing officer has to an swer up ud and clear what resour ces do we have bec ause the resou rces i needed was coproduct office r and an or g officer and an assistant product ion aid now that is an febc06 the org officer and h is 14 23171 resour ces part i febctapes 86 011004 assistant production aid and i had what the devil wher could we get them and the r esour ces we we re able to utilize the r esou rces we had t that particular moment to save the situation and then i actually rewrote the pr ogram just last night to gain further resour ces we were goin g to throw coup aw ay so we all of sudden got those and we re goi ng to utilize those so this is r esou rces d you follow what ar you r resou rces the ability to return things to the ideal scene it s in the data s eries the discu ssion of resou rces how do you return things to the ideal scene depends on what r esour ces you havethe org offi cer and his resour ces part ii 7101 c23 s feb c 7 23 january 1971 now the pr oduct office r as he goes on and st acks up mo re money of course we get more and mo re resou rces in ter ms of money but we may not have resou rces in terms of trained personnel the sea org expan sion and so on is ab solutely st agger ing in terms of you know i actually think you you guys pr obably believe that we wer doing great in 68 and its all sort f gone down hill and etcetera nd etcet era its very very funny whats happened is that ou r statistics at this particu lar time have become div ided up and the st atistics ar of more ind ividual units nd areas and those s tatistics do you see well theres this type of thing the sea org now is runn ing three aos there are now three shs theres great many more scient ology or gs and ther are tremendous number of franchises which are really kind of orgs do you and its quite amazing but when you add up these statistics you find out theres just been general you should do it just for fun now theres just been consistent general xpan sion and the stats have been goin g up and theyr going up and go ing up the general stats but its becau theyve become compartmented theyr assigned to diffe rent units and nobody adds up all the units now further more if you ta ke the scient ology or g inc ome which has lagged as compar ed to franchise income and so on the truth of the m atter is the franchise s were financed by the by f sms early on so theyve sort of robbed the or gs of their income and then the orgs havent kept up on that f sm line that would have expanded them and they havent cont inuedto operate as their own reliable selve s and theyve tried to maintain establishm ents and so forth without actu ally produci ng the things they should have produced and its gone agley but when you add it all up you find out quite am azing ly 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 and then you think ma ybe there was bong at that time there was tr emendo us spread and it just went r ight on up the k eyboar d it went down it goes down it goes up but you take our stat s as this minute compar ed to the s tats of 1967 and they re way up and theyr way up above 196 8 look it ove r the you ll see that they are its quite amazing febc07 the org officer and h is 2 23171 resour ces part ii febctapes 88 011004 we are expanding and the place that it shows strain particularly is in the sea or g becau in the sea or g we h ave lim ited number of personnel and they have already over period of time consistently been stretched so thin you see we re maintaining three aos instead of one w ere still making the inc ome of one do you see but now weve got three establishm ents to man and its just got the lines thin youll find that that to large degr ee is the lot of the execs of washingt on dc fo r instance wer yanked out into the smaller rgs and so on there wer all kinds of wild personnel tangles and ther was lot of weight on washing ton and as matter of fact i did not want and did not approve the est ablishm ent of these tiny rgs they could only be of service if they were feeder orgs and they didnt they set them selves up as independent rganizations now theyr continuously in trouble but actually they r ob some of the income f rom washingt on s they re har der to manage becaus there are mo re of them but the aggr egate income is comparable and its been in my mind several time s is to r etire some of those place s to franchise and fo rce them to feeder service to washing ton again we probably wont do that weve got better idea right w well just force all of them to be bigbut i thought i wou ld interject that just in pas sing because i found out the general impr ession was that something was happening with this it isnt as matter of fact the australian the attacks on australia and so on ar the most ineffective attacks that anybody ever theyve pa ssed law s and bans all over the place the p olice have given us all back our books and theres nothin g to hell with it nob ody had anything to do with it so it sits on the books as dead st atute it made the st affs timi d it worried them it upset them it did this and that and the othe r thing but it sur discredited the enemy so if at any time any time you dont continue to pi up resour ces in terms of trained staff members if you don t cont inue to pile up resou rces in terms of space why that is what is going to break your back because you ar not on any down trend at all your on an escalating up trend i invite you to look at the franchise s tatistics of the st three year s and they re they almost go doub ea ch year its not quite that steep but thats the way it looks ou look at it on graph up she went so d ont plan on level graph your resour ces ar your resour ces and they ar mainly in terms of manpower how many people have you hatted how many peop have you trained how many people in the field do you still have the allegiance f how many people have you patched up h ow many arc breaks hav you handled and how many members do you have in your audito rs as sociation and so fo rth are the only things whic h will keep you above water becau its problem in resour ces and the r esou rces ar thing which the or g officer s to watch and if he sees his r esou rces declini ng well we just stablished new cou rse out in longvil as branch course or something f rom the or g oh oh oh oh there goes the trained something and ther goes trained something else and so on has he got them to send out so he should stockpile all the r esou rces he c an money auditors books he should be greedynow the pr oduct office r can go on tur ning out p roduc ts tur ning out products turning out products tur ning out p roduc ts but when som ebody doesnt do something with these as resou rces and get his r esou rces off that line and s tack them up and preserve them in ter ms of febc07 the org officer and h is 3 23171 resour ces part ii febctapes 89 011004 field peop and so fo rth theyr willing to help out and somebo dy might come on staff and the audit or was trained and he wants to know when he can go working for the org those ar resou rces and everyb ody you hat becomes resour ce so of cou rse he wants to ove r hat alway s person hatted fo r three posts is better than person hatted for one post hes better resou rce so you r org officer has the duty of pilin g up resour ces now his s udden dem ands made m ade on him piece of cake hes way ahe ad of it oh need to buy new bui lding ok how much it cost alrig ht ok well look for one yeah g ood only million w ell aright poof alright ok hes in that posit ion oh you need tw hund red audit ors ok d you see how an or g officer gets behind becau his resou rces ar lim ited s ther efore he gets head by inc reasing and hording his r esou rces see how its do ne now you d ont want miser on the post wh holds the r esou rces to his chest and never will let them go but you want pr ovident sort of housewife who has basement fu ll of next years c anned good rations and doesnt have to go screaming down to the safeway to buy cup of sugar every time that ther is guest for dinner now if you look this over from the standpoint of expandin g by resour ces you will see that you cannot expand unles s you have stockpiled resour ces or tried to now you should alway s try to stockpile resour ces and thats how the or g officer keeps ahead of the ga how many r eplacement aids do we hav in the flag bu reau alr eady trained who can be spar ed on their posts t this p articular moment and that tells you exactly what the r esou rcesare that is poverty boy that is right down to the bott om of that ole barrel im sur there must be half herring left in this her ring bar rel some place someb ody get flashlight do you see whe re she errors so now the or g officer system should inc rease resou rces and so when hes called on for one he gets two and yes you will eventu ally wind up and orgs which i manage by the way generally do wi nd up theres an awful lot of old stuff out there that nob odys ever used in the garage and it probably never will be used now somebo dy sa ys wasnt that terrible waste that wa s just providence xtended litt too far they also dont turn around immediately and look at the r est of the resour ces that wer used and theyr all over the place in full use and they also dont look ar ound at the bank accounts becau those per iods were also attended by very hi gh bank ccount reserves th at went pouring in and the staffs also we re well paid at that time so thes are the criter ia by which an or g office r ope rates now he h as to know what resou rce is resour ces are things lik space fu rniture equi pment and the est ablishment of the factors of the org any of those c an be resour ces but the final valuable products what happens to the final valuable products af ter theyr final valuable p roduc t so the rg officer sort of step s in after the p roduct officer and thats how he get s ahe ad of him so the p roduct officer you see he s turned out lot of his f inal valuable products and they re sitting all over the place t this moment the or g officer says heh heh heh heh lets get some f these got it open up an or g officers des k and ther list f potent ial st aff members for posts and so for th hes in poverty febc07 the org officer and h is 4 23171 resour ces part ii febctapes 90 011004 now naturally an or g officer tries to keep everything on an or g boar d and he tr ies to keep it all straight and tries to keep it this w ay and tr ies to k eep it that way ri ght up to thepoint when the or g boar d gets in his r oad and at that moment why he can ma ke do in some fashion or another and get some appr oved change so that it can be officialized thats appr oval sort of after the fact otherw ise s you expand you won t be able to fill in the wea k points so the or g boar d is saying well you cant have an or ganiz ation without weak points if theres poi nt missing on the or g boar d that you need to have filled do you follow thats contradict ion if you have s trong organization which wont blow up at the joi nts its of cou rse going to get an xpanding org boar d fortunately the or g board 1967 org board expand s from about tw or three people or one person can operate on it actually to about hund red thous and its inhe rent xpan sion is that g reat so you r eally dont have to vary the patter n of the rg board much that was the r eason it was planned now the close wo rk with the hco weve cover ed and the or g officer moves very fast and should always move faster than the p roduct officer yes the product officers go ing hund red miles an hou r the or g officer wi ll be lost if he doesnt travel at hundr ed and twenty five if he only travels t hund red and twenty five he wi ll be overtak sooner or later becau he has to stop by the way side every once in while to pick up the b odies and pat them to gether the be st laid plans of org officers af t gangagly yes we will be able to tak care of it bessie ann just ran of f with another man now in ur gent peak peri ods the or g officer might be required to understudy and be t the p roduc t officers side in othe r words they wo rk as team and at peak per iods r at tough points they must work as team they must not be distant fr om each other they just work right the re hammerpou nd and they will get over one f these things now the or g officer should be so familiar with his or gs personnel that he wo uld at any time be able to sa what each st aff member is up to and know what they ar doing and in his operati ons he of course fo llows the d ata alr eady supplied by lrh in cdos and lectu resnow if your operating right now at period of transition it doesnt change very much becau of 2 august 196 5 hco pl which lays down basic form that is the one which says what the hes does and what the oes does that is the first borning of this and when that was violated somethin g went astray and orgs becam harder to manage really the hes was an or g officer and the oes was produc t officer and i f you look under the oes you will find money in div ision three you will find audit ors in the student audito rs in the dir ectors of traini ng and you will find pcs in the department of processing and then you wi ll find under also distri bution you will find the field and the pr oducts which are going out int the field and up at the beginn ing of the line in the first two divisions you find the hes and so fort h had hatting forming and so fo rth and also had the xecutive divisi on which contained the estate section so you it all works out right and thats 2 august hcopl and it contains the first elements of the s ystem in which wer operating now that was an older system than the 67 org boar d but the 67 org board was the preservatio n of this sy stem and the 6 7 org board was very well tried out at saint hill and was function ing very very well at saint h ill durin g its pea k per iods the org boar d was copied with all co rrections by mary sue in 1967 and i found that when section is on the wrong part of an or g boar d you ll get int trouble at once and great many of these adfebc 07 the org officer and his 5 23171 resour ces part ii febctapes 91 011004 justments wer made so the 1967 seven div ision org boar d is ful ly tested or g boar d unfortunately the div ision three of that or g boar d was lost and not published and the elements of it are still around and i think wer making some effo rt to publ ish this at this time but mary sue wrote it up and for some r eason or other it just wa snt mimeog raphed and i cant imagine what happenedthe fact that we have develo ped some new pr inciples in the fie ld of pr and in the distribution div ision has tended to throw the distribut ion divisi on bit out becau its p roduct was not anticipated totally at that time and its p roduct is scient ologists that is its pr oduct and these scient ologists of course have pr oducts of sold b ooks contacted people and other sending people in you know inte rested persons nd so on and they also have the guar dians office is carrying on some of that now and they h ave all kinds f commit tees and that sort of thing stretched around the wor ld and they u these committees and so on that was r eally an or iginal distribut ion division functi on so that is in state of flux at this particu lar moment and you could either just u what is on the nine division publ ic divisions use that or use the old distr ibution div ision org boar d with these element s put into it but i can tell you r ight now that the pe foundati on is go ing straight back in the cademy becau pe fo undation requires course superviso rs and its just it s just lower level of the sa action of course s uperviso r and they have the facilit ies tech service s and other thi ngs which can be doubled in brass to handle these public actions becaus theyr not publ ic actions its the s ame ction all over again you wi ll see something resembl ing staff college or hatting college thrown into the line up and that of cou rse makes valuable fi nal pr oduct if som of the pe actions so came over to it at the time im speaking to you this h as not been comp letely r eleased but it shouldn t give you any trouble at all just those public courses nd so on right over there right over ther bing into the cademy or department of training and youl l find they re better cared for when that wa s that way by the w ay i have r eports on when it was that way the pub lic comi ng in and runnin g into students who were all enthu siastic and in good shape and had status with them then the publ ic had alr eady man aged to reach and withdraw so the rganizationalpatter n the or ganizational patter n with which your dealing and the oec wh ich you study ar all of piece and ther thing out of line with any of these p atter ns you will occasional ly have something has moved to another div ision and will have the w rong department r divisional designatio n on it that could even be corrected up becau the functions in actual fact havent much changed ther efore there is tremendous wealth f information and techno logy which has been developed all f which is of infin ite use to the or g office r and he is ric h in terms of theo ry and techno logy of organization and particu larly r ich with the theo ry and technol ogy of the or g product fficer system an organization is liable to organize fo rever without producin g anything an or ganization is liable to try to produce f orever witho ut organizing anythin g both of these things ar hideous crime becau bo th of them wi ll crash ou cant cont inue to produce withou t organizing it you cant continue to organize with out producing febc07 the org officer and h is 6 23171 resour ces part ii febctapes 92 011004 the gener conduct of the or g officer is met to the deg ree that he is familiar with his oec hes famil iar with the hat s with the expectancies fr om duties on the vari ous post s with the resou rces he s with what the establishment is particular ly comp osed of and the pr oduct officer oddly enough has to know all that better than the rg officer so if you f ind you rself going too far adrif t or too far astray either as product officer r an or g officer you do have tremendous amount of material whic h can be r eviewed and that material is not out of line and its theor ies ar defini tely not out of line theres noth ing nothing been thr own away in it at all 1970 was such stellar year in the adv ancement f organizational techno logy that you would immediately xpect it would throw everyth ing away well theres consistency in it all consistency in it all it just showed up the imp ortance s and how an evolu tion of it cou ldtake place there is another system on the orgproduct officer system that i must mentio n in closing and that system is si mply the tr iangular sy stem that is wher you have very big organization and unti l you had this unit up to wher you wer clicking along at around twentyf ive thirty tho usand d ollartype rg you wou ldnt really want this type of system becaus its trifle cumber some and that is the tr iangular sy stem by which the org officer and the product officer are handled by an xecutive director or comm andin g now what h appens ther is that the p roduct officer goes s traight along with the duties s he s and then he has the various problems which he is running into or what he wants or what he can think f or what hes tryin g to get thr ough and the xecutive di rector at that time is the planni ng officer now i want to point out to you that the planning officer up to that time on the lineal sy stem of just product officer to org officer the planning officer is the pr oduct office r he is the planning officer of wher the hel l are we going what we go ing to do but the commanding officer if he was operating with product officer and an or g officer would be the planning officer and hes the planning and coor dinating officer that is the way we ar running the flag bu reau w sort of run mixtu re its sort of half and half when we ta ke whole continental area and all the chips ar down and that sort of thi ng is why then i will step in as comm andin g officer and planning and then i will take it up so that we get plan of overal l projects and so on so that it would be actu ally in lineal sy stem it would be the p roduc t officer who did that he would be wearing he woul d be d ouble hatted and wher there is wher the triangular system isnt in the product of ficer is alw ays doub hatted as the commanding officer or executive director in any or g that your runnin g at this particu lar moment the lineal system wou ld be the one you are using but i wish to call to you r attention that at the time when you have aproduct officer and an org officer and they ar working wi th commanding officer or executive director then you also need the rest of the fri lls and the r est of the frills are pr officer who is s taff officer hes not down in any div ision hes handling the human emoti on and reacti on and you re going to start runn ing into plenty f that and youve got to have ssengers or runners that becomes neces sity you woul d have to have an executive directors febc07 the org officer and h is 7 23171 resour ces part ii febctapes 93 011004 secretary who is sh ared to some deg ree in use r as guidance factor or coordinative factor with the p roduct officer and youve got quite litt staff ill just n ame them ff for you theres commanding officer product officer org officer staff pr officer and messengers and secr etary the only plurality there is mes senger you cant xpect ssenger actu ally to stay on duty fo rever anyb ody wh tries to put messenger on duty at eight oclock in the mor ning and ta ke them off at six oc lock at nights got rocks in his he ad because what hes going to do hes going to spend peri ods when he doesnt have any ssenger and if hes depending on mes sengers and so on why he couldnt do it but it takes mes sengers in order to handle anything rapidly enough of course i m do ing as usual the r oman runnin g three ch ariots simultaneously f rom center ho rse with the post s somewhat empty he re and ther along the line up and thats done because of the xpansion factor i suppose some day it will all be improved and it will all be perfect i don t see it in the fo reseeable futu re but actually the sy stem which we ar runn ing on right w and getting into shape is actually three thr ee org system comm anding officer of three or gs simultaneously each one with pair that is the pr oduct officer and an or ganizin g officer and with bounteous number of messengers and with excellent secretarial counselo rtype bac k up and one of thoseorgs right now the ship rg is running solo at this particular moment that is to say the res commanding officer but not in essenc commanding officer who is not backed up by an organizing officer and wh at this moment doesnt even hav an hco to establish anything and i dont know wher thats go ing to go but i know very well from where i look that at any given instant that the re will be small beginni ng little whistle of steam wh ich gradually goes int high roar becau something something wild will take place unless th at is or ganized up you can alway s anticipate something that an ar ea that isnt organized to some degr ee will cave in so youve got to as an or ganizi ng officer anticipate the fact ou can look at n area and you say that isnt well enoug h organized so the refore we can only let it go so long before there will be boom now any time you try to increase the traffic on line and you dont increase the rganizing funct ions on the line rapidly enough or som ebody d rops the ball in the process of increasing those or ganiz ing actions at that moment you do get boom it goes bo om and these ar the peri ods when you ve got to have pr with his coded questions that can be decoded so we can fin d out what it is so we can get pr ogram in the thing while the rganizing officer immediately gets hold of this one and that one and cools off the xisting tempers and you get instant hatting right away and comm ev the hco as fast fast fa st you see becau when its let go you can operate on this princi ple the longer you let it go the bigger the b oom and that is definite operating princ iple if you dont believe that we had it all taped out many m any months ago what we wer going to do and it wa s for period there when we did not put an organizational patter n togethe r and ken and i wer discu ssing this and we should really organize this and we r eally should take this or ganizati onal step but at that particu lar time were unwilling to take thestep due to some of the s carcities of personne l and i dont know i think we let it go for afebc 07 the org officer and his 8 23171 resour ces part ii febctapes 94 011004 bout six or seven days and all of sudden boom and now we had to put it all together in just time at all and the othe r principle is the l onger you neglect it the mo re frantically youre going to have to work to salvage it so foresight really pays off and thats why the rg officer should be way ahead of the pr oduct office r and he get s way ahe ad i call to you r attention again by picking got five people here who are elig ible to be executive di rectors in pinch and ive got six peop who are triple hatted that is to sa they re on single post but theyve been check ed out on all f the hats in their particular area isnt that nice and so on now if we just check them out on all the hats of coup of more divisi ons her we pos sibly will have an or g officer here ah thats nice good ies and that is the think which has to be back of that which puts the rg officer ahead of the product of ficer in poverty it is alway s very easy to starve to death very quickly and theres something i must mention to you in actu ally in closing someth ing i must mentio n to you and that is that ther ma kebreak point of an org theres makebreak point and when an organization drops below certain volume certain income and certain personnel level it is in the br eak point and it not only breaks itself it breaks the people in it now when you start to getting people trying to blow becau of overload and they cant cope with it and that sort of thi ng you ar defi nitely defini tely in the b reak area and when you lot of trouble and strain and stress you are in the break ar ea now the br eak might not be r ight wher you are it might be on an extensional l ine you may hav very overbur dened lines wi thout recog nizing it which those l ines are extensional outside the or ganizati on now that woul d be particu larly true of bureau flag bu reauor liaison bureau t up is peculiarly liable to str esses which arent easily locatable inside the rg because the s tresses are on its traff ic lines because wher it has any responsib ilities for organization of outside ar eas at all those s tresses show up inside the rganization so everyth ing appe ars to be ok as far as personnel are concer ned and that sort f thing are concer ned but theres inter nal stress youre actually in break ar ea and that is the time to organize like hell to promote l ike mad and to push up you r accumulation of resou rces at gr eat speed whenever you find yourself in that and every scientol ogy org in the world as i speak at this moment is running below its ma ke point the make point of scient ology or ganization where its r eally rolling in cream and so on is pr obably som ewhe re in the vic inity of about twenty thous and gi and if your not doin g that then your under strain and very very heavy s train and the people inside the or ganiz ation will be under strain and then you can expect that to dwind what ever youve g ot wi ll dwindle rather than increase unless you take effo rts to actually effectively push it up to the ma ke poi nt now its noth ing very serious you just m ake up your mind that were going to expand this est ablishment up pa st the m ake point for instance the accumulated ctions of an org like the l angeles or g at this particu lar time have not added up to movi ng itself into any zone of make it got int the br eak point and its suddenly grabbed from every di rection and they re puttin g it back togethe r again but it is the money m ade by the individual staff member that deter mines you r makebreak poin t and its the ld qual stat and it actually isnt term of sum s of money you can just lay it aside i said that that wa s in that zone and it is in febc07 the org officer and h is 9 23171 resour ces part ii febctapes 95 011004 that zone you can lay th at aside as being thats only contempo rary who knows but what tomorrow barrel load of money wi ll buy loaf of bread and mo rethe makebreak point and so on is dependent on the amount of money made by the individual staff member and when it is too high you wi ll find yourself in break point and if its too low youl l find you rself in break point if you re countin g on every in dividual staff member to pull in fiftyfive hund red dollars wee k for the or ganizati on you are in too high band and ther will be litt bit of crack s tart showi ng up along that line becau you havent put enough organization there to ma ke that much money and if its to low youve got too much and to inef ficient an or ganization there and its ba sis are too bad if its down at the lower end of the band and i can tell you that th rough 1969 the point of membership in orgs was sixteen to eighteen pounds per st aff member lets look that over that was the inter national sixteen to eighteen poun ds per st aff member that isnt even wa snt even go od pay fo r sciento logy org member out in the society he cou ldnt even suppor t himself at that much less support the or ganizati on s that or ganization must have been absolutely product gone they couldnt have had any product at all d you see what i mean im givi ng you the actual data now at this time i instantly became very interested in this network my ears went up boom and this wa s about little over year ago that i saw what this trend wa s and i said that they re runni ng organizationally at so low level that they wont make it and this is going to crack up somewher along the l ine so wel l bolster it up and that wa s the lrh program number one programs th at you sa w going out at that particu lar time we re tryin g to lift that up trying to lift that up and hol d the f ort until we could get better basis of organization which coul d bring this bout the why of that wa s lack of products they were not making products and the p roducts they wer ma king were very of ten too poorly costed just just insuff icient volume insufficient quality and gave you insuffic ient viabil ity so that ld qual stat wil l have to be restor ednow gues s what i d ont know what it is at this xact inst ant but all the members of the sea or g in orgs or not in orgs at this particular instant well this is figu re thats ta ken from som considerable time ago actually measured up but it coun ted all the people in the sea or g and the gr oss income of the sea or g and it was fabulously high the highest income per staff member ever made in the sea or g was fiftyfive hundr ed dollars they were pretty high heavily under strain to but they wer doing it now the one when i surveyed the thing i said at this inst ant not true when i surveyed this last and i dont guar antee the absolute accuracy of it and so on but it was five hund red about five hundr ed and twenty do llars fo r every person in the sea or g on ships in orgs and everyth ing else per sea org member not per st aff member now this shows ther must be some outness now one of the outnesse s is is that the scientol ogy org does not have suffic iently large packages to sell it is selling right now hours which might not be wise it ought to sell results of some kind or another it ou ght to sell pac kages and it could rescue itself very ea sily by selling train ing which isnt cut rate training febc07 the org officer and h is 10 23171 resour ces part ii febctapes 96 011004 do you know that the l angeles or ganiz ation was selling course s for as little as thirtyfive dollars apiece actual ca sh received they had inter nal systems of cutatives so that ther was thisa nd thata and that considerati on and then just failure to walk ar ound and col lect the money and so on and whole series f their invo ices and so on were inspect ed few months ago and it showed that that somebody just had rocks in his head and the org was having great deal of trouble and they wer selling cou rses but having sold the course they wer ent really deliverin g the cou rse but what they sold the course for was stagger ing through some kind f inter nal think or arrangem ents r peculiar ities and so on imnot tryin g to brand one org thats being particular ly bad i imagine this was fairly general you cou ld get dianetics course thi rtyfive dollars and so on now how they m anaged this i dont know but there could be even when you have package and even when the package wi ll bring in adequate income to suppor t the rg things can happen inter nally in the or ganization so the resour ce never the valuable final product doesnt occur well that is of great inte rest now one of the r easons why you have sophisticat ed technol ogy at this particu lar time is becau of the factors which i have been telling you and also becau of the di fficulties of managing from command p osition these diff iculties are sufficiently great that theyr almost were almost impossible so the refore we had to have much higher much more sophisticated techno logy and 197 0 was the ye ar in whic h this was very car efully resear ched and devel oped but your makebreak p art of your organization is imp roved to the degree that the pol icy and techno logy of scientol ogy is known and employed in the operation of that or ganizati on and this is your first factor that you have to lear n with some hor ror just few minutes ago just few minutes befo re the lectu re i was looking at an other wise or iginated po licy letter wh ich caved in corner of one of ou r finance systems and w i have g ot to run this down and r ound this up and cancel this thin g out in hur ry now you occasionally in the field will get an or der rarely but you ll get them an or der or pol icy or dir ective r an ed whic h runs cont rary to your product ion and which makes you r produc tion difficult you wou ld be very r emiss in your duties i f you did not instantly call this to attention rapid ly the re is even pol icy by which destructive order can be halted on the l ines for instance in the mid dle f the d ianetic s course inst allation in the dianetics course you have statement when it was r eleased do not drop any scient ology action which youhave t this p articular time couple of pls not written by and some di rectives and so forth went out and in the souther n united states you had belief the south western united state s there was belie f that if anybody audited scientol ogy grade s on anyone that he was commit ting high crime and woul d be l iable to comm ev now who the hel l put that out i dont know and yet that was into the teeth of the actu statem ent made on the hdc tape when it wa s made and on the ed wh ich released it and f or god sa kes dont drop any scientol ogy actions you are doing just bec ause wer giving you dianetics so what wa s the broad spread action to drop every single scientol ogy action that was being do ne the re was even coup of policy letters riginated that got by and got cirfebc 07 the org officer and his 11 23171 resour ces part ii febctapes 97 011004 culated which canceled those thi ngs out and which messes it up oh my go d so you must assume th at som ewhe re along your lines you will have somebo dy who finds it very satisfactory to inter rupt forwar d progress the wr iting of the cur rent fashion the writing of the cur rent fad does mo re to destr oy your stats th an anythin g else you could do yester day it was true to and yet man because of his immediat concer n with present time is continu ously th rowing away wh at he h as in return for what he hopes to have and its sort f an idi ot game our resour ces ar policy and hcobs d you know that this moment we have just put on chec k sheet i dont know the date of this cong ress it must be in the early sixties ken cou ld tel l the state of ma n congr ess thats it 59 we have just put it on chec k sheet for very high upper level course the state of man congr ess you havent any idea of the of the what you could do with the r esour ces if you dont know what those r esou rces ar why of course they won t be uti lized and you r ide off in some high hopes of something becau all the auditors in the hgc flub dianetic session all of suddenwhy som brand new technique is looked up on to solve all the c ases in the neigh borhood any one of which w ould solve if anybo dy ever r ead the xtbook and taught anybody the xtbook on dianetics in the first place the highest br eakthr ough we have at this moment is cove red in ful l in the early sixties and the only thing that s happened wi th this b reakthrough is we hav used it to its total ity and have udited it with some new methods of handling session which make it come off smooth ly enough only one new princ iple has been developed but there are two new methods of auditing to make it smoother but the whole theory of it is bac k the re in the early sixties now thats am azing isnt it now you re basically in the busines s of knowledge as the one thing that you are putting out and its k nowledge f self so whatever other valuable final product you have is knowledge and you wou ld be absolute ly startled but fellow who is class x in training at this moment g ot stopped by the other day and given when he was asking questions about why something was happening about low ta was tol d very directly very directly and very f orcefully that hed damn well better go back and r ead the orig inal thesis he hadnt ever understood what happened in this s ession ive had css who couldnt audit becau they di d not know the basic bo oks the refore you then ba sically are purvey ing knowled ge so how do you xpect to succ eed without your mimeo files how do you expect to succeed with out your book stor absolutely crammed to the gunne ls how do you expect to succeed with out every tape in that place and pac kages for sale that you possibly can lay your hand s on becau you re basic ally purvey ing knowled ge when we went over who serie s of franchises we pick ed out the most succe ssful franchises and we asked the fel low to wr ite up what m ade it so succe ssful at the beginn ing of ever meeting that he had with his public on pe level he read them pol icy letter almost regardless of what it was all about and he g ot tremendous he wa s just howl ing succes s sonow you start compar ing this with empty mimeograph files with packs with holes in them and you will see what causes your makebreak point you ar not spending your primary asset which is knowledge and we re not dealing with the kind of knowledge which was true in 61 but was not true in 62 theres very litt of that on the trac k and it was all corrected out not too long ago there are tapes beyond belief the lib raries nd so forth which we have febc07 the org officer and h is 12 23171 resour ces part ii febctapes 98 011004 so your organiz ing officer you r organizing officer must r ecognize that his fi rst as set that he l ooks on as goodies is all that space t aken up ther with mimeo files all that space taken up there with packs and all of that space t aken up in the book store with basic b ooks and so on theres resour ces and thats wher his r esour ces begin h is resou rces dont even begin with people the peop are all over the place but they re worth nothing to anybody unless the knowledge is put out and that is the basic busines s you re in and if an org officer mist akes you look it over you will agree with im not just beating drum fo r anything of the sort you look it over here and youll find out that youve got guy in off the str eet and you put him on as clerk or course administrator realize that you dont look on him as valuable at all unti l he s been checked out and trained and this realize that you alway s automatically and very often very mista kenly ma ke your class viii the hes because he knows more knowledge so knowledge is what ma kes the difference and the or ganiz ing fficer is ba sically dealing wi th knowledgeable peop and so his basic asset nd basic r esou rce of cou rse is k nowledge and he ta kes off from there and then he gets that applied to peop and then the ne xt thing you know hell see thirty two story building scient ology in gold letters acr oss the fr ont of it its more the org officers basic hatthan it is the pr oduct office rs becau the p roduct officer doesnt ok on book or dered from som place or another as pr oduct he looks on book sold as product but the bo ok ordered is the or ganiz ing fficer s wor ry now of course the pr oduct officer cou ld say look i cant sell any books unt il some books have been or dered and deliver ed new ork is failing at this moment everyone walking around in circles wonder ing why is n ew york failing i happen to know the sing books that they do not have in new ork and theyr all of the ba sic ones they re just not there they don t have them w should be at flag bureau and probably will be and the re is an aide at this moment in char ge of pubs or g pushing like scr eaming crazy to get lot of basic titles back in print and to get them into print in the us the worl d has all of sudden decided not only to be xclusive with its cur rency but also wit h its li teratur us books c ant come into europe european books c ant go into the us w very difficult they can get in on indiv idual b ook sa but trying to get them in in any qu antity at all is very terrible and copy rights go to pieces if you do and so on so you re up against this so what what ba sically what ba sically is the ba sic resour ce the individual walks in off the street until he s been check ed out until hes been genned in until he knows the administrative knowled ge of the or ganizati on and so f orth is not resou rce he is just r esour ce to the po int whe re he may be wort h something he ma not be worth something now when hes check ed out so ther efore knowledge is dominant factor in the succe ss of an org officer and i want to point this out not because of any other r eason than when it isnt the re he wi ll fail time and time and time ag ain this h as been pr oved over and over and over and over so in just windin g this up i want to put this put this home as far as as far as the pr oduct officer is concer ned he wont get anyplace unles s hes got some t apes going everynight every night every night every night every nigh t every night every ght every night every ght every night we dont care whether he was running an has course r pe course febc07 the org officer and h is 13 23171 resour ces part ii febctapes 99 011004 or something he ought to have some tape s going every night every night every night every night public tapes on and on and on now you say w ell and so on somebodys making r esurgence in an or g right now theyve gotten hold of rons journal 67 and theyr just playing it every night and it seems to lik theyr making terrible scarcity of the situ ation but then we f ound out that the on ly tape s available wer mixed bag mix ed bag ther were some xcerpts from some various gresses somebody picks all the cher ries ff the ice cream you know or just one or two cher ries off several ice cr eams ruins sev eral ice cr eams to have three cher ries or something i dont know what the think is but we re tryin g right w at the flag bu reau to do everything we can to bust these lines and to get distri butio n and so on it might be done faster it might be done this it might be done that we have certain various logistic problems and so on which we hav to ove rcome were trying to make this thing available but unless somebody at the other end of the line in the person of the or g officer recognizes clearly that he is dealing with knowledge and if he snt got it in book form and if he snt got it in pack form and if he cant make up packs out of any mimeograph set up hes had it now its true enough he could probably get few sets or one set of an oec cou rse he could get that s et and you can s ee now the try ing to do something with this bou nd set well hed hav to have s everal set s well good so he could have several sets but it doesnt give him actu ally the l oose leafed stuff that he needs the refore an org officers whipped at once that he doesnt know what hes do ing and he c ant immediately impart and directly andimmediately gen in and impart to his staff members rapidly and of course he could never back up pr oduct fficer and if you want to know what is w rong with the m akebreak point of any or ganizati on is scient ology or gs have d ropped low on their resour ces f knowledge that they can hand around and use at this particular moment and the knowled ge which is in practice and which is available to them s practiced knowledge in the hands of auditors and instruct ors inside the rg and in their neighbo rhood thank you thank you very much good ght w febctapes 100 011004 the h as 7101 c24 s feb c 8 24 january 1971 ok this is the twenty fourth of janu ary ad2 1 and just as i predicted and hor ribly as that may be sur enough i had to give lectur now on the has as soon as we had the sy stem why i thou ght well everybody ll understand that thats very simple do you see you just get product and the rg officer comes along behin d you and puts the or ganizati on the re so he can get that pr oduct and straightens it out thats very simple and then i found out after i work ed fo r litt whi ill be truthfu l i figured out id have to say something about the p roduct officer becau that emed to be in doubt litt bit so eventu ally i work ed at it myself to get goo d grip on this subject of product officer and pushed it on th rough and gave talk on the s ubject and thought everythi ng would be gr eat and or g officer and so fo rth and whatd i run into then why i ran into the org officer wasnt really understo od so i gave you talk on the or g officer and got that straightened ou t and then has has reared its ugly head so ill try to straighten ou t the r ole of the has we are dealing with product one product two product th ree p roduct four and p roductone is the stablishment and produc t two is the p roduct of the establishm ent what does the est ablishment m ake wh at does it p roduce and pr oduct three that is the co rrection of the est ablishment and product fo ur that is the cor rection of the product now to look at this very rapidly we find out that its nece ssary when we have pr oduct to get out that an or ganization get it out now to give you s table datum if you want to improve the volume of production you have to organize if you want to improve the quality of product you have to organize if you want to impr ove the viabi lity of product you have to organize i f you re being served lousy din ner seldom at great expense the an swer is organize or ganize or ganize vo lume w ell organize it up so the raw materials come in so it goes down on pr oper assembly line of preparation and comes out at the other end s product if you want to improve the qu ality why go down that line find out who hasnt g ot the tech of ma king soup and you also impr ove the quality of the st eps and the xactne ss with which they ar done and you will come up with better quality f product and once mo re if you want to impr ove the viabi lity you have to be able to scout the various logistics inv olved in the raw material and you have to take the excess steps and the excess do less mot ions out of the line that finally winds up in dinner and you will wind up with che aper dinner febc08 the has 2 24171 febctapes 102 011004 now the trick is to wind up wit h lots of dinners of good acceptable quality and viability of getting dinners in othe r words viabil ity comes dow n to when it comes to finance the ou tgoincome law applies and if you only ever knew this about finance why you would actually have it made the res practically nobody in the worl d has actually lear ned this about finance and it is very element ary thing to lear n and it is simply that income must xceed outgo and outg must be less th an incomenow if youve lear ned that you become financial genius now f rom where do we go from there wher do we go from the re w ell then we r eally get to be financial genius and money starts s hooting out in all directions and you dont know what to do with the s tuff and that is to say you and this is wher the pr oducti on office r funct ions he recogn izes th at his losses are the losse s in money he doesnt get those ar the loss the losses ar not in the paper clip package f or two cents when it could be bou ght for one cent although that is an econ omy which is nece ssary to know it is the junio r econ omy and nobody knows this other econ omy at all it s comp lete stranger every week that your org does not make three thousand do llars nd only ma kes two thousand do llars you are runn ing at loss of one thousand do llars i dont car what youve got in the ban k i dont care how smug everybody looks if your org has potential of twelve thousand do llars wee k and you only make three thousand do llars week you are losing nine thous and dollars week cold hard spendable ca sh if you r org and you r skills nd capabil ity and so fo rth would run at twenty five th ousand dollars wee k and you are only getti ng five thousand dol lars week you are losing twenty thousand do llars week cold hard cash when the s tat goes down from eighty nine hundr ed dollars to seventynine hund red dollars it isnt pr etty good you have just lost one thousand buck s now that is the way you handle p roduc tion money and what that r equires from the pr oducti on officer now hold you r hat now hold you r hat it requires big idea and it doesnt require somebody sitting around saying well if we could just ma ke the paper clips for two cents pack and we ctually are spending now we could save one mil and so forth and therefore our profit will be thats whats wr ong wi th capitalism they re alway s worrying about profit dont every wor ry about profit worry about milli ons see w orry wrong tar get so when you really know this about income and ou tgo now you ar screaming f inancialgenius now you really are one s look it over now the r ealm of inc omeout go is wh at diffe rence is between inc ome and outg now if your income is two cents higher than outgo you say w ere solvent heh heh heh heh oh you nuts ou may be solvent at that xisting instant but you are not viable what does it take in this universe to be viable boy this is this is quite universe this is quite universe and i f you look this universe over very car efully you will find out it has all kinds of wild ramificati ons if farmer wants to wind up viable and he calculate s very carefully that he wi ll need twenty tons f wheat to see him through the year hes god damn f ool if he doesnt raise two hund red and fif ty tons i didn t mean to be profane you can cut that off the tape but he is hes foo l hes fo ol if he doesnt raise two hund red and fifty tons he needs twenty tons of wheat so he s gone febc08 the has 3 24171 febctapes 103 011004 if i could just get you r wits to sort of separate on the idea of what viabil ity is your org should be able to run without any tr ouble whatsoever f or at least two years without ever ma king cent or firing person and about then you might have achieved better survival ou got the idea people who sit ar ound and live one of thes hand to mouth existence is like saying our cashbills ratio thats p retty go od now cashbil ls ratio we owe one hundr ed dollars less than weve got and were doing great boy you died death wa s several months ago get you r think get your think di fferent now if you ever wo nder about why you dont have enough money to do everythin g you want to do and br ibe all the s enators you want to bribe and buy all the pr ime ministers you want to buy and so fo rth it is just that piece of think ill tell you great odd ity about this wo rld you think if you would decrease prices you will make mor money ou can too much inc rease price and you will immediatelydive your income you can too much incr ease price you will immediately dive your income inc rease or decr ease your prices too greatly and you mess up your income if you want to shut your income of f why just raise your prices unexpectedly but in wor ld of inflation money is w orth less and s and s so how are you g oing to compens ate for the fact that the money you ar getting is buying less and less and s and you r prices are decr easing consistently w ell thats an inte resting idea if somebody came along right now and said that an automobi the x model automob ile cost tw ice as much as it wa s going to cost last year thats hor rible people stay away in droves fr om x becau theyve inc reased the price f it even if you put out model x 1 so youve got to put out spoo fer car brand new c reation and it is so great it cost f ifty times as much as an xmob ile now you get some buyers ma n is not rational where it come s to pricing people do not sit ar ound and figure it all out now this is advice to kite you r prices up int the sk and not give any service fo r it god knows ou give service of caliber that would get you ten times as much as your gettin g and you ll get the ten times as much providin g as you don t tell people youve raised the pr ice s ther efore you dont dare raise the price so ther efore you have to do something else ou have to r eprice so it requires repricing repack aging now this is world of airyfairy god elp us because you as k peop for survey on this subject and they give you nothin g but lies so you re never able to establish it so it all has to be by doing and you offer this other package of som ethin g else and then you will find out what your pricing is now this might not w ork in the commer cial world of automob iles except it would i think the r olls r oyce is the biggest swind in the wor ld i do they do things lik lock the bonnet so nob ody but r olls royce mech anic can touch it becau its so fragi and they give som kind of spring suspen sion so that the cha ssis is independent of the bo dy ivedriven them theyve got pick up they sure ride nice an old ladys car but they sur cost febc08 the has 4 24171 febctapes 104 011004 now theyve m ade price reputati on very high because the quality is such that the deteri oratio n is very slight and then they never change thei r model so they never build in any obsolescence so its noth ing to be asked twelve tho usand five hund red pounds fo r second hand r olls royce jesus god twelve thous and five hundr ed pounds for second hand r olls royce bah people would ask you with straight face you know buick wil l run rings around it its got name its g ot quality its deteri oration is terrific and its dr iven by the m aharajah of spangpou r theres st atus invo lved in it and so on so there are all kinds of factors in this s ubject of prici ng but if your pricing is something you cant fool with you can fo ol with vo lume but you have to make sure that you r costing is adequ ate and out of all of this that ive just been giving you this is t lectur on economics this is what est ablishes how big an est ablishment you re going to maintain the products off icers cap ability of getting the s tuff out and getting it out econom ically in volume high quality can deter mine the potential viability now the usual method of firm is fol lowed by gover nment s also and they xpand to absorb all of the inc ome that is the ru under which most or ganizations operate expand inter nally administratively with duplications to ab sorb all of the income that is coming in so there is counte r rule which works on this planet why i wou ldnt even bother to inqui re and ive never bother ed to inquire an rganization tend s to spend bit more than it ma kes and it is the perating rule under which all or ganizati ons functi on and you will find it is nev er violated so the or ganizing officers job is to violate it do you see now the big idea th at the pr oduct office r got you say w ell heavens sakes what doyou mean the big idea f the p roduc t officer th is is all est ablished by somebody else at highe r echelon and nob ody gets any idea look even guy in the even guy in divisio n two bir d in division two who is working on his post ther he c an get big idea in the field of promot ion the registrar sitting at her post sh can all of sudden get big idea and put it int effect without any further nonsens and peop in the ssembly lines they can sit ther and look at this and all f sudden get big idea its all in the fie ld of big idea is how to get usually mo re consumpt ion of what your producing and an organization doesnt run without these big idea s poppin g up here and ther usually theyr not germane becau they dont apply to consumpti on so all the big idea s you get must apply to consumpti on so youre always on the outlo ok fo r big idea s that have to do wi th consumpti on of you r product caus that gives you the mar gin wher you can push your product volume up and therefore you can maint ain your viabil ity so if the big idea s which you accept as an executive is for the inc rease of consumpti on and its di rect and immediate of the thing which you are consuming why great the promotion peop who all f sudden get out leaflet that ev erybody stuffs very very swiftly into thei r pock et rather than th rows int the w aste ba sket has of course increased the consumption of leaflets and youll find out that will go much furthe r so all f you r big idea s the r eal bi g ideas h ave to do with the incr ease of consumpti on and produc t officer operating on flag is how do we inc rease the consumpti on of flag febc08 the has 5 24171 febctapes 105 011004 products it exactly defines it and it defines it department after department in an or g how do we inc rease the consumpti on of this product now when it comes down to the final an alysis is when an inc rease of product is such that it starts inju ring the viabil ity of the or g it must be an unecon omical p roduc t and it mustnot have very much to do with the final p roduct ion and wer talking about believe it or not hco were just talking about how much rg so the xpan sion that you re trying to inc rease is in the field of consumpti on and then in the field of producti on to meet that consumptio n and then an econ omical fur nishing of that product ion in order to meet the consumpti on works bac kwar ds do nt you see it is not the purpose of an organization or hco to put as much or ganizati on ther as it the rganization makes i wou ld say th at safe average to work on to begi n with wou ld be about fifty percent and then i would say just fo r fun that one shoul d aim towar d third and as it goes on up in volume one should be aiming towar d quarter the cost of the establishm ent is quarter of the inc ome of the est ablishment is what i mean your first and pr imary tar get is not one hund red percent and it never is one hundr ed percent and it certainly is never two hundr ed and twenty five percent like gover nments run so your legit imate target of hco is fur nishing an or ganiz ation the total cost f which is about fifty per cent of the income and that would be its init ial pr imary tar get and now he starts in hco the has he sa ys w ell wait minute wait minute the has what do you mean the has the finance is in div ision three isnt it its in the hco has hat its got to be becau he sa ys how much organization youve got now you tell somebo dy in treasury who ever told anybody how much organization you had all they do is grumb you as k treasury t reasury varies t reasury varies fr om total neglect to grumble that is the to ne sc ale band they run and that s natural the staff has not been fed for three weeks could we plea have ten cents to buy loaf of bread grumble i mean thats n atural there are two peop you never want anywher near an or ganizati on in control of that organization two people they do not establish manage ment policy one of them is ccountants and the othe r is lawyers and this isnt my datum and its not bui lt out of my antipathiesto either of these people the attitude of an accountant s to be the attitude of an accountant he had got to make sure that the money due nd owing to this rganization is collected and that the bills f this rganization are paid and that ther is some money to put in reserve now the v arious funct ions of accounts include of course go ing th rough purchasing becau they can buy things cheaper and this that and the ot her thing but accounts is established by fp and i call to you r attention that fp is an activity fp is an activity which is shared in by the head of each div ision now your liable to see som ething new about fp and div isional heads and that is each pr oducti on branch should have the st atus of divisional head your ad council should be about the sa techadmin ratio of the rg and that should be your ad counc il you should not have tw tech peop and sev admin people because itl l give you an unbalanced fp you look this over itll give you an unr eal ad counc il action do you see the res febc08 the has 6 24171 febctapes 106 011004 not pos sibility of you r product ion divisio n then is to tally overwhelmed by the r emaining commit tee ction so that p roduct ion nobody has his ey on product ion people have their eye only on admin istration admin istration is important if you pul l the people off of administrati on and you put them on ly on producti on why you will find that the or g will go do wnhil l the admin istrators are vital to that org but if producti on theres two opposite ends the aristotelian aristotles pendul um the tw extremes hav mean between them and weve been runn ing wher administration and administrative div isions thou ght mo re and had more say than the production divisions w ell we have to even it up and we have to br ing it bac k considerably and we have to swing it so that it doesnt quite go to such xtremes now we could swing it so that only product ion divisions this woul d be the tendencyonly product ion divisio ns m ay sa what we can buy and do and do with our money because they ma ke it you know what po litical philosophy i have just scribed communism the woiker that po litical philosophy is so lousy that they cant buy shoes thats all thats wrong with it it isnt that it violates the r ights of man or anything of the sort it just is nonp roduc tive its nonproduct ive sy stem and what s wrong with extreme capitalism and so forth is its non productive system and the re are two extremes one the administrato r not even the administrator it swung clear over to the guy who happen s to have couple of quick bucks and then he lives off the inte rest of these buck s and he figures out how he c an swindle some companies into borrowing some of these buck s so he can foreclose nd get the company and sell it and m ake some mo re bucks and thats capitalism it has nothing to do with product ion it just h as to do wi th bucks so similarly you can get an organization which is run by accountants and they wi ll talk about noth ing but buck s its grim it gets very grim but they h ave their point and they have very impo rtant r ole theyr supposed to sit the re and m ake sure that that do ugh is actually collected and do you know that lot of treasuries they d ont make sur the do ugh is collected w ow you talk about neglect now to the degr ee they dont collect the dough they wi ll enfor ce econ omy on the or g so you actually mustnt mustnt put them in char ge of the or g and reversely the sa thing you cant hav run away or g which has financial checks and balance s in it now i can do that by the way run run away or g that has financial check s and balance s in it but then theres hidden built in compute r at work cause i can tell you any or g im running i can tell you about what the log istics ar of the or g and about what its financial positi on is and when the ccountants sa it is something else i make them immediately go back to thei r desks and s tart figuring and they wi ll come out at the other end of the line not because i sayso but with pictur much closer to what ive got because i know what mar gins im operating on i know how much we should be ma king i know how much we shouldn t be making alright with in that framework then i can suddenly tell peop to buy things and do things nd that sort of thing that appe ars to be uncont rolled mostly becau it doesnt pas s through fp or something like this w ell the st atistic involved in the thing is the test of the pudd ing any or g im running starts accumulating reserves accumulating reserves they finally find out weve run out of this bank account becau its too full and that ban k account febc08 the has 7 24171 febctapes 107 011004 and what count ry can you put it in w and that is the way that one ought to run but you would have to have you rself im t tryi ng to post you up as financial genius i just happen to be one but you youve got to when you re runn ing an org you ve got to know about where you stay and then som ebody this is alw ays the li ttle secr et compute r thats sitting on your des k you know the financial positi on of this or g and its bank balance s and what it s spending what it can affor d and what its costs ar and what is its potent ial of product ion and that sort of thing you know these things bang bang bang and somebody come s up to you and s ays were going to put new wing on the buil ding and this new wing on the bu ilding is go ing to house eight hundr ed and fif tytwo new des ks of some kind or another and wer going to something and id say wh at the what woah what is this all about in other words its the bility to recognize proposal for establishment whic h is real as far as the pr oducti on goes cause your eye is on the p roduc tion someb ody walks up to nd says w ell what we oug ht to do actually is put in twenty new auditing rooms and so on alright whats the cost twenty new auditing rooms and so fo rth thats fine lets work on that that s great ok twenty new auditingrooms somebody talks about putt ing in new service spac and so on well great g reat service sp ace whats the log istics of the s ervice space fine f ine thats all leg itimate someb ody talks about puttin g in new coca cola vending machines along the des ks of the typists and i say wh at why and they s ay w ell i have friend and he sells the machines and so id be lik ely to do survey of the thing and id find out that they have to walk two and half blocks in the hot sun r something like that to get themselve s cok something like this so i ll put in chocolate bar machines and co ke vending machine and hot drink vending machines nd so fort h as m atter of fact you can remember times when this has occur red thats just staff service and they wound up not costing money and so on in other words all the factors balanced out and that was fine you cou ld furnish s ervice it pays fo r itself one way or another so on but i dont ever conside r an or ganizati on able to affor d anything even burnt match stic ks unless its got couple of years of reserve fo r its total establishment out lay when ive got that i know im working at bar minimum and at th at moment why i start to get loose with money and of course im not above shooti ng the moon on this sort of thing its not the type of thing that an accountant appr oves of and as matter of fact i have of ten seen look of absolute but hidden horror on the face of accountant s and so forth when i have said well alright well so and so and etcetera and they get ho peful that this will at lea st go through fp and it doesnt and it comes out on the othe r end that we have put in this many thousand and we have gotten back at the other end oh my god becau it would be project which increased consumpti on or met consumpti on which cou ld be br ought about so what consumpti on can be brought about is one of the fi rst thoughts of pr oducti on man othe rwise he wil l run out of space to put his products he doesnt care how many p roducts he makes as long as they dont sit the renow im sur the pr oducti on man ager of the f ord motor comp any never gives second thought to fords being consumed by the public only he oug ht to he ought to if edsel ford which is one of the biggest mech anical blunders f history and one of the biggest p rofebc 08 the has 8 2 4171 febctapes 108 011004 ducti on blunders of history was the edsel if edsel f ord had k nown anything what soever about his busine ss and if hed ever p robably read his grandfathers notes or wh oever whatever he was to henry ford he wou ld have found that henry ford operated on the po licy of america on wheels small cheap transpor tation and ri ght at the time he was build ing the edsel and so fo rth america w as go ing int small cheap transportati on but they could nt get any in america so they bough t foreign cars its nuts he cou ld have built tin lizzy designed in milan th at would have sold lik hot cakes and so on but he would have h ad to have looked over his m arket wh at cou ld his m arket have consumed so he would have had to have his eye on the main chance of product ion instead of that he buil t something was cr oss between buick and mercury and it was rather indistin guishable fr om mer cury and it was terrible lemon and he built it without any idea f consumpti on survey r anything else see he didnt have any idea so chains of dealers went broke in all di rections it was terrible catastrophe he didnt even run pilot project why didnt they hand bui ld it it wo uld have been much cheaper why didnt they hand build one f these d amn things and run it out on the street and ask anybody if he wanted it i mean thats the most elementary pi lot project i coul d think of so youve always got department functio n and its called the speci program section and if an org doesnt have any speci program sections its go ofy and every time you get one of these wi ld ideas you put it into speci programs nd itll wind up not w recking youwell that would have been special p rograms ford motor company lets h and build one of these things these monsters and run it out on the str eet and see if somebody want s it and they run it out on the s treet and the lit tle boys all throw stones at it give it to good looking young man and he cant pick up girl the who length of main street ou know run some practical test s and they finally woul d have monk eyed around and they pr obably would have bui lt something like milan italy designers hor ror with sweeping fenders that come up from the bonnet and h alf an inch r oad clearance between its crank c ase nd any sp are rockthats lancia and bui ld somethin g like this and th rown it together and wondered how cheap you could throw this thing together and fin d the cheape st motor that you could probably get and finally fin d its washing machine moto r somethin g like that and throw it under the bon net of the thin g and run it out int the street and give it to the h andsome youn g man and its immediately completely bust s is sprin gs with loads of girls and they try to offer it to anybody in sight and they immediately starts r eaching in thei r pock et bo ok for chec k or somethin g buy it with small change and so on gee do gs do you see but that would have been th rough speci programs so any productio n action through the org must r emember to have sp ecial program s now theres ter ribly funny story about this diana of course s as cs 6 speci programs ction and early on we didn t know much about ho w this artistic idea of celebr ity center wo uld go very short time ago af ter its been goin g for all this length of time i say you know its funny i understand celebrity center now has quite an tablishment there and its got about ten or twelve or gs and its branchi ng out and its got w ten r febc08 the has 9 24171 febctapes 109 011004 twelve of these and they em to have quite bit of income and we seem to have people involvedwith this and so on whos got this ar ound her i mean it doesnt seem to be ou r account diana s ays i have shes been sittin g ther as promot ions busy man aging this whole netwo rk and sh and yv onne gi lliam appar ently just runnin g with the ball and so on thats the othe r mista ke they never tur ned it over to man agement heres this xpandin g netwo rk of orgs suddenly emerging growing up and mu shrooming all over the place her and so forth shes been doin g it quite competent ly and yv onne s been doing it quite competently establishing new centers everyth ings go ing along fine its still running in special programs so if som ething is succe ssful in special pr ograms it will force itself on your attention yeah i just suddenly realized it didnt have the m ain line of command and cont rol its reports didnt come in th rough the channels ny one xpected its r eports not that we we rent paying attenti on to it not that we didnt appreciate it we thought it was great but id never it never had an aides m eeting on celebrity centers or anything like this i just w oke up all this machinery of cont rol is missing who had it special program s well now thats st of succe ss and it s about time then that management r eaches into its hi p pock et and brin gs out its wallet and sa ys l ets turn this thing loose l ets get this thi ng go ing now therefore all new types of expansions ar piloted they are piloted otherw ise youll go broke becau you re testing consumption now its one idea to get an idea concer ning consumpti on its another idea to find out if it is it never the idea the big idea you get is not neces sarily sent th rough speci programs but i f it is so strange and bizar re that you dont know what to do with it and it looks like it has an inte resting ramificati ons and it doesnt fit any place why dont go for broke on this thing put it through speci programs and set up litt unit in special p rograms and so fo rth and let them pilot the thing and then dont forget about it find out ho w it didbut your big idea s that you get along this line are very of ten the most banal big idea s you ever hear d of they re just based on how to get mo re peop to walk into the or g but every once in while you ll get big idea in the fiel d of producti on it will have to do with promot ion or what you are offer ing or how you will handle this or that or something of this sort all of which is perfectly allowable with in framework which you probably regard as perfect ly rigid the framewo rk is quite r igid and the big idea s arent and after you get this all straightened out and tested why it is time to put som establishm ent there so thin gs th at move from speci programs in have to be pr ovided for by the has as elementary as that things that you move into the est ablishment as an est ablishment and they ar legitimately part of the establishment then those thi ngs become the thin gs allowed for by the has and its up to the has to keep the establishment below way below the cost figure of the income and good target is fif ty percent you sa yeah but the has he mostly has to do with ethics doesnt he he doesnt have anything much to do wi th ethics ethics fficer has to do with that ethics is how you hold the edges the ethics fficer is the god of the edges this thing must flow down this channel and hit these s pots and these s pots must be there and that is sort of febc08 the has 10 24171 febctapes 110 011004 the he is the st word in edges that may sound esoteric but people use him to monit or behavior and i never he ard of anythi ng so nutty in my life who cares about behavior its pathetic you once in while wi ll see somebody in cont rol of thin gs who is very concer ned with whether two terminals get along wi th each other well fine spend some time have third party investigate it so so what v ery litt to do with it interpersonal r elations ar only go od in the p resence f succe ssful production and the thing which you want to do isincrease product ion and that handles all the interpersonal relations you have anything to do with the has would deter mine the size and type and kind of the establishm ent which could be afforded and he wo uld have to have to do with logistics and he may be runn ing much less establishment than he cou ld affo rd his first economy tradit ionally has been very erroneously on has itself and im alway s asking hco ar ea secretaries how can you possibly have too few peop in hco how the hell can you d this it absolutely assaults my reality its somethin g like somebody standing up and sa ying this is blue when it is sc arlet it is complete and utter and total disobed ience of all po ints of reality and ill tell you why hes the guy who recruits personnel hes the bir d who cont rols establishm ent hes the bi rd who sa ys how many people shoul d be whe re and he comes around to and he tells he hasnt got anybody in hco once in while once in while som ebody walk s up to you and brags that he isnt doing his job well that is hcos method of not doing their job thats brag well we havent got anybody in hco nobody here and so fo rth dont have any facilit ies h avent got any its tou gh havent got fi cabinets to keep nythi ng in theres place to file anything here in hco wow now immediately out of that one thin g do you have some idea of what the hco as should be do ing the ne plus ultra f his not doing his job would be manned and operating hco that wo uld be the ir reducib minimum of his job woul d at lea st be manned nd operating hco that is i rreduc ible minimum fully manned perfect hco is the ir reducib minimum of his doin g his j ob now if hes got that he should get on with it and do his jo b whic h is put the stablishment there and that is why hco is the comm and channel and you say how p ossibly could hco possibly build up an or ganizati on well christ it s in char ge of the or g boar dsits in char ge of the personnel its in charge of hatting its in char ge of the commun ication which gives it the communicatio n lines cause n organization consist s of the li nes and its in charge of inspecti on so th at it knows it and its in charge of ethics so it can hol d the edges of this thing and so on and when youve d one all that you probably have missed the one po int by which hco bui lds ho lds maintain s mans and controls the or ganizati on and its the orders issue s ection now if you want to know how bad off an ar ea is organized or an organization is organized look at its or ders of the day and fi nd out whether or not it cont rols any establishm ent orders and if it doesnt contain any stablishment or ders then the hcoas is not build ing an or ganizati on so who is bu ilding an or ganizati on and the nswer is nobody so whats going to happen to this or ganizati on its t going to exist febc08 the has 11 24171 febctapes 111 011004 now how much or ganizatio n he can buil d is deter mined by viabil ity financial viability limitati ons on personne l is mostly imaginary it has to do wi th w dont like peop did you ever that marvelous little cartoon of the fello w sitting in the b ox and sa ying i hate everybody you know marv elous litt cartoon well you don t want one you dont want department one like that department one must be p repared to take anybo dy on even though they have to shove half of them out through department three now if you have n hcoas who knows his busines s then the or ders organizationally to put the establishment ther from the data which is given one way or the othe r through the lines nd the tip offs which are given by p roduct ion and the requirements f product ion and so on why he can put an organization there so hes actu ally an organization builder and theres the po int of the establishment pr oduct one bui lder and he builds an or ganization with an hco as ar ound and days go by and i dont see manned division two i beginto wonder is this guy waiting for an or der to put up an org boar d for division two wh at the devi l is he inv olved in wh ats he so inv olved in he cant do his job wher the or g board and wher some personnel in this division two is he w aiting for orders to put an or g here hes got the or ders to put an org here hes in charge of org boards yeah you sa well hes not in charge of build ings and hes not in char ge of this oh yes he is or ders issue s ection and when theyr issued they c an be inspect ed and if they happen the res time machine and so forth i can take an hco i can bui ld quite an or ganizati on with an hco its whats the viabil ity of this or ganization would be the on ly cont rolling factor organization thats new youn g something like that why sometimes i migh t fudge over into seventyfive pe rcent but it woul d certainly soon be very rapidly down to somewhe re around fifty percent of its income would the cost of the or ganizati on and if it really got to running id ashamed of myself if the organization was runnin g at any higher cost than about twenty five percent be ashamed of myself id think i just didnt know my busines s at all what the hell s going on doesnt anybody get an idea s around her at all ou know whats goin g on product ion must be zero consumption isnt figu red out the pr oducti on isnt matched up to the consumpt ion do you follow ther something out of gear he re some place gr eat big why see how come were spending fifty percent f what we ma ke that s silly also walking up and down the or g and so forth and eing that st aff isnt getting more than they used to get and so fo rth and they arent getting more than they need and so forth thats so silly whats the m atter f cou rse weve got the nswer to that w eve had the answer to that he re for some litt time the income per st aff member only sixteen to eighteen pounds didnt mean orgs wer over manned it means people werent wearing their hats and ther was producti on orientation its incredible you cant pay somebody twentypounds week if he himself is on ly ma king on the verage fo r the organization sixte pounds week so if people say w ell they p ay us badly who the hells they were looking at they ri ght between the ey sitting right back of that typewr iter boy why dont you pay yourself better if you turned out little bit higher quality letter perhaps you would be who knows febc08 the has 12 24171 febctapes 112 011004 you expect some g reat god to descend fr om heaven nd magically wave wand and so forth what the devil is the xpect ancy here fell ow would have to do productive work and then the p roduct ion would have to be of quality and desirabil ity to bring about consumption any way you look at it i dont care if you re looking at this in moneyless society that is the way it works if this vil lage with its garden plots d oesnt raise mor than four or five such villages could possibly eat it will be bunch of poor dow n trodden starvation famine faced pea sants they won t even be able to affor d bicycles maybe the res money involved at all maybe they never see drachma or durum r ruble from one years end to the ne xt but you look around there and this has been true f or thousands of years and it was true in the euphrate s and was true in any other zone or district on this r any other planet one of the reasons the united state s is having problems right now and it must cause the supp ressives just fant astic p roblems is one man c an now raise enough food to feed f ortyseven it used to be that one man could raise enou gh fo od to feed four and this is causing terrible problems and h as total economic strains on the gover nment right w its awful but the damn fo ols keep shippin g over seas money why ar they shippin g money over as they havent got that so that any of these econ omic criteria just have to do with just these very very very plain factors you cannot pay worker more than he m akes and that is all there is to that so thisguy sits ther and hes s upposed to punch holes in belts so he chews up belts so he thr ows them out the win dow so he thr ows them in the garbage c an and belts ar rive at the other end of the line and the res belts to be consumed and so f orth about that time he starts whinnying about how hes underpaid i dont have any s ympathy at all im not being the hard hearted tas k ma ster i just know more about life than he does its fantastic in the united states you look ar ound and you see some of these young squirts hit ting papa up for new jagu ar or something l ike this and so on i often w onder how long they re going to go its sort of like circus you see not too competent perfo rmer on high wire which perfo rmance and at what po int of the wi re is he going to go all the way down to the sa wdust its one of these things now theres been all kinds of katzenjammer kids runnin g around telling people lies about economics but ther are other people running around telling peop about the poo r down trodden work er after they get thei r workers paradise in r ussia they all starve to death t rouble in russia ri ght w is they g ot shoe s to keep out the snow nicks not that you have to have great of shoes but if you wi ll go ar ound wi th body you might as well produce enough to keep it goin g produ

years witho ut ma king penny you can do that youl l survive and dur ing that two years you can get busy and first ill give you an idea of ho w rick ety thin gs can get for some r eason or other cashbills were so bad over the wo rld that i di dnt expect scientol ogy organizations to survive as of october 1969 and i dont know wh was who was saying what about which but boy they cert ainly were by anybodys criteria insolvent their cashbi lls ratio was crossed they wer in hor rible cond ition it wa s mess gha stly mary sue or iginated as part of the lrh program s and didnt take full credit for it fp number one the lrh ed which is financial planning program number one and she put that out and she r ode that h ard and so on and as of now the stats may not look all that gr eat across the w orld and so fo rth but those or gs are all solvent she chieved that in seven or eight months of very hard slug back nd forth bac k and forth and she was aling with the cost f the rganization in almost every case and she found ou t that most or ganiz ations had very unreal idea of ho w much they cost they didn t really know ho w much they cost to run wee k so they didnt know how much money they had to make now if weve chieved that we wil l achieve the ne xt step which is just this that it is not good enoug h to make as much money as you need fo r the next week you have to buy survival and your survival is minimum f two year run with out penny ever walking in the front door and thats minimum and that would get you over most political other crisesfebc09 productio n and the 2 24171 resour ces of the has febctapes 114 011004 so lets ok at this l ets take ok at this v arious crite ria these ar the har d facts of life now your up against the har d fact s of life so how much establishm ent can you affor d well you obv iously cannot affor d an stablishment which doesnt produce and you bviously canno t affor d peop in the stablishment which doesnt produce and you bviously cant affor d to harbor machinery which doesnt produce and off ices which have service use and these ar the thi ngs you cant afford there was trick that johanne sburg in its early fo rming days when it was under jack parkhous used to pul l which wa s i was hor rified at is they bal anced their books by firing staff members so that as the s tat went up and down they wou ld fire staff members nd take on staff members in order to balance thei r books well now thats the wrong way to d this the way you do is hat train and get better on post the staff members you have now man ager always s the responsibil ity of providing work f or his workers and that is something that som ebody had better learn in russia just that manager has r esponsibi lity you find you rself it works two ways its how much stablishment wel l its how much production now wer back to resour ces what r esour ces does the has have th at can be uti lized by pr oduct ion now you thi nk boy you must be in the airyfairy worl d and so fo rth and that it must be ter ribly difficult and so for th it isnt terribly dif ficult its very very simple our average income fo r the last thr ee months wa s x ther efore our expendi ture and establishm ent for the ne xt three months must be one half x nd our income must be 2x and your immediately at qu arter and you target it and try to strive for it so its t very difficu lt to wo rk out you will find when you first fac an organization that its inef ficient in the xtreme and you re not the har d hearted whip ma ster that sa ysimmediately this many must go because we dont have the general moto rs answer see were closing five plants now h id iots i use the word advisedly actually its an insult to idiots that s about the lousiest man agement that anybody ever heard of look theyve got that much stablishment now what w lets get it worked in reverse what r esponsibi lity does this hand to the pr oduct officer of that or g hes got to get it consum ed hes got to get his pr oduct consumed not reduced you dont reduce product ion you increase consumpti on every time you f ind you rself thinkin g in terms of well weve got too many auditors and so fo rth now and so on and the refore and so on youve got resou rces r esources have been fur nished to you you have to quick l ike bunny figure out wheres this pr oducti on going to go so it s one thing just to produce and its nothe r thin g to produce with some place to put you r produc tion so when you re dealing with commod ity of auditing hours it doesnt seem to occupy much storage s pace but actually you have total vacuum what are you goin g to do with this we got twelve audito rs and we don t have any mo re work than for six audito rs w ow wow w ere not going to lay of f six audito rs wer going to get the consumption increased f or those idle audit ors and that is responsib ility of managing and good manager and goo d product ion officer and go od organizer will balance the factors out febc09 productio n and the 3 24171 resour ces of the has febctapes 115 011004 now you g dow n to the dist div ision or you go over to promotion somehow or anothe r and you re going to increase that and that is why pr is so very very very important youve go t to know reliably what people want youve got to estim ate what they want and predict what they want inte resting now you d ont think weve ever done this oh boy yes we have wh at do peoplewant w ell they want new tech but the nswer to wanting new tech is the ld tech hasnt been p roduced and they dont nece ssarily want new tech t all they want tech and they hope that the new tech wi ll produce mo re than the ld tech the factor missing ther is quality quali ty of tech weve got som ebody walking around this s hip right now being talked to by the m aster at arms and othe r peop and so fo rth trouble with her is is she never had an engram run and era sed tough problem r eally tough we got thirteen year old audito r that wou ld probably run rings around any hdc in the worl d she could sit ther and run an engram out except nobodys ever gotten her to an auditing session by an auditor who would run an engram out most of your basic p roblems of product ion are never connect ing up see never connecting up the guy who can do it and the guy who wants it its simply that see now you try to connect up guy who cant do it to guy who wants it and you re immediately going to have p roduct ion problems boy youre going to have the ful lest qual you ever hear d of very funny recent ly we we re talking about stalled cases and difficulties and so fo rth the failure of quals over peri od of time was the failu re to use the primary too l of qual and i was just investigated this bout sev enty oh i dont know how long ago it wa s fifty days ago now you know that the pr imary

the pr oblem was how do we crack some of these cases i think i was crac king cases lik this that w alk up you know and they em to awful bad off cases boy so type of assessment was dapted to this which

of its breakthrough just to the degr ee that this 1965 development or i think it wa s even bef ore that is suddenly used now wer going to use it now do you get this do you get this youve had it all

011004 get in product ion is something you already got and you re going to get the idea of how ar we g oing to use this ou got it so you l ook ar ound and you will alway s find resou rces of this character so you start hell of campaign start hell of camp aign free gr een form im just givi ng you an idea f ree green f orm only green f orm wasnt popular people g ot awful tired of these green fo rms because they never had gr een f orm people began to shudder when you said gr een form so its fr ee ca analy sis case crac king analysis d ream it up any way you want to anyb ody wh appe ars at the rganization between f our and six in the af ternoon and so f orth will be given case cracking analysi s present this c ard now if your goin g to do that som ebodys goin g to have to run like hell to put the l inesin so that is why your org officer is not you r establishment off icer becaus the stablishment is har d enou gh to maintain with all thes wild hats runn ing ar ound in it without also having an org officer and product of ficer who are getting idea s so youre going to have to put in some temporary line its just temporary line youre going to have to beef it up more so the or g officer of the or ganization alway s to ask the pr oblem f how are we going to get this temporary l ine in in order to handle this new consumpti on of product so consumpti on of product here is vitally neces sary now how are we going to get these people received they walk in with this c ard they show this c ard to receptio n well does recept ion leav them the re for two hours now somebo dys got to have that recept ion and this person doesnt know his way ar ound through the or ganizati on so somebody s got to escort him down to this ter minal and then ther got to be an uditor who sits there and that auditor has to know how to do once through as sessment on the thing and then theres got to be some pr person perhaps the re to say how great that is but then that wouldnt give you that somebody ought to lead him back to the registrar about this time so the registrar gives him his results well if registrar gives him results the r egistrar can s ay buh itll only take five hours to handle this t wentyf ive hou rs to handle this it doesnt much matter what the registrar says or the r egistrar sa ys w ell that actually that actually car ries along with it the case cracking intensive which is of specified number of hours at all but it just costs x dollars oure not under any ob ligation to pay it feel better w don t you very good thats fine oh you do you want that oh well alright here sign on the d otted l ine and so forth and go on down the li ne and pay the c ashier and so on im very glad you ar than k you and youve g ot to have that line in if you havent got that line in all the ideas that the pr oducti on office r gets to increaseconsumpti on and get the six uditors busy wi ll fail we had the most marvelous marvelous caper one time it was called hospital caper and we had volunteer audito rs all over the place and certain number of hours of the day they wer goin g into hospitals and eing patients and peppin g them up and patting them on the bac k and so forth and giving them little cards ma rvelo us the person in char ge of the p roject broke it right in half and crashed the project right down through the middle in spite of the h ard work put in by these peop for week s you know how he did it ther was recepti on sitting at the other end f the ph one number these peop wer being given and the office he h ad had and was rented was never manned they couldnt reach it by pho ne they cou ldnt reach it by feet so the org officer is responsib to make sure that the lines exist febc09 productio n and the 5 24171 resour ces of the has febctapes 117 011004 now the has would eventu ally inc orporate this kind of thing into his organization now hes busily runn ing an or ganiz ation so the refore an has has to have hco xpediters who can then put together immediate type s of lines and set ups to handle special traff ic they usually send them int file and cf when years go they should have had two file clerk s in cf and theyr usually used xpediters to put together what hco should have long since had as establishm ent now an hco xpediter is som ebody wh goes do wn and gets in the special line and sits in as special cort wh handles the speci action so th at you dont have to remove peop from key posts in or der to fit out these wi ld ideas otherw ise the hco as is go ing to get very impatient wit h you wh at you need another recept ionist well well take one of the letter reg typists eah now he s hould have some hco expedite rs and if those people are not totally employed all the time then they ou ght to be studying so any slac k time they h ave any slac ktime they h ave dur ing the day then they oug ht to be studying if hes going to have ny full time people on cou rse who ar going to something or other something or other and he doesnt think he can affo rd full time people in cou rse whyd he m ake them hco expediters and then not send them of f to fix up file someplace but use them put in special traffic lines now an hcoas ther efore has to maint ain the est ablishment the establishm ent is pretty well established by or g boar d that or g boar d is not an arbitrary which simply sets up there is actu ally was produc tion oriented and the end f every one of those departments had product when we s tate that thing loud and clear and start to work it all backw ards we wind up with the s ame 67 org boar d we had in the past wh at do you know somebo dy must hav been bright someplace anyho w so hes actu ally organizing backwar ds even though hes organizing he thinks f rontwards becau hes got canned or g boar d that he puts there and bang that or g board is spot on is reason that makes him the first action he bui lds that or g boar d backwar ds how does he f ill it he fi lls it up to the degr ee that it is demanded by product ion so he expands his stablishment by increasing the postin g of his xisting org boar d and he too must hav resour ces and ive given you one of his po ols of resou rces now very of ten as you will find in the personnel series you have personnel people who think each divisi on particu larly the better runn ing divisions are personnel pools and if youve ever screams go up in all directions it s ssionair ing in the sea or g this is horrible chapter f something or other from the viewp oint of people who are trying to hold the organization there and k eep it going because missionai re has priority and this m akes m ad mess one day youve go t captain the ne xt day you havent you know i mean its that kind of thin g its that ghastly and dont think it doesnt just rip everythin g to ribbons but it is neces sary to do so because pr oducti on in the sea or g come s first product ion happen s tobe scient ology ar ound the worl d and it is now expandin g to be scient ology ar ound the world so sionai re has to go has to go has to go well thats th at alright the r est f us wil l cope one way or the ot her now actually it puts to heavy bur den on in the sear or g the division is the thir d mate the hco now it puts to heavy burden on him and so on but he should get clever febc09 productio n and the 6 24171 resour ces of the has febctapes 118 011004 he should get clever the re are some ol d fos that talk bout missionair unit so hes got second p ool second pool he has so hes got sionaire unit now in view of the fact ther he avy demand on highly trained personnel you r sionair unit spend most of its time at home on guar d duty and s tudy and therefore you have very highly trained peop and you can circulate people who ar succe ssful missionai res and also ho lding executive posts r less exhaulted posts you can ci rculate them int the missionai re unit and so on and take people in the missionair unit and put them on up there are ways and means by which you can shif t this sort of thing around but it gives the personne l pool so the main p roblem of an has is personnel pools becau his main flub exclam ation point is stroying whatever or ganizati on has been put ther alright somebody is working working working working working to put qual there and they work hard and they get the peop trained in and gr ooved in and then ne xt thing you know hco regards qual as personnel pool or theres nother thing becau qual can be dou bled in bras s with tech in an organization you get the disgraceful action of weve got backlog now so i have all the qual auditors and so f orth they re going to have to audit on the tech li nes oh boy thats nuts but it sa ys the person in charge of hco s not allowed for an ebb and fl ow of traff ic and does not have ny audito r pool so who does itsay is ou t the has he di d not predict so hes operating on resou rces now what ar his ba sic resour ces his ba sic resour ces you sa of treasury r money thats also the hass resour ces p eople hatted peop trained peop very valuable people peop of all sorts and descript ions not just this blank fi filled up with body i told you the other day you can find all the bod ies you want in mortuary so he must be runn ing some kind of an hco which is pove rty hco becau he doesnt have the r esou rces that you would expect fr om an hco so he has to unmock what he builds thats kind of crazy fel low builds house then to build second ho use he has to take all the timbers out of the first house to build the second house and then he ta kes out the it s nuts and somebody comes along one day nd says say simple simon why don t you have pile of spare lumber oh i couldnt do that i cou ldnt get that th rough fp yeah well they cant affo rd that oh i woul dnt say cant affor d that if i were an has at that point i wou ld sha ke my he ad at every fp meeting sadly wh ile looking at the p roduct ion officer sigh i woul dnt ever say anything any time anybody as ked for anything i wou ld say wh you fellows get around to producin g something you can come back nd talk to why dont you produce something with what youve got w ould be my st andar d attitude as an has i must hav instantly and at once twenty sp ares twenty spare what twenty spar staff members yeah what for for having spares yeah i know but theres only fifteen st aff members in the or g id say i know im tired of transferring fifteen transfers every week ou must be run ning thirtyfive man or g that must be whats wr ong wi th this place thats the why youre tryin g to run thirtyfive man org with f ifteen men and yet we dont see m to have enough money here to deal with not making very much money all seems to be very sa d i febc09 productio n and the 7 24171 resour ces of the hasfebctapes 119 011004 wonder if we should nt train up pr oducti on office r see this kind of thing you know it could get dirty after while but when p roduct ion is not adequate for the est ablishm ent then the establishm ent goes po or in all of its resour ces and its main r esou rces of course ar trained staff members willing audito rs who want to come on st aff it inclu des the state being coaxed into lookin g around and if the re arent any cheap empty of fice bu ilding around here its l ooking around and eing whether or not the re arent some thisa s and thata s and how can we get bunch of file cabinets the wrong way to go about it is to p resent to fp eight thousand six hund red and fiftyfive do llars for three new st eel desks for the pr oduct officer org officer and has thats not quite the way to go about it the fello w is now pulling the incr edible and the incredible is is trying to spend money you dont got and it can be done in this society to show you how clever the society is they re alway s willing for you to spend money you dont have so you have to safegu ard that and we ar ourselve s and we ar solvent and we do exist and we do still own our souls and we ar not in the pock ets of the inte rnational bankers solely becau we make everything make its own way and that is the basic action that i have hear d actually that some members of orgs wonder why i dont pay them better it will be somebo dy in keokuk or cococom see why i dont pay them better i dont know im not even in charge of their boar d of directors the answer to the question of how they arent see theyr asking the wrong question the answer to the question is why do nt they wear their hat and do their job in quantity so that eventually the org will get mo re money and they c an be paid more see elementary the answer to the stion is r ight on their skull now this is then the ecol ogy that economic dog eat dog framewo rk or dogs eat cat s and cat s eat rat s or something the eco logy if this universe in wh ich we are dealing and theecology of the universe is th at staff members who produce get paid hass that put an establishment there that is h atted and trained to functi on and so f orth has he avy income potent ial and pr oducti on officer who is able to spot producti on and get the product ion out of that line and who is able to persuade consumpti on persuade those peop he s in pr promot ion distribution wher ever he has if he c an persuade consumpti on to occur as he raises his product ion why he is all set and peop wil l just get p aid more and more money and the next thin g you know st aff member is decla sse who doesnt drive up in rolls r oyce but you have to think in that way in rder to bring about that r esult now in view of the fact that we ar ent aiming for rolls royces but we have n entirely different target ther efore it goes into the field of volume and quality viability will pretty well take care of itself if you r volume and quality is adequate so your first poin t that you alway s now let give you letter reg sequence her this is fo r an has what wou ld he be persuaded to do he cou ld instant hat letter reges thats goi ng to give you volume he mini hats them that gives you some quality he r eally hats them that gives you viabili ty the first one is volume and you as m anager alway s demand fi rst and foremost volume as your first demand and then when you ve got your volume you demand as your second action quality of the vo lume and then your third action youve got to calculate and so forth as viabil ity febc09 productio n and the 8 24171 resour ces of the has febctapes 120 011004 now if you don t calculate it som ewhat backw ards and fi gure out what your viabil ity predicti on is you also wi ll have an awful time of it but right now we have n organizational runaway patter n that is fanta stic its ola and in just few succe ssive wee ks they have vaulting height their peaks although they k from the pea ks the peaks on those wee ks give you curve that sa ys with in about seven or eight weeks something on the or der of aboutfifty thousand within two or three months it says som ethin g like about eighty thousand and certainly withi n five months it will be hitt ing hund red tho usand i wonder what the third mate t aola is doing what hes thinking what hes wor rying about he doesnt think its any part of his hat and if he doesnt wear that as his hat and ta ke that predicted vaulting it tells you that the or ganization reached its m akebreak point as far as staff members wer concer ned certainly at about forty tho usand and that put that wh ole staff under considerable strain at about that because they didnt have quite all of those p osts covered and they didnt have this and they didn t have that and they r eally had to get down and swe at to keep the lines running and to keep thei r quality up well that would be br eakdown of the has so it tells you that at ola within five mont hs they h ave to have double thei r staff double the trained audito rs they h ave double the sp ace they have and ok it takes months to get people r ecruited trained and so forth who is swe ating on it and ill tell you at this moment there isnt anybody worrying about it but d you see what the predicti on is so that is what an has has to d he has to think in ter ms of and there isnt any has thinking in those ter ms ctually theres been hat written in these ter ms because this is you r product org officer system but this is the h at so ther condemnati on of that but that is the ter ms of that becau he s to furnish the tablishment and if he has to furnish the est ablishment the w rong time to furnish the stablishment is af ter its hit th ree times what the rganization can possibly handle and when its hit that to do the rganization and establishing that you should have done five months go oh god this behind hand action is pretty ho rrible now i can tell you right now wer cracking the roof on eur ope europes go ing to be run away we do have sc andinavian team in training of four peop thats scandinavianteam of four people oh we have got project go ing right at this moment thats go ing to knock the spots off of europe all books cou rses we re setting up and were engineeri ng it one way or the other we finally f ound out ho w the slots d rop into place and ho w financin g not financing but how we are going to build up to this line we dont have to worry about the financin g its just t aken care of in nor mal course of hum an events were translating into each pr inciple eur opean language the lot an oec shsb c has course b ooks only previously it was not translatable becau of the fanta stic print ing cost that it woul d have invo lved the viability factor then did not forgive it you could have put out million dollars tran slating and publ ishing bo oks and that sort of thing it woul d have been fabul ous someb ody reach in his pock et and does this you have to wait for an idea and think up an idea of how you can do this t apes site translation like they d at the united nations i got the idea st february its taken us while to get u s underway here febc09 productio n and the 9 24171 resour ces of the has febctapes 121 011004 site translation site translator can hear the thing in his ear and when hes really trained spit it out in the othe r language so its just going right over onto tapes then we can copy the most tapes nd we c an sell tapes and we m ake it mand atory for every one of those orgs to buy complete new set of all of their tape s every three months theyll wear them out we get their promoti on projects nd so forth going theyr all on tapes we dont have to translate nythin g on paper and so on were gearing up and alerting scandinavian or gs right now in the swedish ar ea start figuring out how you re going to get your tape r ecorders kids and what your goin g to be do ing ther will be other projects to graduate them into it and all of sudden in their midst why they will have has and other materials and theyllall be in swed ish sam things go ing to happen in france sa thing will happen in ger many and so on weve bust ed the language b arrier its alway s been wor ry about how we were goin g to do this alr ight we do it now the only other thing weve got to w orry about is how do we get multilingual lrh comm wh is site tran slator can ta ke the dispatche s of that organization and translate them on tape or send it on through for his ad ministrative act p robably be body in the organization speaks any english at all dianoute x and when we get it into russian thats it probably well put it in lithuanian polish borderline so we re hitt ing int boom in this in russia r ussias booming on the s ubject they re fumb ling all ar ound trying to figure out what the psyche is all about they fin d out that thats legitimate spher of research the gover nment isnt controlling so int the middle of this bo om we simply releas russian sciento logy so anyhow weve been trying to figure out how to how to penetrate that zone and area now the only reason you re not making any penetr ation in some ar eas is becau materials are the re nob ody s totally translated what wer doin g into what we are doing were putting out knowledge and with that knowledge and with the actions whic h that knowledge has you can get gain p roduct ion case change ability and that sort of thing but the basic of it is knowledge and when you get it right down to it and do an nalysis of the thing why here is pr oduct called knowledge and the consumption of that knowledge is guaranteed but look you have to have the bulletins you have to have the tape s you have to have the cou rse s uperv isor wh says and you read this bu lletin now and then see that the student reads that bullet in w thatd be something new and who d oesnt assign him condit ion of enemy bec ause he doped off midway to but goes over and as ks him what is misunderstoo d alright what kind of organizati onal structur does that ma ke what is the est ablishmentstructur did you notice that i included the oec it would be fatal not to put the oec in with it now i can tell you something else th ats fatal ou put in fragment of something and it ll boom and collapse so if you put in fragment of what your org cou ld be exporting with knowledge it will boom and it wi ll collapse if you put in fragment of you r produc t if i werent talking to you w about the responsibi lities f establishin g establishm ent i know it seems very rambli ng when i talk to you about this bec ause you say the has has nothin g to febc09 productio n and the 10 24171 resour ces of the has febctapes 122 011004 do with finance and boy he doesnt he can spend you poor boy well we just weve g ot these sixty s taff members i dont know why wer we got em we got the staff members audito rs amongst them don t have course supervisors hats um we got est ablishm ent theres sixty staff members six ty unhatted peop wou ld behave lik about sixty ene mies man t each other theyd be at ach othe rs thr oats in time so he doesnt have sixty man st aff he s sixty man mob so he doesnt have an establishm ent yes he s great deal to do with this sort of thi ng so somebo dys got to ta ke responsib ility for the establishment and ive elected him it now if the or g office r takes responsibil ity for the stablishment acr oss the line he wi ll cease to help the product of ficer and you know very well that if he ceases to help the pr oduct officer the p roduct officer will start falling on his head so the w rong division of dut ies obvi ously is the rg officer taking responsibi lity for the est ablishment the rig ht division of duties w ould be for the has to take responsibil ities fo r the establishm ent and get one there that funct ioned and get the people hatted and checked out the wrong action for an or g officer w ould be to turn around to an has and sa give th ree staff members at once because i have got to beef up the empty fast fl owing postsof and f or the has to pick of f peop off of other fast flowing p osts and give them to the org officer thats nuts the has wo uld have to look ar ound and find wher he had some peop and if he looks around and finds he snt got any spar peop hes one of these poo r sods that s just standing in bread line clear at the end with on ly gallon of coffee and h alf loaf of bread to give ou t to hundr ed men hes poo r we ough t to give him special clothes you know with ragged cuf fs and if you turned ar ound to treasury and you had to run sion or something of the sort and you said to treasury we need two hundr ed and fif ty dollars in order to pay the xpense s of this and treasury said im sorry dont have any money becaus we didnt ma ke any provision for this and all our moneys in the bank and ther isnt any way to do it theyd say he isnt doin g his j ob well look at the has l ook at the has resour ces what ar the realities now let give you little piece of stuff which emer ged out of socialism ther few bits in socialism which are sound think the most of it is balder dash but this is very sound think t he wealth of the wo rld are the r eal things in the world and that is wealth and money is only substitute fo r wealth and is not itself wealth and that is true money is on ly valid to the degree that it can substitute f or actual wealth money is only of any u to the deg ree that it can pu rchase things of value value is established by things that ar wanted value is est ablished by wantedne ss you can then fluxuate value by m aking scarcities and demand s and so f orth but it is ba sically wantedne ss kensian ph ilosophy which he tried to say wa s econ omics is valid unless you put it in the field of econ omics it is valid in the fiel d of producti on its not valid in the field of money and i think he mu st have gotten couple of thin gs cr ossed but as far as produc tion is concer ned you also have to create want what you are selling is absolutely priceless wh atwere selling here on flag i think you will agree is priceles s ther isnt any possible price febc09 productio n and the 11 24171 resour ces of the has febctapes 123 011004 could be placed on it so its pr ice is what can be r eceived for it not what is it worth but what can be r eceived for it greater or less er so pricing is bas ed totally really not on value but what can be r eceived for it and that value is total ly how much it is wanted and out of very very close k nowledge of those and once you get all of thes factors disentangled and all added up in you r skull you can est ablish how much establishment the has can put ther has nothing whatsoever to do with any firm factor of well im an has i will now put up an org boar d and this or g should be m anned wi th fifty peop and we wi ll now put some d own the line and we wi ll put the peo ple theres blan k space s on this or g board and well put the peop in those blan k space s and so f orth right thing to do is to put up the rg boar d and then p ost it to the deg ree that it is r equired to back up producti on and you bu ild it up now youl l find that command l ines of the org board will go absolutely mad if you dont bui ld in from the top so obvi ously the f irst pr oduct ion man that you put on is in charge of everything and does the p roduct ion youve got one auditor he obviously is in char ge of all auditing while he is doing all the auditin g and he is bviously the product ion man for all auditin g so its bui lt from the top to that degree but then when theres more auditing why it must be becau ther more demand f or auditing so want has been created about auditing and that is ba sically done by the ci rculation of books b ooks always run out in front of the organization the st ats of an organization are actu ally almost monitored by the degr ee that the knowledge has been ci rculated they ar dir ect coordinati on its actually not even by the degree of sales talk put out its stats of an organization are proportional to the amount f knowledge circulated by the organizationso the has builds according to the s tats he can bui ld by if he buil ds an or ganizati on at the cost f fifty per cent of the income of the or ganization hes r eally doing great r ich has is one wh has reserves r esou rces now the we alth of the wo rld are actualit ies an has is we althy to the degree that he has trained staff members that he has trained st aff members in reserve special p roducts is being asked to plea find w ork fo r five fully trained audit ors we ar not using at this moment on the pr oduct ion line how would you like to hear r emark lik that wouldnt that be remarkable but that could be s tatement which is m ade by the has i got five audito rs i dont want to assign them int the administrative lines havent you got some kind of project where they can go out and audit arc breaks or something do something or cant you think up something or somethin g now you can run it the other way to look i want to have her fiftyfive man organization and weve on ly go t thirty man organization and at the present moment we c an only affor d thirty man or ganization cant we inc rease pr oducti on or demand r something in some w ay so th at we c an increase our number s organizationally so that we do get up into zone wher we ar runnin g wher we have few reserve s instead of just as king to pul l musical chairs every day any day of the wee k that wou ld be very comf ortable positio n so pleas cant we get the inc ome up huh i noticed when we we re collecting stats st week ive got it here wher is this s tat here yeah oh yeah hm yeah l etters out letters out dropped yes i know but we re tryin g febc09 productio n and the 12 24171 resour ces of the has febctapes 124 011004 to get quality in ooh first you get in volume and then you get in quality and then you will have viability now hes dealing with some inter esting coins how many auditin g hours can the or ganizationfurnish how many instruct or minutes c an the or ganization furnish how many student hou rs can the or ganization furnish how many publ ic cou rses per unit per person can the rganization furnish and that would be r esour ces survey f an has how many hours how many hours well that s mon itored by how many auditin g rooms how many uditors how many this how many that and so forth so an has should know the r esour ces of his rganization he should know its actual wealth that he h as fair resour ces r additi onal r esou rces depends upon his knowledge of the existing resour ces never saw s uch silly thing in my life as set of graphs come in her one day an organization had about ten audito rs who were auditi ng six hours week ea ch oh whos kidding the re must hav been som ebody in that ar ea that was just th rowing the gold coins of that organization right over the side boy he was just thr owing them int the sewer just as fast as he cou ld pick them up and th row them aw ay six auditors count em up ho w many uditing hours should six auditors furnish that s hund red and fi fty auditin g hou rs or six auditors at twenty five hou rs week v ery well done auditing ho urs too resour ces this organization can fur nish that these auditing hours are worth this much unles s were selling by pac kages so we ought to be selling by pack ages we shouldn t be selling by hours bec ause its to expensive and it appears too expen sive to the public to sell these uditing hours in this fashion so we p robably should sell by pac kages and so forth so therefore the pack age selling and so on and so on and so on but nevertheles s the coins the gold coins which that or ganizati on is spending and has to spend are auditing hours and if theyr not spent this week they cant be spent ever again funny money its real wi ld money if you dont spend it you havent got it how many student hou rs can this or ganization deliver hours of students on course alright theres only room for twenty students in this or ganization if you jam them in with shoe ho rn now eachstudent is go ing to spend eight hours day on class so each student is wo rth eight hou rs and they re going to be twenty students so you can fur nish what in day how many s tudent hours those ar your coins now do you understand why i say the has is very poor if he does not have r esour ces those are his r esour ces supposing hes got hund red and sixty staff members and he s as organizational p roduc tion coins twenty five twenty five auditi ng hours supp osing he s one instructo r for seven course s now thats instructo r minutes per course now you subtract that dow n to instructo r minutes per potential student so hes got one course superviso r and hes got one audito r and he has hundr ed and sixty s taff members does that sound crazy to you well i exaggerated bit so that it sounds r eal crazy the organizationd be br oke in time do you see th at uh theres noth ing to delive r how the hell could he deliver anything the h as an d the co ins of the organiza tion 7101 c24 s febc 10 24 january 1971 an organization which would leave an or ganization has so many registrar minutes to invest and the r egistrar minutes it has to invest determines the number of sign ups which an organization has interviews with the r egistrar two hundr ed and eighty four is somebody kiddin g for one registrar figure it out fo r you rself ther tw hund red and eighty four interv iews during the wee k then how many r egistrar minutes coul d ther have been spent with each pr ospect and you ll find out that it couldn t have been at all they must have dusted off chair in the waiting room or somethin g do you get how you figure out the coi ns this is the inte rnal economy of an organization and the ar the real factors of economy now its the has that m akes them av ailable to be spent hes in char ge of the personnel hes in charge of the lines and hes in char ge of the sp aces so he also must be in charge of the potent ial co ins th at the or ganizatio n has to spend not dollars they re worthles s hes in charge of how many auditing hours the hgc can fur nish how many instruct or minutes c an be fu rnished ho w many interviews done ho w many typist minutes which cont ributes di rectly to typist letters you dont sit ar ound all the time wonder ing about this letter stat get real its typist minutes how long does it take typist to type letter and you will immediately see exactly that you have ceiling now the letter registrar that is dic tating the letters is th at many registrar minutes but that r equired certain number of folder actions and you can immediately deter mine how many letters ou t the rganization can achieve now this is economy im not now talking about this co rny hungar ian stunt wher they go around and tell wilson well all you got to do is borrow hund red llion billion from the ne xt inter national bank er that comes thats not econ omy thats crap w ere talking about real things w ere talking about real things were talking about typist minutes and you sit down its an element ary exercise in arithmetic what s you r letters out w ell if you re going to have to do letters out and if somebody wants the letters out stat up theres goin g to have to be another typist and then to keep her busy why therell probably have to be two more typists to k eep letter registrar busy so youre going to have to hire an entir ely new team of two typ ists and letter registrar and then thats go ing to keep central files in worse tur moil and so on so were probably going to febc10 the has and the c oins f 2 24171 the organi zation febctapes 126 011004 have to put somebody on to central fi as liaison ou want more letters ou t i have to have four peop central f iles clerk additi onal central files clerk additi onal letter registrarand two additi onal typists to keep up with this one letter r egistrar now you got producti on now you g ot letters ou t now the degr ee that the has see s that their hats get put on the quality of that pr oducti on will get very good they can bang out any old kind of letter weve received one of the funniest letters her i once in while staff member r somebody an aide r somethings name wil l appe ar of course on som old organizational cf r addr ess file and they wil l get they wil l get letter from this rganization see in cococ omo or som place and they quite often ar quite go od dont worry about that but we received one one day that wa s hilarious the letter said dear blank ou are inv ited signed marvelous letter oh their quality could be imp roved but with that short letter i imagine their vo lume wa s pretty go od so anyw ay the has can go at slip shod basis and just ho pe that it all happens in some fa shion and sit there with total cacopho ny and mes s going around in his vicin ity and the lines just all go ing so on listen i f its entur bulated in an hco then the hco does not have contr ol of the lines of the or ganization obvi ously so wher would should be the first point of calm in an organization the calme st most orderly place in the rganization should be hc if hco is woo f woof and wow w ow and zom zoo and then the lines ar goin g and ther mobs of people busting in and so on and etcetera and i wont give you much for the rest of the lines in the or ganizatio n they couldn t possibly be under cont rol now heres one for you heres product org office r datum the product officer and the rg officer separate right at the poi nt of line when the or g officer zone is enter ed its t the p oint of line the product office r who finds himself handling line is already int the pr ovince of the or g officer cause the or g officer and ssential part of organization is the lines simple thing like the dispatch that get s from here to ther and so onnow produc t officer of any sort what soever is running with out lines he doesnt have any lines he doesnt have ny lines t all hes goin g around as basic observational actions mainly but we get into thing whe re line ill differentiate this exactly its wher line s to be fo rmed in the or ganizatio n whe re line has to be formed at that po int and at that xact point an or ganizational line has to be handled or put in you have now enter ed the province of the or g officer you cou ld out f self defense as product office r get somebo dy to do something that had to be done at that moment to go through but the s econd that you have to transfer this person or do somethin g like that and so on you re into the p rovince of the rg officer you often find yourself in that province in producti on now the ba sic lines of the or ganizatio n are in the cont rol of the has and those lines all have to be ne at and so on so it is noth ing for produc t officer to find something out with the lines this is the main thi ng he f inds out so therefore an org officer ought to do dummy runs and ther tw types of dummy runs the res just plain dummy runs you just g through the or ganiz ations publ ic lines one way or the other try to get hired or something like this or try to take advant age of this new fr ee offer and go int the proper point and so f orth and just try to get it you som etimes fin d you rself in practically fist fight febc10 the has and the c oins f 3 24171 the organi zation febctapes 127 011004 well what you fin d out is pa ssed to the has thats pas sed to the has as direct signal that his li nes have to be stablished at this po int the other type f dummy run is bull bait and you take whole bunch of questions ta ke whole bunch of questions wh ich the public would be pr one to ask and youl l be surpr ised how funny some of the questions ar and you just dream up these stions w ell i have check her on the f armers bank ofde moine s and it is fo r two thousand do llars and i owe you two hund red and sixty dollars so if you could give the change why then i would be happy to buy the fu ff fuff and so forth and see what your cashier does see what he sa ys see if he handles it at all and you find out the bulk f the ca shiers just sort f say get out get out yah thats not the pr oper public response and therefore your bull bait you r bull bait dummy runs pay off becau the bull bait dummy run test s the personne l just the plain dummy run just tests the line d oes the line xist even if you say things to the personnel does the line exist but it takes bull bait dummy run to test the personne l so the rganizing officer in his sp are time cou ld very easily th row in plain dummy runs and bul l bait dummy runs and so fo rth and hell furnish lot of the material f or the has so if the has we re on the ball hed run his own dummy runs wouldnt he its actu ally an i r functi on to do dummy run form one dummy runs that sort of thing so is ther an establishment ther is all the or ganiz ation or the organizing officers trying to find out is ther an establishment ther now the has of course is being fi xed firmly with the r esponsib ility for putt ing the stablishment ther and you re going to get all kind s of vagaries and hes go ing to get in all kinds of trouble and he s going to get in all kinds of arguments and hes also go ing to get all kind s of wins because one f the ar guments hes going to get immediat ely is w cant affor d it as m atter of fact in washingt on at one time ther was only one thing that wa s ever came out f any finance li nes and so forth we dont have any money and they had found this as the p at patter n answer to anything that was br ought up by anybody and they foun d this alway s worked and this was how not to give any i forget who was who was handli ng money there at that time but it was just that and i kept he aring this comi ng back on the lineswe don t have ny money it was an er rant lie i think t that particu lar time f or washington we had fabulous reserve and we wer running along great the st aff was well paid and everything of the sort and we dont have any money well it was r because it was lie but this was how it cou ld never do anything so that is the wr ong answer we don t have any money but he wi ll run int this he will run into inference s like this so he should always prove his point and the w ay he proves his p oint to show the coins he has these ar the coins which we have and the coi ns ar the volume potential volume of product ion per department for the final p roduct of the department not nece ssarily the fi nal valuable p roduct of the rg but these ar the coins which i am furnishing and we should be getti ng so and so and if wer not then ther something wrong some place else not someb ody is neglect ing to bring about demand fo r consumpti on the cr eated want isnt there and if i can furnish one hundr ed and fif ty coins called auditing hours per week in the hgc and im not febc10 the has and the c oins f 4 24171 the organi zation febctapes 128 011004 being asked to furnish any more then ther is som ethin g wrong therefore sale s and delivery must be very out now it isnt up to him to manage the thin g its up to him to hat things its up to the product ion officer to say what can be p roduced and to bring about consumpti on of the product so by the w ay thats why you wi ll eventually have to have pr man as staff member of the see its pradvert ising type liaison as part of the pr oducti on officer im just neglecti ng to mention its part of that persons duties to br ing about actions whic h inc rease consumpti on hed cr eate want and so on so producti on man couldnt actually operate to long wi thout pr assistance whether he was doin g it himself as i used to do or whether it was being done for him thats why he h as pr manthe rest of it is is hes handlin g human emoti on and r eacti on inside the rganization but remember he has public outside and that public outside is actually of senior imp ortance to the publ ic op inion inside and hes got to test that and he w ould know what tone scale to launch his campaigns and his ad s at and he could collect ol d succe ssful campaigns that wer succes sful and wher the peop came from that bought services som earlier time and all of this sort of thing can be done so ther efore it puts product ion man in char ge of consumpti on to know this but nevertheles s its the hass r esponsib ility to furnish the coins which will meet that consumpti on for instance he coul d actu ally go down department after department and demonstrate how many hours of product ion how many p roduct ion coins th at is to sa how many auditing hours how many instruct or hours how many this and that ho w many s tudent hours pardon instructor minutes student hou rs how many bu lk mail mailings how many letters ou t how many this and so fo rth and he coul d cast up the immediate st at of the or ganization now an organization that just runs accidentally on stats is not being run that or ganization is runn ing the person it s running the has and of cou rse his ar eall be very confused he should and cou ld carry shadow line on graph which wou ld tel l him immediately who to hat he knows what the well done auditing ho urs of the organization should be becau he has th at many audito r hou rs to expend so the very wel l done auditing hours and so forth or well done auditin g hou rs ought to be the number he is furnishing its very simple hes put the coin there to be spent s it been spent alright so the well done auditing hours ar twenty five and he has potent ially got himself hund red and fifty well do ne auditing hours it shows up on the stat t once the st at of the or ganization so he knows it s sour so he knows he snt got an tablishment doesnt he hes go t flubso who does he hat what does he fin d of course its quite obvi ous what hed find in that particu lar ca hed find registrar and he woul d then find tech sec he wou ld also look at how many we re done and how many wer well done and he finds out that eighty were done hundr ed and fif ty could have been done eighty wer done and twenty five wer very well done and ou t of those figu res he knows who to hat who to demote who to promote febc10 the has and the c oins f 5 24171 the organi zation febctapes 129 011004 and what type f personnel hes got to have t once so he is in contr ol of the est ablishm ent isnt he so for every department he could have stat and that st at would tell him exactly how many letters could be got ten out how many this could be done how many th at could be done how many students coul d be handled he cou ld map the who establishm ent the who establishm ents st at ceiling and that you could call stat ceili ng that stat ceiling per department would give you exactly what the potential of the stablishment wa s if it was not running close to that potential then it wa s running ineff iciently and there was something wrong with the pr oducti on officer or the or g officer now lets say nine tenths of these stat s run great and the ot her st at doesnt w ell this would be m atter of conference on that poi nt wouldnt it so by stat ceiling you could measure you r establishment and if you havent asured your establishm ent by st at ceil ing as an has then you cou ldnt possibly have any idea of who was doing what with this c ar now it s one thing to put bus ther and its another thing to get it driven and surpr ise surprise he cou ld stil l handle he can still hire bus dr ivers now the ctual potential and capability of productio n officer would be how many of those co ins ar spent ther the s tat ceili ng how cl ose is the s tat to the stat ceiling andthat is the effectiveness of the divisio nal pr oducti on office r the divisional secr etary or the product ion officer f the rg whats the st at ceil ing now people could get rig ht puzzled with when i keep cra shing in to tech services and sa ying hey hey hey hey get this point on and then not beef it up or somethin g like this see som ething w rong here som ethings wr ong looking around looking around looking around looking ar ound well that s because it hasnt approached the sa number of hours as are available you look down you find out we have five fully qualif ied audit ors on full time training uh uh uh uh uh uh five ful ly quali fied auditors on full time ahh w find that we wi ll be needing who bunch of hdcs who are ot 3 but i find all the hdcs being trained as cla ss vis and ar not spending thei r time on adv anced courses uhh you get the idea so these ar the criteria by which you ope rate now if youve got stat ceilin g and you ve got your stats matter how big or how small the or ganiz ation is what have you got ou got the effectivene ss of the has the effectiveness of the p roduct officer and the effectivenes s of the rg officer the effectiveness of the has is in question on ly to the deg ree that he s hatted peo ple what s his hatting and training what w as his r ecruitin g thats how that brings his in question the utilization of that time that brings in the p roduct officer how many p roducts are turning off of this l ine theres things lik comp letions completion gets into the airy fairy land now the product officer who can tur n out more completi ons per unit of auditing time without going quick hes goo d product officer how many of these courses c an we finish up r ight now i could do horrible thing as product office r particu larly here theres lot of peop who have come to the s hip and so on who have an awful lot of incomplete cycles in terms of courses l you d have to d is survey how many course s they had and then survey ho w close they we re to the end of which which cou rse wer they close st to the end of which gradeor which this or which that or which other thing in other words you d full full survey so febc10 the has and the c oins f 6 24171 the organi zation febctapes 130 011004 you had all the cou rses all the grade s everyth ing else d this sit down as product ion office r shoot his complet ion stat by simply making everyb ody f inish up that one that was closest to the end on the cou rses get all of these all f these all fin ished up see br rr you would have actu ally an instructo r minute situation which was minimal and you woul d have you woul d have this fant astic completi on st at now very dirty trick wou ld be to move off then and put another product officer on the job and sa you see and then for years later say w ell when i was product fficer of that or g ctually he woul d have done well because those people should have completed those thin gs but you can alway s you can alw ays find some pr oducts lying ar ound the only point im ma king now therefore there is dif ference betwe the pr oduct office r and the has the has has got simply the facility there to produce the product hes just got the facil ity to produce the p roduc t by his h atting he can handle the contr ol that is he c an contr ol the quality of it to some slight degr ee to considerable degree actu ally but actu ally its the product officer who can play ducks nd drakes with this line up and he could either make it look awful or he can make it look ter rific and it wou ld be the pr oduct office r who to marked deg ree mon itored the size of the est ablishm ent you got that if hes goin g to have much of an est ablishm ent hes going to have to do an wful lot of pr advertising survey type actions hes go ing to have to really know boy and hes have to have his have to have that special p rograms units ove r ther pocketa pock eta pocketa pocketa on special p roject pilots pil ots pi lots pi lots pilots pilots lets see if we cant whydont you appr oach som old ladies i underst and that there is hotel outside the city which has lot of resident lets put an audito r in there sounds mad it doesnt matter out of all of this all of sudden one pays off the total cost of running all these s pecial program s is peanuts nd the income of one of them is half million bucks do you see w ell that ta kes care of all the rest of them its the pr oduct office r doesnt keep shootin g the wh ole rganization into and every time i release piece of tech or ganizati ons unfo rtunately try to shoot the wh ole f their product ion line into this new action i could shoot them i could just s hoot them in cold blood they keep doin g it why do they do it i d ont know i think its pecul iarity which also shows itself in some feb c student applicant some time or another will move aboard the ship and he will say its fascinating bulletin even though it is several years ol d he wouldnt say it if he knew what hi larity it produces the rebuttal to the thing is is the law of gravity has gone out because it wa s discover ed in 16 49 you get the point im ma king now even with all this pr oduct system nd so forth we havent antiquated the rg board what org board did we fall back to we fall back to the be st product ion org boar d we had whic h was 67 you wont find theres very much violated along the line w ere putting the c ream on top of this ca ke now alright im not trying to make fun of febcs dont look so cont rite but it is nuttines s and im just talking about it because it is nuttiness yester days pr ocess we cant use nymo re becaus weve got this process im sitting here right now playing mean trick just because of this an vicious sn arling trick cfebc 10 the has and the coins of 7 24171 the organi zation febctapes 131 011004 tually im t the truth of the matter is were handlin g such dynamite in this new rund own which we have that it actually couldnt go into orgs that wou ld flub any we had somebodyover list the other day and knock ed case just little tiny flu b like that p oof straightened it all out yeah but ooh im t nece ssarily although it wi ll look so deter mined that they will use what they have at this time the real reason is because its got to be very very groovy rg indeed before they c an handle this otherw ise itd just blow them ri ght ff the face of the earth so if you l ook int this if you look into this with care you will find out that the p roduct officer will make all of his ca sh out of yesterdays development and theres wher he gets his overages now i told you the tr ick of making somebody finish up the cou rse he could really shoot the moon and he s ends somebody out on his pr line or the person who is serving pr in the or g and so fo rth will you please go around and survey how many courses people have started that they hav not do ne now wer going to get all those cat s back in and we re going to fin ish off their courses eah but you cant get ny money for that oh yes you can ouve got your nerve ma king anybody given course ill show you product fficer goof there was product officer the re but this is goof to end all goofs the eight cou rse got longer and l onger and longer and lon ger and finally i think the person has to be n eight the mo re newly graduated eights ar all ninety year s old well do you know whats contained in that p ackage this is wasting the facilities f an or ganizati on w so the has puts them ther now they can be wast ed by the p roduct officer or they can be made c apital out of by the pr oduct office r so im just showing you the r elationship between the two the has hes got the coins ther to spend ho w do they get spent let show you this go of ther was an eight course it took us th ree week s to teach the eight course we taught it with ferocity we shouldnt have probably made engrams all over the cou rse i know its been succ essful ever since w ell i was thrown overb oard fivetimes on the r oyal sco tsman you can hear it now its actu ally the badge of the eight in huge survey it wa s only menti oned twice through eights and so fo rth and one of them had distracted him so he coul dnt pay any attention to the course but all due respect to that youll have to cut all that out cause its very bad pr ever to br ing up flap you know the main strength and aw kwar dnes s of this is we had course why didnt peo ple go on teachin g the cou rse oh they added every bul letin that came out afterwar ds to the eight every bul letin every bullet in yeah the eight course chec ksheet got bigge r and big ger and fatter and fatter they wer still selling it for the sa amount f money now what would product ion officers r eactio n to this be student hours instruct or minutes he wa s throwing them away throwing away s tudent hours and instruct or minutes he was also throwing away cash now lets add to it this one everybody who come s from an shsb c taught in this s to be retrained so we retrain them befor we teach the eight course and then the eight course of course inc ludes all the bu lletins whic h have been is sued in the line from 68 til 70 geezu s christ viability goes out the win dow at this point why febc10 the has and the c oins f 8 24171 the organi zation febctapes 132 011004 the price of the eight cou rse is now cover ing in ter ms of instructo r minutes it s now cover ing an shs bc an eight course and all the stuff since and do you know what the course line up r eally is it should be an shs bc retread fo r which that sh should be char ged full price by the giving org audit or come s in clas s vi cant audit thats it retread well run retread cou rse well teach you how to audit that s it the bill immediately for an shsb c goes to that sh and boy ill tell you in very short order they will cease to give f lubby shsbc courses righ t alright the eight course is th ree wee ks long guy comes in goes home hes an eight now it is something to be an eight i f you dont believe it try to w ork with six on eight techno logy who isnt an eight or try to work with person of upper techno logy above eight who doesnt know the eight technolo gy uagh ho rrible so the guy really never even had chance to become an eight see becau he wa s so interested in comi ng her actually theres an auditor band which starts just bef ore the xterior ization run down and runs up to about the midd of 1970 which is nine and bel ieve ther plenty there theres plenty there theres plenty to know about that stuff and starting then for sure we have h ad to specially train stellar eights and guys who were nine had to specially train these guys to make them tens so it isnt anybo dy try ing to merchandise something you want to know why somebody cant do give class iv an xteriorization run d own well they just make mess of it exteri orizati on run down should be done only by nines theres bulletin out which brings this about but i havent the courses emer ge yet every moment those cou rses ar not publ icized every moment that those cou rses ar not in at any ao any moment every second that theyr not in is costing the real coins f the organization which is student hours d you know that othe r organizations sending in somebody to an or ganization cannot affo rd to send that person months and months and mont hs cant fford to send them fo r three wee ks the fee is not the to tality f it its the l oss of his services to the organization thats the r eal thing that is l ost and the fee for the course is not it and even in ter ms of money its k eeping the guy ther durin g that long per iod of time thats xpen sive so you r viabi lity goes out the roof the second that product ion officer tak his fi nger off his number and sa ys w are not selling something at its proper price the price in his ter ms being what is the co in the organization is paying then all of sudden what happens then the or ganizati ons the li ttle rganizations cant send anybody to the course totake an eight course becau he won t come home until hes ninety nine do you see so thats that s bad productio n thinking alright its being changed right this minute but im giving you various instance s you cou ld make fort une rig ht now guy blo ws fr om dianetics course i turned out little project didnt even think about it very l ong but it woul d have been winner that organization which di d it i dont know if i have any r eports on it its just to the effect of who who blew who didnt this one is diffe rent anybody whos had any dianetic auditin g anybody whos had any dianetic auditing should come in and take dianetics course now that might r might not work because you wo uld get failed cases and so fo rth but you could fill this in with this kind of promotion the promotion that could be thrown int the line up very easily is very often people d not make good gains or make all the gains possible febc10 the has and the c oins f 9 24171 the organi zation febctapes 133 011004 out of dianetics intensive unless theyve had dianetics course and then you quote several succe ss stories to that effect now that would be the p roduct ion gimmick on the thi ng so alright youve all of sudden got course minutes now its asier to furnish course minutes than it is auditor minutes but once mo re if an ar ea does not have very many uditors its got to furnish course instruct or minute s and student cou rse hours becau it can furnish those up to point wher it gets some audit ors in order to function so what do we ok at here that is the spending of these coins but who puts the coins ther the has puts the co ins ther and if he doesnt have enough coins there and if he doesnt have any r eserve po ols by which he can get more coins to spend fa st hes always in mess therefore the post is almost unhandleable alm ost untenable cause hes the guy who puts the co ins ther to spend good has will rub his hands togethe r and sa im go ing to put five hund red auditorhours per week s coins into the hgc and wer goin g to fix up the lines wer going to fix up the tech s ervices and so fo rth and weve got to cs and train we g ot this that and the other thing and the plan and fo rm of the or ganizati on ar so and so and this he tel ls the product ion officer and this wi ll all be r eady and my s chedule on the thing is something on the rder of about sixty day s i will be able to have this w ill you at the end of that peri od of time will you have those thi ngs consumed plea br rroom now theres another method of looking at an or ganizati on isnt it so the bur den of the has is very very heavy indeed becau hes got to furnish the coins which can be spent then hes got to have reserve coins that he can spend and the real coins of the or ganization are not the do llars an organization that doesnt ma ke dol lars is going to be up the s pout or around the bend now as far as the lines of an organizations concer ned and an hco which is enturbu lated and so on there is this kind of thing do you think pc wou ld be enturbu lated if you started process on him and you never finished it do you think the pc would be enturbulated now we get int the r eal field of third dynamic auditing admin istrator handlin g the group he s what is called administrator trs that cut through the noise the chatter and the aberration and get the action done that he has sp ecified to be do ne and it wo rks on the ba sis of it works on the b asis of everytime st able datum in confusi on problems of work and youshou ld know that little chec k sheet bac kwar ds and for wards becau the hatted person can st and up to the confusion and the unhatted person cant so how do you back off the fusion out of theor ganizatio n is you well and efficient ly and accurately hat the peo ple so the has who want s to get an or ganizati on wh ose own hco is gr rr and enturbu lated and so fo rth would have to have pr etty good administrator trs they re being written at this particu lar moment and all the feb cs ar goin g to be run on them and theyll wish togod id never invented them p robably i think you have to wear padded shoul ders nd knee pads to get through these trs its the inability to conf ront confusion that wr ecks the ad ministrator so he squir rels what would you think of d of p when the auditor comes down and he says ou know this febc10 the has and the c oins f 10 24171 the organi zation febctapes 134 011004 pc is running very badly what do i do and the d f p says well you do so and so and the person the audito r goes ff and he come s back nd he says i did that and we actu ally had to have patter ned action for that the patter ned action original ly was what did you do and you find out the guy did something entir ely different what was out it was tr 0 tr0 in that auditor by the intr oduct ion of tr0 that wa s the end of that w didn t have th at problem in organizations i mean in auditing anymor alright well you re seeing the entrance her of the s ame thing only its on the thi rd dynamic what confusi on can you conf ront and int what fusion can you hat and that is the test of an dmin istrator and would be the test of an has par excellence what confusi on can he conf ront becau if he cant conf ront it hell just blow off of it and squir rel oh i see you r eally cant have nybody on that post and the line cant go that way becau aa h ahh alr ight anyhow blll ooh god i got out f ther see his administrative t r0 is for the bi rds so he walk s in on this post and this post is so on and they sa and we cant handle this weve got the b acklog becau its time look at all the piles that go into the it s all the boxes you see and we cant have of theres bla you see and he says gee oh well its mes s i gues s and he walk s off back to his desk you wo uld be s urprised what commod ores messenger goes thr ough flag alway s has about two or three strat as of sea org in progress simultaneously and it s the new r ecruitstrata and it has the student strata nd it s the old timer strata well youll get sen sible actions and so f orth but wit h this admixtur of personnel around you get certain amount of confusion because ther will be r ecrui t on post wher you wi ll expected veteran ev ery once in while well you can alw ays tell this cau you usually get an explanation and the commo dores ssenger has become actually they ok lik little kids and they fi ne and so on actually they c an probably do better administrative tr0 than anybody in the game i just sent one on sion by the w ay cause i knew theyd have to do some conf ronting so i sent somebody up ther who cou ld confr ont see simple messenger walks up and he sa ys would you plea tur n on the he at on deck thats the ssage but thats of course carried intenti on dont you and you get well its on and its on and theyve just run into somebody whos just taken over as an i r and they re new recruit because the ones we had have alr eady been sent out to take car of some other ship or something of the sort and you cant turn this valve becau of the valve and it doesnt in the ot her jiggydoazit and so on and shchevom yeah got it commod ores mes senger says turn on the he at on deck somet imes if they cant get it through at all they come back nd they say this hes explainin g i say who is it ah so so on so just run it up another echelon becau i know ive run into recruit who is standing watch point youd be surpr ised thes characters have the got whole ship taped they know exactly the degr ee of hattedne ss of everybody on this ship the hattedne ss is u sually excellent but they know whe re it isnt why becau the administrative trs in as you go th rough you r organiz ation and you fin d out theres confusion and all the chairs ar lined up and theres nob ody sitting in the ch airs but the peop are outside and they febc10 the has and the c oins f 11 24171 the organi zationfebctapes 135 011004 should be inside sitting in the chairs and theres somebody behind the desk and hes got whole pile of invo ices and he s eems to be coun ting som ething you say what ar you doing w ell i got to do and ther an emer gency action here and weve g ot to get in the financial planning and the amount f stat which is com ing through and so on how about what s your post oh im qual r ecep tion i i and so on i got to get this now wait minute wait minute wait minute how about these w ell look ive got this all this is all its very easy to understand becau if we don t get the s tat in by two oclock and so and so hey how about all these peop wh at people ll these people theyr outside they shoul d be at lea st in her in the waitin g room and so on oh those yeah well i got to get the look your just oking at ban k ban k expressed on the thir d dynamic some lines are out here and it isnt up to you to invent new solut ion it is up to you to gets done on that post what is supposed to get d one on that post just l ike it is up to an auditor to get that command d one and if youve got that down thats all r eally you need to know about getting an or ganizati on in the has wou ld have to have this in par xcellence he would have to have this in gorgeously he wou ld have to be able to confr ont any gods quantity of confusion and hed have to know his or ganizational techno logy enough to know exactly what hat to put on how fast at which instant he knows what s supposed to be happening in this particular zone and area and he puts that hat on the person says w ell i cant wear this hat and this office is all put the hat on and the bla bla comin g dow n and lying on that ther eighteen diffe rent sizes nd so forth hat what ar you supposed to be doing on the post what ar you supposed to be her what ar you supposed to be and so on oh well yeah well yeah oh you mean i gotsomething to do with thes with these dispatche s oh and you get the reverse total dedicati on to dispatch line all hel l breaking loose outside the off ice with somebody comfo rtably handlin g his st ale dates as slow ly as possible so the ba sic requisite of an has and certainly even much mo re so of an executive di rector product ion officer and rg officer wou ld be his tr0 and his knowledge of what wa s supposed to be happening there at that time his knowledge of confusion and the s table datum and he k nows th at if he gets the st able datum in which is the hat the confusion will go off he doesnt stand ar ound and ar gue about this that and the other thing he just gets the hat on and it belongs the re at that time gets the line connected up that should be ther yes and then he goes back half an hour later to make sur its still there now one of the thin gs th at happens to sea or g mission occasionally is that it goes into an or g the rg does what it says while its ther the org mission walks out and the org does xactly what it plea ses at once in other words the ethic s presence was not xtensional that has h appened more often than once now that would mean actually that the place couldnt conf ront its own confusio n so to that degr ee you have to teach an or ganization to confront its own fusion youre about to see bull baited admin istrative trs such tr is trying to get piece of paper put from one table onto another table with three peop around the first piece of paper and th ree people around the cond table w ith the th ree people at the second table febc10 the has and the c oins f 12 24171 the organi zation febctapes 136 011004 comp letely unw illing to receive any piece of paper and the peop at the first table comp letely unwilling to part with the piece of paper bull baited putt ing somebodys hat on meaning by that just cardboard hat all the r easons why he cant wear this hat why he doesnt want this hat and snt got anythin g to do with this h at that s actually what it takesbut an hco br ings or der and that is the dr ill that brin gs or der becau what ar you dealing with oure dealing with hats lines you re dealing wit h space youre dealing with certain products in terms of moti ons which produce p roduc tion actions dealing wit h organiz ation actions filing actions and so fo rth one s to know what those actions are one doesnt have to have it down perfectly one doesnt have to be super pleu perfect and when one doesnt know what unit is supposed to be doing and the unit is gettin g along alright one should have enough sen to back out quietly and close the d oor but unit that isnt runn ing alright and its stat s are down and so f orth one shoul dnt go in to hear the xplanation and then back out and close the doo r that is the one thi ng that is w rong to do so anyw ay the has then has the jo b of puttin g an stablishment there well establishment is an or derly arrangement it is an or derly arrangement so the refore everybo dy in hco should be capable f bringing about an orderly arrangement if hco canno t bring about an or derly arrangement it will bring disor der into the or g now all of this may not be expressed in old policy but what do you know it doesnt violate old policy the old policies which were written yester day these very interesting policies that ar sever days old that should be issued ag ain truth of the m atter is that unless you have center r focus po int in an or ganizati on which is s table po int which is then bring ing order to the remainder of the rganization you will only have an enturbulated organization you wont have your product ion coins to spend so one of your jobs is getting something to spend in terms of the real wealth f the rganization and the r eal wealth of the organization of course is ba sically knowledge and then the time and actions of bringin g about what that knowledge can do and that is the r eal wealth of the rganization and when you k eep your eye on the main chance that that is the wealth of that or ganiz ation what do you think wi ll happen to an of fice in san francisco as we had manymany ye ars ago calling them selves the p sycholo gy consultants it went broke but it was hor rible disor der becau the in formation that they we re export ing wasnt even being used where they wer they we re very in dividuated out f rom things so what do you what do you basically what do you basic ally have in an has ou have just what its mott says br ing order but what is bring ing order p utting in stable data nd stringing the lines in spite of the fusion many an hco if it is doin g its j ob wel l would feel lik lineman telephone lineman in the middle of battle but telephone lineman can string line in the middle of the b attle the point is does he string the line r does he suddenly q and with the battle so you would get you r administrative q and youd walk int the thing and the registrar is supposed to be r egistering somebody but isnt actu ally is engaged at this particu lar time in arguing with of all people arguing with the mimeo files clerk and is ar guing about who wou ld have what lunch hour or some other unlikely subject alright what is the ction the re the q and is is to settle who has the lunc h hou r and walk out youre asking the pc f rom wher cou ld you commun icate to an febc10 the has and the c oins f 13 24171 the organi zation febctapes 137 011004 elephant somebody walked dow n very funny hco i mean very funny examiner report i saw here the othe r day just as an inte rjecti on s omebody walked by and theyd been doing long l ist and all hell had br oken loose and their cases falling apart when they hit the ter m elephant they walked up and said to the xaminer im an elephant release they were doing fine now supposing this auditor had come along and the person said i dont particu larly care to run that item and why don t you particularly care to run the item w ell actually i havent havent received letter from my mother lately well what about your mother uh youve seen this happenalright lets ok at this ad ministratively lets ok at an has who does this sort of thing w eve got to get in the registratio n line here and so im go ing down and get in the registration line very good now what is the tr ouble with this registration line hes alr eady opened himself wi open and somebody says to him we really dont have any c arpets and he s ays well what about these carpets and well it would nt get through financial plannin g becau bessie ann wo uldnt agree to them and the hco sec goes off to see bes sie ann now if you just mult iply this about five hundr ed times over during day an has sees that his li fe is utterly unlivable hco will eventu ally be ducks nd drakes the whole organization will be walking through hco itll look lik grand central station if i were an has and somebody came in to see in the mid dle f traffic perio d and so forth and wanted to know when they wer going to when they we re going to get an an swer to their brothers petit ion to have free rehabs im afraid i woul d not answer with q and the pr factor woul d have to be pr eserved but in sence my action woul d be what is your post what ar you supposed to be do ing wh at is the traffic on it right now and that would be the an swer to the b rothers petiti on about his fr ee rehab s and then somebody wou ld say hco doesnt give service doesnt give an swers that i should be getting f rom the registrar r from the letter registrar do you follow now hco personnel wou ld have to know routing and so does every person in the organization has to know routing and do you know who has to know his routing best the executive director of the or ganization has to know mo re about routing in the or ganizati on than any other person in the or ganiz ation because bout ninety percent of an executives functi on is routin g not only routing but establishing the route to be routed on tremendous quantity of stuff early on on any post wil l come through and all it requires is routin g alm ost everythingin your pending basket is misr outed and doesnt bel ong to you and just on that ba sis of this isnt mine you can t ake pendi ng bas ket and route it and not cruelly or crudely you look it over and you ll find out that its all misr outed s you didnt know what the hell to do with it becau of cou rse it wa snt yours and all it tells you is that r outin g is out and there must be some other people around who d ont know routing so your action woul d be to get everyb ody check ed out on ba sic staff hat and chinese s chool on the rg board and few more elem entary things of this char acter so we do have the pr ocesse s neces sary to resolve the confusion they do exist who runs these pr ocesses the has hes the auditor of the org only theres the thing called febc10 the has and the c oins f 14 24171 the organi zation febctapes 138 011004 sane est ablishm ent and he mu stnt go in the same direction that an audito r goes an auditor reduces the b ank to nothin g lets not have an administrator reduce the rg to noth ing hes not tryin g to run the or g out hes trying to put it ther therefore id say an has who cant do c reative processing wont be very succes sful and his tr if his tr0 is bad so that he qs and as in any way whatsoever he w ont be very succe ssful so these ar the various requirements of it but if he can mock thin gs up and if he can hol d positi on in space and if he can fix things and if he does know confusion and the stable datum if hes deter mined to bring order regardless of what if hes deter mined to ma ke the lines go on out and straighten out if hes deter mined to put the organization there and bring order in it and if he c an confr ont confusion without q and aing if he can h at som ebody why hes quite guy hes qui tr easure actu ally hco personnel are so rar because these abilit ies ar rare because hes ba sically an audito r to the or ganiz ation he audits out all the confusi ons in the organization and thats how he br ings or dernow what ar his duties t put the tablishment the re ho w much establishm ent how much establishment c an he affor d to put there how does he figure out this stablishment well he figu res out the establishment in terms of product ion that will result in the gr eatest return to the or ganization so he c an put some mo re establishment there and why does he put som more establishment ther so that he can put some mo re establishm ent there why does he put more establishment the re so he can put som more establishm ent there of cou rse and what h appens whi hes doin g it hes got all kinds f peop that dont know what hes tryin g to do and doesnt know why hes trying to put the establishm ent there so they say ive go t letter from my mother and sh has just s aid bongledon g and the refore i must gagob and he sa ys at that moment thats very g ood ther is the mail clerk see if he has any letters fo r you the re is the mail clerk but my mother good ther is the m ail clerk see if you have any letters in yes but im in gr ief about this see the chaplain messenger take this person to see the ch aplain and come bac k and tell if the ch aplain was on post heh heh in hco they think theyr messengers wh car ry the m ail around thats becau nob ody is using it as central hub from which order is b rought you cant br ing very much or der over very lon g peri od of time unles s youve got som messengers i can as sure you of that so this is whe re the thin g goes now i suppose ne xt i will be talking about the hco department one in sections department two in sections th ree fo ur five six sev eight nine and eventu ally chase it all the way on off the other end of the or g board but that would be sort of greedy i wou ld be taking all of your good ies away f rom you it is you i expect to chase it all the way do wn ff the other end of the or g boar d all the confusion you have h ad in the pa st with rder following all the w ay along the l ine viabi lity rising and the planet inour laps thank you very much thank you than k you very much good night now as you r eturn to our org 7102 c03 s feb c 11 3 february 1 971 good evening good evening this is thir d of february 1971 ad 21 this briefi ng is convened here tonight and is ar ranged bec ause this is the set of directions which will be given to and is being given to the departing product officers or g officers febc graduate s to take bac k to their orgs and consists in sence of their of the sion orders of the xecutive director produc t officer org officer set up now the flag bu reau has been working very har d and very lon g and hard indeed to get together the b asic p rojects necessary to make an org roll on up the line and to make it great succes s now you must realize that if you we re returned to an org and whi youve been go ne of course why must of the st aff have blown and so on and youve got these one and h alf staff member s that were hired yester day s ee and thats all you have left and you open up this suitcas and you have bout twenty seven twenty eight projects or something like this there is some lar ge number of things and youl l run out of peop very rapidly to hand these people out to now i don t say that they all blew during your absence i hope they didnt we won t ma ke that postulate but quite the contrary has been going on dur ing your absence f rom the or g lot of good people wh have been working very hard to keep the show on the r oad while you sailed around souther n seas and admir ed the palm trees listened to the native gir ls dancing and learning to beat drums and so on and theyve been working hard while that is and so you come in and you re going to change everythin g theyve beendoing and your going to change ny line they have accidentally gotten together that runs right and i will sit her and i will look at st at for you r org that wi ll be going at reasonable bare survival level or better and it will of cou rse go d own now theres been an or g there for very long time in most ca ses and it has had its ups and its had its do wns and its had its attentions which it sometimes r egretted and its neglects that it som etimes appr oved f and it has not been nothin g nor are the staff members which you left behin d totally occlu ded on everything that is going along becau you will find that some of these po licy letters and so on have alr eady been received they have been put to some slight degr ee into action you will find that ther is certain clientele inv olved there is certain backlog to be ta ken care of and they have m anaged to work out that if you stand down at the cor ner of wupf and yak street and every few minutes somebody will come by and they h and them something and some of thes people show up and they wi ll be able to get somebody to come int the rg every now and then and they have certain r oute and there are certain number of people wh have pr omised to come in and ther are cert ain number of services and ther are certain number of people on the course and certain febc11 as you return to your org 2 3271 febctapes 140 011004 number of blown people that theyr trying to get b ack and somebodys got an ar c break program of some kind or another and so on in other words it isnt all bad by long way now what if we just wal ked in and changed everything now ye s we say this org which should be ma king twenty five thous and dollars week and that is true of any org you are going back to i would be shamed to run an or g at wer level than that now is on ly making fifteen hundr ed week and thinking it is doing well people are gettin g born and going aberrated faster than theyr being processed right now youve got situ ation the rewhere some people are at very har d wo rk hav been able to keep very low level of survival going and it is up to you to take advant age of that situation and push that inc ome up and that wou ld be your first rder of busines s your first rder of busines s is to fin d out what is goin g on and get it paid for and deliver ed and that would be the fi rst or der of busines s of product fficer and the ne xt order of busines s of pr oduct office r wou ld be to l ook ar ound and how he can inc rease consumptio n now the poo r pes who has suddenly been r elegated to secretarial level or something like that is in actual fact your pr and you could do far worse than to just put him on as pr type of action in addition to his other actions in the pub lic divisions to figure out how consumpti on can be bui lt up and tur n over your distribut ion divisi on to somebody who is competent to take it over and k eep going the ctions which they alr eady have going there do you follow now i wouldnt even r ecommend that or insist on it but because your personnel varies but you will sooner or later need somebody who xclusively sits ar ound as product officer and figu res out exactly how you re going to increase consumpti on by the us of the new techn ology of pr and you will find out that that is staff job that is not divisional job and then you as product officer ar going to go car oming around through the or g and banging off staff members as you tur n the cor ners rapidly and you wi ll have certain amount of human r eaction to handle and that is st aff job so you r pes can tinue to do his publ ic div isional w ork which must go on or i assure you cs 6 will become very upset and you can find somebody and groove them in as pr but in any event that is go ing to be poi nt which has to be watched becaus the incr ease of consumpti on is nece ssary adjunc t if you re going to inc rease the income and delivery of an or g the re is noth ing sillier than canning factory wh ich keeps throwing the cans out theback door and they do nt get used and eventually they dont can anything anymo re well the b reakdown of that particular point is consumptio n was not bui lt up so you re going to have to take car of that now what you ar up ag ainst is the fact that you re going in to an ar ea which is to some degr ee running and it has its own traditi on of how it makes things run better and the product officer has to take whats lying around and st art making it into products and thats for sure so his first rder of busines s of cou rse is to go in and say hi and w got great plans and everything is fine and everyth ing is doing that youve been doing around here is fine and were just going to do mo re of it and the s taff at that moment is going to groan and they re goi ng to say w ell we cant do anymo re than we re doing becau we re totally overloaded w and at that moment you say w ell we wil l have an org officer to take car febc11 as you return to your org 3 3271 febctapes 141 011004 of that poi nt so that you r ove rload doesnt particular ly wo rry you and then you go ahe ad and do two things ouve g ot to get the inc ome up and youve got to get delivery going and if you arch around you will find all sorts f half finished thingamajugs to push out and you will find all sorts of thi ngs you can sell and so on in other words it is goin g concer n so your first action is survey on your return in your new found knowledge survey of what theyve got right there that can be delive red now if i walked int an or g at any given instant i would look the place over i would probably move all the xecutives out of the s ervice space and thats usu ally my first action in an org im not kidding you i move all the xecutives out of the s ervice space and thats my first day and wo rk with their creditor set up so th at there won t be foreclosed on the s econd day and by that time i have l ooked over enough of the situatio n and i get big idea as to what we can of fer right now and we offer it very promptly on any open commun ication linethat is and you have s pecial project number one which you will be given which is that s special project that doesnt incl ude with the feb c pac k its with your pac k but its the big idea that you can do right w and its alr eady under bit of flight this particu lar one and we havent got the ful l results on this yet but appar ently its produc ing people and they walk in and they actually do st art moving through the or g lines s youve got special dissem project number one which is good idea now maybe that isnt all the go od idea that you will need and maybe you have to get local good idea but dont get an idea that on monday and then not executed on tuesd ay the usual fate of good idea s the st aff is alr eady over loaded so if somebody comes in with good idea and thats just what they dont need what they need is executi on they hav had several good idea s during the st year and none of them got executed and so that you will probably find that you have in addition to getting you r special p roject number one under way which is sort of an all hands evoluti on and wi ll get things go ing you will undoubted ly fin d that ther are some other idea s in progress which you can push so your first action is actu ally to look the thing over adjust it up bit for produc tion without disturbing anybody particularly and then get some p romot ion out get some delive ry being done look ar ound the cademy or the school or something like this and how many of you cats can graduate today w ere not speeding you up you know and so fo rth how long you been her two years well that s and go into the cr owded waiting room and where the p reclear s wait for their sessions and go and see som ebody and as k them when they are going to hi re an audito r or something and about that time why you will be aweigh in other words you start to get delivery you get p romot ion you get delive ry you get inc ome and you get the show running becau remember you are trying to get final valuable pr oducts namely money student completi ons and pc comp letions and you r area s probablygot tons f pcs that could just be comp leted but that wont nece ssarily bring you in great deal of money so anyw ay you wi ll see what you will see and it is nece ssary to understand comp letely utter ly and total ly that pr oducti on officer is ther to get the final valuable p roducts and gettin g those final valuable products is quite trick and now you re being asked to get these final valuable products with out buildi ng for the ne xt two years at v ast cost lar ge est ablishfebc 11 as you ret urn to our org 4 3271 febctapes 142 011004 ment at all youre not thinking in terms of that at all oure not thinking in terms of any of this except how ar we going to get the thi ngs goin g now once you start this i can as sure you that your first few day s will be very diffic ult becau af ter you ve tal ked to the st aff and tol d them what its all about and tried to get the show on the r oad and played them som tapes concer ning this which you will have and what you are tryin g to do the ma chine will start runnin g even tho ugh its little machine it will start runn ing and you have already started if you know you r busines s at all if weve taught you your busines s vaguely the s alt mil l will start runn ing and you know the story of the salt mill i have alr eady told it to you it was in h olland that this horrible thing appe ared and it started tur ning out salt and they put it under mattresses and they put it in the attic and they hit it with hammers and it just kept on turning out salt and it turned out more and more salt and ther were tremendous piles f salt all over the place ther was pr cam with it to get consumpti on you and they finally in disgu st and ho rror threw this thi ng int the sea and f cou rse that is why the is sa lty and why we have to buy water at such v ast xpens in these po rts so you have st arted something going and i can ssure you that t that point you wi ll feel yourself very over strained very red and very knock ed about now the st is to live through that period and to keep runni ng ahe ad of the stor mfrom there on out becau at first guilelessly you will sink bac k into it you start the thing running and then you say w ell weve got that and w you have started something going so now you re going to have to back that up and the longe r you are the re with out your org officer five feet ahead of you trying to get products out why the more difficult you will find it so that the n atural soluti on to this is the first p roduct of the product officer is an org officer and the or g officer will hastily start throwing som lines together and so forth and gettin g some old scratch paper and so on cause they hadnt had any invoices in this or g for two years and your product officer wi ll keep insisting on some delive ry but there is place for anybody to lay any money down and the org office r has to fix place fo r the money to be paid down and then ther this matter f paper and ho w do you get the p romotion becau the pr inter you see he snt been paid for long time so you have to find another printer in order to get thats the org officer and then the audito rs they havent got any place to audit now becau the executive offices h ave been are all using up all the auditin g space and the org officer ll have to move all those out and so on and here you go and the rg officer now your tongue is alr eady hanging out see get the pr oducts you r tongue is alr eady hanging out the org office r came on br ight fresh able to conf ront the world and so forth three days later why his tongue will be hitt ing the floor and hel l be trippi ng over that so now you have to remind now you have to r emind an org officer at this point that the first pr oduct of an org officer is an has and the has will come on oh that s easy that hco w ell weve got an hco we have some comm ba skets out there in the hall weve got an hco and about this time why the has will be discover ed to be not quite sure what this thin g called an tablishment is and is liable to give you defini tion of an establishment something on this rder hes liableto give the org office r definit ion of an establishment s somebody with hat and wi ll have to be remin ded that est ablishments contain typewriters carbon paper ball point pens comm febc11 as you return to your org 5 3271 febctapes 143 011004 baskets floors ceilin gs and numer ous other machines appurtenance s and whi rly gigs and typewr iters and f ront doors and door locks that actu ally lock nd safes that you keep money in and invo ice machine s and other odds and end s and he sa ys but that isnt the pr ovince of hco you sa listen to the th ree hou rs of tape ag ain on the has each time he comes bac k your safest thi ng is to just tell him to listen to the thr ee hours of tape and so on and to chec k out on his ba sic staff hat and to get his hco check ed out on basic st aff hat and to hi re an hco and to put an hco ther and what do you know hes got projects to put an hco there so wher does your febc pac k come in now youve got your mission orders the re are for the pr oduct office r the re are actu ally mission orders fo r the org officer and ther are orders for the has and these ar part of you r pack ou have two projects one of them special pr oject one wh ich is dissem nd special project two which is tech and thats how you deliver the busines s which you attract with the first one alright youve also got the busines s the org is already doing which you mustnt neglect now with the pr oduct office rs first action he wi ll find just to give you slight review he wi ll find that it is vital that he have an or g officer and that is in the natural cou rse of events he cant live with out an org officer and people are going to tell you that the rg officers actually the hcoes and she sit s bac k with the same duties nd the same jo b and sa hat as the hcoes and you sa listen to the ten hou rs of tape which we b rought back and omit to listen to tape one which is pr becau we want product ion now at th at point at th at point it could be xpected that you have enough income thatyou are going forwar d sufficiently that the has can now actually put an tablishment the re and he woul d cont inue to do so almost totally independent of the product and or g officers of the rg now the way he puts together the feb c pac k is he tak existing staff which is alr eady in that division or is super numerary someplace els but not using the area that you re using for delivery at that particular poin t you want to cure him f that fa st you car ry ruler around to slap peoples fin gers when they r each for personnel in working installatio n and one of the or g officers brigh test tricks has pr obably never been mentio ned is if he not ices displacement of line and that sly r each fr om the personnel whic h he has desperately got ten into the line up producing is to slap somebo dys k nuckles quick d you follow otherwise your working installatio ns will be dismantled fast er than they can be put back together again so the rule of thumb along all these line is the or g and the or g is personnel pool to the deg ree that it is not engaged in direct p roduct ion and one never dism antles working installatio n that is something you have to teach people when theyr engaged in putting ships togethe r do not dism antle working installati on well yes i know but we re never really going to use this hoist here and wou ldnt it be nice if ah ah ah ah is it working installati on yes but it isnt used for anythi ng just now well yes that s fine leave it alone but let us define working installati on w in terms of an org and it will make mo re sense to you working installation is any group which is deliver ing the adequat and adequate product ion of that product whic h they re supposed to deliver and you leave those alo febc 11 as you ret urn to our org 6 3271 febctapes 144 011004 ne and you dont you dont mon key wit h them and as soon as you see working installatio n under those defin itions being knock ed down you re going to fin d that you are ma kingthree st eps fo rward and unlike the communists who only go tw step s backwar ds you will be going four steps bac kwar d did you know by the way that the communists thes days xercise all the chi ldren in schoo l to go three step s forwar d and two steps b ackwar d and they go around mar ching this to teach them th at that is how commun ism is going to win you and they hav them walk three st eps fo rward and tw step s backw ards and th ree step s forwar d and two steps bac kwar ds and th ree steps fo rward and demonstrate to them and do you know they d ont even have certificate to run scs its wonder theyr squirreled up anyway i can imagine the guys do ing this busting the uditors code all ove r the place so the upshot of it is the upshot of it is that you can actually go th ree steps forwar d and fou r steps b ackwar ds the p roduct ion officers getting his product ion and the ne xt day the p roduc tion isnt the re wh at happened so the or g officer looks it over and then they look over and they that the has s just got th rough transfer ring mary lou well lightening should strik twice if it happens twice so what you have to have there as pr oducti on officer and what is being put the re as an or g officer is being do ne independent ly of the has building an stablishment ou say but gee that s imp ossible i mean youve got this thing comi ng in from one side and then he wou ld need the personnel which youre working with thats just the whole point and thats why you have to have income he gets these personnel now ther only one or two areas that i know of off hand who have such s uperfluity of personnel with such singness of product ion as to make the wh ole rg fair gam ther the pr oduct office rs job woul d just be simply to walk in and tell who was ever supposed to be do ing something to do it you know an auditor theyve g ot twelve auditors r something like this or four audito rs and so forth and their well done auditing hours for the week ar six nd half and they ctually will graph it as six and h alf justas though this mounts to something you see i mean its marvelous you wi ll find all kinds of odd ball situations with r egard to this and they wil l tell you why you cant get production but that woul d be in only about th ree or gs that i know f the r est of them do nt get producti on mostly because they hav ent got any peo ple to produce so as you get p roduct ion goin g as producti on office r and as this is being backed up well what do you do with thes febcs w ell you certainly with these febc projects w ell you certainly put them int the hands of people who are not at that explicit instant engaged in desperate pr oducti on on something else d you follow so your has is m ainly invo lved in either appointing acquir ing hiring kidnapping shanghaiin g team s and every one of these pr ojects wil l und oubtedly have to have total team cquired for it trained in it hatted to do it and he just k eeps movi ng in the departments as trained teams so he practically has nothi ng to do with you at all he practically has nothing to do with an or g office r now the s equence in which he moves those ams in is very interesting and you will find out that this is the sequence th at you had better move thes projects in and these projects are moved in in this sequence number one is hco number two is tech number th ree is febc11 as you return to your org 7 3271 febctapes 145 011004 dissem number f our is treasury number five distri bution number six qual and number sev executive division and your going to have picn ic youre going to have picnic becau you r orgs going out f pha but that is about the only way you can do it therell be some cat s produc ing before some ot her cat s are producing so the sub products to the final valuable p roducts will start st acking up and now you will move int another phase somewher along the re wher the p roduc tion officer is trying to co ordinate between what he s got going and what is going on and youl l find ou t that they wi ll phase in very nicely and you will just get moreand mo re of it and you wi ll get mor and mor producti on now i will go ove r the xact s equence f events th at will appe ar on the mission orders of producti on officer and the first one is get fu lly briefed on flag as to what xactly you will be doing when r eturning to your org im doing some of that job of briefing right this moment now you bring with you to you r org the flag febc project package and copy of the rg board you will using and adequate copies of lrh eds nd programs as per the pr ojects you wi ll have with you your febc tapes you ll return to your org and you will assume the p ost of executive di rector product officer now you will immediately cho ose nd appoint somebo dy as your org officer the first pr oduct of product officer is an org officer he s another set of orders now your next action woul d be to quickly hat him using the febc tapes which you will have now you cope like mad together with the or g office r to build the income and delive ry up and to do that you have these two special projects sp ecial project one dissem special pr oject two tech you can use nd get the in on sort of an all hands evolut ion thats just to stimulate some busines s but that doesnt mean to knock out everything that s going on in your org now your object in bui lding up the income with anything you can fin d lying ar ound old belts and so f orth that you can feed int the machine somehow or another that wil l wind up at the other end of the line as delivered product and will produce an income for the or g by having built this up between yourself and the or g officer you can appoin t an has as soon as youve got it going not neces sarily when you have bui lt it up to hundr eds of thous ands becau you wont you as soon as youve got things goin g and so on why you appoi nt an has and then to this point nothin gs been done with the feb c package xcept special pr oject one and two thats the only thing youve used f the package now this has will have to have his hat put on pretty heavily by the or g officer wonthe and he will have to get some kind of an idea of how to check peop out on things and so forth wont he because he now gets presented with the entir febc package and in the sequence of department by department he gets ahold of teams trains them in and gets them produc ing what theyr supposed to be p roduc ing according to the package and youl l find out that that wil l coordinate wi th you r org boar d now you r ealize that you cannot hire peop and k eep peop on or anything else if you havent got som money so that is why you must run lik mad when you fi rst get bac k to make sur that your org income goes up very nicely you can try to get your gdss up very nicely you can do anythin g you want to do very nicely as long as you get delivery and inc ome and if youve got delivery and youve got income your febc11 as you return to your org 8 3271 febctapes 146 011004 org inc ome wil l rise and ther will be enoug h money there for the has to hire and affor d the luxury of being able to actually groove somebody in on the p roject not whiff it acr oss under neath their nose get small boy who cant read and s ay that is your project so you would build ing solid org cau these pr oject wi ll build solid department so as soon as hes m ade some p rogress on thes project you will start issuing the rest of the p rojects as i have discu ssed and as ive to ld you befo re your sequence nd so on wi ll be ted dow n as to what pr ojects or teams hes busy gr oovin g in and traini ng up you understand hell probably still have some peop ther but if you are very very clever you wont take any of the xisting rg except just these two or three orgs that ar very supernumerary you wo nt tak anybody that your using on your product lines at all you wo nt disturb the or g that is sitting there and that youve got ten int action all of thes people on projects and in department s will be all brand new won t they and wouldnt you be clever wouldnt you be cleveri wish you guys woul d catch up we got the gi up to twenty one thousand w and you havent got any of those p rojects working and so fort h if you could bu ild situation like that why you wo uld be doin g great once mo re why its the sequence is hco tech dissem tr easury distri bution qual and executive divisi on alright now the has can get this done by hiring and appoint ing and hatting them and so the has is busy buil ding the tablishment wh ile the product and or g officer continue to get the inc ome up any way they can inc ome and delivery youve got to achieve the pr oducts of student s pcs and the v aluable final p roduc t of money whether you have those pr ojects in or not and you ll find those pr ojects wil l just move right in and start doing the s ame thing so it s actually reinforced action so unti l all of the pr oducts projects ar in in the org you are in state of cope and both the pr oduct office r and or g officer is in st ate of cope now if you this due to habit patter n and so fo rth that the or g officer is the hes who occup ies the hess sk and handles the traffic of the hcs and passes dispatches over to the oes who sits at his des k and then handles that and if those posts you feel have to be covered and its absolutely vital during your cope per iod that they be covered becau peo ple keep coming in and sa ying wher the hes cau its an old line or something well put somebody there just put somebody there you know sa well you r desk there we ar and so on hes got sk handle the dispatche s and keep list of whos writ ing them all but dont you get sucked into that line sir an org office r should actually carry pedometer now pedometer is an instrument which is hung on belt and it is used to people in the fie ld of engineer ing walking hiking and the ar my to find out how far one s walked and it s little weight in it and every time that you ma ke step why this litt thing goes click see so it measures the steps ctually to perfectly adjust pedometer you have to go out and measure off hund red feet andthen find out how many p aces you have in that hundr ed feet and it has little dial in the back of it and it is set that m any inche s and you set your pace then is let us sa twenty seven inches r the old roman pace f thirty inches r if you re out of that habit maybe even thir ty two inches and the truth of the m atter is that both the oes product officer and hcoes febc11 as you return to your org 9 3271 febctapes 147 011004 org officer should have st at bas ed exactly on that pedometer all joking aside the jo b is done with mileage the j ob is done with mileage now i am in somewhat favor ed positi on i have ctually four splendid ly trained and very accurate ssengers and i should hang pedometers on those and i would probably get part of my mileage st at but they they r eally they r eally run up the mileage they r eally run up the mileage now what ar they do ing they re looking into situation getting questions answer ed trying to find the bug in the situatio n giv ing the nswers to the situation and we eventually will evolve this thin g and get the thing straightened out one way or the other now that is s ubstitute for the sa thing but there is real substitute for it and if you were running it har d as product officer you see ive already done some time here as product officer otherw ise i and ive done tremendous amount f time as an org officer and my org mileage as an org officer is very very high because one of the duties f the rg officer is for instance this is just an inc idental duty one that you sandwich in between every other duty is to see every person in the or g every day fr om two points of view is he busy in wearing his hat and on personal poi nt of view is he doin g alrigh t becau you get an or g runnin g like this i shudder at what might be go ing on in one of our orgs right now becau it is on an escalating affluence tr end and i know those po or kids have got their tongues hangin g out they must be just running like salt mills thems elves and if som ebody isnt taking car ofthem and somebody isnt paying attenti on to what their life is lik why the ne xt thing you know youl l break them dow n on such system as this and that is the only real liabil ity of system the fact of the c ase is person moves up in terms of vel ocity and they migh t not move their personal life up in terms of veloc ity and they cert ainly dont move up their care in terms of velocity and so it tends to drop out of phase litt bit and there in the first few days or weeks of something like this why you can xpect one or tw or three guys to drop out of the li ne up wi th epezudicks or som ething of the sort and you wonder whats wr ong well dont be too mystified it is simply that they are not getti ng the adequat personal care that they shoul d get in proportion to the amount f attention which they ar exerting so this is an important po int auditors ar peculiarly like this audit ors ar like race horses they actually the res hardly anybo dy ever stand s around and ru bs down an audit or but they ought to they ou ght to they ou ght to stand around and rub them d own and pat them on the shoul der and feed em oats becau the tru th of the matter is the truth f the matter is they on ly really fade out of your line up becau they have not been given themselve s adequat care and attenti on from an or ganizati on po int of view and i remember the old londo n org phrase wa s given to one time by the hco sec l ondon and i said i came bac k i was gone for whi and i came back to the rg and i said and ho w are the auditors getting along and have they gotten the consultati on rooms wh ich wer ordered and so on and sa ys and i said w ell what what kind of shape ar they in what kind of treatment do they get around here if i remember the conversation right ly he says treatment they re treated like chaff i noticed they di dnt have many uditors on staff either febc11 as you return to your org 10 3271 febctapes 148 011004actually there was period there when we very very fancily fixed up whole bunch of consultatio n rooms fo r audit ors and they each one had his ow n private consultation room and actually there was pr obably tw sides to the desk or som ething of that sort they wer their auditing rooms and i think that we doubled those auditing rooms so that ther was two audito rs to an auditin g room but they h ad their certificates on the wall and nice sof t carpet and goo d looking desk and they had their own personal effects around and so forth and things went very well but this is just personal car so that youve got your basic actions her as pr oduct officer is you shouldn t have to think of this the res reverse for you your org officer should be so good that the or g officer takes car of all that now i can tel l you an actual instance where whole division was totally mystified as to why i was m aking fuss and why my messengers wer in blur going back and forth and back and fo rth and ar ound and ar ound and ar ound and why pr was showin g up and it was very inte resting thin g the pr survey which i had conduc ted in that particu lar ar ea wa s marvelous the re wasnt one single person in that immediate ar ea who was awar of the fact that the k ey post of the ar ea was empty that morning traffic could have fl owed so an action had to be ta ken and it had to be taken now becau that post was about to be empty i had received the info rmation to this effect and i had tak the actions neces sary and the ctions had been oked upon as an arbit rary action and the pr survey disclosed later that the misundersto od that lay all through the ar ea is body spotted what the ctual basic situation was it was an ctual human emoti on situation becau peop got very upset about this they went through this that the lines k ept going but nobody had noticed now product officer should not have to think of that this sort f thin g should be ta ken car of now typical pr oduct officer action is ouve just been told by the d of p that hecan only have eight pcs wee k oh is that so w ell isnt that interesting immediately lets cut these lines up because i want you to get about twenty righ t away now twenty twenty twenty and her einafter you must never take any orders of any kind whatsoever f rom tech s to the amount f traffic and volume that they c an handle its in policy i think youve p robably read it do you know that an ar rangem ent will normally occur between tech and the r egistrar and do you know that r egistrar at the dr op of hat wil l also st art to schedule peop for tech w ell this is very wonde rful when you look this over because what youve got there is not deter mined eff ort to reduce the p roduct ion but youve all of sudden had an arbitrary ceiling put on the mount of income and the mount of delivery which you can do whereas the actual functi on which shoul d be perf ormed is the d of p ought to be on that telephone and that d of p ought to have an awful thick notebo ok of all the possible auditors with in the three hundr ed mile range ar ound there who can be called in and brought in on the job part time full time any ol d time that s proper functi on of d of p now therefore the pr oduct office r will be drivi ng this thing on up and one of the things which the or g office r will have to do is to keep it coo led ff and that is one of the reasons why you wi ll also have to have pr sooner or later febc11 as you return to your org 11 3271 febctapes 149 011004 you can get int the most remar kable puzzles as to why this that or the ot her thin g wont funct ion and the b asics of them ar lack of understanding of what the situation was and the unw orn hat and if you take those tw thin gs as the two things which get in your road as product officer youve got it made s ther efore you should tell the staff when you ar rive back what is going to happen and you shouldn t leave them in any mystery concer ning what is go ing to happen they will agree wit h this i am very very sure without any di fficultyat all but you r final action on the thin g is of course the production and the inc ome and if you can raise that inc ome and you can get that delivery going any old way that you possibly can man age it if you can get that go ing why then you will have enough wher ewithal to build an tablishment i want to point out to you that cobble rs who become v ast shoe companies st arted working on an old tire or slab of leather and thon ged it in coup of place s and they p robably sat out in the open or in s hed in their back yar d and they didnt have any tablishment in this particu lar ca the egg alw ays comes first and you can eventually get yourself chick there but it costs money in this ca to put chick there and you have to make the money to put the chicken the re let poin t that out to you i f you sit bac k and wait f or this m achine now lets go at it the ot her end too lets just you go home and organize everything along about six months fr om w you will start to see some pr oducti on the mean time you will be getting telexes flag saying and you wi ll be saying but i m trying and thats becau you re trying to get the chick befor the egg we hav now go t two actu case histories of tryin g to get the chick before the egg and both of them ar hor rible flops so wer not w talking ou t of data w already know that the stake you can make is go back and rganize everythin g the right way to g back is say get busy we re going to deliver now now the s how is going to go on the r oad and so fo rth and you guys h ave been doing great and we re going to extend everythin g youve been doi ng and bac k you up and you wi ll find itll all work out in the lon g run becau that is the trut h alright so much f or the pr oduct fficer now lets t ake up the or g officers actions here and his sion orders consist of roughly the fol lowing listen to the febc tape s brought back by the xecutive director then st ar rate on them with him its very very luck executivedirector who has an feb c org officer get yourself hatted as org officer immediately cope like mad to get the organization needed by the executive directorproduct of ficer in getti ng the tw special pr ojects done designed to drive in lots of busine ss along with that wi ll be preserve the or ganizati on and p roduct ion which is already there together with the xecutive directorproduct of ficer build the inc ome and delivery of the or g up it doesnt say blasted thing about bui lding up the stablishment i dont care how you build up the est ablishment i dont care what house of cards youve got one card over here on the edge and another one st anding up cross wise to it and so f orth and you say god at any moment thats goin g to give way well it hasnt yet be optimistic now youve got inc ome comin g up and delivery occur ring and at that time why an has is appointed and you give him the hco feb c projects the or g officer does and as soon as the has has made som progress on these hand him the rest of the p rojects f or the other divisions and you give him the implementing sequence which ive already given you febc11 as you return to your org 12 3271 febctapes 150 011004 and ensur the has bui lds up the establishment of the or g by hi ring appoin ted personnel and hatting them using the febc package cont inue to back up the executive directorproduct officer in any way you can to get the income up while making sur the has is busy build ing the est ablishment so actually there are some team s that can be driven with one hand but the org officer is driv ing tw team s its quite stunt and he c an easily get these things cr ossed where he just goes in oh it would be so much ea sier if i didn t have to instant hat every time i walk in those two or three new uditors to show them wher to take their pcs if we coul d just get hco straightened ou t so it woul d take over that wrong answer the rg officer goes r ight on instant hatting and gets min i hatting when he can and clears up the misundersto ods in passing thats one separate ctionnow on the other hand with his left hand hes got an has who today tried to transfer three auditors to become hco members cau they we re experienced class vii is and on the ot her hand is not insisting on any security amongst peo ple he is hiring and you look up and fin d out that the hair quantity of which is moving into the ar ea of hco is obscuring the desks and other things of this char acter so its not necessarily smooth thing to try to run an has who has his own troubles but nevertheles s that is what the org officers doing hes driving mad elephant wit h his ri ght hand and full twelve horse chario t team with his left and the above util izes wh at youve go t and s an org officer and puts you into financial better ment which per mits the or ganizatio nal st eps and this way the re will be t rouble at all in implementin g these feb c projects and those are the or g officers orders now the has will probably look at thes turn them over on the other side l ook at them and r ead them on that side and sa well well these guys h ave got it pretty easy they were all trained at lea st one of them wa s and what is this thing here that s ays major target nevertheles s you ve got to take it from the re now wrong way to do this wrong way to do this w ould be to spend year and half training the has so that he could put an has there and another wrong way to d it would be to xpect that he instantaneously had total gr ip on the basic staff hat without ever having read it knows nothing about hatting people knows nothi ng about target policies or anything else so the refore ther has to be bit of chec k sheet that this appo inted has has to go through in order to accomplish what he is supposed to be do ing and that would be of vast assistance to him one that wou ld save you gr eat deal f time so your producti on and your org actions of cou rse ar inst ant and immediate but you can affor d little bit of time not very much but you can affo rd litt bit of time to get your has hatted and his orders ar listen to the febc tapes on orgproduct officer systembrought back from flag by the executive director get st ar rated on them by the or g officer fully accept the hcofeb c projects given to you by the or g officer start implementin g these per department with teams and hes go ing to sa wher do i get these ams and the or g officer says now the re is certainly som data her on recruitin g and hiring personnel and the ne xt action here is get very busy hir ing and appointing personnel and hatting them to man up the stablishment of the or g using the feb c projects now at the s ame time if you count on hco to perf orm the functi ons of hco while it is try ing madly to get an hco there that can perf orm the functions of hco you re asking the febc11 as you return to your org 13 3271 febctapes 151 011004 has to do the org officer s job and weve now made that mist ake two or three times nd we neednt keep m aking the mist ake there is thing what soever wrong with the or g officer callin g angeles and s aying the c rew of the b olivar will report do you follow i mean theres place in these orders is the action of the or g officer in gettin g some people to get the p roduc tion out or anythin g else or in getting them hatted nowhe re does it say that the are done thr ough hco they don t neces sarily an org office r doesnt have to go near hco from one days end to the ne xt except to get the has on the ball now eventually it will start to wo rk but remember you havent got machine yet theres machine to run yet so the or g officer will have to do those actions neces sary to put enough establishment ther only hes not bui lding an establishm ent hes build ing jerry rig house f cards hes wise if he tries to build it on the or g boar d patter n and hes wise hes very wise if he tr ies to get the lines in on po licy and hes very wise if he does this that or the other thing with regard to the oec nd so forth hes very wise but hes not ordered to do so he isnt it is part of his lines sitting comfortably at his sk to pick up the inter com through the or g and sa give personnel he wou ld be all too often surprised to have noanswer at the other end of the line it would be up to him to eventually put personne l ther but how would he do that by puttin g an has there elementary so the est ablishm ent will occur but an stablishment rises proportional to the wher ewithal neces sary to resolve the case so nearly all or g officers ma ke the slight mista ke of putting dependency on hco now the mist ake that can be made by the p roduc t officer is to t inform the or g officer what hes up to the product fficers got to keep runni ng action and those he doesnt even have to brief the or g officer if he just h ands him the noteb ook every once in while that the tebook will communicate but ordinarily after hes gotten something straightened ou t he wr ites up what he di d so the res som kind of record of this thing otherw ise this gets very confusing so it also works in the case of an or g officer an or g officer who makes record of anything hes doing when it is totally in tradicti on to what hco is trying to do in the same sector your going to get very inte resting ridge but that ridge is broken down to the degr ee that the rg officer merely keeps hco informed as to what actions have been ta ken which might possibly imp inge up on hcos basic est ablishment action and then the other mist ake that can occu r is has gets confused and thinks the or g officer is the hcoes who is his senior who really is the ethics off icer f the org or is part of and so on so you want to get that mighty clear becaus an has who confuses what the or g officer is and thinks of the or g office r as his senior on whom he depends utterly for his rders the org officer isnt his senior its org office r is his nightmare i mean there is senior ity ther the or g officer definite ly is senior to the has but is not in the relationship of senior that you woul d ordinarily expect senior wou ld be responsible f or the area and zone the has is responsible for the stablishment and t the rg officer the org officer is responsible for the p roduct ion the rg officer is responsible for enou gh product usually product three to get the pr oducti on officer supported so he can get products out and theres wher he l ives and if he s an has thats go ing to come around every morning and febc11 as you return to your org 14 3271 febctapes 152 011004 say what ar you r orders sir and doesnt just get on with it why hes goi ng to be in trouble do you get how these thi ngs figu re out now they do disturb traditional relationships in an or g and they disturb those r elationships so badly that staff that is gr ooved in in some other way is liable to be bit confused and as i told you earlier if they feel better having an hes and having an oes and pes and so forth why thats fine but certainly theyve got to have distribution sec nd so on and if they feel better that way and it looks better that way if theyve got to have something l ike that you can always put somebody on there it doesnt matter its just three mor names on an org board but youl l find you rself immediately into some kind of an interesting situation youll find you rself in an interesting situation youre tryi ng to go through an ec committee authority and you re trying to do things in an or derly fashion and producti on is alway s done in disor derly fashion order is the excepti on and that is why you have whole officer the has devoted to br ingin g order in ter ms of putting an or g there whic h can run in an or derly fashion so that is as far as your orders go putting an hco there is quite job it is s ufficiently hard job that the re wer one and one half hco personnel in england one year ago one and one half hco personnel in the whole of england isnt that interesting mu st be very hard to put an hco there we had them cou nted i often wanted to see that half hco personnel that was year r so ago and it wa s period when the or g started to sag bit so what does it take to put an org the re money it takes income loot thats what ittakes and how do you make loot you iver and you get peop to come in and ta ke adv antage of the delive ry which you are accomp lishing and you develo p the consumpti on and that is how it works now you ar immediately goi ng to collide with the proportional pay system which is being abolished now as soon as we can get this back ed up and straightened ou t new financial situation is being arranged for sciento logy organizations as well as sea or g orgs its more or less running this way in sea or g orgs now the xact form that it takes is p robably still open to some adjudicati on there are some peo ple wh have say in this line people run these finance networks and they have their own ways of doing things and you cant be too dictato rial and mandatory about the who thing for the xcellent reason that they also have working ar rangement so the xact actions ar based on this fo rmula however that the or g has an allocati on which is minimum allocation its b read crust s urvival it covers the rents and the lights and it might cover litt staff pay pock et ch ange and they make all of their money on product ion bonuses and its the degr ee of productio n which was brough t about by the rg wh ich deter mines their allocati on and goin g in on an fbo system and it runs simply l ike this financial plannin g is done on the b asis of necessities nd along wi th that is the state f product ion for that xisting perio d and that is pa ssed thr ough to the division three and so on and its an ad counc il action and division three has chec klist of the necessities of an or g and they check this off and they that if its wi thin rights then they do what financial adju stment or financial planning is done in the fiel d of financial planning this is then forwarded to finanfebc 11 as you ret urn to our org 15 3271 febctapes 153 011004 ce banking of ficer as submission for allocatio n the flag finance banking of ficer you notice the tit s been slightly shifted then makes an allocation all of the income of the or g ispicked up and banked by the finance banking fficer in probably two separate accounts they are man agement accounts that money which is allocated is then given over to the rmal banking sy stem which an or g follows the adjudication as to the rightness wr ongness nd otherwise f this is done quite fairly that adjud icatory function when all becomes too horrible and so on is given to the guar dians off ice so that if this situation goes completely out of gear or injustice s are occur ring or something like that there is local submission that c an be m ade so that the guar dians office can adjust it guardians office has an xcellent r ecord on cashbills now the man agement debts of the or g or the man agement part of the rg or manage ment costs in managing the org normally come out of the m anagem ent accounts so that the org does not have to be too worried about that in that fashion reserve is bu ilt up and xpan sional actions can occur in the or g witho ut the inc ome being consumed in day to day running operations and that way you wi ll get n establishment other wise i cant conceive of any way you will get one so if the pr oduct ion is ther the allocation of course is quite good and if production isnt there it is bar est survival and in that way why we have alr eady got succe ssful actions in this theres lot of backgr ound in how this is done but it has never been laid down as an exact for mula on ho w it is done and you could expect that for mula from time to time to be shifted but the formula is simply that ther is basic allocation to the org and that ba sic allocati on keeps it from getting into the sher rifs hands and that s about all and the or g to make any income and pay and do other things of that char acter and pay its payr olls and so forth that org would then have to have certain p roduc tion and these are called producti on bonuses but they ar ent bonuse s to the ind ividual theyr bonuse s to the rg now that would influence financial planning and might very well act in this fashionthe product f such and such division was practically nil therefore the request s for fp and so forth by that divisi on and so fo rth would get rather jaundiced eye from the tr easury sec and it wo uld certainly get jaundiced eye fr om the fi nanc office r fifteen st aff members produc ing nothing so it doesnt get bonus so that div ision would stay on s tarvation level until it got produc tion and in that way then you don t have your throat cut as produc t officer of having all kinds of consumptio n of the valuable final product at the or g in such way that you cannot build an tablishment cause youd find yourself just stalled on plane unless s uch system wer introduced the proportional pay system has served its purpose as long as i wa s managing orgs fairly directly people actually received more money than they or dinarily would have r eceived on the pr oportional pay sy stem that s not been the case for som time and the p roportional pay sy stem wa s to maintain an or g so that it di d not become inso lvent and we hav maintained these or gs w we re ready to boom them and so on so the proportional pay sy stem peop are thank ed for having been on that system s hor rible as that system occasionally worked out to be but they have ctually served their pu rpose they have k ept the beach head febc11 as you return to your org 16 3271 febctapes 154 011004 now of course the valuable final products of the or g are on the feb c on another subject he re the valuable final p roducts f the rg are on the feb c org board at the bott om or should be and i can r ead them off now there are products and there are valuable final products and although the valuable final products of an or ganization are let sa one more thing about the finance sy stem the thing that you will run into in the finance system is not understanding it and the r eason peo ple wo nt understand it its to simple actually you re running on much mo re comp licated finance sy stem w the feb c org b oardand i ts vfp s 7102 c03 s feb c 12 3 february 1 971 alright now lets ok at this p roduct product each department would have product each divisio n theo retically has pr oduct and these pr oducts ar in the most part subpr oducts if you want to be very technical about it becaus they build up int valuable final product now valuable fi nal pr oduct is one that you can exchange with the society for the wherewithal which the society has th is is by defin ition by definit ion it is something for which you can exchange the services nd goods f the society and if you want that now of course that woul d seem to be just money and the truth f the matter is to large degree the society not really deliverin g and not really serving has to count totally upon money but trained auditor is valuable final product because he s an inte rchange with the society around you preclear is valuable final product because he brings about an inte rchange with the society around you and money is valuable final product becau is br ings about an inte rchange with the society around you in even communism wher money is out lawed but they have inc ome tax you didn t know that about russia one of the r ussians main pr oblems today is income tax ou didn t know that w ell anyhow they invented it they ought to get it boy overt motivator sequence s but you in actu fact on this type of economy and thinking in this particu lar way you would see that preclear receiving service actu ally does br ing about an inte rchange an audito r out in the society r eceives an inte rchange and if you look over if you look over economics as well l ook it over from the st andp oint of barter and you will understand far more about money than they understand in switzer land thats dirty remark isnt it the on lytrouble with switzer land is that s all they understand that money is money is money is money is money is money is money is money now they understand p retty well how to is this money to her and is the money back gain and so on and one day itll all as is and theyl l wonder what in the devil theyr doin g the truth of the matter is that barter is better xpression of econ omics any d ay of the week why because when money inflate s and goes bad people resort to barter so barter must be the basi s of money so therefore that is something which you should keep in mind if febc12 the f ebc org board and i ts vfps 2 3271 febctapes 156 011004 the w orld all f sudden goes communist or socialist or fascist r something else wher your money factors go out you still have barter type s ystem which can functi on its barter system is clumsy and i m not saying that barter is the thing you should engage in im just showing you that ther are diffe rent coins than cash ther are diffe rent coins th an cash pr oducts whic h you have them selves could probably be di gnified if you changed the econ omy you were operating with as valuable final products but the wher ewithal whic h you need in the society in which you will operate is money and the way to ma ke money is to tur n out valuable products in ter ms of money and receive the money and convert it int an est ablishment your way its the relative simplici ty of the sy stem wh ich lends itself to use but there are other system s and you can work them out and so on cau basic ally what you re trying to do is inte rchange youre tryin g to get service s for service and if you underst and barter and how service could be translated dir ectly int commo dity and you understand that that can occur you ll all of sudden r ealize that your service s to be r eal and that every product that you put ou t has to be an inte rchange able product with commod ity p otentially and that doesnt mean audited flubbed up p reclear now you g out and try to trade banged up can of beans fo r nice sleek new c an of soup and you wi ll see at once that you r product has to stand up and money obscur the fact that delive ry must be of good quality and that is the thing which you must r emember and doing product officer job that your delivery has to remain of good quality so therefore therefore you probably have hill to cl imb in getting up quality stat actually should consist of volume quality and viabi lity and the quality must not be neglected but you can try to push the quality up so high that you get interchange at all the art formula applies to producti on in the ca of the art formula which is you see that it is commun ication you cou ld actually push the perfecti on of art up to point wher it not only doesnt communicate its never released at all i sometimes watch cs grooming up pc with life repairs and i won der if hes trying to repaint leonar do da vincis mona lis i get them acr oss my des k every once in whi the guy s certainly gone as high as he possibly could go in this grade and if we repair him just once more or if we gr oom him up just one extra uditing comm and we have h ad it so ther time when you let go f the product you so communicati on must still exist ther must be transfer f communicati on partic called products othe r words theyve got to flow so your quality is something that you rise and so you r letter registrar can sometimes tell you we are working here why didnt we get ny letters out this wee k w ell actually were checking out everybody in cf and we re filing up cf perfectly and we have got the quality here and weve g ot to raise this quality because weve had two letters in the pa st year which have criticized us for our lack of quality so the hundr ed thousand letters wh ich we xpect to get out in this year must be of good quality and the fou r hund red and sixty two r eplies we get every week ar neglected becau they arent complain ing or som ething i mean its as crazy as this you just get acrazy xplanation the w ay to do it is you get your volume and then make it of quality so you will have to do this f cou rse with technical delivery so this its true of all of thes products evefebc12 the febc org b oard and i ts vfps 3 3271 febctapes 157 011004 ry one of thes products get it up in volume improve its quality and i f you do that you wi ll achieve viabil ity if you try to improve its qu ality wit hout raising its volume you will not ever achieve viabil ity nor will you achieve vo lume so it goes one tw three it goes volume quality viabil ity and one f those thin gs extends f rom the st one so you think in those terms in productio n you think in those ter ms with regard to all of the products which you have department ally and ill just r ead you ff rapid ly so itll be matter of record the v arious products of departments as they exist as of this particular time and reserve the right to improve this list or imp rove the wor ding of these products and that is department twenty one is the techno logy of dianetics and scient ology and its products in ot her wo rds that is the knowledge with which you ar dealing but its the techno logy of dianetics and sciento logy and its pr oducts w ell thats great you say but really the ffice of lrh and r on is on flag and so forth youve got dep artment twenty one in your org now policy knowledge is goin g to leav the gu ardians office as funct ion and is being moved over int the office of lrh and this wa s one of the old hats one of the ld hats of the lrh comm and you ll find an old time lrh comm knows his policy backwar ds and forwards so thats putting it ou t yes he s ays but r eally he isnt keeping the mimeo files how coul d he do it that s knowledge now if your department twenty one isnt putt ing ou t any knowledge in this di rection of any kind what soever or offering anything and so f orth why its not doing its job what was the lrh number one eds and why wa s the lrh comm trying to put those into orgs itwas directly and with some sperity in ca ses trying to put knowledge into the lines righ t now department one is effective personnel posted and hatted now that is posted of course includes an or g boar d and effective personnel youd have to get some personnel so of course it inclu des recruited personnel so theres s ubproduct of that is hi red recruited r acquir ed personnel but the end r esult of this the actions of that department ar effective personnel posted and hatted you dont have any personnel you know what department to look to now the odd part of it is is very valuable commodity in the society is staff member and this is sufficient ly valuable as poin t of interchange although you really cant get any money f or it sometimes i f irst hit this when i found out why i was losing secr etaries way back in the early fifties the fact th at girl had been my s ecretary was an adequ ate recommendation to become an xecutive secr etary to some mill ionai re someplace and i lost mor secretaries they we re trained up and it wa s very funny but my secretary in south frican count ry was just an verage stenographer until i got her trained up for very short period of time and what do you know she wa s hired by the richest man in malawi for ten thousand year why w ell they knew administrative sy stems they knew the basic fundament als of administrative sy stems and so they went into category called executive secretary do you know that you lose peop all over the place to busine sses your orgs actu ally lose people to busines ses you look ar ound and find out what they re doing now those st aff members who have been wel l trained turn up in the most remar kable places i remember one time in london somebody called up som big co rporation to talk to its president one day and febc12 the f ebc org board and i ts vfps 4 3271 febctapes 158 011004 they wanted to know what they wanted to talk to him about and they said i think the personcallin g said w ell i want to talk to him about sciento logy and ther was click and whup and so fo rth on the ph one and voice came on the phone and said this is mr blank scient ology consultant and the person doing the phoning was talking to his jun ior of last week now this is one f the r easons why weve instituted in the department of trainin g h at college becau its apparently valuable commodity just look amongst you rselves ho w you fight to keep or connive to acquir an xperienced trained or hatted staff member now tell theyr not valuable alright department two is communicati ons asily accepted and swif tly delive red it doesnt need too much embr oidery but its just that now it of course could have volume and it could have quality and od dly enough can have viability dont mail the mail for couple of week s and how b roke you go well of course that s pretty pretty blunt but the truth of the matter is you wi ll hear occasionally somebody who is try ing to raise the quality of the letter registrar ive had this happen raise the quality of the letter registrars letters t rue enough they can be ghastly occasionally but somebody somebody is busy trying to raise this quality like mad and you sa why well this stuff just pours in from the rg you see and peop in the field dont like it or they dont accept it and do you know that s urvey proved entirely the reverse even when they didn t answer them that the bulk of the peop around and so fo rth were very happy and little bit hono red to get commun ications f rom the or g you see you only hear from the people who complain and the other guys sit out there and they r eceive them and they re very happy to receive these thin gs once in blue moon why youll get complaint six thous and circulation magazine edito r once told once told that peop in the field didnt like the h ard sell that wa s in the m agazine and i said how many peo ple in the field and she scraped up every letter that cou ld be scraped up and ther were twelvewhat batting average t welve out of six thousand unfortunately that st ate f mind prevailed the magazine went sof t sell and the or gs income started go ing ou t the bottom well this is not necessarily that but this is just m ailed communicati ons easily accepted it says so communicati on wh ich is dispatch in its proper form is easily accepted dispatch anything that is m ailed that can be ccepted and the truth of the matter is that quality factor enter s in ther and person can object along that l ine to the quality and we used to have thin gs called comm inspecti ons it could easily be extended over also into quality so department tw is communicati ons as i said easily accepted and swiftly delive red and department three is an est ablished active and ethical or g well thats the pr oduct so that is the p roduct of hco so its the p roduct of the st department of hco and look what that department contains it contains inspecti on it contains stat s and it contains ethics and you could nt have much of an stablishment unless it we re an ethical establishm ent and it argues b ack and fo rth again st itself so that is the product if you dont have pr oduct why then som ebody must not be using the expertise of stats and that sort of thi ng with r egard to the st aff your staff stats and so fo rth it may be febc12 the f ebc org board and i ts vfps 5 3271 febctapes 159 011004 nobody even looks at them neglect any place along the line and that department wi ll wind up with not having one so that you can sa is the product now department four is effective promoti on pieces pr inted and sent out so notice it says effective wipes out lot of mimeo magazine s puts in lot of surveys it actually changes your ope rating l ine becau effective effective what is the defin ition of effective w ell you can sure figure that out it woul d be something that wa s answered and p referably answer ed with body so the or g mailed out thousand p romotion pieces and only nine hundr ed peop cam in what the hells the matter with that dep artment but that is the rati on whichyou woul d be perating how much went out how much came in ou could probably figure the pe rcent department five is have course pac ks and tape s plus these valuable final products of the rg sold and delive red bo oks sold and delive red tapes sold and delive red meters sold and delive red insignia ou probably some d ay or another will see that product neated up but if you just k eep up if it gets ne ated up and those dis appear youl l have h ad it the funny part of it is th at sold and deliver ed book does not cease to be v aluable final product of the or g becau it is out there read nd read ag ain and r ead by somebo dy else and so on so when you dont have books out there you of course ar not export ing knowledge to the society and tapes when tapes dis appear ed once out of whole continental area tiny one the wh ole subject went bad and it wa s why why was eventually found in this ter minology of that day and it was found that they hadnt played single tape anywher in that ar ea for two years when they played tapes in that ar ea for two years it went bad and when tapes were played ag ain why everythi ng go t fine so it was just the fact of commun ication ther was factor of communicatio n which had been dr opped so if you r org isnt selling any tape s da da do do if you dont have ny tapes being played down in the distribution div ision or someplace or somebody isnt playing tapes or there arent any study groups playin g tape s and ther tape s why you will develop some tr ouble not f rom us you will develo p some trouble from you r field and of course sold and deliver ed meter s and over the dead body f numer ous indiv iduals who seem to make it their dedicated possibi lity of holdin g their withholds absolutely secret and if i were them i wou ld you know were still selling meters now sold and delive red insignia is not done anywher near enough but look i wonder why i wonder why your org doesnt sell the s tudent the m aterials f his cou rse ouknow i think its shame that he doesnt and i won der why som ebody cant have his hat when he goes way i should think he could and i won der why an shsbc doesnt have every shsbc tape he ever listened to i dont know why in fact i don t know why you havent got total ar chives in your org see i dont know why at all so you start you st art looking this ove r you say hats course pac ks and tape s the truth of the matter is its just wer just being big hearted and weve never looked at what you can do wi th hat s and course chec k sheet s and cou rse tapes w just never looked at that we used to have rush pr oject wh ich wa s very inter esting after every cong ress the tapes of that cong ress were instantly av ailable to any attendee of the cong ress and we used to sell an awful lot of tapes now that that to some degr ee is neglected as valuable final profebc12 the febc org b oard and i ts vfps 6 3271 febctapes 160 011004 duct so pr oduct fficer shoppin g around inside of all this can very often find some that arent even listed down here but befor you distort the or g too much make sur they re valu able enough to be bothe red wit h can they achieve volume is one of your questions you can sometime s spend mo re administerin g something than you can be recompensed for now number six hold your hat its the inc ome gr eater than ou tgo plus reserves and that is why the invoice department is being shifted di rectly and immediately to six the invo ice machine is go ing right over int six i found ou t odd ly enou gh the reason why manage ment org must hav service or g alongside of it wa s great inter est to you anyb ody in liaison office would find itself xtremely emb arrassed if it were too distant from an actual wo rking org becaus theyll lose the s cene and the scen disappears fr om before their view and the famil iarity ceases xist and the refore orders and cor rectio ns can be qu ite unr eal alright so i found out that you cant get an inv oice sy stem in to tech if it runsthrough cashier strangely enough the busines s of the cashier is to is to handle the ca sh and where an or g has cr edit and an or g inevitably has some kind of credit problems as long as it has qual it wi ll have cr edit problems of one kind r another so that any credit invoice or any debit invo ice r any other kind of an invoice has got to go int department seven and its got to be addr ess plated fo ldered statement she eted and so on people are alway s sending this in we try to get out of the credit busines s we can never make it and peop are alway s sending in hund red do llars too much and what do you do with it w ell you put it int the statem ent files and the guy now has statement hes plus hundr ed when it gets upsetting is in the book department when they consistently will send in another do llar or two and you will go down in book department and you will find that they very often have little credit file and people are alw ays leaving money on c redit in the book department and you g dow n ther and youl l find out theres comp licated lit tle file thats being kept by somebody who is shipping books or something and its the most remar kable thing you ever sa w in your life itll be twenty cents xtra and dollar and h alf short and two buck s extra and thin gs lik this and if you dont keep it up peop get upset to but what happened to that venty five cents that i sent you alright so income greater than out go plus r eserve s is six now that mean s that the r egistrar occasionally is goin g to have to hump but then the registrar will have various functions and things in the r egistration department which will funct ion advanced r egistration is total flop in actual fact comparison to what it could be by depending on divisi on th ree to do the co llecti ons becau div ision three does not have the files or the knowledge of this nor the advanced registratio n books with which to continue to send it out so we all of sudden have plating addr ess platin g action occur ring in department six anybody whos advance r egistered and put five do llars in on course immediately gets plate and he gets bill and youjust k eep billing them nd so it has to go out as bill ing and the advance registration only breaks down when this isnt d one alright department sev is all funds col lected f or services and s ales thats all fun ds collected f or services and sa and so on department sev doesnt have nythi ng to do much with viabi lity or anything else theyve just got to collect all the money in sight thats febc12 the f ebc org board and i ts vfps 7 3271 febctapes 161 011004 all that s the w ay they do it they set themselve s up admin istratively to collect all the money in sight i f its money they col lect it if its owed they co llect it they collect it so if theyr not set up to co llect why theyve had it in other words you become unw orkable the or g becomes unwo rkable f rom viability point of view one whole org at this particu lar moment f not one of the sser or gs either is fallin g on its he ad right at this minute becau its inv oice and co llecti ons s et ups ar so poor that it is being paid thirtyfive dol lars s eventy five do llars twenty six dollars f or dianetic courses and they wonder why they cant pay their staff well the advanc registration the dep osit on the course that line is out so well just put it back the way it was or iginally and let her r oll now department eight is subject to great misinterpr etation and its pleas ed creditors they re pr oduct now f cou rse you cou ld please them by over paying them but that isnt expected and as m atter of fact they woul dnt be plea sed if they were over paid becau it wrecks their bookk eeping system but occasionally som printin g firm will make nice try and af ter that be very withho ldy they wil l send you three bi lls and then send you the summ ary bill of the three bi lls and then tak payment s for all fou r bills and after that you find them very hard to live with so they re unpleas ed because theyve now got withho ld but pleas ed creditors department nine is adequ ate and wel l cared for materiel the word adequat means ithas to get issued and well cared fo r and so on the re is an additi onal funct ion in the re theyve got to be able to get togethe r their balance s heets nd so on unless th at is adjusted on the rg board but that is definite ly provided fo r that div ision three should get something out that s to do with its b asic quarter ly summ aries and so on now department ten is adequ ately supplied course s rapid eff iciently scheduled routed and handled students and pcs and that is f cou rse tech services and we have lear ned recent ly that fo r some r eason r othe r this department will with comp letely straight face try to get its quo ta by having f ortyfive per cent of its auditors idle and making fiftyfive percent of its audito rs work do uble their rmal auditing hours this pr oduct can r eally be go ofy so when it comes to bonus sy stem s and so on that department actually loses bonuses for all id nonquota auditors it can lost its bo nus nd its p ay the way its t up right w cause they will leave peop unscheduled they wil l leave people uncalled in and there is wher your well done auditing hours goes to pieces ou will find that something pecul iar is being done with scheduling now one of the way s you sa well the d of p draws up all these schedules for pcs and those ar all traditi onal so what cou ld that have to do wi th tech services the way tech services does it its tech services get s the list and then s the audito rs come in tech services s tands side whi they ar gue about which pcs to take when and that can ma ke such balled up mess as you wouldn t believe it one of our high stat audito rs by the way just ta kes the pcs just in rotation as theyr handed to him and the others shif t the pcs and change their positi ons and change the appointments and adjust the schedule and so on and in the process of do ing so they dont nece ssarily lose hours but they lose their who day and then you ask them w ell why dont you ever study or something the res lot of abuse s can febc12 the f ebc org board and i ts vfps 8 3271 febctapes 162 011004come into this particular tech s ervice department and most of your trouble in trying to get out delive ry and so on you will have with tech services and tech s ervices they will invent lines to try to get tech services in the basic l ines of tech services ar in policy already and tech services ctually worked the most s moothly and so on along about 65 some time like that and you find out an org which you have r ight now theyve p robably got some invented tech service l ine that knock s out your producti on the worst ca what i have ever seen wa s an org had thi rtyfive audito rs and some of them audited two and half hou rs week you mean full pay full time auditors and some of them audited two and half hou rs week w hy ho w w ell the why in this ca wa s the registrar wa s doing all of the tech services functi ons and the d of ps funct ions the registrar was scheduli ng the pc with this simple additive when do you want your sessions and then this would be sent over to tech services and the d of p as th is person dem ands his ssions on and all we ch anged was remove the question and we told the pc to be the re monday that was th at and thi rtyfive auditors instantly started to audit their fu ll quota of the day and the income went up righ t up through the roof and my god you never sa w so much money in your life they wer going mad in the they wer running out f invoices nd everythin g else it was ter rible p roblems over in department ven they couldn t keep enou gh invoices in the place m achines k ept b reaking down from over use and you know ca sh drawers k ept br eaking bo ttoms fell out of them thats the kind of problems i can h ave but the simple switch in this p articular case was remov ing one question from the r egistrars r eperto ire interesting isnt it this probably wou ld bring up the question when does the pr oduct officer cease nd the rg officer begin they begin on the subject of line whenever product officer finds himself in the f ield of line li nes or adjusting line why he s got hold of something thatbelongs to the or g officer and he should turn it over he can handle it if he wants but he wont get anyplace tryi ng to do the or g officers jo b alright so department eleven is valu able final product f the rg and valuable final product it is effectively trained peop who can skillfully apply what they have lear ned and wi ll apply it do you not ice it doesnt sa certi ficate s an auditor who cannot audit is liability hes not valuable final product and weve g ot too many of them being taught right this minute and boy we have to put them over the jumps when we get them her boy do we put them over the jumps and what do you know it takes two way comm and actual case supervision and evaluation from the bulletins and just lik it says in teaching course and the way to get valuable final product there is get the course taught the w ay its supposed to be taught and that s all you have to do difficult isnt it it actually isnt di fficult at all i don t know how anybody makes lousy audito r i think its almo st almost impossible to make lousy auditor so any time you tur n loose an audito r who cant audit why youve cut down your field and youve cut this down and youve done that so thats not only valuable fi nal pr oduct that s product that c an recoil now its been true of department twelve hgc the v aluable final product of the or g but its pr oduct now hear this pr oduct is the wi ns of preclears nd pre ots its p roduct is wins it actually is try ing to move itself up to the persistent fn it is not trying to as far as febc12 the f ebc org board and i ts vfps 9 3271 febctapes 163 011004 the pub lic is concer ned and as far as basic tech is concer ned it is not trying to reform people it isnt try ing to do all the mult itudin ous other things that you think it could do but as far as the hgc is concer ned it is simply wins quantity of and they ar expressed ctually by the width of an fn so they re even on meter somebody who ends the session with quarter of an inch fn well done auditing session it might have fned if the examine r had xaminedthe pc on meter im sor ry im sorry actually my r ibaldry som etimes is prodded into existence and so on ive had too much to do wit h straightening out lines and so forth and recent ly weve been straightenin g out some lines and your getting some r eal productio n but the pr oduct ion which your getting is absolute ly fanta stical and the amount of persistent fn and that sort of thing which is tur ning up on thes lines is practically unhear d of now the xactnes s and the str ess nd duress which it takes to achieve this and the xactne ss of the auditin g and so fo rth come s from the its only doable if you have of course trained auditor in the first place now when we havent go t trained audito r and we have to retrain the audit or and we have to retread him and we have to recram him and we hav to do this wi th him and we hav to do that with him and so f orth befor we can put him on to auditin g then that shows ther was something wrong with the instruc tion in the first place and it just wasnt done according to the xt book that was all but its wins wins every once in while i get som ethin g from cs actually this person has not done the three last pr ocesses of this particu lar grade and the fn wont stop so that we can do them now this is why this is couched in terms of wins now how many wins can you get you give quick lower grades all in twenty minute s and youve got one win wher eas there are in actu fact about thi rty or forty wins that c an be gotten in that area so how do you milk this for wins this will kill you i had c ase th at was all muck ed up the ot her day and so on case came in her from some place god awful been audited upside down and bac kwar ds and so forth and i took ok at this c ase and i audited him on disu sed power p rocess i got win its powe r process that patches up auditing but isnt generally used becau nob ody ever gets int that far or into that much tr ouble on powe r so i just said w ell its doin g good in that pac kage lets pul l it out of that pac kage r it on this pc so ho w can youcoax win out of situation this case w as hopeless it would have been hund red and seventy nine hours f life repairs been self auditing for the last eighteen years gone all the way to ot 6 wit hout having read any of the materials xcept to sort of glance at them shudder clinch get away from them quickly attest nicely restimulated now how do you get win out of that ho w can you shake it down for wins well you can give case win by str aightening them out and when it is straightened out recognize that you have s traightened it ou t and the ca has win now of course youve got the who parade all the way f rom dianetics to ot 6 all wi open to get wins on the way the ca is handled how many wi ns can you get in this ca not how quick can we fin ish the ca because th ats complet ion you offer comp letions you can say comp letions on stat but the w ay the xaminer is rigged up now hel l register it as win you got it febc12 the f ebc org board and i ts vfps 10 3271 febctapes 164 011004 so from the product fficers point of view its ho w many wins it that hgc getti ng per capita and if he can just k eep that flying why the enthu siasm will go out in all directions now department thir teen and ther it got shaken up when we put in thing called hat col lege and it sort f tried to drop out of existence and bunch of things lik this and various things happened along in this l ine and when you don t understand whats happening its good thing to just ho ld on to what youve got thats good maxim and department thirteen department f personal enhancement is effective and well trained org staff members well thats fine but they would have to program them nd so on now to some deg ree this is pr obably susceptible to modi fication if the hat co llege has this but it isnt l ikely that the h at college would have this these peop wou ld have to be programmed and handled and qualled and so f orth in order to ma ke them that and the st ofunct ions have not been dropped ou t of the or g so that is just fancy way of saying sto alright department fou rteen is mo re effic iently produced rg valuable final products so youve got builtin an tablishment co rrection machine ther is built in product three or g serie s ten and that doesnt relieve the pr oduct office r or the org officer of any of his respo nsibil ity and it probably however wi ll cut quite few miles off their pedometers now department fifteen is cor rected org products and its earned certificate s and awar ds now actually these dont necessarily verif or coor dinate with the stats w hav stat action and this is whe re this comes up we have s tat s eries f stats which scatter down th rough somehow or another give you the vo lume of producti on the quality of producti on and the viabi lity of an or g and that oic set of stats when you re used to reading them will give you all thr ee of those nswers wher eas if you just took all of these pr oducts and they became the only stats you had in the or g you might or might t wind up with it now succes s stor ies and the gross income divided by the number of staff members ar the tradit ional earlier stat s of qual and since we dropped those st ats why qual has not been as well off as it has been in the pa st so that ag ain this is mea surin g something up by wins ou can xpect some minor change in this ar ea is the only thing im alerting you to but when you have the minor change why you will have it and ri ght w you have the fact that the product is the cor rected org products in other words the product f the rg corrected and that wou ld be too succes ses nd its arned certificates and aw ards they of course ar very valuable to the people to whom they are issued particu larly if they are earned and if they ar very very well earned they ar very valuable to people and its quite valuable final product to the ind ividual department sixteen is effective pr and adv ertising actions that attract members of thepublic to become scientol ogists so now weve gone external now if you want to underst and the distr ibution division the distri bution div ision is external into the public external and the dissem division of course is inter nal but youve not iced that the re has been shif t of empha sis here given by the produc ts w have effective pr and advertising actions that attract members of the publ ic to become scient ologists fine that s you r outside advertising when they d ropped advertisement s in books in england ther was trouble they didnt have the flow they h ad befor it was simply an advertising campaign you drop advertising campaigns febc12 the f ebc org board and i ts vfps 11 3271 febctapes 165 011004 of all sorts and descript ions and f cou rse your consumption drops naturally so this is ctually where you re coun ting on you r consumpt ion of new zones new consumpti ons now youve alr eady got ld consumptions and thin gs to consume oldly back in the second div ision thats dis sem div ision so you r new consumptions and new f rontiers all come from that ar ea department seventeen hol d you r hat department seventeen this gives you an entir ely different think in the st andpo int of pub lic divisions department seventeen is hatted scient ologists and som pess will look at that and some pub lic division people will look at that and they wi ll say certainly changes things and you will expect the vgis well theyl l probably come in two or three day s later they suddenly get it figured out and theyr away department eighteen is active field scient ologists now of course that then is furnishing these people with sold books distr ibuted materials to actu ally if you look over these peop very carefully you will find out that scient ologist in his personal contact d oes the major ity of you r selling for you ther was an old campaign sell book and ma ke friend the bulk of your distribut ion of scientol ogy materials and so on cou ld easily be done fromthat particu lar ctor providing thes people ar given as sistance to do so so youve got actually the b ook stor sales over the re become very active and tremendously swelled up if youve got department eighteen funct ioning ou t ther selling and i f theres groups out there of them and thin gs of that character and thats what it takes to make an or g expand youve got to open up new consumpti on ar eas the peop thatll open these up are hatted sciento logists department sevente who turn into active fie ld scient ologists in eighteen right now department nineteen is viable or g and of course the valuable final products of the active fie ld scient ologist have boug ht bo oks disseminated knowledge envi ronmental control on cle ared planet so thats how you d that so theyr hatted in eighteen they become active fiel d scient ologists now nobodys tal king about field staff member active field scient ologist they could also be one f those and an ctive field scient ologist if he s the valuable fi nal pr oducts of boug ht bo oks disseminated knowledge he wi ll then get envi ronmental control and hell get clear ed planet and thats how the j ob is go ing out now the department twenty is of cou rse the off ice of the cont roller which is really the guar dians off ice with all guar dians bu reaus in it and is usually manned in an org by an ag and will often have an g finance this s the valuable final product of acceptance s of scient ology its acceptance s and you will find ou t that transl ates several ways f rom the midd it transl ates in numerous di rections it would consist of combattin g an enemy pr opag anda action it would consist of getting in go od press it wou ld consi st of quite few things but the end f all of that is pr oduct and its cceptance so you could actually mea sure up numerical ly accept ances and that too gover ns to marked degr ee the viabi lity of the or g at large so of course it adds into all f the ot her p roducts now if that office is basically external and while its busy trying to straighten ou t thegrooffloof of having hired sweet bets ey from pike wh turned out to be and is trying to handle that if they re out there in the society faced outwar ds and handlin g things on long run and n external reach then you ll get acc eptances so actually it detracts fr om thei r product to handle inter nally orgs and one of the things thats happening right now is the guarfebc12 the febc org b oard and i ts vfps 12 3271 febctapes 166 011004 dians of fice has h ad to take over several rgs and several sectors to make up f or the sl ack of febc students out and it is one of your duties to get the place running so the guar dians office doesnt have to be walking up and down with sher lock ho lmes cap th rough the cor ridors of the or g get em extroverted dont give them tr ouble and dont get them distracti ons give them r eassurance s w ell take care of the or g here and f course as we have already given you here the teen w as of course viable or g now the off ice of the rg boar d you re working on her has the ffices of the xecutive director the product fficer and the or g officer and the xecutive director wh is r eally the p roduc t officers p r and the executive di rector or the pr oduct officers messenger has several the valuable final products ar of cou rse the pr oduct fficer of products one the executive director has products one tw three and fou r org series ten he is basically when you get it out into triangular system the planning officer and he is the fellow that the pr oduct officer and the or ganiz ing fficer meet with in order to plan up what they re going to do and then the b asic team ction wh ich occu rs occurs af ter planning action of this particu lar charact er wher you have the pr oduct office r wh is also the xecutive director he is also the plannin g officer hes doub hatted and you shouldnt lose sight f the fact that he is dou ble hatted and the pr oduct officer f cou rse has pr oducts two and four which is the cor rection of the p roduc t of the est ablishment and of course the pr oduct of the establishm ent and the orgofficer has pr oducts one and three and that is the establishment and the co rrection of the stablishment actually product one is delegated but is really just delegated to the has but then so is everythin g else delegated fr om these and youve got the ful l broad span of it now finance office will sooner or later come into establishment in department twenty one and it wi ll have as its product reserves but the facts of the c ase are that the org itself accumulate s reserves out of its own all ocated funds and the ca shbills ratio is reported just in case the p oint ever comes up is what the rg has not what might be into the manage ment reserve accounts the res been some confusi on on that r ecently so therefore you have list f those p roducts and it is ger mane to this particu lar talk im givin g you what pr oducts you are goin g for now the p roduct officer of course has all of those p roducts and the or g officer puts the organization there to att ain the p roduc ts and as far as the stablishment itself is concer ned that is put ther by delegatio n by the has the febc projects and so f orth if teams ar put to gether to run those you will find out that they very smoot hly move into the or g boar d as being the ctual department and its funct ion what do you do when an feb c project is completed what do you do when an feb c project is completed well you start in at the m ajor target and do it all again and this time you do it big ger and better and you can alw ays do project mo re perfect ly and mo re vol uminously than you did it last time and f rom time to time you will probably have amend ations on these projects based on your own experience with these projects and they wi ll be releas ed as an r after the ed number and youl l notice ea ch one of thes projects is numbe red and so they can be r eferred to in tele x they c an be referred to in correction and they can be r eported on in mos febc12 the f ebc org board and i ts vfps 13 3271 febctapes 167 011004 now the fact s of the ca ar that when person is on mos person is supposed toreport now what is your relationship to clo i can give you that very very brie fly clo is ther to collect data fo r flag and to get flag projects xecuted and to handle immediate emer gencies which are nece ssary to be handled the clo is t ther to send out w ork parties it is not there to hold hands nd its not nece ssarily ther to shoot people it is ther to give hand to give advice to relay dat and for that reason in department twenty one you have nother post which is liaison fficer hes the bu reau liaison officer now all of your communicati on to the bu reau should go through bureau liaison fficer and all the commun ication from bur eau should go to the bureau liaison officer and any communicati on from an ec any communicati on of any kind whatsoever f rom an ec s to be clear ed through bur eau and is part of bureaus function ing and it is do ne in coordination with and under the supervision of product ion aid or assistant product ion aid the excepti on to this is the guar dian office communication lines which travel directly of course to the as sistant guar dian of an or g and travel bac k and those l ines although they wi ll go through the commun ication lines of bureau do not neces sarily clear through any other terminal in the bu reau they ar the re for relay they wou ld go there they wou ld go to external comm actu ally and xternal comm bureau wou ld forward them straight on either to ecww or otherw ise or an assistant guar dian can actu ally commun icate directly to guar dian ww or communicate di rectly to flag and in additi on to that another set of commun ication lines xist in the vicinity of the finance office and the finance off ice goes di rectly from flag to the finance office there are three hat s whic h exist then in the department twenty one and those ar you r basic communicati on hat s its the lrh they re the basic th rough this terminal communication hat xcept as i have just given you on the gu ardians office and this department twenty one you have the lrh comm now ba sically that is my communicati on line and i hope after this is all set up to actually have communication line into the org becaus now that lrh comm is so d ouble hatted and so otherwise ou t of department that its sometimes diff icult to get communicatio n into the rg and get commun ication back from the or g so there are three ba sic hats ther just spe aking rganizationally thats the lrh comm who is the department head and then there is the l iaison bureau liaison fficer who is the ba sic communicati on terminal through which the bur eau communicates to the or g and then there is the finance banking officer who is part of the finance netw ork these thr ee things it w ould be such str ess that i certainly wouldn t advise it but it actually could be triple hatted p ost in small org to begin with and one of the first thin gs th at he would probably get rid of there would be the finance ban king officer hat in one awful hur ry becaus of course this is your final terminal f or fp fo rwarded there from the division three and hed have to handle all of that but nevertheles s those posts you will find it wou ld be very go od to man them and when you can get up big enough so that all three posts can be manned this is the thing to do so therefore the sion commun ication goes out of the org actually through the bu reau liaison officer to the m anagement aide of the bur eau to flag and that is the commun ication line for mission orders so if you re pr oduct officer an executive director or an or g officer or an febc12 the f ebc org board and i ts vfps 14 3271 febctapes 168 011004 has who is on mission orders and has occa sion to report on those mission orders then the commun ication line is actually via the triple hat c an exist lrh comm bureau liaison fficer finance banking officer you wi ll find out that l ife wi ll become much more bearable when he is just bu reau liaison of ficer and that is the proper hat fo r that or der to report it throughthat rder goes to the manage ment aide and you wo uld have to direct it it says management aide and thats the ne arest clo and then that wi ll wind up her on flag because they r eport thei r data bur eau s valuable final product of co llecting data for flag this does not pretend to lay out for you the v aluable final products of bureaus but the valuable final products of flag consist of things l ike workable projects that inc rease the vo lume and quality and viability of an org the final p roduct of bureau liaison office wou ld be project succe ssfully completed which increased the vo lume and the quality and the viabili ty of the or g so actu ally bur eau if you want to know what theyr really supposed to do bureau sits ther with the collected data sent to flag as their valuable product as from flags point of view and fr om their own poin t of view even though it goes th rough their own data bureau and even thoug h it is for and u sed by their people in or der to know what is go ing on wh ich certainly has to be done theyr just solving this in and its in terrible scramble or it was and now its been mor or less smoothed out and that dat comi ng th rough and nt to flag is valuable pr oduct now on the reverse way its comp leted pr ojects it s not actually written developed or anything else projects its completed projects and those you w ould find normally that have the pri ority of flag p rojects comp leted s bur eau f clo is not likely to be shower ing down on you with bunch of internally originated pr ojects which are in conflict with your febc projects but the way an ction bu reau operates is som ething else you should know an action bureau is the st report or the last t of bur eau the management aide wi ll write and sa how is pr oject w oof woof going and he wont hear and then he wont hear and then he doesnt hear and then he doesnt hear well report day k eeps mission away becau of course his action is to turn this unr eported series of stuff straight over to the action bureauthe action bu reaud be ope rating in highly underst andable fashion be operating basically on the thing of trying to find out what the bug is fi nd the why in the situation find out if there is situation find out the why f the situation and if they can remedy it on the ground or refer it and report it so that it can be remedied they have an observation functi on which is only fair to menti on so this is the way the lines ar being smoothed out and that is what you could count on from the bureau bu reau is so there they c an give you advice they can give you help in various way s we are very very help ful indeed but we hav been so helpf ul in bu reaus that the basic personnel of liaison fficers has just been stripped down to practically noth ing sending out work parties to ho ld peoples hand s or file up their cf or do things of that character and its actually litt bit out of character f or the bur eau to do this so we ar frowning on it we wont neces sarily stop this wit h s udden grinding halt but we wi ll certainly slow it febc12 the f ebc org board and i ts vfps 15 3271 febctapes 169 011004 down becaus an org is actu ally not mad competent by being continuously babied or helped and we ar tryin g to make competent or gs th at can st and on their ow n two feet now that is the xtent of the feb c pac kage this is what we ar trying to do with the package this is the cle ar intenti on of what we inten d with the package and wer not at this stage of the game tryin g to do anythin g else but to steer you clear of various rocks nd shoals that you might run int wit h maybe over enthusias m and so forth with regard to som ethin g and tryi ng to go in and gettin g in things to fast and d oing the other action of getting them in too slow now you wi ll set you r own pace to the degree that you can make it go your own competence is what will demonstrate that fter that it s up to you thank you than k you good ght x
