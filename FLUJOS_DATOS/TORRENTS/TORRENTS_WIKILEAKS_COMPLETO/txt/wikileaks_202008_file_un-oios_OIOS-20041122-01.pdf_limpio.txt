to supply but not to cable the fids another tender had to be launched for the fids cabling winner of this tender was vendor 2 background information the single source procurement purchase and supply of fids started on 17 october 2002 with written recommendation and justification by vendor 2 representative the purchase of additional fids became necessary because of the expansion of the passenger terminal building the already existing system had been provided by ve ndor 1 therefore the airport management decided to choose vendor 1 again the capital expenditure approval and contract were signed on 13 december 2002 the procurement file does not show why vendor 1 only livered the fids but did not cable it the need for cabling the fids resulted in another tende r that commenced in march 2004 according to the procurement file it appeared that vendor 2 w on the competitive shopping tender with an amount of 15919 euro investigative details although vendor 2 representative was never employed by the airport the procurement file for the fids supply contains two notes with regard to recommendation and justification for the fids purchase dated both on 17 october 2002 and signed by vendor 2 representative one note appears on white paper the other one on airport he aded notepaper 2 the interviews of vendor 2 representative were cond ucted on 31 august 2004 and 14 september 2004 vendor 2 representative stated that heshe wa s probably asked by peap official to write recommendation and justification note for the fid s purchase vendor 2 at that time worked at the airport for another project linked to the fids vendor 2 was subcontractor of vendor 3 working at the expansion of the terminal building nd observing the need for more fids vendor 2 representative also stated that heshe wit h hisher company provided the airport procurement office with technical specifications fo r the fids cabling on request by the peap official vendor 2 representative admitted that his her involvement in the preparation of the fids supply and cabling procurements and the later participation in the fids cabling tender by hisher company put other competitors at disadvan tage to prepare technical specifications for tender and to take part in the same was according t vendor 2 representative common practice before the war during hisher interview on 9 september 2004 the pe ap official gave contradictory statements with regard to hisher involvement in this case suc h as heshe probably had meeting with vendor 2 representative and the peap engineer to di scuss the fids supply and as one result vendor 2 representative wrote the appropriate recom mendation and justification note but elsewhere heshe denied to have ordered vendor 2 re presentative to do so the airport engineer was interviewed on 11 october 2004 as heshe is the responsible person to suggest new projects to the airport management the airport engineer stated that heshe was at time involved in the fids purchase and did not r equest the support by vendor 2 representative with regard to recommend and justify the fids supply the airport engineer only recommended the cabling of the fids in note to th airport management all following procedures are under the responsibility of the proc urement unit and the management the sales manager of vendor 1 was interviewed on th phone on 30 august 2004 asked why vendor 1 did not provide with the cabling of the fi ds heshe stated that vendor 1s management did not allow traveling to kosovo at that time for security reasons the sales manager of vendor 1 also mentioned that the airports contact person with regard to the fids cabling was for himher vendor 2 representative conclusions fact is that vendor 2 representative was involved in the procurement process for the fids supply and the fids cabling despite heshe was not an employee at the airport or kta procurement unit the excuse by vendor 2 representa tive that such an involvement was common practice before the war has nowadays definitely t its validity it has to be assumed that vendor 2 won the fids cab ling tender only due to the fact that the company was definitely in advantage with r egard to advanced knowledge of the technical requirements and had therefore sufficient time to prepare good bid in terms of the price although peap official as the responsible official at that time denied that heshe had requested vendor 2 representative support for the fids supply and cabling procurements vendor 2 representative granted the itf that heshe acted on peap officials request 3 nevertheless peap official bears the overall respo nsibility for hisher department peap and this investigation proved again that heshe did not fully meet the requirements as manager in sensitive area like the airport the entire matter has to be seen as an administrati ve irregularity it is obvious that international procurement rules had been breached but the procure ment regulation that was in force at that time financial agreement 19992 does not indicate cases like described before furthermore to prove possible case of corruption there are not enough indications recommendations it is recommended that unmik and in particular th kta undertake the following actions recommendation 1 peap official should be replaced by highly qualified manager whose skills meet international management standards recommendation 2 the airport staff responsible fo r procurement activity has to receive adequate training in the handling of procurement ma tters and to adhere to all applicable procurement regulations recommendation 3 the airport staff responsible fo r procurement activity has to ensure that all companies consultancy agencies etc providing supp ort in procurement preparation is being excluded to take part in the tender concerned and i n all other tenders linked to the initial one
