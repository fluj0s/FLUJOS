r212 nevers lecture given on 15 january 1963 okay this is lecture two saint hill special briefing course january 15 ad 13 the planet earth as much of it as bewill be with us for awhile i dont know ive told you everything i know havent got anything else to tell you i can punch up few points for you however there are bunch of nevers arising youre getting nevers in 212 and you avoid the nevers and youll make somebody nervous youve got never represent rock slamming item that is something you just never do and that means anything you have ever seen rock slam see it might not be rock slamming now but it might have rock slammed and that makes you nervous all lists have source all lists have source the source is something and that is an assumed arbitrary and that is the most dangerous point of 212 there is the point where you need little bit of luck you say in presentwhat does present time consist of something like that you see you get nice list its perfectly nullable it goes out to one rock slamming item seen during nulling everything is fine you oppose what you get that all travels beautifully nono strain you wind up with nice rock slamming item and then you oppose it because its still rock slammingthe rule is of course that if the thing is still rock slamming you oppose itand you get your perfect package all that is fine but where does this list come from in other words all lists have source now we find out that an arbitrary source is pretty dangerous it isnt somebody has interpreted this already the misinterpretations will fly around like mad but somebodys already interpreted this you take an arbitrary list and if you see more than one rs on it then youit isnt complete and you complete it that isnt what we did recently that just came down on telex today as an interpretation thats wrong if you just dont use arbitrary lists thats that see that just takes care of the whole question so you never use an arbitrary listjust never do it every now and then somebody sees an item waterbucks crash crash crash crash crash crash crash oh will you look at that beautiful beautiful item oh hoho oh thats marvelous this guys got sen on it hoho they just cant keep their paws off of it you see theyve got to oppose it right now the pcs probably rock slamming on auditor at that moment but thats beside the point so they oppose waterbucks and this goes on endlessly and interminably and horribly and the bank is collapsing on the pc and all is getting more and more ghastly and life looks worse and worse and the main danger is the auditor says well just look if hes very new he says well 212 doesnt work now im sure all of you each one of you some time or another since the advent of 212 has said to himself or to somebody else that it doesnt work see that includes see i too have said haha ive said well it cant be taught you know that was my adjudication you see ive also said boy it just cant work it doesnt work you see well what that is is youre running into bug factorsbug factors of one kind or anotherand either the answer hasnt come your way or you have missed something someplace or another because actually nothing eaves in pc quicker than 212 so weve got our next never never abandon 212 because nothing else is going to patch up what 212 has mucked up this is one of thosethis is one of those geewhizzers that only patches itself up the reason why we know it is an ultimatetype process is because it repairs itself and that of course by definition is an ultimatetype process the ultimate process will repair itself in other words run right it repairs what has been run wrong now the other never there isnever try to patch up 212 with something else because you wont ever make it ill give you an instance wrong list wrong way to pc arc broke the item picked out was not the final item on the list and then it was opposed wrong way to you know i mean its just good messup see and said well thatsthats fine now the best thing to do is just to prepcheck this whole thing out and just forget the whole thing i proceeded to do so got the needle clean as whistle pc smiling cheerful everything was fine and next day was four feet below bottom again so i patched it all up again got rid of all of the auditing straightened it all out beautifully and so forth and within few hours the pc was four feet below the bottom in other words it just kept going like this i finally went back and completed the list and the pc was fine you know i fixed up the original list that had had an item grabbed too soon on it got the right item for that list and opposed it properly and abandoned the list that was wrong way to everythings fine actually you inadvertently will make this test some day you inadvertently will do so youll sweat it out trying to patch up the pc at the end of the session the pc seems all arc broke and you just dont seem to be making the grade at all you see and youve found an itemyou found an item gutshot bear you see and the pcs always complaining about his guts and hes always saying he cant bear it so you say well it must be the item what youve missed is all items have an influence on the pc whether theyre reliable items or not you see it isnt that athe item you choose didnt have an influence on the pc anyway you took this thing and youre trying to do something with it and you gave it to the pc and then you tried to patch up the arc breaks you think theyre coming from someplace else and finally in desperation you say well that item gutshot bear that is not your item were going to complete the list and all of sudden the pcs right up there right up top face clears up goes white everything magic see just telling him its not his item when it wasntin other words telling him the truth of the situation accomplishes more in just that short breath than frankly twentyfive hours of prepchecking i think its quite remarkable see and thats the degree that 212 only patches up 212 its one of those selfresolving little miracle whizzers it solves itself and theres other processes that completely do yes they solve what they do but they dont also solve all cases thats the slight difference weve had processes and all scientology has solved itself but in actual fact they donthavent solved rapidly all cases now therefore for that reason alone its worth taking these risks its worth knowing it its worth studying it its worth getting good on it its worth an awful lot of things but you remember that there are few nevers ive given you the chief neveris never let somebody lose their records or keep inaccurate records or fail to note down what happened on the auditors report and on the lists and never never scamp the problem of records just dont do it because nobody will be able to patch up anything easily now there is method of straightening up case where the records are lost and that is of interest to you its an emeter job and you go back and you carefully trace down to the minute and you know timespot the time when the pcs case caved in and then go back and trace very carefully the session in which it occurred and then put your mid ruds in for that session that session on the 21st of december you see 1955 63 or something whatever it is has anything been suppressed well by putting the mid ruds in his memory returns and he can give you far more about it and then having patched thisit doesnt patch up the case see it justhe tells you more about it and youll recover the missing data and the missing list and ityou can deduce by some guesswork or another synthesize if you have to what the name of the list was and sometimes there wasnt listit just was number of items and there was list title and you have to synthesize what the list title would be in order to complete the list you get the trick but this is pretty grim thisbut patching up 212 without the records is so arduous that you can just lay down rule that never lose and never miskeep records such thing can happen you see as some utterly green auditor someplace ishe nulls the list and it had rock slams on it and he missed the thing he missed the rock slamming item itll be missed from there on out the pcll be all upset so on and heres another never never attribute violent arc break to anything but wrong item or notfound itemwhich means complete list the arc breaks are always attributablewhether theyre demonstrated by despair or violence or anything elsebut arc breaks are always attributable to 212 not the auditing dont ever make the mistake of thinking it was because the pc had missed withhold in the session that he finally blew up at you the item is right but the pc had missed withhold and therefore got an arc break haha dont make that mistake because when you dont complete the list oh you get away with it often enough to make you foolish you actually can get kind of foolish on this because you can make some of these mistakes you see and still get by and then when you really run one into the brick wall then you say well probably that cant be it but let tell you if pc arc breaks badly in doing 212 210 any of this routine 2 he arc breaks badly you attribute it to the routine 2 dont attribute it to the pcs current life and all that sort of thing never never attribute violent arc break violent decay of case which is the same thing i mean pc gets so apathetic wont talk to you something like that any manifestation of an arc break of violent nature never attribute it to anything but the routine 2 actually thats very sound rule it sounds very extreme when you first take look at it but its very sound rule you see an arc breaky pc come this applies to you not just as an auditor you understand this applies to you in the workaday world of scientologyyou see this character come out screaming out of the hgc slam the door you know and oh this is just terrible and so forth everybodys robbed him and all that sort of thing and its terrible and its terrible and well dont stand around flatfooted see just what the hell see who didnt complete the list who missed the item thats yourthats your immediate response see dont attribute it to something else dont get reasonable about it see youll find out youre true every time and pcs feeling bad and upset and so forth well they can have the most fantastic things well they got in an automobile accident and wrapped the car around cops neck and theyre going to have to go to by the way if anybody ever sends you to jail by all means go to alcatraz theyre tearing it down im just thinking of the federal government even their prisons are going to pieces have youdid you know that weve got to audit those people thats all there is to it you know because theyre in violent arc break somebodys missed an item on the us government i think personally they missed it with noauditing situation we havent had any plan for auditing the government we got one president audited that was truman we aint had anybody else audited now i just think theyre suffering from auditing courseso of course that leaves all items missed and thats another way of missing items but it isnt to violent state somebody must have missed list or something on the fda they must have they must have what crumb are you or something like that something what type of insect egg did you come out of you know when you see these violentthese violent manifestations or swift alterations of case or if you think its slow alteration of case go back and find where it was swift never consider that ancase altered slowly it didnt it didnt deteriorate slowly on 212 it deteriorated fast and youve got to go back and find the earliest item missed doesnt much matter how the item was missed it got missed thats for sure there are several ways of missing an item listing wrong way to oddly enough doesnt so much miss an item you list right way to and dont complete the list well youll get your biggest picnics when all of 212 is absolutely right and then the list got extended in other words they had two rock slamming items on the original list so they extended the list found one rock slamming item and said that was it because they didnt have another rock slamming item did they and nothing else was now rock slamming was it in other words that one rock slam seen on nulling is very valid used the first time but on further study here it is of very poor validity the second time its used thats sad but true in other words you had two rock slamming items on the list as you nulled it youre nulling the list get two rock slamming items oh of course obviously the list isnt complete obvious now going on nulling pardon by the way going on nulling is senseless by the time you reach the second rock slamming item youve got to continue that list and then go back and check those two items to find out if theres anything left on them they can dr or something like that but must be very slight indeed now you go on down and you get your final rock slamming item and you say triumphantly well one of these othersrock slams that went on are anything nothing elsei didnt see anything else rock slam so therefore that is the item and therefore there you are there is your item and we now have your item and weve checked it all out and it is gorgeous and the pc makes sense to him and he looks brighter and he looks lighter and everythingand everything is fine but were checking the thing outand lets say its the first list which is yoursort of your source list this was in opposition to it or somethingand the rock slam vanishes off the thing it goes down to dr suddenly this is rather typical you havent opposed it but it suddenly dropped down to dr the thing you got it from went out but it still had rock slam on it but then all of sudden as the pc cognited that disappeared youll find out right after that as long as it rock slams the pc is happy with it but the second it ceases to rock slam hes unhappy with it i mean the interest is accompanying the rock slam dont you see and the pc will all of sudden find out something youre doing wrong with your meter or something about you pc gets unhappy with the auditor the auditing session he never attributes it to the wrong item hell go on and hang onto the item but theres tone curve here theres shift well dont ever attribute it to anything but the routine 2 theres something wrong with the routine 2 you got to continue that list now once in blue moon youll get yourself in the serious situation of having list you cant continue in present time who or what are you upset about now you continue and the pcs upset well you can go on and continue it and you eventually dont find rock slamming item well dont make the foolish mistake of going on and list fiftyfive pages on it to find your next rock slamming item because it isnt there you already got pc thats overstrained on listing oppterms list something like who or whatd be upset about these problems that youve listed here on this list something of that sort but get it over on the other side of the picture here youll come back and find the item that was going to be there anyway pc couldnt confront it didnt put it on the list now theres your main danger as you train auditors one that they dont learn that mild arc breaks and upsets stem immediatelyand little ones stem immediately for just corny auditing you know qanda qand qanda qanda qanda qanda pc half an hour later is still trying to tell the auditor i thought you said express not suppress but i didnt say express i said suppress i know but im trying to tell you well but i didnt you know ii know awfully sorry if i did but i i really didnt you see i really huh haha oh now im talking about those things that dont pass away with the session you know these things that arethis guy is ii dont know whether im going to live or not you know huhhuhhuh life looks pretty hopeless to now you know you see somebody walking around thats been run on routine 2 man dont assign it to auditing skill lack of see just assign it to routine 2 and youll always be right you start to go into the end of the session the pc was happy with the item and it rock slammed and the pc had some cognitions and all of sudden the pc has an arc break because you didnt have the meter plugged in for the can squeeze say the item again it isnt rock slamming well you just grabbed one too quick off the list thats all isnt the pcs item check to find out lot of things now never run pc darker and darker and darker and more compressed and more and more caved in and so forth justwhen you notice that this is occurring come off of it there is cycle they dont get darker and lighter just come right off of it second you notice something like that when you now heres another never never give pc an item and do something else oh i see somebodys had that happen to them that is about the most distracting thing that can happen your chances of giving him wrong item are great even though you can really ride the bicycle down the middle of the road the reason why is you see youve got this fivepage list and it had two rock slamming items on it and you extended it to seven pages you got beautiful rock slamming item there it is it matched the same thing that it came from everything is fine and its just fine and we say to the pc all right we say okay now theres your item tiger pc is going to have some things happen that are right or hes going to have some things happen that are wrong and its up to you to make that test of observation and let give you the never you see never do something else never give pc an item and do something else even when you think its conditional and never make the pc think that youre giving him an item when you arent that also you willmay goof with someday pc understood that you were giving him his item and you were simply tiger drilling out little dr that you had found to make sure the pc has glommed onto this thing as his item he didnt understand because pcs are not in good state of comprehension when theyre in the midst of long list and all that sort of thing you know you can get into the most asinine windups and foulups that you ever wanted to get into make sure the pc knows what youre doing see give him his reality factor tell him lists rock slam tell him they dont rock slam dont tell him what rock slammed though see hell fixate on it dontbecause this is this other never see never give pc an item whether it is the item or other item that is going to be the pcs item or that the pc is going to think is his item and then do something else this is very serious thing for you to do ill give you an example well we found your item here now its tiger okay all right on this item tiger has anything been suppressed okay ohho that was clean anything on this item tiger anything been invalidated and so forth dont be surprised if chair hits you over the head honest this is just not safe thing to do im talking now about personal safety as far as the auditors its just not safe in the first place youve already put him in state of shock now youve given him on this item has anything been suppressed huhh duh huhh huhh its who are you you know even if it is his item or isnt his item if it is his item you can get away with it once in while and brother if it isnt his item youre liable to get his chair around your head you really are see you havent allowed that minute or so there of good observation what effect did this have on the pc your eyes must not be on the meter and you mustnt be doing something else when you give pc an item like that youve had this final rs nice thing it seems to be reliable item and so forth youve gone down the list youve checked two or three of them you say im just checking over some items here to see what they are put in the rfactor and everythings coming along all right little h factor and you know now you know pc doesnt know yet you make that bit of ceremony see and you pull that emeter up to you and then you look at the pc you dont look at another thing and you say all right apparently here your item is tiger you got that tiger and you watch that pc and you watch him like hawk because the wrong item in those first few seconds his face is going to darken his eyes are going to go back in his head his certainty level is going to alter he may be in comm lag for quite little while before he has certainty and then it very well might be the item but you got to know some things did sudden mass appear when you said it did he get sudden mass suddendoes anything else appear in his perimeter hell say well yes hes seen something but it always seems to have been there well take that with grain of salt that doesnt disprove the item but its an indicator that its wrong face gets dark after youve said ituhuh that aint it another thing pc may look sort of stunnedthey usually do because youve hit them with something that they havent been aware of for ages theactually the shock of getting one of these items delivered into your paws as statement by the auditor you can go over them on lists even then sometimes they get shock from it sometimes pc says aaaaa and you say whats the matter well i dont know you read cat whisker there and horrible shot went up my spine well that again savors of some of this other stuff im giving you dont let the auditor go on down the list to the next item and the next item and the next item let the pc tell you about this cat whisker because by god there may be cognition on it which has got it held up see just say well how about thiswell youyou got something to say about that item so forth its just this terrible spine you know it went up my back and went zzzupp and wuff and you say all right you okay now yeah oh yeah ifs all right go on down with your list you understand but you can do sudden shift of attention on pc and put him into hell of state of tension you hit this thing cat whisker see its followed byits followed by waterbuck tiger see all right cat whisker and the pc says ulpeep and you see the needle go off the dial frown at him for the needle having gone off the dial you knowand say tiger waterbuck you want to see pc go right on in cave see hes youve fixated his attention and then slapped him see by shifting his attention so the strongest item even though it doesnt produce bad effects on him the strongest item you can give him the one most calculated to stun him is an ri so you just dont dish this thing out you see like an old plate of soup you see you really serve him up this one on silver salver you know take yourdont take your eyes off the pc you hear now dont take your eyes off the pc dont go into lot of chatter sometime he will wonder he will ask you why are you sitting there so quietly just thought you might have something to say about it this gets him into thinking about it you know and he says oh well yes tiger hes looking doubtful you really cant tell whats going on yet or not you havent really been able to ascertain if he was getting darker or lighter youre still in little state of doubt yourself with regard to this thing you know hell go on huh wonder if thats why ive got fur on my ears you suppose so then recognize what youre looking at see now your next test does the rock slam continue as he talks about it or does it suddenly vanish ware shoal if it suddenly vanishes now get that meter so that while yourewhile he startafter he starts cognition you see thats the second period youve already got your period of inspection then youve got your cognition period if you want to get real technical following that youll see that thing rs as long as he has cognitions on it and actually if its real ri his cognitions on it are endless it just goes on rsing thats perfectly safe but you can get an item which is not the last item on the list theres one still on the list to get which rses for moment the pc cognites for moment everything seems to go along beautifully all tests are in and then you sit back all ready to shape it up or find out whether its term or an oppterm getting ready to list something to it and the pc says well thereve been quite few times ive suppressed things in this session oh yeah here we go hahahahaha that was not the last item on the list that was not the item you didnt have your paws on the item and that there is this funny condition where everything there is onethis can happenthat the inspection is all right he doesnt seem to get more mass he seems to be cogniting his skin tone is lighter dont you see all this seems to be fine and the rs was there and he gives you this cognition and you look down and get ready to drill the doggone thing you knowto find out whether or not its this way or that or commit overts you know and he just ran out of rs in other words it blew as lock on the right item and at that moment it will follow the whole chain of sequence of wrong item mass will show up he will get darker the rs vanishes down to dr its interesting so that period of inspection is very importantvery very important and never shift the pcs attention during period of inspection just never shift bis attention onto something else or doing anything else never do anything during this its quite important and that way youll save lot of heartbreak on the thing he wont get all tangled up and very arc broke then if its the wrong item and you say well did anyany mass show up there of course this is not shifting his attentionhes right on it you know oh well yes this bigbig round sphere showed up on the end of my nose yeah well all right seem like your item all right i guess so iiii guess possibly his face is getting darker just as you watch him see thing to do at that momentthing to do at that moment is just dont let it go any further say well all right now i myself would like to make just little bit further test on this if its all right with you i would like to list the list little further he brightens up you can add the fatal words thats not your item and hell brighten all the way up you understand but boy you have to be pretty good because if it is his item and you tell him its not you also got an arc break you getyou get how this little period goes this isthis period of the presentation of the item to the pc can be the difference between case that runs smoothly in spite of goofs and case that compounds the goofs into reala real upsidedown backwardsandforwards godelpus see the longer you let pc keep wrong item the longer you list wrong item the more collapsed the pc is going to get so in all patchups when you decide to patch something up patch it up accurately and patch it up now dont ever let your heels drag on patching case up do it straight away the longer you let that case go with everything wrong way to and so forthin other words youre not quite sure so youithis is the way it is this is another never is just never persist with wrong action because you dont know what to do to correct it just never persist with wrong action lot of your difficulty comes from the fact that you persist occasionally with list when you dont know what else to do well youve got to do something actually itd be far better off somebody was telling the other day he didnt have time to study the pcs case well i dont know iyou can take pcs folder and look it over it doesnt require any vast amount of time but in actual fact rather than persist with wrong action it is far far better for you to say well put your cans down on the table there i want to take look at your line plot and go over this with you right now and its far better if the case is running wrong to straighten out the case on session time im not recommending this but you would be far better off to straighten it out on session time than to persist with some kind of wrong action just to put in auditing time you understand youits goodits good sense to find out what youre doing before you do it and its very very necessary to come off an evident wrong action the moment you discover it is wrong now ill give you an example we say list the list both way to all right you say well how much is listhow much of list do you have to list so i say to you page all right that is actually one of these dumbox type responses see how do you ask pc if hes tired you know so you say well you sayask him are you tired you know now lets look at this thing sensibly you list it wrong way to when do you come off of wrong way to list in actual fact keep your eye on pc youll see him getting darker he starts to gethis skin tone and so forth starts to darken well his needle starts to tighten up its less loose than it was and so forth this is only four items deep on this list oh hell get out of there like scalded cat you say well thats fine thank you hes still listing you know thank you thank you thank you thank you and he manages to get the brakes on and he stops you say well thats all of that were going to list this list the other way apparently it is the other way and you start listing that and you say awor tell him the truth you know ill have to confirm it the other way if you havent listed that yetand well go on with this in other words dont persist with an action which is obviously worsening the case hoping for the best now theres an example here this does not mean somatics brother somatics have nothing to do with worsening case cases improve up through somatics something thats wrong with some of the cases you will audit from time to time is that they dont arent getting any somatics pain they dont get any sen well its happy win when all of sudden they start to get pain or sen dont you see somatics turn on so youre winning so just because case is getting somatics dont think its getting worse i only would add that if id had not on occasions been remarked to i had to stop the process because it was giving the pc so much pain and i think of this poor pc sitting out in north umbrella californiahaha who somebody stopped list on because they wereyou know hohoho it makes feel bad so somatics arent this these are these other signs mass is obviously closing in on him hes obviously getting darker his eyes are going way out of gear theres something going on here the pc is looking older and so forth youd better make damn sure what youre doing now on occasion pc has gotten quite sick at his stomach but actually this has only been from questionable source theres something bit wrong with the source or wrong way to theres been something wrong with that when they get very violently sick at their stomach and start throwing up or something like that or diarrhea or something theres something wrong with the source in other words someusually it was an item which was picked out of the middle of an arbitrary list you wouldnt expect that normally as reaction but if it did happen as reaction and i was absolutely sure of why i was doing it i sure would go on with it but dont ever persist with wrongness now that you know that thing is wrong knock it off now see just skip it pc is turning bright green dont keep on until hes brighter green dont consider that youre always flawless and that you never make mistakes youre going back patching up neglected items bypassed items youre looking at this line plot and youre patching them all up and youreyoure opposing all the bypassed items on this case getting it all up to present time everything is fine and the case is coming along all right and youre listing and the case starts to look slightly yellow and you list anotherthis if you didnt follow this rule would be what would happen seeyou list another ten fifteen twenty items the pc is now pretty yellow now you list another thirty forty items and the pcis justnow got much yellower and starts to turn black around the mouth oh you say well we really havent proved the point yet so we will list another seventy or eighty items on this thing pcs tongue starts to swell up and he cant get it out because he cant get his mouth closed over his tongue so forth you say well that doesnt prove very much everything this list ran it in and therefore will run it out it wont oddly enough itll only run out when you take the source and complete the list the source came from you know youve got to complete the source list thats whats wrong youre doing something wrong with an item you can also do this with wrong way to from right item there arent too many things here that go wrong youre working with finite number of things but they can add up to several combinations anyway you go back and you take look at this to find out where this doggone source came from and by god represent of rock slamming item has gotten by you somebody atwell some time or another had done 3d criss cross on this character and had left this item sitting there and it wasnt identified immediately to your view as having come from rock slamming item or maybe you did it yourself at some time or another and you hadnt noticed this interesting factwrong source so everything is going into the soup in grand fashion when you see something going wrong dont be nervous about it youre not going to kill anybody if you know your business it is only the amateur surgeon that leaves his tools inside and joins the ama or bma you know its only the amateur you know something is wrong with the fellows knee so they cut off his foot you know and then they find out theyve cut off the foot of the wrong leg so they cut off his arm because he irritates his knee by scratching it and lowtoned government of course gives him medals for doing it but the main point is here they get into some wild thing of really not knowing what the hell is wrong but trying to look good and trying to go on and not try to go back and understand what the hell theyre doing that makes it go wrong so therefore you want to develop very bright eye on the subject of the pcs appearance and you can get it down to where actually you can tell pcs difference of appearance the thennow you can tell it in any given ten minutes it starts to worsen in any given ten minutes lets find out whats going on its notnothing to be nervous about nothing to be nervous about but it just picks pc up it saves auditing time like mad see actually pc can take an awful lot before he kicks the bucket he can he can take terrific amount he can take an awful beating youd be amazed and recover from it if you remember the earlier never is dont try to heal it up with something else if he got bad on routine 2 then hell get better on routine 2 providing its patched up properly now you can start compounding felony by the case has had three case errors on it so you add fourth now thats wrong so you add fifth now you find thats wrong so you add sixth well the never here is to never let case errors accumulate or multiply dont let case errors accumulate or multiply its all right to have had two or three errors on case so what but the second that youre aware of the fact that there is an error on the case why put it together remembering that one of the errors on the case is to fail to complete cycle of action youre going down the list pocketapocketapocketa its right way to list its going beautifully its who or what does present time consist of pocketapocketapocketapocketa youre going right down the line everything is fine rock slamming youre going to get an item and halfway down that list you happen to gethalfway through the list you happen to discover that the pc ismy god this pc has been upset and rather arc broke ever since we found valhalla i hadnt noticed that before and valhalla has never been opposed and it probably came from an incomplete list ulp well the way you multiply the error is abandon the list that is now running all right and leave that as an incomplete cycle of action and go back and patch up this earlier action you see because thats liable to lead you to another earlier action and then you abandon the patchup of the first one you found and you go back to the second one the earlier one and patch that and youre just multiplying errors dont you see now it is tossup lets say theits the whole question is answered by is the case running all right and its tossup its tossup apparently the pc seems to be interested in the list were doing were all of sudden aware of the fact the pcs apathy is probably coming from something bit earlier and we look this up well in that case the pc isnt running all right is the pc see theres your point of judgment and theres rule that can go along with this is before starting new action make sure that all of your earlier actions are correct and complete and youll always avoid having to make that gruesome decision now that we know why represent lists look so funny sometimes and now that we know we must never take an arbitrary listand i mean never you know all lists stem from an arbitrary source they all do and you can be slightly unlucky well you take an arbitrary list just like the list one were using the scientology list one thats an arbitrary list and you assess that thing and its not complete list the reason we got away with it to the degree we did is because the pc had never listed it and therefore was not complete or incomplete but the pc very rapidly restimulates on that list and you get more than one rsing item on it or something like this and of course its obviously an incomplete list because it followswhether the pc listed it or notthe rules of complete list so therefore we have to find out what it came from and complete it but look what it came from is an arbitrary point see although were abandoning arbitrary lists or precanned lists and arent doing them see good training and so forth in desperation sometime youre just going to get tired of this pc and youre going to say well im just going to oppose auditor and see what happens and youre going to get away with it and thats all right auditings always been what you could get away with but remember the point you depart from to get his first list one listed by the pc is also an arbitrary point you had to select it now to reduce this clearing the auditing command is always good sense there are three universes for listing theres the present time physical universe right up in pt that the pc is cheek by jowl with in his life and livingness there is the second universe which is the universe of auditing and thats the auditor and the meter and that sort of thing and now the reason that has to be separated out as separate universe is you know some pcs will sit there rock slamming like mad and never realize they theres anything wrong between them and an auditing session and making gains at all youll run across this phenomenon often enough to make this an important division and then youve got your third universe of the parts of existence thats slightly less than whole track then in view of the fact that weve got positive and negative on all these things here are six potential lists the three basic universes positive and negative on each one six potential lists ive just given you another variation tonight list each one of them as terminal list or each one of them as an oppterminal list and of course you have brandnew series on the thing and you have total of twelve you get why the variations are because you can have an oppterminal negative and an oppterminal positive and terminal negative and terminal positive now you can also make an errorthere are two errors you can make here one is failure to clear the auditing command from which youre getting this arbitrary source point youre already using an arbitrary source point see and to fail to test it and clear itlet put it that wayto fail to test it and to clear it now what do you test it for well youre going to test it for rs because youre just never going to list arepresent rock slamming item never so the first thing youre going to do is test for rs i dont care what it is test it for rs now you can segment it and test the segments sooner or later somebodys going togoing to rock slam on who or what you read him the question and see asee vlt of rock slam and read him sections of it and youre all of sudden going to find some section of that thing rses well if its represent list you better omit that section man see thats never represent rock slamming item so therefore that continues over into never represent rock slamming question and beyond that point you rather takes your chance but heres way of narrowing the number of chances you take clear the auditing command with the pc and vary it around until it gets real to him in present time who or what are you associated with he cant make it but in present time what is he in contact with that makes good sense to him he seems to be able to list that you got this so as far as the list is concerned is never try to list list question that the pc cannot answer that sounds awfully elementary but its already happened in other words clear it with the pc and get it squared away so the pc knows what he is supposed to answer here get his agreement to answer this thing and you can have an arc break or an upset or wrong list and so forth just on that crazy little point you just make up your mind carelessly someday you just carelessly bangor youll see some auditors do it that youre supervisingcarelessly bing hell say all right whats present time consist of he just audited pc short time ago you see or you have and he had very good luck with this list so you know its and case is going noplace the guy cant list and hes obviously having trouble and so forth this is this is an auditing error not an r2 error more than anything else because clear the auditing command has always been part of auditing although we havent been doing it or stressing it very hard lately im stressing it hard here because it goes right over into routine 2 error and you get some little boy or something and he cant answer this its just too many words and too much this and that for him and he cant list it he doesnt understand it and you finally say whats here or whats life you know and he lists it like bomb what life are you living you know or something you know you clear it around until its something he can answer all right now you can get missed withhold effectthis is quite importantyou can get missed withhold effect by listing in the wrong universe of these three universes and as i told you in the earlier lecture you can get various dead horses skunks cycling lists and so forth by taking wrong way to you know youre listing terminals youre listing an oppterm list you should be listing terminals list you get the idea the who or what would have these problems is what you should be listing who or what would have these problems now you can get similar mess by choosing the wrong universe you should be listing the auditing session and youre listing the present time environment the life and livingness universe you see of the pc or youre trying to list the partsthe wheel of life type of thing you know the dynamics list and so on when you damn well ought to be running his life and livingness and hell actually arc breakthis is an important point to youhell arc break just as though youd missed an item thats worth knowing he wont arc break the same way just by reason of not clearing the command or something hell go on and try and he wont arc break but you should be listing the auditing session and you go and list the parts of the universe you know or the parts of the dynamics the guys acting just like you missed an item and you cant quite figure out what the hells wrong well the thing is is you missed the whole universe see the next item ready to come up was an auditing item and you didnt ask for it so that is danger it wont be regular and routine and you wont always be doing it so theres always little bit of luck and little bit of thought goes into choosing what type of list to list on this pc so its got to be the right universe and its got to be the right terminal or oppterm whatevers going to come up next dont feel too bad if you occasionally hit dead horse or something like that but the final never on this whole list of neversi dont pretend that this is complete list of neverswell they havent all been invented you know but these are some principal ones that are quite interestingis never in your anxiety to clear somebody or pacify somebody who demands auditing never fail to get out of the road his hidden standards and gross unseen present time problems before you try to clear him that is what routine 2 is designed for actually its designed only to get out of the road his ptps only to get out of the road his hidden standards clear the way open up the track and get the fellow so that you can find his goal and clear him well never omit that step because the only thing thats been chancy about clearing and the only thing thats been sour with clearing general on broad basis have been wrong goals and the source of wrong goals are the existence of present time problems and hidden standards on very few pcs goal at all could be found it was so serious goal at all could be found endless endless endless endless endless lists well those endless endless lists are not caused by charged up goal list youre listing on by present time problem and you are listing straight on by all goofed up hidden standard and that is squarely in the road of everything youre trying to do because it is goals go out hard cases messing up pcs sort of arc broke you cant quiteyour liability of getting wrong goal is very great now you get such good clean clean clean goal when youve done your 212 real well on pc that its very well worth knowing its just happened i just got despatch just before i came over here it was rather remarkable but theyd run this pc on 212 and theyd gotten something on the order of about six items three packages and they did goals list and the goal is right there see i mean you know practically number one or two on the list rocket read every time suppresses nothevery time you say the goal beautiful rocket read now as you know in your experience with 312 i mean with 321the number of times you find virgin goal when just found it reads and then it flicks and then it reads you know that kind of behavior you almost never can get one of the confounded things to read pow pow pow every time you know rocket read rocket read rocket read you know and then you dont have to worry about suppresses or fight with the pc at all you just keep reading it and it keeps reading well theyve just found goal like that and its the first one thats come up the line its got reported in here from california and i think it is quite quite interesting because its in actual fact the first central organization goal thats been reported after the fact of having run 212 on somebody interesting well most of the troubles you are havingyou go back and review lectures and notes and so forth from 1961 1960 the troubles which were recounted are centered around ptp and hidden standards and thats talked about and talked about there were innumerable methods used to get by these thingsnothing got by them now that we can get by them with routine 2 it is not simple process it is one which is requires precision but it also doesnt have endless bugs in it its got plenty of indicators and im grooving it down to where the indicators are better and better and more and more noticeable thats my job right now and to cut down the amount of work done before you hit the nail on the head so happens that this processroutine 212also does more for case than anything weve had before but understand the relationship here see that it does more for case thats just dandy were very happy with that that isnt what we expect of it but it just so happens it does more for case so its natural to run on almost anybody raw meat or anything else youre not telling them im going to run this to get your goal you tell them im going to run this when in actual fact youre trying to sweep enough items aside so as to pave the way toward the goal therefore it is up to you to run very smooth 212 and very rapid 212very smooth very rapid because the more you goof it the harder it will be to get pcs goal the more wrong items you find the more garbage youre leaving in pt see youre really strewing the track fortunately 212 takes it apart so the final never turns up and that is just never mistake the purpose of 212 thank you very much good night
