observers contend that dods winnertakeall approach to jsf production could have negative implications for the defense industrial base and us national security in official communications dod has consistently maintained that the winner takeall approach is the best vehicle for acquiring the jsf because it is the most cost effective strategy and that any defense industrial base concerns can be dealt with as they arise aerospace industry officials have also publically expressed their support for the winnertakeall strategy congressional support for the approach appears mixed and legislation has been enacted mandating detailed study of the potential industrial base implications it appears that substantial amount of analysis has focused on the cost implications of the winnertakeall strategy versus splitting the jsf contract between two or more producers however it also appears that to date much less analysis has focused on the potential defense industrial base consequences when considering the potential national security implications of single manufacturer of the jsf the following questions of potential interest to congress arise 1 will awarding production of the jsf to single manufacturer degrade the future us defense industrial bases ability to generate competition in the design of short range manned combat aircraft such as the jsf in the post jsf time frame 2 will there be demand for short range manned combat aircraft in the postjsf environment observers tend to agree that maintaining combat aircraft design capabilities is more critical and more difficult than maintaining production capabilities yet there is disagreement about whether design capabilities can be maintained in the absence of continued work also many argue that other platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles could supplant manned combat aircraft in the postjsf future other observers disagree and argue that it is likely that dod will require manned combat aircraft after jsf if only for niche missionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31360contents background 1 joint strike fighter jsf program 1 jsf acquisition controversy 2 dod perspective 3 industry perspective 4 congressional perspectives 5

jsf program is scheduled to begin production around 2005 with first aircraft deliveries projected to start in 2008 for years the jsfs cost goal was an average flyaway cost of 2838 million in fy1994 dollars depending on the service version in november 2000 the program director revised that goal to 3138 million each the total program acquisition cost of the jsf program has been estimated by cbo at about 219 billion in fy1997 dollars including some 22 billion for research and development rd and some 197 billion to procure these aircraft2 their actual costs will depend on future inflation rates technological factors and procurement schedules httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31360crs2 3appendix i gives the historical background on consolidation of and competition within the us defense industrial basethe department of defense has declared the jsf to be the last manned tactical fighter that it intends to procure during at least the next several decades the department awarded the development contract along with the expectation of follow on productio n to team of manufacturing companies headed by single prime contractor lockheed martin this winnertakeall award brings into sharp focus several significant issues with respect to the industrial base that designs develops manufactures and sustains high performance military aircraft during the 1990s the number of companies in the us aerospace industry capable of acting as prime contractors has fallen precipitously due to series of corporate mergers acquisitions divestitures and consolidations while there appears to be general consensus among analysts that sufficient aircraft production capabilities will continue to exist the consolidation has led some to question the industrys ability to continue competing for major aircraft contracts3 the debate appears to center on the extent that corporate competition encourages cost reduction and aircraft design innovation some observers take the position that at least two competing corporate teams are necessary to spur needed efficiency and inventiveness others claim that mechanisms other than competition can serve to curb cost rises and that design innovation is possible without competing teams of expensive highly specialized teams of design engineers jsf acquisition controversy one of the more controversial aspects of the jsf program has been the winner takeall approach that dod used to award the development and demonstration contract on october 26 2001 senior dod officials announced that team led by lockheed martin and composed of northrop grumman and bae systems had beaten team led by the boeing company winning the exclusive rights to enter the jsf programs system development and demonstration sdd phase and to build all 2912 jsf aircraft this decision was part of larger acquisition process where dod had steadily winnowed down the competitors in three stages from three companies to two to one in the first phase lockheed martin boeing and mcdonnell douglas competed for the jsfs concept demonstration phase contract mcdonnell douglas lost this competition and subsequently was acquired by boeing during concept demonstration lockheed martin and boeing built and flight tested prototype aircraft as they competed for the sdd contract some observers contend that dods winnertakeall approach to jsf production could have negative implications for the defense industrial base and us national security they make the following argument over the last 40 years the us demand for fighter aircraft has steadily declined and after the jsf program will likely continue to decline this reduction in business has helped fuel major consolidation in the aerospace industrial base leaving only few companies capable of designinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31360crs3 4dod currently plans to end production of the f22 raptor and the fa18ef super hornet in 2013 if this plan holds in 2013 the jsf will be the only combat aircraft in production 5edward pete aldridge undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics letter to the honorable carl levin chairman senate committee on armed services september 25 2001 6ibid 7 greg jaffe pentagon cost study led to plan for fighter plane wall street journal june continuedand manufacturing combat aircraft if the jsf production contract is awarded to single company it is likely that its competitors will not be able to sustain their combat aircraft design and manufacturing capabilities due to lack of business4 opponents of the winnertakeall approach argue that dod should award jsf production to at least two companies which should ensure at least two companies remain capable of manufacturing combat aircraft and thus benefit the defense industrial base by maintaining competition in future years dod perspective the department of defense has been the main proponent of the winnertakeall approach in september 2001 letter to the senate armed services committee undersecretary of defense edward pete aldridge reaffirmed dods commitment to the winnertakeall strategy he wrote that dod had reviewed the pros and cons of an alternative strategy that would keep both contractors involved in meaningful work and would also permit both contractors to compete for the production of future variants of the jsf configuration5 secretary aldridge wrote that dod had decided against the alternative strategy because 1the teams were formed commitments made and the competition conducted under winnertakeall approach it would be unfair to the winner to force him to restructure his team to accept the loser 2we would introduce significant delay 69 months in the current plan if we asked the competitors to revise their proposals to reflect this new arrangement 3the program cost would increase to accommodate the overhead of another team member who must retain duplicate level of expertise to be prepared for future competition this could be cost of 500 million to 1 billion impact on program costs 4there will be sufficient work on uavs ucavs new longrange strike aircraft and foreign military sales of fa18ef boeing and f22 lockheed martin to retain some tactical aircraft design team expertise after the jsf competition and the planned f22 and fa18ef production 5if there were decline in the currently planned force structure the potential cost savings for future jsf production competitions would be less than might be predicted now 6finally it is not clear that there will be competition of manned tactical aircraft after the jsf in the 20202025 period6 dod has conducted number of internal and external studies on the jsf winner takeall strategy two internal studies showed that splitting production between two contractors would increase initial costs between 900 million and 14 billion7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31360crs4 7continued 28 2000 8robert wall multiple jsf builders urged aviation week spac technology september 13 1999 p33 9kenneth h bacon assistant

2000in july 1999 defense science board task force on acquisition reform recommended that two companies build the same jsf design the companies would compete for each lot of aircraft production this would ensure price competition and innovation as each company attempts to win larger share of jsf production8 this strategy has been used by dod to produce other weapons such as amraam and tomahawk missiles however in june 22 2000 news conference undersecretary of defense jacques gansler downplayed the dsb recommendation saying that the dsb had not conducted quantitative detailed analysis gansler said that competitive production had been very successful on missiles very successful on jet engines but its never been done on airplanes9 dod asked the rand corporation to conduct an independent analysis of the jsf acquisition strategy this report assessing competitive strategies for the joint strike fighter opportunities and options was released in april 2001 and endorsed the winnertakeall approach rand analysts found it unlikely that dod would recoup costs through establishing second production line and suggested that the best way to keep costs down would be to give production to one team and compete future upgrades to the aircraft10 regarding the industrial base the rand report determined that one has persuasively argued that winnertakeall strategy in the jsf would inexorably lead to the loser exiting the fighter aircraft business or even that the loser would clearly lose an important degree of capability to continue as competitive supplier or combat aircraft systems in the future11 in dod it appears that this subsequ ent analysis has outweighed the dsb recommendation on split production industry perspective it appears that industry leaders have consistently voiced their support of the jsf winnertakeall strategy on cost saving grounds in march 2000 executives from boeing and lockheed martin reportedly urged pentagon advisory panel not to alter the winnertakeall strategy12 this position was reinforced month later when boeing company executives expressed their opposition to proposal that the jsf be manufactured by two different companies boeing vice president frank statkus was reported to have argued that two different production lines would not reduce costs if our configuration is selected there is value

approach to producing the jsf would preclude the need for two lines frank cappuccio lockheed martins jsf program manager claimed that lockheed martins team approach would create competitive production environment if the challenge is to sustain production competition through the life of the programwe can do that internal to the team he said14 industrys perspective on the industrial base implications of the winnertakeall strategy appears less consistent than its stand on cost savings on the one hand company executives have downplayed the impact of winnertakeall on the industrial base lockheed martin executive vice president tom burbage for example was quoted as saying that the us industrial base would not necessarily decline burbage said that there was other work that could sustain his company if they lost the jsf program theres perception that if you do winnertakeall that half of the us industrial base turns their lights out as resultthats not exactly what happenshe said15 on the other hand all companies involved in the jsf competition have stressed the great importance of that contract to their financial well being lockheed martin executives have pinned their future on the award of the jsf this contract is as vital for our fighter operations as it is for theirs boeings16 northrop grumman member of the lockheed martin jsf team has also weighed in on the industrial base issue company officials informed dod that they would require at least 20 percent of the jsf production business if they are to remain potential prime contractor for military aircraft while northrop grumman is not the lead contractor on any military aircraft programs presently in production it does build 40 percent of boeings fa 18ef is major subcontractor on boeings c17 and provides radars for lockheed martins f16 and f22 fighters17 congressional perspectives individual members of congress and congressional committees have expressed both support for the jsf winnertakeall strategy and

manufacturers to design engineer and build military aircraft and weapon systems21 part of the motivation behind this study is the belief that previous studies of the winnertakeall strategy have focused on the cost issues and not adequately considered industrial base concerns22 questions for congress when considering industrial base concerns such as the potential national security implications of single manufacturer of the jsf the following questions arise 1 will awarding production of the jsf to single manufacturer degrade the ability of the us industrial base to generate competition in the design of short range manned combat aircraft in the post jsf time frame 2 will there be demand for short range manned combat aircraft in the postjsf environment potential for future competition it is important to keep in mind that design production and later modification and sustainment of existing aircraft are three separate and distinct functions each of these functions demands different set of specialized skills from the company that provides them production modification and sustainment in the form of ongoing maintenance can continue for decades after design is created the lockheed f16 fighting falcon has been in production since the late 1970s and the last boeing b52 stratofortress entered service in 1962 overseas customers sometimes continue to purchase new aircraft after production for us military services have ceased taking delivery and competition between the aircraft producers of various nations for sales to particular air force is not uncommon23 most observers agree that production modification and sustainment skills are transferrable between military projects and in many cases even between military and civilian aircraft programs the most strident jsf debate among industrial base analysts centers on the nurturing of innovative concept design some maintain that the basic design skillshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31360crs8 24see drezner 1992 and

combat aircraft are specific to that type and are inapplicable elsewhere others however believe that the ability to design aircraft is more general in character and that the various aspects of design necessary to create platform such as the jsf maneuverability stealth habitability and safety of flight propulsion work with hightemperature metals and the like are present in separate ongoing projects and can be brought together when needed several studies have indicated that the aircraft design function requires constant exercise to maintain effectiveness24 as stated in recent rand report experience matters prime contractors tend to specialize and develop systemspecific expertise strong experience base in specific types of military aircraft rd or in specific technology areas appears to have been extremely important25 nevertheless it may be possible to keep engineering design teams together either in reality working on advanced technology design and prototyping programs not intended to produce operational combat aircraft or in virtual space through the imaginative use of cuttingedge telecommunications and computerdesign technologies as one report phrased it an aircraft design team matter how qualified and well supported will inevitably lose its overall ability to produce new aircraft designs that incorporate advanced technologies if it goes too long without actually designin g flying and testing new aircraft26 it may be prudent to consider whether national security might benefit from encouragement of continued aircraft design activity according to department of defense statements the award of the jsf development contract marks the end of the design of short range manned combat aircraft for at least the next several decades this has generated concern among industry observers over the retention of viable us design capability john douglass president of the aerospace industries association has stated that theres only so much more engineering work to be done once youve got the airplanes designed if you dont design airplanes you lose the capability to design them those engineers arent going to sit around the companys not going to pay them for 15 years to do nothing27 on the other hand the department of defense has pressed since the early 1990s for the integration to the extent possible of the us commercial and defense industrial bases the aim has been to spread the defense customer and the supplier base into the broader commercial economy tapping into innovation not traditionally oriented toward defense this could expand the pool of engineering talent available to design military aircraft while potentially increasing the number of active projects in his 1995 annual report to the congress secretary of defense william j perry outlined plan to break down the barriers between the commerc ial and defensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31360crs9 28see economic security new ways of doing business at defense in the annual report of the secretary of defense to the congress 1995 29see chapter 15 acquisition in the annu report of the secretary of defense to the congress 1999industries and to realize the benefits of civilmilitary integration in both research and development rd and manufacturing28 by 1999 he was reporting to congress on his efforts to eliminate defense requirements for separate military production lines of virtually identical products again with an intention of eliminating the distinction between the defense and commercial industrial bases29 to the extent that the production of civil and military aircraft can be combined it may be possible to employ engineering and technical teams in the manufacturing of both much of the debate of the implications to the defense industrial base of the winnertakeall contract award focuses on the two contending prime contractors lockheed martin and boeing however the contest was actually between two competing international teams of companies led by the primes every portion of the two basic prototypes the x32 and the x35 was designed and manufactured by one firm within group and several firms provided subsystems for both aircraft the essential decision then was the selection of the overall system integrator and aircraft final assembler this role of systems integrator and broad program director requires highly sophisticated management expertise and is increasingly the ability that defines the defense prime contractor and separates it from other defense firms this characteristic of the prime contractor to form subcontractors into competitive teams may have implications for the future of manned combat aircraft design competition if the loss of the jsf program meant that boeing could not compete for similar future contract it may be possible for another member of the lockheed martin team to do so an example could be northrop grumman which will provide aircraft structures radar and part of the electrooptical targeting system to the f35 the company has extensive system integration expertise has in the past created the f5 tiger the f14 tomcat and the b2 spirit and is currently one of the leading companies developing an unmanned combat aerial vehicle ucav another company with history in aviation and extensive system integration abilities is general dynamics after having sold its military aircraft division to lockheed martin in 1993 general dynamics acquired gulfstream aerospace corp maker of the gulfstream series of corporate jet aircraft in 1999 and has since successfully marketed the aircraft as special missions platform signals intelligenc reconnaissance atmospheric research astronaut training and medevac another approach to aircraft development that has focused on the retention and employmen t of skilled design teams is the use of advanced concept or advanced technology demonstrations these projects concentrate on the concept development design prototype construction and testing of cuttingedge or futuristic vehicle or system designs instead of being created to enter production these prototypes are intended to demonstrate features that may be incorporated into existing vehicles or to expand the boundaries of achieved performancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31360crs10 30for more information on ucavs see crs report rl31014 unmanned combat air vehicles issues and outlook by robert chapman ii in sum some analysts hold that the award of the jsf production contract to single manufacturer could adversely affect industrys ability to continue creating designs for short range manned combat aircraft if the arrangement causes the atrophy of expert design and production skills within the aerospace industry however others argue that any of several actions could mitigate this effect including but not limited to the effective consolidation of commercial and defense design and production work the creation of series of advanced technology prototype demonstration projects and potential reconsideration of the jsf as the last manned aircraft program of its type potential for future demand this question is important because if there is high demand for these kinds of aircraft in the 20202025 time frame then it may be prudent to take steps today to ensure robust manufacturing capability potentially safeguarding at least two jsf design teams and production lines in the future on the other hand if there is demand for such aircraft of if the future demand is very small then there may be negative long term effects on the industrial base resulting from limiting jsf production to single manufacturer in fact some argue that if manned combat aircraft are only small part of tomorrows air forces then reducing the number of defense aerospace companies today that design and manufacture manned combat aircraft could be beneficial in the long run by encouraging these companies to begin pursuing new designs technologies and markets arguments for limited future demand those who argue that there will be or little demand for manned tactical combat aircraft in the 20202025 time frame typically point to the growing application of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and unmanned combat aerial vehicles ucavs30 the perceived imbalance in force structure between short range and long range combat aircraft and the increasing need to be able to engage in combat in distant theaters that may lack robust infrastructure proponents argue that uavs and ucavs are already playing prominent role in warfare and that the technologica l doctrinal and political barriers to increased applications of uavs are rapidly disappearing the emergence of uavs can be seen in several areas first leaders in both the executive and legislative branches recognize the importance of uavs and have taken steps to encourage their accelerated development and fielding in its fy2001 defense authorization report s2549 106 292 section 217 p 141 senate authorizors strongly endorsed the pursuit of unmanned air and ground vehicles they authorized an increase of 200 million in unmanned systems rdte and challenged dod with this goal within 10 years onethird of us military operational deep strike aircraft will be unmanned and within 15 years onethird of all us military ground combat vehicles will also be unmanned in his december 11 2001 speech on military transformation president bush strongly voiced his

speech president bush mentioned only two weapon systems specifically by name the predator and global hawk uavs proponents argue that leadership at high levels is necessary component of military transformation and uavs and ucavs have such backing the recent successful operational employment of uavs is the second area which proponents cite as evidence of the likelihood of uav and ucav future growth before operation enduring freedom proponents point out that the predator uav already had successful operational track record in bosnia albania and over iraq in afghanistan however the predator systems made important leaps in military capability by successfully employing hellfire missiles and by passing real time fire control quality targeting data to ac130 gunships both capabilities are much needed advances proponents argue against some of the most challenging tasks facing the military such as destroying time critical targets proponents also argue that the global hawk uav is making an important contributio n to operation enduring freedom despite still being in its experimental phase in fact global hawks experience in afghanistan is very similar to that of the thenexperimental jstars program in operation desert storm the 1991 war with iraq following the jstars successful employment in iraq this program was accelerated and now plays prominent role in the us airborne reconnaissance force structure proponents suggest that global hawk will likely follow similar path another factor that proponents argue points to the inexorable growth of uavs is that uav programs are being accelerated in the current future year defense plan fydp the air force for example recently completed development roadmap for the global hawk which not only boosts production of the aircraft but also more aggressively pursues power and payload improvements that would make it more able to replace the u2 reconnaissance aircraft32 also the pentagons comptroller is urging the air force to purchase 15 additional predator uavs in its fy2003 budget request this proposed acceleration is on top of the presidents allocation of 21 million from the 40 billion counter terrorism supplemental toward the purchase of new predators33 others argue that the demand for new manned tactical combat aircraft in the 20202025 time frame will be very small compared to todays demand because dod must aggressively pursue long range combat aircraft or bombers in fact many argue that if dod is serious about transforming itself it must cut or cancel the jsf program and build long range bombers

requirement for bases near the battlefield this also reduces the strain put on airlift and aerial refueling assets advocates of greatly increasing the ratio of long range bombers to short range

strike36 the published qdr document discusses the need for long range precision strike 10 times in 79 pages in the spring of 2001 the air forces air combat command acc unveiled its new global strike task force concept refinement of global reconnaissance strike warfighting concept introduced the year before prominent in both concepts is strong role for long range bombers in future expeditionary operations37 gen richard hawley retired former commander of acc and principal author of the initial global reconnaissance strike paper emphasized the importance of long rang attack aircraft bomber centric approach can deny an enemy his antiaccess objectives attack his key strategic infrastructure slow or halt his forces and beat down his defenses while the other elements of the joint force are safely built up in theater38 those who advocate an increased emphasis on long range bombers say that recent conflicts show how important bombers are to air operations in operation allied force the 1999 war in kosovo heavy bombers accounted for less than 5 percent of the aircraft involved but released 53 percent of the bombs and missiles39 operation enduring freedom the current war against terrorism in afghanistan further illustrates the importance of bombers advocates say air force bombers accounted for about 20 percent of combat missions and dropped more than 76 percent of the bomb

f15es air force fighters sat out the first month of the afghanistan air war bomber advocates also say that recent technologi cal advances have greatly improved bombing accuracy and flexibility two areas where in the past tactical combat aircraft may have had superior capabilities long range bombers in operation enduring freedom are dropping the same gpsguided munitions as dropped by tactical combat aircraft and advances in information and communications technologies allow todays bombers to change target sets in midflight these improvements are opening up new applications for long range bombers such as conducting close air support missions and pursuing time critical targets such as mobile scud missiles the performance of long range bombers in afghanistan has prompted important decision makers to question the air forces proposed plan to retire 33 b1b bombers at the end of fy2002 sen john warner for example was reported to have said that this retirement needs to be reevaluated in light of events in afghanistan41 despite the real advantages that bombers confer on us military operations the current aircraft force structure is weighted heavily toward short range combat aircraft and away from long range bombers say bomber advocates today the ratio of short range combat aircraft to long range bombers is approximately 16 to one meaning less than six percent of the services 4000 aircraft are heavy bombers in contrast the ratio of fighters to bombers was two to one in 195042 bomber advocates say that this imbalance will grow as the ratio of dollars spent on fighters to bombers will go from less than five to one in 1999 to more than 30 to one in 200343 furthermore advocates say this imbalance in expenditures needs to be redressed because bombers are more cost effective than tactical combat aircraft gen richard hawley retired former head of the usaf air combat command for instance argues that bombers require fewer pilots and less investment than fighters to deliver the same number of munitions44 final argument for why the future demand for manned tactical combat aircraft will likely be very small rests at the intersection of the two previous arguments the growth of uavs and bombers specifically unmanned long range bombers may be feasible in the 2020 time frame boeing for example has recently marketed dod on an unmanned bomber concept based on its ucavn concept this stealthy long range ucav would carry 5075000lbs of ordnance internally45httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31360crs14 46 in 1916 uav prototype called the hewittsperry automatic

richter global hawk crashes in afghanistan in setback for high tech drones angeles times january 1 2002 p 3arguments for significant future demand others argue however that the postjsf demand for short range manned combat aircraft will likely be significant tactical combat aircraft advocates say that predicting the future is extremely difficult and that it is premature to plan for the end of manned tactical combat aircraft long range ballistic missiles which have been used in warfare since 1945 still have not replaced long range bombers satellites which were first launched in the late 1950s still have not replaced manned surveillance aircraft similarly uavs have been around since the early 1910s say opponents yet they have only recently become operationally effective46 it is not likely that they will replace manned aircraft in the near future instead much like satellites and ballistic missiles uavs will likely complement manned combat aircraft while it is true that todays uavs such as predator and global hawk are useful their reported effectiveness in afghanistan needs to be balanced with their documented problems to get clear picture of future developmental challenges for example recent report by dods director of operational test and evaluation criticized the predator saying that number of faults renders the predator not operationally effective in meeting the mission requirements delineated in its operational requirements document47 two global hawk uavs have crashed in development due to problems in remote piloting of the aircraft48 third global hawk crashed during operation enduring freedom the pentagon says that the crash was not due to enemy fire but the exact cause of the accident remains unclear49 in addition to these reliability problems opponents say that uavs are more vulnerable to enemy action than are manned aircraft while many are likely shot down because they operate in areas too dangerous for manned aircraft they are also less survivable opponents say because they are less responsive to threats pilot has better situational awareness than remotely located uav operator and heshe can take more immediate and decisive evasive action if required uav opponents pont out that approximately 20 predator uavs have been lost to accident and enemy action while the united states lost only two manned aircraft in kosovo and none thus far in afghanistan manned combat aircraft proponents also say that there are many combat missions that will remain beyond uavs capabilities airtoair combat for example requires level of situational awareness responsiveness and adaptability that requires human in the cockpit say tactical combat aircraft advocates httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31360crs15 50marc strass dod official questions services commitment to uavs defense daily december 14 2001even if uav technology continues to advance opponents say there are organizational and cultural factors that could impede their increased application some argue that the civilian leadership of dod is much more bullish on uavs than are the military services officials in the office of the secretary of defense for example have said that the air force and navy have emphasized investm ents in manned strike platforms to the detriment of uav programs50 culturally uav opponents argue very few people join the air force to sit in mission control center and stare at computer screen people join the air force because they want to fly airplanes and the types of airplanes they most want to fly are tactical combat airplanes moving to uavcentric force could seriously damage recruitment efforts say manned aircraft proponents advocates of tactical manned combat aircraft also say that while antiaccess challenges are real increased emphasis on longrange bombers is not necessarily the best solution one real challenge for long range bombers is sortie generation rate flying long distances to attack targets takes time wears out crews and generally makes it difficult or impossible aircraft to fly multiple daily sorties the b2 while touted for its ability to strike targets in afghanistan all the way from its base in missouri has not flown in operation enduring freedom since the first days of the war instead b1s and b52s have been forward deployed advocates say that tactical combat aircraft based intheater are better at keeping pressure on the enemy through numerous and continuous attacks if the theater lacks bases the us can bring bases to the theater afghanistan has called attention to the utility of carrierbased aviation also dod is exploring mobile off shore logistics bases molbs which could serve as super aircraft carriers for air force fighters carrierbased aircraft coupled with verticalshort take off and landing aircraft vstol which can effectively operate from short or austere runwaysand potentially air force fighters operating from molbs may be better approach than relying on long range bombers final point that advocates make in support of the fielding of manned tactical combat aircraft is that the overall military aviation piece of dods budget is likely to increase in the future they argue that recent conflicts iraq bosnia kosovo afghanistan illustrate that air power is playing key role in us military operations and is therefore worthy of larger part of the budget relative to other elements of the force structure even if uavs and long range bombers were to become more prominent in the us military force structure advocates say this doesnt necessarily have to come at the expense of tactical manned combat aircraft proponents argue that the funding for more bombers and uavs is more likely to come from other areas eg reductions in ground forces or from savings from base closure and realignment rather than from decrements in the manned tactical aviation budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31360crs16 51 for more comprehensive treatment see crs report rl30720 the us defense industrial base trends and current issues by daniel h elseappendix defense industrial base issues51 consolidation the us defense industry was born in the expansion of war industries that began in 1940 and carried the united states and its allies through world war ii much of this production capacity turned to the creation of commercial manufacturing in the late 1940s but the beginning of the cold war and the outbreak of war in korea caused the government to return defense production to war footing particularly in the electronics and aerospace sectors although appropriations for defense procurement have fluctuated in the decades since the close relationship between some major aerospace and electronics corporations and the department of defense forged during the korean war and the cold war remain

nature of modern warfare short conflicts characterized by high rates of munition expenditure and low rates of equipment loss versus the world war ii model of long conflict and the loss of large stocks of military equipment makes it unlikely in the view of most defense analysts that there will be need for large scale mass manufacturing industrial mobilization rather analysts expect critical defense
