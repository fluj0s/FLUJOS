are allowed to participate in negotiations on an adhoc basis by contrast the london club parallel informal group of private firms meets in london to renegotiate commercial bank debt unlike the paris club there is permanent london club membership at debtor nations request london club meeting of its creditors may be formed and the club is subsequently dissolved after restructuring is in place the paris club does not exist as formal institution it is rather set of rules and principles for debt relief that have been agreed on by its members to facilitate paris club operations the french treasury provides small secretariat and senior official of the french treasury is appointed chairman the current paris club chairman is jean pierre jouyet undersecretary of the french treasury in addition to representatives from the creditor and debtor nations officials from the international financial institutions ifis and the regional development banks are represented at paris club discussions the ifis crs2 present their assessment of the debtor countrys economic situation to the paris club to date the paris club has reached 405 agreements with 84 debtor countries since 1983 the total amount of debt covered in paris club agreements rescheduled or reduced is approximately 505 billion paris club operations since the first debt restructuring took place in 1956 the terms rules and principles of the paris club have evolved to their current shape this evolution occurred primarily through the g78 summits1 five principles and four rules currently govern paris club treatments any country that accepts the rules and principles may in principle become member of the paris club yet since the paris club permanent members are the major international creditor countries they determine its practices the five paris club principles stipulate the general terms of all paris club treatments they are 1 paris club decisions are made on casebycase basis 2 all decisions are reached by full consensus among creditor nations 3 debt renegotiations are applied only for countries that clearly need debt relief as evidenced by implementing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21482 an international monetary fund imf program and its requisite economic policy conditionality 4 solidarity is required in that all creditors will implement the terms agreed in the context of the renegotiations and 5 the paris club preserves the comparability of treatment between different creditors this means that creditor country cannot grant more favorable terms to debtor country treatment on more favorable terms than the consensus reached by paris club members2 while paris club principles are general in nature its rules specify the technical details of paris club treatments the rules detail 1 the types of debt covered paris club arrangements cover only medium and longterm public sector debt and credits issued prior to specified cutoffdate 2 the flow and stock treatment3 3 the payment terms resulting from paris club agreements and 4 provisions for debt swaps4 since the paris club is an informal institution the outcome of paris club meeting is not legal agreement between the debtor and the individual creditor countries creditor countries that participate in the negotiation sign socalled agreed minute the agreed minute recommends that creditor nations collectively sign bilateral agreements with the debtor nation giving effect to the multilateral paris club agreement by recommending that the united states renegotiate or reduce debts owed to it congressional involvement is necessary to implement any paris club agreement 1 the g8 summit brings together the leaders of canada france germany italy japan russia the united kingdom and the united states annually to discuss wide range of political social and economic issues 2 for more information on paris club principles and rules see httpwwwclubdeparisorg 3 the flow treatment provides method for the debtor country to progress through temporary balance of payments difficulties stock treatment specifies what portion of countrys stock of debt is covered by the paris club agreement 4 debt swap is transaction in which company or in the case of the paris club country exchanges debt for other assets such as foreign aid equity or local currency debt crs3 paris club terms there are four type of paris club treatments depending on the economic circumstances of the distressed country they are in increasing degree of concessionality classic terms the standard terms available to any country eligible for paris club relief houston terms for highlyindebted lower to middleincome countries naples terms for highlyindebted poor countries and cologne terms for countries eligible for the imf and world banks highly indebted poor countries initiative hipc classic and houston terms offer debt rescheduling while naples and cologne terms provide debt reduction classic terms classic terms are the standard terms for countries seeking paris club assistance they are the least concessional of all paris club terms debts are rescheduled at an appropriate market rate houston terms houston terms were created at the 1990 g7 meeting in houston texas so the paris club could better accommodate the needs of lower middleincome countries houston terms offer longer grace and repayment periods on development httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21482 assistance than do classic terms naples terms naples terms designed at the december 1994 g7 meeting in naples italy are the paris clubs terms for cancelling and rescheduling the debts of very poor countries countries may receive naples terms treatment if they are eligible to receive loans from the world banks concessional facility the international development agency ida country is eligible for ida loans if it has percapita gdp of less than 755 according to naples terms between 50 and 67 of eligible debt may be cancelled the paris club offers two methods for countries to implement the debt reduction countries can either completely cancel the eligible amount and reschedule the remaining debts at appropriate market rates with up to 23year repayment period and sixyear grace period or they can reschedule their total eligible debt at reduced interest rate and with longer repayment terms 33 years cologne terms cologne terms were created at the june 1999 g8 summit in cologne germany5 cologne terms were created for countries that are eligible for the world bank and imf 1996 highly indebted poor countries initiative hipc6 they allow for higher levels of debt cancellation than naples terms under cologne terms 90 of eligible debts can be cancelled 5 list of all paris club debt reductions under cologne terms can be found online at httpwwwclubdeparisorgencountriescountriesphptype_trtco 6 crs report rl33073 debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries by martin weiss and crs report rs22534 the multilateral debt relief initiative by martin weiss crs4 the evian approach on october 8 2003 paris club members announced new approach that would allow the paris club to provide debt cancellation to broader group of countries the new approach named the evian approach introduces new strategy for determining paris club debt relief levels that is more flexible and can provide debt cancellation to greater number of countries than was available under prior paris club rules prior to the evian approachs introduction debt cancellation was restricted to countries eligible for ida loans from the world bank under naples terms or hipc countries under cologne terms many observers believe that strong us support for iraq debt relief was an impetus for the creation of the new approach instead of using economic indicators to determine eligibility for debt relief all potential debt relief cases are now divided into two groups hipc and nonhipc countries hipc countries will continue to receive assistance under cologne terms which sanction up to 90 debt cancellation the united states and several other countries routinely provide 100 bilateral debt cancellation nonhipc countries are assessed on casebycase basis httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21482 nonhipc countries seeking debt relief first undergo an imf debt sustainability analysis this analysis determines whether the country suffers from liquidity problem debt sustainability problem or both if the imf determines that the country suffers from temporary liquidity problem its debts are rescheduled until later date if the country is also determined to suffer from debt sustainability problems where it lacks the long term resources to meet its debt obligations and the amount of debt adversely affects its future ability to pay the country is eligible for debt cancellation the role of congress congress has an active role in shaping united states debt relief policy title v of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 the federal credit reform act of 1990 pl 101508 2 usc 661 et seq set new guidelines for the cost accounting of credit and loan programs in the us budget following the passage of the act when new loan program is created congress must make specific appropriation to cover the cost of the program these rules also apply to changing the terms or reducing the amount of existing loans thus congress must appropriate in advance the anticipated cost of any us debt relief typically the appropriated amount is included in the annual foreign operations spending measure the method that the us government uses to value foreign loans is also based on the federal credit reform act of 1990 the act requires that us loans be valued at the net present value and not their face value determining the net present value is complex calculation involving several factors including the terms of loan whether it is concessional or at market rates and the financial solvency of the debtor and their likelihood of repayment in effect this means that the us government can forgive large amounts of foreign debt with very little budgetary implication for example on december 17 2004 the united states forgave 100 of the debt that iraq owed to the united states worth 41 billion with budgeted 360 million the determined net present value of the outstanding debt crs5 the united states began participating in paris club debt forgiveness in 1994 under authority granted by congress in 1993 foreign operations appropriations section 570 pl 10387 annually reenacted since 1993 this authority allows the administration to cancel various loans made by the united states these can include us agency for international development usaid loans military aid loans exportimport bank loans and guarantees and agricultural credits guaranteed by the commodity credit corporation issues for congress the second session of the 110th congress may address several issues related to paris club debt relief members of the private sector frequently raise concerns about the procedure for providing debt relief and perceived lack of input into debt relief negotiations especially considering that foreign investment is the largest source of external finance for low and middle income countries significantly higher than foreign assistance in addition many observers are concerned that in the wake of substantial paris club and multilateral poor country debt relief several emerging creditors are extending large loans to poor countries potentially prompting new round of debt crises among developing countries httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21482 the paris club and private sector activity the private sector financial community has frequently expressed concerns about paris club operations when the paris club was created in 1956 official capital flows government finance dominated total capital flows to developing countries this situation has since changed dramatically the bulk of developing country debt is now held by the private sector and private capital flows account for more than five times official borrowing worldwide7 one private sector concern is perceived lack of input in paris club negotiations while paris club only reschedules official sector debt the outcome of their negotiations greatly affects the private sectors ability to renegotiate debts owed to the them by sovereign creditor nations private sector officials are also concerned that official paris club debt is not written down to its appropriate market value as private debt often is during restructuring this could possibly distort the value of countrys debt and lead to an increase in the private sectors share of the debt relief burden since 2001 the paris club has held annual meetings with the private sector to discuss these concerns emerging creditors paris club member countries and the multilateral development institutions are increasingly providing foreign assistance in the form of grants rather than loans in 2002 the united states introduced new grantmaking foreign assistance program the millennium challenge account8 at the world bank 30 of assistance to the poorest countries is now provided as grants9 at the same time as traditional creditors are switching to grantbased assistance several new creditors have begun providing largescale loans to lowincome countries some argue that these emerging creditors are taking advantage of low debt levels in poor countries because of 7 tirole jean financial crisis liquidity and the international monetary system princeton university press 2002 8 crs report rl32427 millennium challenge account by curt tarnoff 9 crs report rl31136 world bank ida loans or ida grants by jonathan sanford crs6 recent paris club and multilateral poor country debt relief and are engaging in opportunistic lending10 among nonparis club lenders china is by far the largest international creditor with 5 billion in foreign claims as of yearend 200411 africa has been of special interest to chinese investors12 recent investments include 19 billion deal between the angolan government and consortium of chinese companies to upgrade its railroad infrastructure and an 83 billion investment to build an 1800 mile railroad in nigeria besides china other large emerging creditors are brazil india korea kuwait and saudi arabia while paris club creditors have established clear and transparent rules for their foreign assistance little is known about the terms of this new lending many western donors are concerned that new accumulated debt will create new cycle of poorcountry indebtedness and will erase any potential gains from recent debt relief efforts by paris club creditors and the international financial institutions according to the imf many emerging creditors loans have nontraditional financial structures including implicit or explicit collateralization foreign exchange clauses and variable fees13 if this debt is nonconcessional shortterm and at rates that poor countries cannot afford over the long term potential debt crisis may be looming this presents significant challenge to the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21482 international community and the members of the paris club the paris club will likely have to reach out to emerging creditors over the next several years and try to harmonize their lending with the existing norms according to one analyst either it will include new members such as china or it will close14 10 leo ben and seth searls and lukas kohler achieving debt sustainability in lowincome countries past practices outstanding risks and possible
