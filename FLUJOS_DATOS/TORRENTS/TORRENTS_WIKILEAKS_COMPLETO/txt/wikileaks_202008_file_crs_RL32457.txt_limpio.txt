of congress manufacturing and information technology trends in the united states and other industrial countries review of major studies summary the performance of the us manufacturing sector including the loss of manufacturing jobs has been long and widely discussed but the issue has intensified since the recession of 2001 less widely noted is that other industrial economies have also seen loss of employment in manufacturing with increased labor productivity employment in manufacturing has declined in most industrial countries as well as the more industrially advanced developing economies this point was discussed in crs report rl32179 manufacturing output productivity and employment two reports in 2004 by international bodies have analyzed the comparative performance of us manufacturing in ways that provide report card on relative us performance both reports rate the us economy as more effective than other industrial countries in using information and communications technologies ict to enhance competitiveness and growth the commission of the european union eu in its study fostering structural change an industrial policy for an enlarged europe found that while european industry overall has not suffered decline in output since 1979 it has failed to match the united states in two key respects first us manufacturing has had superior growth to the eu in labor productivity since 1995 secondly the eu report found that this is because of better productivity and output growth in ict products and in applying ict in delivery of services the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in 2004 produced study entitled the economic impact of ict which was the latest in series of comparative analyses it ranked the united states as the highest among industrial countries in its investment in ict used to measure diffusion of technology within the economy this propensity to invest in ict may have contributed to the higher rates of growth seen in the united states compared to other industrial countries the oecd research indicated that relatively lower levels of product and labor market regulation in the united states by comparison with other industrial countries are important governmental variables in encouraging private sector ict investment and its contribution to growth this crs report will not be updated contents introduction 1 european commission study of industrial trends 2 sectoral comparison of eu and us industry 4 eu policy conclusions 6 oecd analysis of the economic impact of information and communications technologies 7 us

of eu and us labor productivity trends 5 manufacturing and information technology trends in the united states and other industrial countries review of major studies introduction the decline in us manufacturing employment and perceptions of an erosion in the us industrial base have been concern for us policymakers after the onset of recession at the end of 2000 the united states lost nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs over three years notwithstanding an economic recovery that began in late 2001 only in early 2004 did manufacturing employment start to recover adding total of about 100000 new jobs on seasonally adjusted basis from february through may according to the department of labors bureau of labor statistics there is widespread concern that the decline in manufacturing employment is mostly permanent and not just cyclical decline detailed crs analysis found however that accelerated improvement in us labor productivity accounted for reduction across many industries in hourly labor input required to produce increased manufactured output that analysis also looked at other countries finding that the recent us experience is not unique manufacturing employment is declining almost everywhere as productivity improves1 recently the commission of the european union2 eu and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd published reports including analyses of comparative performance of the us and other economies especially with reference to the impact of information and communication technologies ict on manufacturing and overall growth the eu report included direct comparison of us and european industry the oecd report studied investment and diffusion of ict on comparative basis in industrial economies in europe north america and asia the two reports are similar in that they credit the united states in comparison with other industrial countries as having more success in utilizing information and communications technologies ict to enhance the transition of its economy including manufacturing in the face of rapid global change 1 crs report rl32179 manufacturing output productivity and employment implications for us policy p 39 2 throughout this report the european union is considered as the 15 countries that were members before its expansion to 25 countries on may 1 2004 except as noted the european commission acts as its executive body crs2 european commission study of industrial trends the question of european deindustrialization was the focus of the recently released report of the european commission hereafter the commission fostering industrial change an industrial policy for an enlarged europe3 the conclusion was that europe is not deindustrializing but there were also serious reservations about some current trends in european manufacturing especially by comparison with the united states the concern about deindustrialization in europe arises from the decline in manufacturings share of value added in the combined eu gross domestic product gdp4 this is shown in the eu report as falling from 274 in 1979 to 190 in 2001 on current value basis5 the eu report found that most industrial sectors have recorded job losses and that the decline in manufacturing employment is considered as key factor in concerns over deindustrialization6 as shown in table 1 employment has declined in almost all industrial sectors in europe out of 26 manufactured product groups as selected by the commission using the international labor organizations international standard industrial classification isic only one rubber and plastics had greater employment in 2001 than in 1979 however the commission differentiates between industrial change and absolute deindustrialization it states that the shift in employment from manufacturing to services reflects in part substantial improvements in labor productivity in manufacturing development that makes eu industry more competitive not less so in domestic and export markets among the 26 manufactured product groups listed by the commission only five showed declines in output in 19792001 these were textile mill products clothing shipbuilding leather and footwear and mineral and nuclear fuels as shown below in table 1 these five product groups are also among the less successful performers in the united states with respect to both output growth and employment 3

survey of manufactures 1979 and bureau of economic affairs office of productivity and technology unpublished data on employment sic basis 2000 notes industry descriptions altered from eu report for clarity based on isic and us sic code descriptions the present report has adjusted us data based on the standard industrial classification sic system longer in use in the united states to try to align categorizations with the eu report insofar as possible for 19792001 the following note specific categories where such adjustments were not readily possible includes recycling industries for eu only includes nonleather footwear for eu only us does not include nuclear fuel us employment data on sic basis available through 2000 only as found in the earlier crs report us manufacturings share of currentdollar gdp declined in similar way as it did in europe during the same period the crs report also highlighted the significance of improved labor productivity in the us manufacturing sector7 consequently as shown in table 1 most us industries increased absolute output levels between 1979 and 2001 even though many also displayed declining employment sectoral comparison of eu and us industry despite common useuropean trends and overall european growth in output the european commission in its report nevertheless viewed the data on relative competitiveness with some concern it noted significant slowdown in the rate of eu labor productivity after the mid1990s as shown in table 2 according to this analysis the trend in overall eu labor productivity improvement was stronger than in the united states in 19791995 the annual eu rate of improvement of labor productivity in manufacturing alone during this period was approximately the same as the us rate about 35 however in 19952001 the rate of annual us labor productivity improvement in manufacturing increased to 38 according to the eu report while the rate of improvement in europe was only 23 the commission noted that better performance by some eu national economies finland ireland sweden as well as in the united states is evidence that decline in productivity was not an inevitable result of other broad economic trends8 7 see crs report rl32179 figs 2 and 4 and pp 710 8 european commission fostering structural change p 6 crs5 table 2 comparison of eu and us labor productivity trends annual european union

secondly the european commission also commented that by comparison to the united states the eus performance was especially disappointing in hightech sectors review of table 1 shows that the eu beat the united states in 11 of 26 categories when one compares output growth data in manufacturing on sectorby sector basis over the 19792001 period however the point made by the commission is that while growth in europes labor productivity in sectors with strong technological content has been robust in comparison with the overall economy it has on the whole been significantly lower than in the united states in these sectors9 looking at table 1 one can see that this has led to higher rates of us output increases especially in computers and office machines electronic components including semiconductors scientific instruments category that includes medical equipment and measuring and controlling instruments such as those used in electronics manufacturing and insulated wire and cable which includes fiber optics10 the commission found that the gaps between us and eu productivity improvement rates were growing notably in those industries that manufacture ict equipment the gap in these trends was also growing in those services that are intensive ict services users11 this will be discussed in more detail when reviewing the oecd analysis below 9 ibid 10 generally the eu and oecd reports use the designations high technology and information and communications technologies ict interchangeably in the united states high technology may also be used interchangeably with advanced technology concept developed by the us commerce department this includes information technology products but also variety of other manufactures such as biotechnology pharmaceutical and aerospace products see for an analysis ernest h preeg the threatened us competitive lead in advanced technology products arlington va manufacturers alliance 2004 p 2 and table 1 for purposes of comparison the present report considers only ict products as designated by the eu and the oecd as high technology 11 european commission fostering structural change p 6 and table 7 with data taken from the more detailed study eu productivity and competitiveness an industry perspective as noted in crs report rl32179 pp 1819 esp fn 35 real constant currency comparisons over time in ict industries are extremely problematic and the us commerce department discourages reliance on such data to minimize distortions between us and eu output data the eu researchers adopted the us deflators for these products crs6 conversely the eu report finds that us output growth is slower than in the eu in some traditional industrial sectors according to barry bosworth of the brookings institution in reference to the performance of us industry everybodys talking about high rates of growth in productivity but its in two areas high technology and services the rest of the goodsproducing industries have not shared in this12 number of important us manufacturing sectors have not experienced high rates of productivity growth cement included in the isic category of nonmetallic minerals fabricated metal products furniture printing food manufacturing electrical equipment paper and primary basic metals with the exception of furniture which the commission and the isic combine statistically with miscellaneous manufacturing us overall output has grown slower or not appreciably faster than the eu performance in these product groups as shown in table 113 eu policy conclusions nevertheless continued ability to match labor productivity trends and output growth of us industries in certain sectors of traditional european strength such as chemicals and electrical machinery is of relatively little comfort to the european commission it believes that these product groups are more vulnerable to competition from developing economies both the more advanced competition from east asia and the newer competitors looming in china and india the commission believes that there will naturally be shifts of production as well as research and development activities to such countries as they become increasingly important to industrial producers global competitive position moreover competition from these countries will intensify not only in traditional industries where cost and market location considerations are paramount but also increasingly in high technology fields where ict technical proficiency is important14 while facing such challenges the commission believes that the eu is not well positioned compared to the united states or japan in specializing more in industries requiring higher levels of private sector research and development activities and industrial innovation the report cites data to show that the eu trails the united states in many dimensions on such factors15 the commission report proposes multidimensional approach to resolving the problems of lagging eu competitiveness measured in terms of labor productivity gains and output increases in hightech sectors with regard to the united states and other industrial regions it emphasizes the 2004 enlargement of the eu as unique answer to the competitiveness problem the commission views the new member states particularly the larger economies of eastern europe as vital sources of well educated and trained or highly trainable labor at competitive wage rates the commission believes that this productive potential can be readily integrated into 12 business week us factories falling behind may 24 2004 pp 9496 13 these are categories cited as examples in ibid and are based on latest us data which may not exactly correspond to either the categories listed in the commission report or earlier us sicbased data

production source across many industries in both european and export markets16 beyond eu expansion the commission reviewed range of other policy areas it argued for increased sensitivity to the need for regulatory environment favorable to industry in competition policy environmental policy and tax policy the commission in particular emphasized the need to encourage research and development rd more systematically17 specifically the eu has proposed creation of european research area designed to create an internal market for research and technology and counter the fragmentation currently affecting european research as well as an action plan to increase investment in research and meet the objective of increasing total rd spending in europe to 3 of gdp by 201018 the commission report summarizes this action plan similar plan on innovation policy and plan to be proposed for strategic agenda on the future of research in the manufacturing industry the commission complements the focus on rd with proposed policies to improve human capital and worker training and to create coordinated approach of community policies in the field of ict19 oecd analysis of the economic impact of information and communications technologies the oecd directorate for science technology and industry in recent years has produced series of reports and analyses on the new economy generally the impact of ict on overall economic growth and development in early 2004 it produced further report in this series the economic impact of ict measurement evidence and implications20 as in the eus analysis the oecd study makes specific comparisons between the performance of us european and in this case some other industrial economies the focus of the most recent oecd study is on the key question that the european commission policymakers have been grappling with namely what encourages greater diffusion of ict into the general economy the bulk of the 16 ibid pp 1417 17 for concise discussion of the

and national programs to support the semiconductor industry national research council washington 2003 pp137148 18 as of 2000 total eu rd spending was less than 2 of gdp oecd science technology and

structural change pp 1727 20 oecd the economic impact of ict measurement evidence and implications paris 2004 crs8 study examines number of firm and industry comparative studies in specific oecd countries the authors admit that many of their conclusions are tentative in part because the data series are not definitive ict diffusion the subject of the study is itself relatively new phenomenon and reliable data series do not have long history the present crs report focuses on the second chapter in the oecd study this develops crossnational conclusions and comparisons based on recently developed official statistics which the authors feel provide sound basis for international conclusions21 us leadership in information technology investment the oecd report finds that the united states leads the other economies in terms of how much of its capital investment has gone into ict22 ict investment is measured as share of gross fixed nonresidential capital formation in each of 18 countries in 2001 the us percentage was about 28 it was the only country whose percentage of such investment was greater than 2523 also when measured against the levels of 1980 and 1991 the us percentage of capital investment in ict had increased progressively and steadily among other countries the united kingdom sweden the netherlands canada and australia each placed more than 20 of capital investment in ict finland was above 17 germany japan and italy were above 15 ireland was just at 15 but growing rapidly and france was about 12 just above portugal at the bottom of the group considering also the absolute size of the us economy by comparison with the other countries this statistic alone indicates how large is the us lead in terms of its installed ict base and presumably the competitive advantage thereby derived information technology investment and regulation the oecd report sought to find indicators of what encouraged or discouraged firms investment in ict much of the report examines specific case studies and microeconomic indicators such as the size of firms that utilize ict and specific reasons why firms do not make ict investments such as concerns with data security and lack of trained personnel but of particular interest with regard to the policy perspective were the findings of the oecd study with respect to the business environment that governments create for the operation of companies the oecd report found that higher levels of investment in ict is generally linked to lower levels of detailed government regulatory control in an economy defined as product market regulation and employment protection legislation these two measures 21 ibid ch 2 the diffusion of ict in oecd economies by dirk pilat and andrew devlin 22 ict for the purpose of this project consists of the high tech manufacturing categories identified by the european commission in the comments above on table 1 plus consumer electronics and the following isic services categories wholesale of machinery equipment and supplies renting of office machinery and equipment telecommunications and computer and related activity including consulting maintenance and data processing services ibid p 21 23 the latest available data may be from an earlier year for some countries in the list crs9 were based on summary indicators developed in an earlier oecd working paper24 product market regulation was based on series of measures of government intervention in the economy these measures included relative size of the public enterprise sector its scope role of legislation in controlling public privatized and private enterprises administrative burdens on enterprises legal barriers including barriers to entry for new enterprises licensing requirements and price controls the oecd report used an index scale from 0 to 6 to measure levels of product market regulation among 18 member countries including the united states japan and most eu member states all countries scored within range of 10 to 30 the authors of the chapter related this index to the level of investment in ict as share of non residential gross fixed capital formation according to the authors product market regulation can limit competition since ict offers firms new capabilities eg in selling or purchasing online firms may be able to enter markets and introduce products and services that were not feasible before ict might thus enable the introduction of competition in markets that were previously characterized by low competition for example national or regional monopoly product market regulations may also reduce the incentives for firms to innovate and develop new ict applications the study found that countries that had high level of product market regulation in 1998 had lower shares of investment in ict than countries with low degrees of product market regulation the united kingdom the united states australia and ireland were the only countries among the 18 studied with score of 10 or less on the product market regulation scale and as noted above the first three also ranked above 20 in the ratio of ict investment to gross capital formation the three countries with the highest levels of product market regulation index scores 20 were italy greece and france which also ranked among the lowest countries in ict investment intensity at 15 or less germany and japan ranked about the middle on both dimensions25 the oecd report also measured the extent of ict investment against the strictness of employment protection legislation again the oecd constructed six point scale based on legislated restrictions on working hours notice and severance pay requirements for nofault dismissal of permanent fulltime workers and constraints on temporary employment26 the authors hypothesized that if firms cannot adjust their workforce or organization and make ict effective within the firm they may decide to limit investment or relocate activities 24 oecd economics dept working paper 226 summary indicators of product market regulation with an extension to employment protection legislation by g nicoletti s scarpetta and boyland ecowkp 99 18 april 2000 25 in statistical terms the correlation between the two indices was 054 ibid p 30 and fig 210 the oecd authors noted that the market regulation rankings were based on 1998 data and that some countries had passed new liberalizing legislation since then 26 oecd nicoletti et summary indicators pp 4043 crs10 the authors found fairly strong negative correlation between scores on this sixpoint index of employment protection legislation and the ratio of ict investment intensity the united states was by far the lowestscoring country on employment protection legislation and the highest on ict investment intensity the united kingdom was secondlowest in employment protection and secondhighest in ict investment following what some in europe call the anglosaxon model australia and canada both scored 10 or less on the employment protection index and were among the leaders in ict investment among the continental european countries denmark scored lowest on employment protection and thirdhighest on ict investment netherlands and sweden both scored high more than 20 on ict investment but both were over 20 on employment protection however japan and germany scored between 25 and 30 on employment protection compared to their midrange scores on ict investment france spain italy greece and portugal were all above 30 on the employment protection legislation index and were also among the lowest scores on ict investment the oecd reports authors also noted that two independent studies published in 2002 confirmed such links between levels of legislated employment protection ict investment and productivity performance27 conclusion as noted in the european commission study many factors influence manufacturing performance not all of which are covered here the eu authors state for example that they did not consider the impact of exchange rates or trade issues on industrial performance but within the limits of the eu and oecd reports the main features of comparison between us and european manufacturing performance are reasonably clear manufacturing in both europe and the united states experienced declines in its shares of the overall economy in terms of both employment and currentvalue gdp however manufacturing output has increased over this period so that it may be misleading to talk about deindustrialization the european commission is concerned however that the us manufacturing sector has clearly been outperforming europe since the mid1990s in information and communication technologies ict the fastestgrowing high tech sectors of modern economies oecd economists comparing performance across many industrial economies find that the united states has had by far the highest rate of growth in ict investment they also find that such investment in the united states appears to be positively influenced by the relatively low degree of product market regulation and legislated employment protection compared to other industrial countries 27 correlation between the indices was 065 ibid p 30 and fig 211 the employment protection index was based on legislation in place in 1998 crs11 both the eu and the united states are examples of mature industrial economies as is japan also included in the oecd study which are struggling with the effects of multiple transitions the ratio of jobs in manufacturing to those in services is declining high labor productivity in manufacturing means fewer wellcompensated manufacturing production jobs per unit of output and ready availability of trainable labor in developing countries in an increasingly globalized world economy has encouraged offshore outsourcing of industrial products and processes both the eu and the oecd studies appear to conclude that the us manufacturing economy has outcompeted its eu counterpart not in all product groups but certainly in promoting the manufacture of ict products and the application of ict throughout the economy with different purposes the eu and oecd studies appear to arrive at differing policy conclusions emphasizing the policy areas under its purview the european commission foresees that europe can address the problem of lagging labor productivity and investment in ict through full integration of new member countries in the internal eu market greater and more systematically coordinated support of rd within the eu and attention to other policy areas such as competition policy though focused on the microeconomic factors that appear to promote or hinder firms adoption of ict the oecd study comes to an unambiguous conclusion with respect to the business environment provided by government higher levels of product market regulation and legislated job protection effectively discourage wider use of ict in industrial economies among eighteen oecd member industrial nations the united states clearly had the highest percentage of investment in information and communication technologies as share of gross nonresidential fixed capital investment the united states also scored the lowest on an index of strictness of employment protection legislation and was in the lowestscoring group on strictness of product market regulation from this comparative review of the policy evidence contained in these international studies it would appear that increased governmental efforts to regulate product and labor markets in the business environment reduces the investment in information technology and possibly its contribution to overall growth for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32457
