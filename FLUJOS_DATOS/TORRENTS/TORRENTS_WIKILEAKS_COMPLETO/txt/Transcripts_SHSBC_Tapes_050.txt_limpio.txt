subject shsbc 50 basics of auditing lecture given on 29 august 1961 thank you this is the 29th of august 1961 and im often gagging about using notes in lectures but this particular lecture i have some notes for believe it or not thats because this is very very tricky subject and im going to talk to you about something that is going to make you more auditing gains in less time as an auditor and make us more clears than any other single subject we have opened up on in recent times now this is quite an important lecture this lecture should be basic on hpa and an absolute necessity at the level of hcsbscn and if dscn is missing these points we ought to revoke his thetan but this is quite important this material not to give it an overstress of some kind or another because i dont think it could be overstressed now you see earlier this summer i was confronted with the fact that with all the materials in hand as to how to clear people very few clears were being made interesting huh but every time we have borne down on the subject of auditing and accuracy of auditing all of sudden we have people finding their goals and terminals on you see finding goals and terminals on pcs and we have more clears being made this is very direct we have had this experience here we are all im sure agreed that it was matter of the rudiments were out and just as soon as i said well weve got some kind of games condition going here and the rudiments are out and youll find it in the first 150 its proven true i think maybe we got maybe something on the order of one or two goals out of fifteen cases that are still not found since that was released just few days ago right female voice yes two cases just two cases female voice who are hanging see interesting and in every case the goal was within the first 150 and yet they had assessed for weeks and weeks and weeks after that first 150 see theyd added it up to thousand and all gone up and on and on and more and more goals and longer and longer assessment and i said well go back to the first 150 i think thats where you found them isnt it interesting isnt it so that all the time after the first 150 certainly goals were taken then the rudiments were out during auditing obviously the rudiments were out the goal was buried and as soon as the rules were put right the goal came back in perked up and pangitypangitypang and everything was going along gorgeously as my friend paul said the other day we were all off at smart trot now heres point then heres point of some interest that by improving auditing technology and the skill of individual auditors we then come closer to very broad clearing it is not case difficulties that are restraining the pc now from getting clear all the evidence is in and thats what it adds up to all right therefore the stress must be on auditor technology the handling of technical aspects of scientology now the better that is the more clears youre going to make weve got the weapons with which to make clears there arent any bugs in it i havent written up your last prehav scale but you mostly have it right now theres missing items of any importance that would restrain this from happening so therefore we come back on auditor technology now i dont want you to accept anything i am saying as accusative casewise or anything like that im simply going to give you data here and this data is very well worth having this data was arrived at the hard way itd be withhold from you to tell you otherwise than that it was arrived at at hard way on hard line ive been getting some auditing sessions have been going out we sat down and analyzed and we have analyzed now all the points where sessions were going out and so forth i got good reality on that and suzie got good reality on it and we were straightening out these points because frankly we werent doing it particularly to find out more about auditing but its just stuff that came up and we analyzed accordingly and apparently what it boils down to is not auditing attitude or anything as nebulous as this it boils down to very concrete data which youll be happy to find out now as an auditor perhaps you say well theres so many rules of auditing and which one of these rules of auditing should i be following and how much memorizing of rules and all of this sort of thing should i do well basically first and foremost if you are worried about the rules of auditing there is something wrong with your auditing approach we can count on that then as stable datum that if somebody is worried about the rules about auditing and the zigs and the zags and so forth about auditing and terribly concerned with these things and so forth then theres something basically wrong because auditing fundamentally is simply this it goes back to the original thesis the auditor plus the pc is greater than the pcs bank and the auditor is there to direct the pcs attention and to keep the pc insession and to remain in control of the session and get auditing done now theres aside from saying what auditing is therapeutically supposed to be doing this and that and make clears and freeing up attention and the various theoretical and technical aspects of scientology when youve talked about auditing youvee said it when you have said that auditor plus the pc is greater than the pcs reactive bank the auditor is there to direct the attention of the pc and get the pc in there and get these objects confronted and straightened out and the unknowns off and the bank straightened out and the track straightened out and so forth and he winds up at the other end with clear that is what it amounts to with the technical knowledge of what you do with pc it all boils down to that you are there to get auditing done the less auditing you do which is effective auditing the more upset your pc is going to be now lets take the first object lesson here the auditor sits down in the auditing chair the pc sits down in the pcs chair what is the contract what is the understood contract as of that instant that understood contract is very simple contract the pc sat down to be audited what does the pc understand by being audited he basically understands it as getting on toward clear what he means toward clear were not sure lot of the time but even that he senses it is there he senses hes got direction to go he senses that he can arrive at certain destination and hes there to get that done now hes not there to have arc breaks run present time problems handled hes not there to straighten out the auditing room hes not there to have any of these things done at all that we call rudiments he is there to get audited toward clear well the first observation we can make that rudiments go out to the degree that auditing doesnt get done thats direct ratio rudiments go out to the degree that auditing does not get done now this poses you problem if you are using session to put rudiments in if you use up time at all to put rudiments in of course youre apparently around the bend as far as handling the pc because the rudiments are out you see heres puzzle that we face at once if youre not spending any time putting the rudiments in of course the rudiments are going to go out but the more time you spend putting the rudiments in the more rudiments youve got to put in have you got that so somewhere here theres an optimum amount of rudiments puttingin and its not very much its on the order of five minutes you know five minutes and the rudiments are in the pc will bear with that but not much more and when it goes to half an hour his present time problem is actually basically the fundamental problem of getting auditing now hell say the present time problem is something else is something else is something else is something else but his basic problem is he going to get any auditing and after hes had half to threequarters of the session thrown away on bunch of things that he didnt care about why of course now he has new present time problem called getting auditing in the next session he comes in with this new present time problem am i ever going to get audited because he doesnt consider any of these other things auditing now thats quite fascinating he doesnt consider them auditing so therefore of course hes out of session from pcs viewpoint auditing is direct press forward getting himself straightened out so he can get good goals assessment and finding his terminal if he knows anything about it at all this is what he demands and getting auditing straight along on the road to clear and knowing hes getting someplace and all of that sort of thing this is what he really settles for this is by experience they will even hang on for months as we know now getting assessed for goals even though the goals are all invalidated and everything else theyre still interested and theyll still go to session dont you see even though the thing is being run completely crosswise you see theyll still go to session and still be assessed you got that well they wont be run endlessly on general processes that dont approach them any closer to clear theyll only go for maybe seventyfive hundred hours and theyll leave the hgc and they take lot of persuading to get back and they wont want to be audited by you anymore you know in private practice and so forth what are all these things from from the basic present time problem of not getting auditing so actually your main chance is simply to audit the pc if it comes to question of whether to audit the pc or go through some arduous flipperoo on straightening out some kind of superrelationship or something audit the pc first see now youve got to find out what the pcs attention is on and what he considers auditing and he very often considers it chronic present time problem of some kind or another or longduration problem and he judges everything as to whether or not hes making process progress by whether or not this problem is getting stronger getting weaker the hidden standard sort of thing hes got all that sort of thing well hell be interested in that why is his attention is on it so thats auditing so auditing could be defined to the pc as anything which is handling the things his attention is fixed on thats what he considers auditing if his attention is superfixed on it and its being handled he considers that auditing and of course his attention is superfixed on goals so you can get away with assessing practically forever he will stay in there being assessed longer than he will stay in there being run on oddball bitandpiece general processes that dont lead toward clear isnt that fascinating thats an observation that i think youll find is quite valid now if it came to choice as to whether or not we went about it endlessly endlessly endlessly running rudiments to get them in or auditing the pc you would always choose what the pc considered auditing you would always choose what the pc considered auditing and let the rudiments go to hell and the next thing you know theyll disappear in importance remember what you validate becomes important you start handling too many present time problems and arc breaks too arduously and too long and believe you get more arc breaks why do you get more arc breaks you get them simply because auditing itself is present time problem because he isnt getting auditing in his viewpoint he is not getting auditing he is not sure he will get auditing therefore his contract is violated so he is in disagreement with what is happening in the session do you follow that now pc will sit there and endlessly run 1a why well his attention is stuck on it his attention is stuck on all these problem points you see he considers it auditing as long as you are auditing in the direction of his problems of course so he will settle for 1a its amazing how long he will run how many versions of 1a see this is amazing too if you were to flatten 1a then as we already have talked about and gotten problems and security checks totally out of the road you would find your pc would stay insession and think he was going someplace and of course he is going someplace and if you were to flatten 1a giving the rudiments lick and promise before you did goals assessment youd find out your rudiments were in when you were doing the goals assessment because you see the pc now can confront problems youve already brought him up to the point of being able to confront the rudiments before you started fooling with the rudiments you got the idea although you run rudiments every session although you try to find out what they are although you try to knock them out although you do run some havingness on the room and you keep the rudiments in nobody is saying just forget rudiments but dont consider rudiments anything like session dont ever make the mistake that the pc will think he is getting session when rudiments are being run youll find pc after pc when you ask him do you have present time problem will groan because he knows now that his session is going to be endlessly chewed up with the john and mary of life and he doesnt consider hes getting anyplace why doesnt he consider hes getting anyplace because he knows hes getting place with his wife and so forth well you say well thats problem but he doesnt consider this the general problem of his case by any means you have found problem he is worried about having to write blitz and company and you say well well have and you just start to make the motion toward handling this problem of having his attention on blitz and company and the letter hes got to write to them and you get oh my god youve heard him huh well why do you get this he doesnt consider blitz and company auditing he doesnt consider blitz and company as any difficulty but he does consider that not getting auditing will produce an enormous difficulty the value which pc assigns to auditing should be appreciated by you it is terribly highly valued very highly valued by the pc and this is great oddity because actually psychoanalysis was never highly valued hypnotism is not highly valued psychiatry they spit on they go back for their electric shocks like woundup dolls but you say well what do you think would happen to you if you didnt have any psychiatric treatment oh id probably be just the same as before whats the difference you say well would you walk across the street for psychiatric treatment hell well thats an oddity in itself see this is an oddity youre dealing with commodity which is very highly valued and which the society has been trying to put into the field of psychotherapy but psychotherapy is not highly valued so what youre doing basically is very highly valued by the pc so the more you dont give him of it the more difficulty youre going to have with him if theres ever crossroads of decision as to whether or not were going to endlessly get on with this even crude remark of this character well i see youve got present time problem yeah have you got little bit of an arc break all right well okay to hell with those were just going to run now and you give him the process and you go on and run it and youll be amazed how often the pc will say hey you know hes right in there pitching he might grump for minute you know and say well its not according to hoyle you know but youll just be amazed how many times that will win where the endless handling of rudiments wont win the endless handling of rudiments is limiting factor in auditing because it produces eventually the arc break of obtaining auditing so the decision is audit youll have less arc breaks the more auditing you do and of course if your auditing is flawless from standpoint of model session and if some of these other things im bringing up are also present smoothly in the session your days of having arc breaky pcs end as soon as you recognize that point that he is there to be audited and his basic contract is the basic contract of being audited and the more you audit him on the things his attention is fixedly on i mean fixedly on on the long track basis you see and the more attention you give to that and the more you handle that the more he knows hes being audited the less arc breaks youre going to get its amazing what pc will put up with to get auditing quite amazing what they will put up with to get auditing why make them put up with anything but at the same time go on and audit so the best hottest message i can give you on that exact subject is audit dont fool with it audit see what pc responds to best oh well all right youre here to be audited good enough fine now were going to go over the rudiments all right and you rip on down the rudiments line and you notice theres bad flick of some kind or another you say whats that he says well thats soandso you say good and you ask it again all right thats good good its still flicking is it still worrying you anything else about it worrying you well soandsos worrying you say all right good get the next one bang the next one bang you say all right now now lets get down to business now this is the process im going to run and here it is and he says well i dont much care for that process ill take this up in moment and you say i dont care you say i care for it do it you know that kind of an aspect and he says but soandso technically and it said in bulletin soandso you say well all right i read it too do it you find the guy doesnt go into apathy quite the contrary he goes spark spark spark spark spark and youll get good gains all right there are some more aspects in that but that whole first section of what i want to talk to you about is for gods sakes just audit the pc dont fool with it just audit you see just go right in there and saw it up and chew it up and push his attention around and get him through to the other end and well get 1a all straight and handle whatever you want to handle i dont care what you handle because this would hold possibly if 1a ever became ancient history this would still hold run the pc toward clear and have minimal chop behind your back you see minimal unkind thoughts minimal arc breaks minimal difficulties in sessions these all just tend to disappear because he might say well that auditor of mine is cross of bitch but jeez he sure audits you know this would be kind of the idea you got the idea he sure audits it might be terribly profane the opinion you see well you dont do right in session shes real bitch that auditor you know you know that kind of an aspect and that kind of conversation but id rather have her audit than anybody else i know you know that kind of song the hgc as soon as that became prevalent in an hgc and as soon as hgc auditors you just try and change the auditor on the pc they had this auditor last year or something like that and well they just dont want to be processed unless they can be processed by the same auditor because theyre very sure that auditor can audit but its not can audit although they always use can audit the secret is will audit and the auditor who kind of wont audit they dont want thats the secret of being wanted by as an auditor is how much you get down to business and how much business you get done all right now lets take up something little more esoteric here under the heading of escape as philosophy this is very complicated subject this is the orientation of an auditor has to do with his orientation this is the only point where an auditors orientation can seriously get in his road as long as he follows scientology and goes on auditing and using the principles of scientology this one can get in his road all those levels of the prehav scale that have to do with escape that is abandon leave anything like that if these are in any way shape or form hot or if theyre not thoroughly flat on an auditor youll get two aspects youll get the auditor letting the pc escape he wants the pc to escape because this is the auditors modus operandi of handling situations and this is as wrongheaded as you could get because the only way pc will ever get clear is by turning around and fighting down the devils that pursue him and if the auditors philosophy is the only thing the pc should be permitted to do is escape the auditor will never control the session and this is why an auditor doesnt control session when the auditor doesnt control session he thinks hes being good he thinks hes being nice to the pc now lets go about this on little wider basis and oddly enough under that same heading comes case reality necessary in an auditor and weve got the same heading its escape as philosophy case reality is necessary in an auditor exactly what is this that we are looking at when we find that scientologist has never seen or gone through an engram when we find that scientologist has never collided with ridge when scientologist is not aware of the thenness of incidents if the scientologist is not aware of those things he will continue to make mistakes and amount of training will overcome it knowing this just knowing this will overcome it because it all of sudden sees lots of light lights begin to flash in all directions if scientologist has never been through an engram if scientologist has never been stuck on the track if scientologist has never seen ridges or any of the other mental phenomena it is because his basic philosophy in life is escape now there is all the wisdom there is in it i will go ahead and tell you all about it but there is all the wisdom there is in it of course if hes never seen an engram what is he trying to do hes trying to escape from engrams so he escapes so hard from engrams that he sees little flick of picture and hes away man hes away hes off like rocket hes off like the russian never went see hes over the hills and past arcturus theres little twitch of somatic and pshew hes gone why his basic philosophy is that if you can run fast enough you never get bit so of course he doesnt have what we call case reality because of course hes running from his case his basic philosophy is the best way to handle case is get out of it so thats all he ever does with the pc takes the pc out of his case so therefore pc will never be insession with him oh lights begin to dawn huh it is pure kindness this auditor will find the pc getting interiorized little bit and hell know that this is the wrong thing to do so he will take the pcs attention out of session some of them do it very flagrantly and some of them do it very pleasantly it is nevertheless true one of the ways of doing it is change the process another way of doing it is q and pc says i dont want to be here the auditor says of course you dear fellow you do not want to be there lets be somewhere else at once pc shows the slightest inkling of digging into it in the bank and the auditor pulls him out the auditor is selling him freedom at what cost the cost of never getting clear but the auditor sells him freedom and its good thing its kindly meant this same auditor well might have penchant doesnt necessarily but might have penchant for going around opening all the canary bird cages in the world but then by george never follows up the fact that the canary birds are inevitably eaten by cats or killed by hawks promptly and at once dont you see the auditor is saying escape escape escape the auditor is actually saying dont confront it dont confront it dont confront it dont confront it dont confront it the processes hes running are saying confront it confront it confront it dont you see but the auditor with his auditing technology prevents the pc from confronting it and so therefore runs rudiments forever does other things doesnt quite let the pc go into session quote makes mistakes quote changes the process often quote ends the session irregularly does something odd and all of these oddities could be said to be backed up by this one philosophy the philosophy of escape the kind thing to do is to let him out the guy is settling down on the track in some fashion or another and hes going out of present time oh lets not let him do that because thats the wrong thing to do now this is compounded this is complex subject which is why i said this earlier in the lecture it was the auditor who has case reality of course dramatizes this point you cannot see engrams while youre running from them lets take model engram that this person is in and lets take some of the things that this person has happen to them the model engram he is in hes being whipped the jesuit fathers or something of the sort have decided to really lay it into him on the backtrack you see at some time or another and theyve got him tied to post and hes being whipped so he cannot leave that post so he fixes his attention on section of sky and says it isnt happening thats escape isnt it so what does he find when he gets into that engram he finds an invisibility called sky he doesnt find any whiplashes he doesnt find any post he doesnt find anything he finds section of sky that is the final mechanism escape now he escapes mentally he doesnt just run away he escapes mentally dont you see all right so that worked he didnt feel them after that so it was workable philosophy perfectly workable philosophy unconsciousness is also workable philosophy so hes being tortured on the rack ah he fools them all he goes unconscious he cant feel it anymore we dont have then an engram of the rack we have period of unconsciousness you see that hes actually in the incident but hes only unconscious all right now lets go little bit further here and lets take look at this little bit further and well find this person has odd somatics and odd difficulties that he cannot account for and if he never sees any engrams or sees them very rarely of course he cant account for these difficulties at all in book one it says theyre all contained in pictures and he doesnt see any pictures and yet here are the somatics and theres pictures of course theres pictures because his attention on any given point is the solution escape escape mentally escape mentally by forgetting it escape mentally by looking at nothing escape mentally by saying it isnt there you know the various mechanisms of notis yet the somatics have not been notised and this person every time he quote contacted an engram actually contacted nothingness and then was left with nagging somatic or sensation that he could not then account for and which seemed to be very mysterious to him and therefore didnt connect any of these sensations much with his bank dont you see and knows he feels uncomfortable but cant really connect it with any given engram got it all right lets take an actual case in point person does in running on the track contact an engram and there it is all 3d and so forth people standing on the bank throwing spear all right spear comes across the river goes through the pcs ribs and the pc has hell of somatic and that is the end of the picture this person now auditing says well why doesnt this pc handle incidents like that well nothing to it spear went through you and of course phsst momentary you know flat and gone and youre out of it and thats it i dont get this idea of being stuck on the track you see hooh nobody should be stuck on the track why doesnt this pc just flick his attention out you know well ill fix this pc up so he can flick his attention out ill pull this pcs attention out dont you see this is the best mechanism you ask this same person this is an actual case you say do you ever have somatic in that area you just indicated that the spear went through during that incident oh yes all the time well does it have anything to do with that spear person didnt say all the time person said yes very occasionally but does it have anything to do with the spear uh well uh or does it well do you have lot of odds and ends of somatics of this particular character oh yes i do are they connected with pictures actual conversation that took place but i thought all that went out with dianetics and in scientology you longer had to confront all of these things well here immediately of course you have the tag end of every engram that the person has contacted is just stuck stuck stuck and where are they all theyre all in pt so what is pt to this person pt is certainly just pt but actually its jam of engrams so therefore the pc should be in pt all the time because the auditor is the auditor is never out of pt so therefore the pc is never out of pt and this auditor will not actually guide the pcs attention through an engram because theres reality on it the best thing to do is to yank the attention out of the engram so the auditor will not control the pcs attention because escape is the better philosophy dont you see why this is so theres the reality now theres direct cure for this and if you wanted to get anybody who didnt have quote any reality on the past track reality on engrams reality on this and that as far as these things are concerned and was thinking people are being unreasonable who go into engrams and get stuck and whose attention are not in present time this person then is not operating on reality they cant quite tell what the pc is doing dont you see so theyre always worried about what the pc is doing because they themselves have never been in this identical situation they get little bit impatient with the pc dont you see so theyre not actually doing guided tour of bank theyre doing guided yank of bank and if you were to run this process on that unreal case its just one process oneshot process you would suddenly find that they would have an enormous shift of reality on what weve been talking about all these years and the process is what unknown might you be trying to escape from thats the process and at first glance that would become very brutal process of course because itll just start unstacking this and one of the first things this pc would see who had this brilliant reality on the people on the bank who threw the spear would be to find out the water was cold and the pc i happen to know has cold feet all the time of course theres that piece of that engram see so that piece of that engram would be contacted and you just keep contacting these pieces of the engram because of course youre running the reverse mechanism now not the philosophy of escape but the only philosophy that works in scientology is confront it it isnt that you have to erase it it is only that you have to become familiar with it all you have to establish is familiarity with the bank you dont have to establish an erasure of the whole bank it would take endless time to do that and all of sudden this auditor whos been having trouble guiding pcs attention will not have that trouble anymore they will recognize at once ooohhohohohohoho ive been trying to get the pc oh i see my my pardon my red face oh boy is this what its like down here you know now what happens is every time this auditor yanks the pcs attention the auditor is not aware of the fact that he has got the pc in one time stratum called engram time and is pulling the pcs attention to present time and locks the incident the pc was in in present time by an attention shift any kind of mechanism whether you call it faulty technology changing the process changing ones mind doing something of this sort whatever you want to define it or whatever rationale went with it this is actually occurring and of course it is painful to the pc to have this happen so the pc of course protests and this is basic difficulty with arc breaks you get basic difficulty at once because the pc was there and now hes here only hes not here and hes not there and where the hell is he it isnt that pc should be regressed on the track and totally impressed by this pasttime incident to total point of overwhelm but the pc is in another time stratum usually when hes being audited even on conceptual or permissive process pc appears to be sitting in present time and the pc is not in present time so of course the pc can neither be talked to nor handled as person would be handled in present time it is not social tea party auditing isnt the pc is not there really the pc is in another time stratum and if you practice the philosophy of escape on somebody who doesnt have to escape but is trying to do the bank the auditors goal is different than the pcs goal and the pc is saying well im confronting it and im getting familiar with it and here it all is and the auditor is saying come away come away come away its dangerous reactively this is what is happening so the auditor is saying come away and the pc is saying lets stay here and between the two you get arc breaks and arguments you would inevitably wouldnt you and as soon as the auditor takes guided tour of this thing called an engram bank you see with the spears whizzing from both banks of the river this particular person has probably neverr noticed that not only were there spears coming from one side of the river but that probably there were whole volleys of arrows coming too those somatics havent appeared yet you got the idea theres other things missing in all this and of course it all looks very mysterious but the person gets down there and theyre trying to escape from it that would be their first action spear goes through them they say escape boom lets go well its one of the basic thetan mechanisms its why he never asises much track its why he doesnt become familiar with his bank so look how prevalent this thing is very prevalent and thetan would be in bad way if when you killed his body he couldnt exteriorize see so its an absolute survival mechanism for thetan so you see its not bad thing to have escape philosophy or to be able to escape but let tell you when person is compulsively escaping he of course never escapes and when you get pc that youre getting to escape all the time of course he never escapes and his case just winds up in little black ball you got the idea so therefore we can say that escape as philosophy very much gets in the road of auditing when the auditor has this as total philosophy you see and we can say also then that case reality is very necessary in the auditor but of course what do we mean by case reality well case reality is willing to stay there and take look you see instead of running out on the incident when it comes up these two things then are under the same heading and they are the same subject person who doesnt have reality on the bank has consistently escaped from the bank and then that person of course does odd things in auditing and we say well that person is bad auditor that person is not so good or that person doesnt get results or something like that well we can say that much more succinctly and much more kindly now much more effectively we can simply say well this auditor has escape as philosophy and hasnt got much reality on the bank so therefore when he audits pc he doesnt know what the pcs doing and when the auditor doesnt know what the pcs doing and cant fathom what the pcs doing and the auditor thinks that the pc shouldnt be looking at all that stuff too of course we dont get any clearing because clearing depends on familiarity with the bank im not telling you you all stick on the track im merely saying that its necessary to have familiarity of what can happen you know there you are in the middle of the river and stuff is coming from all directions and youre confronting it and you got it and youve got sensation of fear or something or confusion already thats going with it and all of sudden the auditor says well thats the end of that process lets run something else god you dont know whether youre on the track or in present time or something like that youve been betrayed in other words but you could educate this auditor endlessly just endlessly without producing single change in that philosophy unless you hit the philosophy itself got it you cannot educate an auditor who has that as philosophy into giving what you would consider smooth session of keeping the pc insession and his attention on his bank do you follow that so thats exactly where that button sits and thats exactly what button you press and when an auditor makes consistent mistakes when an auditor yanks the pcs attention when the auditor is doing lot of qandaing theres more about qingandaing but when he does lot of this lot of shift we just assume that that the auditor has total philosophy and fixation of escape and therefore is letting the pc escape and he isnt being vicious he isnt trying to cut the pc to pieces he knows whats best for the pc get out of there man not even get rid of it just get out of there pc starts to look little bit indrawn go into session the auditor will pull him out every time you probably couldnt even list the number of mechanisms auditors use to effect this so theres just sense in putting up counterlaws to each one of these mechanisms thats used is there theres sense in doing that because we have the basic mechanism for it all right now lets go little bit further here heres another subject on this responsibility for the session in the original thesis way way back when you had the rules the laws the basic laws of auditor plus pc greater than the pcs bank pc less than pcs bank obvious pc must be less than pcs bank or the pc would never be troubled by the bank dont you see so thats why selfauditing doesnt work by the way the pc is less than his own bank also he never can get insession because bank wont go insession you can audit valences and that sort of thing oh dont mistake i mean theres you cant say that selfauditing does not produce result it does produce result but the result is quite minor and actually all selfauditing is is remedying havingness on auditing selfauditing always always always begins on scarcity of auditing pc would always rather be audited than selfaudited but they could get to point finally where auditing is so scarce you know people have been quote auditing them unquote without auditing them and auditing thereby gets scarce so pc starts auditing and can come up to point where the scarcity becomes so great that they begin to assume virtues like the fox who loses his tail you see the great virtues of having tail the great virtues of selfauditing simply the lack of havingness of auditing can result to the fact where selfauditing can become quite virtue and person can say occasionally once in while rarely youll have somebody say well i want to do it myself as far as selfauditing is concerned i really want to make the grade myself and you look back over the history of the case and youll find out they didnt feel that way year before they just didnt have auditing so you can actually have somebody sitting there and an auditor quote unquote there and the person getting auditing dont you see and this denial of auditing denial of auditing by being yanked off the track by endless rudiments by never getting anything on the road by never really getting in there and pitching you see one way or the other the person is being denied auditing and the person will be denied auditing to point where they selfaudit thats what selfauditing is you find pc selfauditing you can be sure that the pc has such scarcity of auditing that your auditing is having considerable difficulty arriving you dont have to do anything about it except just reestablish the pcs confidence in the fact that he is being audited and will be audited thats basically what you do is just audit and the pc will come out of this but it requires auditing but the pc less than the pcs bank otherwise the bank would never be giving him any trouble yes i know hes creating the bank on how many vias and that sort of thing but hes created frankenstein monster and its about to eat up frankenstein you see called the bank and frankensteins monster inevitably will eat up frankenstein hes created bank hes created all these various valences and that sort of thing hes denied full responsibility for having done these things and so on and the result is that hes having difficulties with bank this is not selfauditing now im just talking about pcs in general im talking about homo sap im talking about the farmer thats walking down the road and im talking about this guy and that guy and the other fellow you see and these chaps are all in this sort of state of less than the bank when we say man is aberrated we say hes less than the bank when we say somebody is psychotic of course this person is not just less than the bank this person is nonextant and is the bank you see hes done theres total overwhelm and thats all psychosis is total overwhelm by own bank now the gradients of cases is the degree to which person is overwhelmed by the bank now recognizing this that youre auditing somebody who is bit overwhelmed by his own bank and recognizing these laws in original thesis simple and elementary as they are they are nevertheless theyre very sweeping in their truth in auditing we get this kind of condition here the auditor has got to be cooperating and running the pcs bank you see and running the pc at the bank in order to get auditing done inevitably when the auditor withdraws from doing this he collapses the pcs bank on him you see when an auditor is auditing and suddenly stops auditing like you know shift of attention spills the water glass tips over the ashtray something of this sort he of course has to some degree withdrawn his control of the pcs bank and you get minor collapse but there is way to get major one and this has never been articulated before in scientology and its terribly important whenever you take direction from pc and follow it you collapse the pcs bank on him these poor guys i know two or three fellows who will only let some weary very weak auditor audit them you see and give the auditor all sorts of directions as to how to audit them and of course this is just selfaudit they dont make much progress they make some but they dont make very much progress theyre usually in misery theyve set up boobytrap situation here because of course the auditor is taking directions from the bank and following them thats part of it and the other part of it is is the auditor has subtracted himself from the basic equation of auditor plus pc is greater than the bank you see so when the auditor takes the pcs directions then it looks to the pc at once as though only the pc is confronting the bank and he loses the illusion of the auditors confronting the bank and of course the bank then collapses on the pc do you follow this carefully its one of these simple arithmetical propositions its one plus one is greater than one and half but one is not greater than one and half and what youve done is subtract one from the one plus one and of course you get immediately the one and half greater than the one youve only got one left you see you havent got pc sitting in the pcs chair youve got an auditor sitting in the pcs chair so the pc is now both the auditor and the pc only it doesnt add any ones so instantly and immediately you of course get the bank greater than pc and so therefore the pc is promptly and instantly overwhelmed pc says i think you really ought to ask about that present time problem another time oh yes pcs can do anything they like and they will say things like this you see in perfectly good situation they have sort of taken over because of anxiety for auditing and other things theyve taken over the idea of auditing and theyre afraid some auditing is not going to occur and so they sort of merge up and something in the bank is this and that and they sort of say well i think you ought to ask about that one more because i think there is one and the auditor does ask that one more and instantly pshew the bank collapses promptly and instantly on the pc got an arc break you never notice it because it takes an hour or so to swell up but the pc thereafter is running on auto all youve got to do is take one direction from pc and you collapse his bank on him you must understand exactly how that occurs you see heres the pc and the auditor and the pcs bank and the auditor plus the pc are greater than the bank now of course the moment that the pc becomes the auditor even to just any tiny degree you longer have the equation of auditor plus pc you have the equation of pc plus pcbeingauditor which of course still adds up only to one person the pc and of course this is not greater than the bank so you get collapse of the bank and i do mean collapse of the bank you can make the bank go pshew just hit him in the face blango now just look this over because its the first time weve ever examined this mechanism in spite of the fact the laws are some of the oldest laws we have i think the only two laws earlier than that is survival is the dynamic principle of existence and the purpose of the reactive mind purpose of the analytical mind those are the only laws that are earlier than these laws i mean in terms of time and development so lets take another example auditor says do you feel all right now or do you feel too tired to go on and the pc says i feel too tired to go on and the auditor says all right we wont go on at that exact instant youve collapsed the pcs bank on him i mean it isnt simple thing that the pc is suddenly dismayed or goes out of session or something like this an actual mechanical fact happens whether the pc perceives it or not the bank collapses on the pc of course because the bank is being held out basically and the pc is being held in position and the bank is being held in position only by the equation of auditor plus pc the presence of the auditor drops and the auditor ceases thats what we mean by ceases to take responsibility for the session now thats an esoteric statement it hasnt any mechanics with it that give you any explanation but that is the primary method by which the auditor does not take responsibility for the session and that is the exact mechanism by which an auditor gets into trouble the exact mechanism its down there to hairline all the auditor has got to say is is it all right with you if we run this an hour and half and the pc says i dont think so and the auditor says well all right then we wont well on the surface of it it is the socially acceptable kindest thing you can do the poor fellow feels tired so we just wont go on with it and at that moment we just picked up the stew pot and hit him in the face with it see we collapsed the bank on him the bank will collapse can be counted on collapsing instantly that this occurs hell get reaction from the bank bang that means actually probably that the model session should be rephrased on discovery of this magnitude but worry about it until you see it in an hcob because it may be and it may not be because basically the model session is written up just to get the illusion of courtesy i say well is it all right if we end this session now and the pc says its not all right im having great deal of trouble here and im struggling around and so forth i say well all right ive made mistake and were now going to end the session its always all right with the pc i decided to end the session if i decide anything else now merely because the pc told something else ive had it because the bank just will go splat now jf i dont want this pc to be butchered up i certainly better stick by my own ideas of what i should be doing matter how wrongheaded or inopportune or upsetting those ideas may appear to be so you just have to take fate in your own two fists on such situation you say is it all right if i end this session now its courtesy and the pc says well yes its all right except im pretty far back on the track all this is is comment to the effect that well you knucklehead you didnt ask where i was on the track before you sprung this other one dont you see well if you now say well all right we will run it ten minutes longer in order to get you up to present time youve had it at once youll never get him to present time why wont you ever get him to present time because you just collapsed the whole track on him thats why and then you probably didnt do anything to reassume the control of the session do you see what happens so you just never never never never do what the pc says you just never do what the pc says i dont care how logical it is i dont care how wrong you are if youve given him totally wrong upsidedown incorrect instruction you can do something more wrong than that you know english doesnt permit the deepening of the word wrong you cant be wronger apparently according to english but boy im telling you you can be wronger it doesnt matter how idiotic the auditing direction was how noncompliable the auditing direction was it just doesnt matter if the pc now gives you some advice concerning it and you take that advice you are promptly and at once wronger you have just lost the control of the session but that isnt whats important mechanically youve collapsed the pcs bank on him you just must never do it thats just something an auditor must never do he says all right if i end this session now and the pc says it isnt all right im stuck down the track and the auditor says all right ill run the process for ten minutes longer well this is the kindest most sensible decent thing you can do isnt it and it winds you up every time in the soup then you probably will spend the next five hours trying to end that session why because you are longer auditing the session the pc is you havent got an auditor plus pc greater than the pcs bank so the pc of course cant come up to present time so he just struggles see the mechanics are just dead against it thats the way the reactive mind is not the way i think it is so that is primary method of getting into trouble primary method is to violate that original equation auditor plus pc must both be there in order to be greater than pcs bank and when the pc says to the auditor advice advice and the auditor takes it of course then at once immediately instantly then the pc becomes quasily the auditor he is running his own bank on via hes longer greater than the bank it only takes split second to happen hes in the soup got the idea well it isnt that pcs mustnt give advice to auditors by all means as pc give the auditor all the advice in the world you understand give him all the advice in the world if he takes any part of it hes lousy auditor thats all because he at once passes over control of the session its something tantamount to walking out in front of the troops and handing your sword over see i mean its something of this order of magnitude promptly and at once youve lost the war and that is it theres going to be reparations charged and the united states will be sending threequarters of the national income over to rehabilitate the country but if the united states doesnt hear about it then nobody is going to rehabilitate anything now theres the whole situation in controlling session and theres the primary difficulty an auditor runs into once more it looks like pure kindness and it turns out to be total viciousness all right lets take up one more point here you can also put pc at responsibility for the session by bunch of pcs ought to and individual considerations about what ought to be going on this is little more esoteric but becomes less so when i say something like this this also comes under escape as philosophy well he ought to be able to get out of that very easily see the auditor says well he couldnt be in any great trouble he ought to be able to get out of that very easily well you see what did he do even if he did it silently to himself he says immediately well the pc is responsible for the condition hes in and you will find the one plus one greater than the bank also operates that promptly operates and the bank will cease to behave its quite esoteric its quite odd you say well pc shouldnt be in that much trouble man of that age shouldnt have all of those difficulties with women after all after youve lived for forty or fifty years you certainly should know something about women you know something like this you have some kind of little unkind thought of this character but its an ought to be you see and you have just shifted responsibility for the session over to the pc just as neatly as though youd suddenly crowned him with laurel wreaths you see how youd do that the pc ought to the pc shouldnt ought to now heres whole class of things you see the pc shouldnt be screaming at well that would be the best way in the world to bring the scream up four more decibels dont you see that would operate at once to put this pc at cause so of course immediately eliminates and deletes the auditor plus pc over bank it eliminates the auditor and of course collapses the bank on the pc you get how this would work you see the pc ought to shouldnt ought to well men are always like that that isnt so bad that type of consideration it just denotes an inability to do something about it so an apathetic acceptance of condition which one is confronting well this merely lowers control over the pcs bank slightly its not very great thing well that doesnt amount to great deal its when you really drop it out when you really say well the pc should be or the pc shouldnt be or something of this sort bang you see youve gone into the same old violation of this original rule pc is doing what the pc is doing and the pc ought to be doing what the pc is doing you see and the pc oughtnt to be doing the things the pc isnt doing and the pc does what the pc does you get the idea and considerations as to what the pc should be doing up on top of this of course interrupt responsibility for making the pc do something you get the idea now of course so long as your intentions are totally wrapped up in what the pc ought to be doing with inspecting pictures and so forth you of course are making this occur you are doing this you see so it isnt an ought to be or shouldnt be or something like this see the pc is going up and down the track and around the bank well he ought to be doing these things you see and you know that he should be doing these things and he knows that he should be doing these things he should be following the auditing command and you know that he should be following the auditing command and all that sort of thing im not talking about that class of thing im talking about another class entirely that instead of making the pc do or become what you want the pc to do or become you add this sneak one into it you see the pc ought to you know and you sort of said faintly to yourself well im not doing anything about it and he shouldnt really be upset about that arc break thats really nonsense he shouldnt be upset about it he shouldnt be oh well its well he shouldnt have that present time problem not now weve only got two hours here and god he shouldnt have this present time problem heavens on earth the pc has got what hes got dont you see you just look at what the pcs got and then you can go ahead and you and the pc can make him got something else dont you see with greatest of ease but if the pc ought to without any further action on your part of course what do you wind up with you wind up with collapsed bank is that clear to you that is not as serious or as general as the other now q and q and every time the pc says something you follow it is the most prevalent method of q and you say well hows your mother hows that about your mother now and well its not my mother now its my father well how about your father well its not my father so much its my fathers okay but its actually my aunt bessie oh well well all right now how does that apply to your aunt bessie and by the time youve done this of course you of course are doing two things youre letting the pc spot what you ought to be auditing youve dropped responsibility then and you of course permitted him to escape from the original questions and you havent followed it through youre permitting the pc to escape and the pc will go along whole sequence and series of escapes and if you follow along this sequence of escapes without ever once saying whoa now pc i asked you about pop i want to know about pop and im not interested in aunt bessie now pop you can say it as rough as you want to it wont affect the pc because he knows confoundedly well thats what he ought to be doing and he says oh oh oh oh i hahahaha fly cops are on my trail and i didnt get chance to duck up that alley well i guess i just better not do that and i better come back here and take look at pop okay well now what did you want to know about father you say well all right i just wanted to know how that was about father all right well its all right about father now what else about this yeah well how is it all right about father oh kill the of bitch as quick as look at him thats how all right it is about father and so forth see oh you say well all right now you got picture there or something well sure i got picture there what else do you think i have youve had picture there oh yes of course ive had picture there well all right now what dont you know about it well i dont know this and i dont know that and i dont know that and dont know that and dont know that and dont know that there there there and what else dont you know about it well i dont know soandso all right thats fine now you still got picture there of your father all right now how about your father well all right take him or leave him okay all right now well go on to something else got the idea the pc never wants to handle what you want him to handle you can just put it down he never wants to handle what you want him to handle i dont know pc yet that will handle exactly what you want him to handle when pc sits there smiling sweetly i get very very suspicious i say what are you looking at he said the same incident you told to look at yeah well what incident was that oh this incident about picking these flowers out here in the field and i say we had an incident there about burning down house what happened to that oh you caught oh well all right burning down house and so forth and somewhat grumpily theyll go back in and look at it but they dont like you when you let them escape because they know way down deep that its wrong they know way down deep thats wrong they know the road out is the way through and the road out is not bounce the guy has been running away for two hundred trillion years and hes looking for somebody to stand and hold the ground and say all right lets pick up these devils one by one and fight them down he will say that is the most horrifying shuddering thought that anybody has ever pushed in my direction but i know damn well hes speaking sooth now it actually hasnt worked for the last two hundred trillion years running away so he says well heres picture and you say good got any other pictures ah these guys are going to let run away all right yeah i got some other pictures good you got any other pictures in there oh yes ive got some other pictures in there oh yeah well hows your father all right fine and hows your mother okay fine oh yes and so forth and the fellow says well it wasnt my mother i was thinking about actually it was my aunt bessie oh well hows your aunt bessie and the pc right at that time says to himself way down deep someplace thats all were going to do now is escape and i know that it isnt the road out so he has arc breaks because he knows hes not getting auditing its very funny thing not overwhelming pc not pounding him down pc says i have to go to the bathroom you say you damn well sit there and dont go to the bathroom and so forth and the pc says well i have to go to the bathroom its present time problem and so forth and you say well im not going to let you go to the bathroom till 430 thats the end of session and thats the end of it and so forth well you keep this kind of thing up forever and eventually the pc gets an overwhelm hes pounded into position see all of this stuff is moderated with reason dont you see that isnt any kind of session direction pc says he has to go to the bathroom all right say go to the bathroom all right now go into session youll find hes slightly out when he comes back so put him into session again put him into session again with crunch but five minutes later he says i have to go to the bathroom you say ive heard that before were now going on with the session hell be back in processing again invalidation is the basic overwhelm the pc says oh it was my father doing all this and the auditor says it couldnt possibly have been your father you get the idea now theres where overwhelm comes from invalidation pc says i think its an automobile mechanic i think it is couldnt possibly be an automobile mechanic you know you could run whole case possibly by saying whos been invalidated see whats death death is invalidation invalidation of terminal whats sickness invalidation of terminal whats punishment invalidation of terminal i mean all things add up more or less to the invalidation of terminal dont they and as result why youve got button there that youve got to lay off of which is just invalidation pc says its made out of green soup you say all right solid green soup as far as hes concerned thats the way it is its just thats the way it is and this sort of matteroffact situation is in few minutes the pc says i made mistake it is not green soup the wrong thing to do is to tell him why i could have told you that earlier youre taking him on tour of bank youre getting him familiar with various things by various mechanisms hell wind up in the other end not afraid now what basically then would best answer up these conditions certainly not escape dont let him escape make him face it up youre always safe pc starts using rudiments for escape omit them always the better choice is to audit always the better choice if the pc gives you directions as to what you ought to be doing in the session give him the cheeriest acknowledgment he ever received and go right on doing what you were doing dont ever shift now is the time not to shift because youve run into some kind of valence or machine which tells you change change change change and you start going change change change with the pc its q and and of course youre going to get place at the other end now these are very important considerations in auditing and if an auditor were to do these things pay attention to them and handle those things he actually could be quite ignorant of some other facets of technology and hed still win hed be right in there pitching there is substitute whatsoever for having reality on the bank there is substitute for it at all because now you know whats happening to the pc you know where his attention is you know where hes going you know what hes doing and you dont make the mistake of believing hes in present time and this is all social chitchat that were indulging in weve known auditors who have thought auditing was that and they always of course wound up with pcs with gain and tremendous arc breaks and rudiments out all the time and that sort of thing because the pcs attention was never insession the basics of auditing however require that the pc feel able to talk to the auditor so you dont necessarily shut the pc off about things like this or directions like this you let the pc tell you but its great oddity that when the pc has told you that the process is wrong and that hes having difficulty answering it it would be great oddity if when you acknowledge this and you say all right im sorry but thats the process we cleared and here is the next auditing command and the pc will say oh hell then hell go on and audit it and youll wind up oddly enough without any much of an arc break but you say well now lets see lets just shift the process he says he cant answer this so lets change the wording of the process and of course dont be amazed that for the remainder of the session and maybe for the next couple of sessions you get absolutely change of case why theres auditor there why because the pc did the auditing so these various considerations are right there amongst the fundamentals and theyre things to pay great deal of attention to and if pc is moving through bank you should have some idea that people can get stuck on the track and youll get an idea of other timeness than here and that things can happen and that somatics and so forth are directly connected with pictures which they are and that sort of thing theres substitute for that sort of thing and in training auditors one of the things you should always ask an auditor is well do you have any reality on an engram do you know what an engram is you ever seen one you ever had somatic out of one not necessarily have you ever had sonic or something like this but have you ever seen one of these engrams and so forth well have you ever had moment there when you were on the track when you did not quite know what was happening oh yes yes yes i have yeah oohooh yeah ooh well sure yeah i was running this one about elephants and these elephants were walking all over goddamn it and i dont think it ever got flattened feel an elephants footprint on my chest right now ah this is safe auditor why hes not running big philosophy of escape escape escape is the road out dont you see if you asked this auditor you say well now have you had any reality on the track well ive read about it in dianetics modern science of mental health well have you ever run into an incident have you ever run into an engram i know they exist intellectually i have good intellectual reality on them ron wouldnt lie to about that matter how kind this auditor appears this auditor is not safe as an auditor why because this auditor practices escape that is the only reason why the auditor has never seen an engram you see so if theyve practiced the escape from the bank they have practiced the escape in auditing and they will yank pcs out of session okay these various considerations are very pertinent to training to auditing to understanding and i give them to you at time when theyre easily remediable there is difficulty with these things im not citing you any 120foot board fence that you have to climb over with your fingernails that process which i gave you is the most revealing process to somebody who has reality on the track that is most revealing they say ooh wow you know this is what ive been pulling people out of and it was good thing i did too okay well possibly many interpretations could be made of this particular lecture but just remember that it too just means exactly what it says which is do the auditing get the show on the road get the most auditing done in the least time that you can your pcs will be very happy with you and they wont arc break either and youll be amazed how seldom you have to put the rudiment in when you come into session you bang yourself down in chair you move the pcs chair slightly you tell him sit there hold the cans all right we are now going to start session start of session good now process we left unflat yesterday was soandso and soandso the first auditing command is bang pc will say pant hell say but wait minute im not even insession you havent run any rudiments you havent done any this or tha the first auditing command is bang answer it answer it answer it answer it the pc says well lets see what is it again you heard it answer it nohhhuh yep what unknown stomach what unknown stomach you say good what unknown stomach dont you know nothing about the pc answers the auditing question chops back at you maybe little bit here and there says boy this is rough man youre rough rough rough you know do you realize im stuck all over the track here i got everything all messed up i dont know whether im going or coming and you just keep pouring these auditing commands at you say good heres the next one pc at the end of twentyfive hours he may or may not tell you anything about it goes around and tells the d of p or another student or somebody like this my god that person certainly gets lot of auditing done weve certainly had lot of auditing done yes sir that person really will audit and the whole aspect of the thing changes now im not recommending that you let the rudiments be out im not recommending these various things im just giving you the frame of mind in which sessions run well and they do run well when they do that when the pc says i think i ought to be running something else you say you probably should be but right now were running soandso pc is all arc breaky about not running something else but my last auditor but my last auditor was running fiveway bracket on mother and it was never flattened and i just keep telling you this that it was never flattened you say well all right and at this point you might think to yourself well maybe i ought to ask what part of it isnt flattened what was the auditors name something of the sort and man you are handling twelveinch stick of inchthick dynamite with the fuse lighted this is booby trap dont fall for it you say well good good even cheer him up say well i hope it gets flattened someday i think youll find that this is the winning card and if you look this over and you follow some part of this and you get an understanding of this why i think you will get some fantastic auditing gains and your days of loses will simply be in the longdistant past okay thank you audience thank you
