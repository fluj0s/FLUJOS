bank limited appointed pricewaterhousecoopers limited to conduct some investigations under terms of reference contained in the contract dated 12 july 2006 under the terms of reference we were to carry out the following tasks i review transactions that charterhouse bank limited cb limited or the bank has recorded in clients accounts with special focus on insider and grouprelated client accounts ii determine if there are any indications of irregularities such as illegal transactions or criminal offences fraud or dishonesty committed in the course of conducting business iii establish if further work would need to be carried out to provide evidence of any irregularities committed or provide any other relevant recommendations iv determine the status of cb limiteds compliance with and prudence in following know your customer kyc best banking procedures through review of the appropriateness of the institutions kyc policy and its application on all targeted accounts v determine if there has been any material breach of the banking act the central bank of kenya act or the regulations guidelines or other matters prescribed by the central bank during the period covered by the review the scope of the investigation was limited to reviewing information available within the bank the investigation did not involve interviewing customers or other third parties or reviewing the records of or information held by customers and third parties consequently the ability of the review to reveal criminal or illegal transactions committed by customers is limited while the review revealed irregular transactions it is difficult to ascertain whether criminal or illegal activities have occurred by reviewing bank records alone from our reviews we have reported transactions that are irregular and give our recommendations on the way forward including recommendations for further investigations and followup of issues with previous management our work included sampling more than 1004 accounts in accordance with our terms of reference and reviewing in detail transactions in those accounts which appeared unusual with special focus on insider and group related client accounts as explained below we faced considerable handicap in obtaining information necessary for our review therefore all unusual transactions may not be reasonably expected to be identified from our work 2 information flow and availability we were faced with some formidable challenges in obtaining information which impeded the progress of our review as result we were not able to access some of the information that we would have wished to obtain to make the exercise more effective some example of this are i we got the impression of general unwillingness among the banks staff to provide us with information and only got minimal cooperation from them ii the banks general manager proceeded on leave without notice at the beginning of the assignment rendering information flow difficult iii we were not able to obtain certain documents for transactions prior to june 2004 as the relevant supporting documents were said to have been destroyed in fire at the companys archives in september 2004 iv the banks core system equinox was down for most of the time and was never fully functional as it experienced considerable downtime efforts to get equinox vendors neptune software limited to resolve these handicaps did not bear much fruit in the first two weeks of the assignment afterwards the system was intermittently down and some of the functionalities could not be utilised v by the time of writing this report we had not obtained documentation in support of telegraphic transfers tts for periods prior to 1 january 2005 we also did not obtain supporting documents for the last quarter of 2005 there were significant transfers made during this period and especially between 25 and 26 october 2005 the statutory manager attempted to obtain the documents for these 2 days which we understand were available but management refused to yield we also understand that subsequent to our departure from the bank the banking fraud team was called in to help extract the documents for these days vi we also requested but did not obtain from the banks management supporting vouchers for the nostro accounts for periods prior to january 2006 the manager in charge of the department informed us he was new and could only provide information for 2006 transactions we were only able to get some of this information on the last day of the field work consequently we could not investigate these accounts fully vii our use of computerassisted audit tools to interrogate data was also frustrated as neither the bank nor their system vendors could provide the investigating team with the requisite data dictionaries to enable us interpret the data this means that whilst we could review the debit and credit entries in each account we could not easily identify the other side of the entries for example if we identified credit entry in the sundry creditors account it was not possible to identify the corresponding debit without laboriously reviewing the individual entries in the various accounts in which we suspected the debit entry would be 3 key findings the key findings of our work are as follows i the bank is not following accepted kyc procedures although the bank has clearly documented kyc procedures these are largely ignored and there is documented evidence of the bank attempting to obtain an understanding of the identity of some of the banks active customers or their businesses there are strong indications of irregular activity in some of these accounts ii the bank is in breach of the banking act and prudential guidelines with respect to single borrower limits and insider lending and reporting maintenance of documents for foreign currency transactions iii there is evidence of the bank carrying out banking operations without complying with laid down internal control procedures or only intermittent application of key laiddown policies and procedures examples of irregular operations include the following customer mandates were in some cases either ignored or overstepped we noted instructions to transfer funds from individuals who did not have appropriate authority alteration of cheque details opening and closing accounts for purposes of passing certain specific transactions we also noted instances where cheques honoured for payment by the bank were not signed by the customer failure to maintain appropriate records of transactions there are numerous anomalies identified which raise doubts about the credibility of the information and records maintained by the bank we consider the general control environment in the bank as weak and we have seen evidence of rampant override of controls by management we recommend further investigation into the operations of the bank and more specifically in respect of some transactions highlighted in this report to rule out the possibility of money laundering abetting of tax evasion by customers or other irregularities we have detailed numerous unusual transactions in section 5 of the report which point to possible irregularity some involving accounts of companies related to the directors of cb number of accounts need to be investigated further including all accounts of the kingsway motor group and related companies the kariuki muigua co advocates accounts accounts related to dilpun shah and all accounts identified in the web of transactions involving paolo sattanino as discussed in section 52 of the report for such further investigation to be effective it should extend to speaking to the customers and reviewing their records some of the key findings are summarised below and discussed in greater detail in the main report know your client kyc procedures banking best practice requires banks to gain an understanding of the customers identity and their source of funds among other things cb has developed some kyc procedures that require prospective customers to supply certain information and to complete account opening forms which are then approved before an account can be opened we however noted that these procedures are largely ignored some of the discrepancies are as follows i numerous account opening forms are missing or are incomplete ii number of accounts do not have customers contact detailsaddresses this could be an indication that such customers do not get statements of account which acts as check against irregular activity in customer accounts iii there are accounts both personal and corporate that do not have the customers photo image either on the system or on the physical account opening forms the banks kyc procedures require photo and signature images for both personal and corporate accounts iv some accounts do not have proper account names for example numerous accounts are only described using initials such as cil pivb s shah and d shah some of these accounts do not have account opening forms and have been used to process unusual transactions v the credit histories for most of the advance files we reviewed are not up to date vi cbk prudential guideline cbkpg08 requires banks to report suspicious transactions to cbk some of the transactions observed are suspicious and one would expect bank to report such transactions to the central bank there are indications that the bank officials may be involved in abetting these suspicious transactions vii in the absence of customer details especially where there are documents at all signed by customers it is difficult to confirm that the customers actually exist in all cases or whether accounts have been created to facilitate specific transactions out of the 1004 accounts sampled for kyc reviews we did not obtain 839 account opening forms or customer instructions being 83 of our sample and representing 217 relationships we were informed by management that these forms instructions do not exist we have analysed the results of the 165 forms that we were able to review in appendix ii of the account opening forms obtained we have summarised in the table below the key findings analysed into the following three categories based on the nature of the customer incorporated businesses unincorporated entities partnerships personal accounts the table below summarises these exceptions

opening documents not completed by 11 11 the holders not verified employmentsource of income 36 36 eg payslip compliance with banking laws and regulations banking regulations such as the banking act central bank of kenya act central bank of kenya prudential guidelines govern the operations of banks these include limits on variety of areas and also reporting requirements on certain aspects of the banks operations there are four main areas noted where the bank was not in compliance with the requirements of these regulations ie i lending limits to single borrowers and their associates ii limits on lending to related parties ii unsecured lending to officers of the bank and their associates and iv foreign currency transactions the key points are listed below i the prudential guideline cbkpg07 section 323 and section 11 of the banking act prohibit lending in excess of 20 of the institutions core capital to any one insider and their associates we noted instances where lending to directors of the bank and companies associated with them are beyond these limits an example is the lending to companies associated with the managing director sanjay shah which were in excess of 40 of the banks core capital and are equivalent to 11 of the entire lending ii the lending above also exceeds the limits of 25 of core capital imposed by section 10 of the banking act on facilities to single borrowers and their associates iii the prudential guidelines cbkpg02 section 3521 requires directors chief executive officers and management of bank to declare any financial interest in customers of the bank in order to reduce or eliminate conflicts of interest thereafter such directors or officers should not be directly involved in the banks dealings with such customers the bank has extensive dealings with the kingsway group and creative innovations limited in which some directors have an interest based on our review of information provided there was also evidence that the disclosures made by the directors to cbk on their other directorships were not complete there are numerous companies with which some directors are associated which have not been disclosed in their submissions to the central bank of kenya cbk iv section 11 of the banking act and section 3527 of cbkpg02 prohibits directors chief executive officers and management from granting any advances loans or credit facilities which are not fully secured to any of its officers significant shareholders or their associates we noted instances where loans to officers and their associates are unsecured v cbk has issued guidelines on foreign exchange that require banks to report any transaction above us 50000 and to retain documentary evidence for those transactions we were not provided for our review with copies of these returns other than for those made in 2006 vi cbk has issued guidelines on foreign exchange that require banks to retain documentary evidence for those transactions in foreign currency amounting to more than us 10000 we noted numerous instances of transfers of us 10000 and below by single customer to single beneficiary on the same day indicating an intention to split such transactions to avoid maintenance of records or reporting transactions above us 50000 as required by cbk vii from the review of the returns to cbk for 2006 we noted an incomplete return relating to some funds transferred from the lion club of ethiopia account we have reviewed transactions in the lion club of ethiopia account and noted other unusual suspicious transactions viii the bank had about 150 accounts which although denominated in kenya shillings had almost all transactions in them in foreign currencies most of these accounts were closed in 2004 and new accounts opened for the same customers in the respective foreign currencies although the account balances were in shillings we noted that there were regular revaluations of the balances indicating that the intention of the bank was to retain foreign currency value it is therefore possible that returns made to the cbk on the currency positions were misleading and did not include these types of accounts unusual transactions and accounts which indicate unusual operations of the bank there is evidence of irregular banking practices based on our review of customer accounts during our investigations we noted number of transactions that appeared unusual and for which we recommend further investigation instances noted include the following i we noted numerous cases where certain customers engaged in regular large cash transactions that are considered unusual there were unusually large cash withdrawals and deposits which may indicate an intention to conceal the true source or beneficiary of the payments made the supporting debit vouchers and deposit slips were not detailed enough to show to whom the cash was paid or from whom deposits were received ii we noted pattern of transactions involving web of related accounts held at the bank which may indicate an intention to conceal the true source or beneficiary of the payment made for example there are several parties making payments directly or indirectly to accounts in the name of paolo sattanino and an entity called capricorn srl account opening details are available for these accounts who in turn make payments overseas to various parties we have identified number of companies involved in this web including kingsway mart and creative innovations it is not clear what the transfers relate to the amounts involved are sometimes significant and are explained in greater detail in section 52 of the report we recommend that these payments be investigated further to establish their nature and rule out irregularity certain dilpun shah acts on behalf of several companies which have link to payments made to paolo sattanino iii we have noted that the bank is using sundry creditors account for processing payments from or to customer accounts some of the payments debited to customer accounts such as the prajapati account as cash withdrawals were traced to the sundry creditors account there is also evidence that loan repayments for loan granted to parmex limited originated from the sundry creditors account there is evidence where the funds came from or whether these were indeed genuine loan repayments it is possible that the sundry creditors account has been used to conceal transactions between accounts it is also possible that cash may not have moved as recorded or cash may not actually have moved into out of the bank iv unusual loan accountstransactions in addition to the parmex limited loan transaction discussed above we have noted other examples such as the sailesh prajapati account where loan accounts have been credited with amounts described as loan proceeds or transfers from unexplained or unrelated accounts v there are large inward and outward telegraphic transfers which are unsupported these are repatriation and receipt of funds to or from sources and purposes that we could not ascertain as explained before we were unable to obtain supporting documents for most foreign currency transfers examples of some of the large transactions noted for which support has been provided include the following crucial properties limited shs 2 billion received in january 2001 and its subsequent transfer from the receiving account kariuki muigua client account shs 312 million received from crucial properties limited in february 2001 the funds were withdrawn within week and paid to other parties kingsway tyres limited there were several large cash and telegraphic transfers in september october and november 2005 various foreign currency transactions by paolo sattanino vi some accounts were opened operated and closed within an unusually short period of time indicating that they were opened to facilitate specific transactions only vii there were some unusually high insurance premium payments to an insurance company overseas for individual endowment policies debited from the kingsway tyres account ca 01000795 the supporting documents showed some discrepancies viii there were instances where an account holder used cheques issued in another accounts name to transact business in his account this was done by manually altering the account name and number on the cheques most of the transactions done in this manner were described as cash withdrawals ix withdrawals transactions were made contrary to or without appropriate account mandates x there was large number of accounts maintained in kenya shillings but having foreign currency transactions that were closed in april 2004 and replaced by new accounts the instructions to close the old accounts and to open new ones were not made available xi we noted number of fixed deposit accounts with very unusual transactions these were fixed deposit accounts that had history of debit balances the debit balances would reverse in due course through unusual entries and would eventually turn into credit balances know your customer kyc procedures banking best practice requires banks to gain an understanding of the customers identity and their source of funds among other things cb has developed some kyc procedures that require prospective customers to supply certain information and to complete account opening forms which are then approved before an account can be opened we however noted that these procedures are largely ignored some of the discrepancies are as follows i missing account opening forms contrary to the requirement that every new customer of the bank completes standard account opening form detailing information about the individual or the entity most accounts are not supported by either account opening forms or customer instructions of the 1004 accounts we sampled for review there were account opening forms or customer instructions for 839 accounts representing 217 relationships these have been summarised under appendix i ii where the account opening forms were available we noted numerous instances where the information on the forms was incomplete the forms require the customer to provide details about the account to be opened once this form is reviewed the appropriate bank official signs it as an indication that the customers request has been accepted and an account can be opened details missing included the following certificate of incorporation memorandum and articles of association for corporate customers trade licenses resolutions of directors to open an account with charterhouse bank address verification documents such as utility bill or bank statements we have summarised in appendix ii the accounts where these details were missing iii the bank requires its new customers to obtain references from existing customers of the bank however we noted instances where potential customers did not obtain such introductions but instead bank official noted known to the bank in that field bank official has signed the form to confirm this on behalf of the bank iv there were instances where appropriate bank officers had not approved the account opening forms we have summarised examples noted where the appropriate approvals are missing see appendix ii v the kyc procedures require that copies of documents supplied be certified as true copies of the original we noted instances where copies had not been certified vi we noted files where the credit history was not up to date examples are overdraft accounts whose facilities have expired and there was evidence of followup since there were recent correspondences between the bank and the customer vii accounts without postal or physical addresses the postal or physical addresses of the following customers from our sample were not recorded as expected account name account account type kenya catermart fx 01400142 limited maniben meghji fx 01400091 shah parmex limited fx 01400017 parmex limited ca 01000193 anandi vipin shahcd 01206954 sonal devani fd 01207285 lack of postal or other addresses imply the following that the customer does not obtain regular updates of the transactions in that account the accounts may not be genuine there is possibility that the companies and individuals mentioned above are not aware of the accounts above the transactions processed in these accounts may be irregular and would call for further investigations viii accounts using unusual names opened using initials our review revealed accounts as well as beneficiaries whose names appeared to be short forms examples include the following an account by the name cil whose directors were the same as those operating the account of creative innovations limited beneficiary by the name pil receiving payments from creative innovations limited an account by the name d shah which may relate to accounts operated by dilpun shah an account named s shah an account named pivb whose details we did not obtain other than cil we were not provided with the account opening forms for the accounts above we were therefore not able to confirm other details of these accounts there were some unusual transactions in some of these accounts compliance with laws and regulations 1 requirements of the banking laws and regulations in accordance with the terms of reference we carried out review of compliance with the various laws and regulations in place during the period under review the key requirements of the various regulations relevant to this exercise cover wide range of matters including the following i corporate governance the guidelines among other things apply to the duties responsibilities and code of conduct for shareholders directors chief executive officers and management of the bank the code of conduct deals with outside financial interests by the directors and insider loans as well as the required disclosures ii proceeds of crime and money laundering prevention the guidelines deal with methods of prudent customer identification record keeping identification of suspicious activities and the need to report such activities to the appropriate authorities for further investigation the guidelines require that banks report any suspicious transactions to the cbk iii enforcement of banking laws and regulations the guidelines deal with the supervisory role of the cbk and the role of the board of directors in ensuring that laws are enforced and weaknesses noted from cbk inspections are acted on iv foreign exchange transactions the cbk guidelines require banks to maintain supporting documents for all transactions above us 10000 or equivalent in addition to the requirement that they report any transaction above us 50000 v prohibited business this guideline applies to transactions by the bank including insider lending limitations single borrower limits requirement to obtain security for any insider lending and prohibition of reckless and fraudulent activities the following were noted from this review 2 returns to cbk management made available to us the returns made to cbk in 2006 for these returns we focused on foreign currency transactions to ensure that transactions that required reporting to cbk were appropriately reported our review has indicated evidence of noncompliance especially for transactions above the required reporting threshold of us 50000 and in respect of maintaining documents for transactions above us 10000 the table below shows details of some transactions which we traced to tt confirmations that were not appropriately reported for most

sattanino accounts we noted that they were only supported by electronic mails see further work under 522 3 splitting of foreign currency transactions from review of sample of customer instructions we noted instances where single payments were split into several telegraphic transfers one such instance was through letter dated 10 january 2005 from creative innovations limited see appendix b requesting the bank to make transfers to various beneficiaries among them paolo sattanino the instructions to pay paolo sattanino required the bank to remit us 90000 and euros 19000 in amounts of less than us 10000 each over consecutive dates although the value of the transaction is significantly above the us 50000 limit set by cbk for reporting and obtaining supporting documentation from the customer this seems to have been avoided by splitting the transaction the table below illustrates some transfers split under instructions from creative innovations in january 2005 we have traced the transfers to the accounts of paolo sattanino ca 01800145 and ca 01600006 the customer instructions appear unusual and may be aimed at ensuring that reporting to cbk does not become necessary date

other foreign currency payments made out of creative innovations limited account number 01000009 these payments also indicated possible splitting of amounts as there were several remittances to single beneficiary on the same date we have summarised these in appendix iii there were other payments of this nature to paolo sattanino from the kingsway mart limited account ca 01000564 4 insider lending our review of lending to directors their associates and companies related to the directors revealed breaches to the banking act these breaches are summarised below lendings to sanjay r shah and companies associated with him as on 23 june 2006 stood at 405 exceeding the 20 limit set out under the revised guidelines and under section 11 of the banking act lendings to sanjay r shah and companies associated with him including his brother manoj r shah as at 23 june 2006 exceeded the 25 maximum permitted under section 10 of the banking act for any one single borrower the disclosures made to cbk on lending to insiders were incomplete since these returns are made by bank officials the omissions would indicate either negligence or concealment the table below shows the lending to

ltd 39 1999 turnover relates to the period from 1 january 1999 to 23 june 2006 as noted in section 55 of this report our review of transactions in the three accounts above indicated unusual transactions for which we recommend further investigation in addition further investigations are recommended to establish whether relationship exists between the level of turnover in the bank accounts above and the revenue turnover reflected in the statutory accounts of these companies 2 nakumatt holdings limited ca 01000085 nakumatt holdings maintained three accounts as at 23 june 2006 call deposit account us current account and shilling current account the shilling current account ca 01000085 was the most active the review of this account showed very substantial credits on regular basis we understood from enquiry with management that the practice is for nakumatt to deposit its collections into its barclays accounts and then transfer to cb those funds required to settle suppliers liabilities we however noted the following matters that appeared unusual and which require further investigation i we noted that during the period between may 2003 and october 2003 an amount of shs 36 million was transferred to the prajapati account on weekly basis there were 22 such transfers totalling shs 792 million for which supporting documentation was available as these were said to have been

signatory contrary to the mandates documented the cheque used to make this withdrawal had alterations on its face that were not countersigned the alterations related to blotting out the name of the account on the face of the cheque as well as the account number and replacing them with nakumatt details we have included copy of this cheque as appendix d v there were regular payments to the fresh an juici account of shs 65 million on regular basis for which we did not see any standing instructions between april 2005 and april 2006 shs 286 million had been transferred in this manner we have classified these transactions as unusual and requiring further investigation as it is not clear what the bases of the transactions are or because we identified irregularities in the accounts to from where payments were made 3 greenhills investments limited the company has an active current account whose directors include manish and manoj shah who are brothers to the banks managing director sanjay

bank 1 cash transactions we noted that the bank had customers who were making withdrawals in cash that we considered to be high and or unusual these transactions appeared to have commercial substance as these customers would deposit material sums described as cash deposits which would be followed by full withdrawals on the same day the transactions were considered unusual due to the following the cash withdrawals were high averaging shs 1 million some of the accounts operated almost entirely on cash basis for both deposits and withdrawals the accounts had very high activity on some particular days during which large sums of money would be deposited and withdrawn the table below shows some of the accounts that exhibited the above characteristics there are numerous other accounts with such

account opening forms were not made available for our review we however noted that the accounts under this name received funds from other customers of the bank the account was credited on regular basis with funds from various customer accounts we noted the following anomalies in regard to this account number of companies and individuals such as creative innovations limited brand imports limited aua industria limited and suresh shah regularly transfer funds to paolo sattanino and capricorn srl accounts in lots of us 10000 or euro equivalent refer to section 33 for examples with regards to transaction splitting there was email correspondence from paolo sattanino directing the bank to transfer money through telegraphic transfers outside the country the transfers were not supported by relevant documentation as required for transfers whose value is above us 10000 refer to appendix vi for money transferred from paolo sattaninos accounts we noted instances where paolo gave instructions to the bank to transfer funds but to indicate the remitter as different entity or individual this would amount to falsifications of the declarations made and the bank would be guilty of facilitating false declarations for some of these transfers the tt confirmations supporting the transactions were not made available these have also been summarised as part of appendix vi there are indications of possible account splitting to avoid providing documentation in support of the transactions by ensuring that the values were at us 10000 or less for some of the sampled transactions in the paolo sattanino accounts customer instructions were not provided for our review these have also been summarised in appendix vi we have included some email correspondences in respect of these accounts under appendix f 3 dilpun shah group during the course of our work we noted various accounts that appeared to be operated by one person there were transactions in these accounts that linked them to certain dilpun shah number of payments made from these accounts related to overseas payments through the accounts of paolo sattanino the deposit slips into these accounts appeared to share the same handwriting pointing to the possibility that these accounts were being operated by one person or by small group of people see appendix g we have reviewed transactions in the accounts that appear related and have presented the accounts graphically below pic 3 odesys enterprises account ca 01000740 odesys enterprises is sole proprietorship account that was opened by mr felix odemba nabuko whose

deposits accompanied by withdrawals of similar amounts on the same day these transactions appear to have commercial rationale and are inconsistent with business operating from butere the following matters were noted the turnover is high for trader in butere and the account needs to be investigated further for tax compliance majority of the transactions are in cash which is unusual especially for business in butere in western province where the bank has branch operations there were significant cash payments on particular dates pointing to the possibility that the account was being used for

include the following call and fixed deposits once matured are credited into this account before being paid out to depositors upcountry cheques are also posted through this account until they clear at which point they are posted into the customer account cash transfers from branches to the head office are also posted into this account we have also noted instances where transactions described as cash withdrawal were traced to this account pointing to the possibility that there were actual cash withdrawals the first three transaction types above would be normal in sundry creditors clearing account where amounts are expected to clear within short period however our concern is that this account may be used to mask other transactions in particular transfers between customer accounts from the above we propose that any further investigation should also include detailed review of this account to establish the nature of transactions recorded in it 1 sailesh prajapati account ca 01 000148 the account was opened on 8 january 1999 and closed on 2 august 2004 there are account opening forms and there were details of the mandates to operate the account within the banking system we were therefore unable to establish the background details relating to this account during this period the account debit turnover was shs 22 billion we were also not able to establish the signing mandates on the account because the transaction records were not made available from our detailed review of the account we noted some transactions we considered unusual as described below i amounts debited into this account as cash withdrawals were traced to the sundry creditors account 01600000 in the general ledger cash may have never left the bank although the entries in the account are described as if cash was paid out ii numerous transactions of exactly the same amounts there were over 1300 cash deposits of shs 1 million each out of 1570 total credits during the period of the remaining credits shs 105 million was received from nakumatt in 28 equal transactions of shs 376 million each iii other unusual transactions were made of what was described as loan proceeds from other accounts whose relationship with the prajapati account we were not able to confirm iv all the shs 1 million deposits mentioned above were in cash which is unusual for trading account v the account has numerous credits described as cash receipts based on the cash withdrawals traced to the sundry creditors account the cash receipts may also not relate to actual cash received the table below shows some of the

recommend that further investigations are carried out review of the sundry creditors account however shows entries described as reversals for some of these transactions these reversals however are not reflected on the sailesh account pointing to the possibility that the descriptions are misleading the table below contains examples of such entries in the sailesh prajapati account as traced to the

corresponding entries of the instalment repayments to the sundry creditors account sc 01600000 this is considered unusual since repayments would either be cashcheque deposits or transfers from another of the customers accounts ii we traced the movement of the above instalments to the kingsway mart limited account ca 01000564 from where transfers were made to the sundry creditors account sc 01600000

proceeds from drafts accounts fx 01400087 fx 01400086 fx 01400090 as noted in the preceding paragraphs on the crucial properties limited accounts some significant amounts were paid out of these accounts in the form of demand drafts we did not obtain details of who the beneficiaries were however we have noted that some new accounts were opened and credited with amounts described as proceeds of draft just about 6 months after the demand drafts totalling shs 14 billion were paid out of the crucial properties limited account fx 01400067 the payments of shs 14 billion in the crucial

there are supporting documents for the transactions as the documents are said to have been lost in fire of september 2004 these accounts were opened and closed within short time indicating that they were operated to achieve some particular purpose the amounts are almost equivalent in value to some individual drafts paid out of the crucial properties limited account fx 01400067 in may 2001 although we have not been able to match them due to lack of supporting documentation it is therefore possible that the payments to these accounts relate to the drafts issued out of the crucial properties limited account we therefore recommend that these accounts be further investigated and that other accounts opened and operated around november 2001 be included as part of these investigations 2 kariuki muigua co advocates 1 kariuki muigua co advocates clients ac ca 01000563 during the months of october and november 2005 this account was unusually active and received huge

numerous cheques whose details have been altered on the face without being counter signed the changes made on the cheques had the potential impact of making the cheques invalid however all these changes were accepted by the bank and the transactions processed through the customer accounts the alterations made related to blacking out the name of the drawer and replacing it with another handwritten name once the details of the drawer have been altered the account number of the customer would also be blacked out and the new account number handwritten we consider these alterations

deposit accounts with debit balances review of the history of the banks fixed deposit accounts indicates that the running balances of some of the accounts were in debit which is unusual we also noted that the rollover details of the deposits appeared unusual since the entire deposits were being credited to the account repeatedly without being retired it is not clear whether cash was actually received each time the account was credited interest was being credited to these accounts even where their status was in debit these unusual scenarios point to the possibility that the deposits may be inaccurate incomplete or may not actually exist it is also possible that such debit balances may have been created to facilitate payments to other accounts or out of the bank the accounts having this peculiarity mainly relate to directors of the bank and other related companies we have summarised some of the accounts which operated as debit balances below most of these accounts were eventually turned into credit balances by 23 june 2006 these accounts need to be investigated to establish the following why the opening balances were in debit and when these debit balances arose why the accounts showed repetitive deposits renewals without the maturing deposits being retired why unlike other fixed deposit accounts where new account is created to facilitate rollover of matured deposit new accounts were opened for these accounts fixed and call deposits that operated with debit balances type customer name ac debit of balance accoun 1 jan t 2003 shs fd sanjay r shah 012051970984029 6
