payment for administrative expenses and the 800 paymen t for funeral expens described above count against the 10000 payment authorized by pl 104208 death of retired civilian federal employee spouse survivor benefits married federal employ ees who retire under either csrs or fers automatically receive joint and survivor annuity unless both husband and wife decline it in writing in which case the worker will receive singlelife annuity 4 under csrs if worker receives joint nd survivor annuity the annual benefit is reduced by an amount equal to 25 of the first 3600 plus 10 of the annuity above that amount in return for this reduction the work ers spouse is entitled to survivor annuity equal to 55 of the workers full annuity before the reduction is taken into account alternatively worker retir ing under csrs and his or her spouse can elect smaller survivor annuity in which case the workers annuity is reduced by 25 of the first 3600 and 10 of the annuity above this amount up to the limit that he or she specifies as the base upon which the survivor benefit is to be calculated under fers if worker receives joint and survivor annuity the retirees annual benefit is reduced by an amount equal to 10 of the annuity that would otherwise be paid in return for this reduction the workers s pouse is entitled to survivor annuity equal to 50 of the workers full annuity before the reduction is taken into account5 alternatively the couple may elect that the rvivor benefit is to be based on onehalf of the retirees annuity in which case the retired workers annuity is reduced by 5 and the survivor benefit would be qual to 25 of the retirees unr educed annuity the reduction in the benefits of workers who elect joint nd survivor annuity is sufficient to cover onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21029crs5 6 under provision of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 this payment can be made through reduction in the retirees annuity rather than as lump sumabout half of the cost of the fers survivor annuity and less than half of the cost of the csrs survivor annuity consequently surv ivor benefits under bot h csrs and fers are partially subsidized by the federal government if the marriage of retiree who had elected joint and survivor annuity ends his or her annuity is increased to the full amount payable under singlelife annuity if the retired worker marries or remarries after retirement he or she has maximum of two years during which to elect survivor covera ge for new spouse and the retirees annuity is reduced accordingly the election for join t and survivor annuity must be made within two years of the date of marriage to elect survivor coverage for spouse married after the date of retirement lumpsum payment plus 6 interest must be made to cover the period preceding the postretirement marriage during which survivor reduction was in effect6 this payment is necessary to preser ve equity between couples who are married continuously throughout retirement and those who marry after retiring because in both cases the survivor benefit is the same pe rcentage of the retired workers annuity child survivor benefits under both csrs and fers survivor benefits are paid to children of deceased federal retirees in the same amounts and unde r the same eligibility criteria as apply to the children of deceased federal employees retired workers who are the parents of unmarried depe ndent children who might qualify for child survivor benefits are not required to take reduction in their retirement annuities health insurance for surv iving spouses and children widow or widower of deceased retiree who is eligible for survivor annuity under either csrs or fers and who was covered under the fe hbp at the time of the retirees death can continue to participate in the program at the same cost as applies to workers and retirees the survivor is eligible even if the amount of the survivor annuity is less than the monthly fehbp premium in which case the individual must remit the difference directly to opm retiree who marries or remarries after retirem ent can assure that his or her surviving spouse will be eligible for fehbp coverage by electing minimal survivor annuity if retired federal employee has former spouse to whom full survivor annuity was awarded through state court order the worker can at retirement or at the time of remarriage if later entitle his or her current spouse to continue participating in the fehbp after the retirees death by electing surv ivor coverage for that spouse even though the current spouse might receive survivor annu ity as long as the former spouse is living and receiving the survivor annuity unmarri ed dependent children of deceased retiree can continue to participate in the fehbp until age 22 regardless of student status provided that they were covered as family members by the retiree in certain cases coverage can continue for up to 36 months beyond the childs 22nd birthday insurable interest annuities both csrs and fers allow retiring employee to provide survivor benefits to an individual who has an ins urable interest in the retiree an insurable interest exists if the person may reasonably expect to benefit financially from the retiree continuing to live for exam ple former spouse or current spouse can be named as having an insura ble interest if spouse survi vor benefit has been providedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21029crs6 7 widows of former members of congress may r eceive csrs survivor annuity even if the deferred annuity that
