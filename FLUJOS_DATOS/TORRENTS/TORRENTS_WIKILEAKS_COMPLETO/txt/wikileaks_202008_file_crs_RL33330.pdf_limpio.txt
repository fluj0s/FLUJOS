not reimbursable by fema or sba typically cdbg has been used to fi nance the removal of debris the provision of extra security patrols and the emergenc restoration of essen tial services such as water sewer electrical nd telecommunications for instance approximately 250 million in cdbg funds were used to fina nce the emergency temporary restoration of utilities in the affected areas of lower manhattan following the destruction of the world trade center and an additi onal 500 million was made available for permanent utility restoration and infrastructure improvements1 mitigation activities mitigation activities are intended to lessen the impact of disaster and can range from such physical measures as the construction of levees to protect against flooding to buildi ngs designed to withstand earthquakes mitigation activities may also involve training exercises and public awareness programs less typical is the use of cdbg to compensate businesses and workers for lost wages or revenues mitigation can take place at any time before disaster occurs during an emergency or after di saster during recovery or reconstruction mitigation activities have involved the use of cdbg s to fund buyouts of real property in areas prone to recurrence of the event for instance following the midwest floods of 1993 cdbg and hazard mitigation grants from fema were used to acquire privatelyheld

governing the use of cdbg funds for disaster relief14 funding transfers congress has included lang uage in previous disaster relief appropriations allowing communitie s to transfer cdbg funds to other programs for instance disaster relief assistance legislation in response to the northridge california earthquake of 1994 included provision allowing hud to transfer 75 million in cdbg assistance to the home investment partnership program housing block gr ant administered by hud15 in addition congress included language in appr opriations dealing with the 1998 midwest floods that transferred administrative authority over cdbg funds for land buyouts from hud to fema as part of disaster mitigation strategy16 matching funds congress has also included language in disaster relief appropriations requiring communities to meet financial match requirement as condition for receipt of cdbgfunded disa ster relief assistance for instance disaster relief assistance in response to the florida hurricanes of 2004 required each state to provide not less than 10 percent in nonfederal public ma tching funds or its equivalent value other than administrative costs for any funds allocated to the state under this heading17 cdbgs awarded to states following the 1998 midwest floods were conditioned on each state providing 25 in nonfederal public matching funds18 reporting requirements

relief funds legislation providing cdbg disaster relief assistance to communities affected by the 1997 and 1998 midwest floods included pr ovisions that required hud and fema to jointly submit
