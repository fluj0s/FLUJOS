local restrictions on employing renting property to or providing services for unauthorized aliens legal issues and recent judicial developments introduction recently several states nd localities have considered andor enacted measures intended to deter the presence of aliens w ho are present in the united states without legal authorization ie aliens commonly referred to in discourse as illegal or unauthorized aliens typically such measures have sought to 1 limit the employment and hiring of unauthorized aliens including through the denial of permits to entities that employ such persons as well as through the regulation of day labor centers 2 restrict the ability of such aliens to rent or occupy dwelling within state or localitys jurisdiction andor 3 deny such individuals access to state and local services or benefits several of these measures have been ch allenged in court including on federal preemption and fourteenth amendment grounds legal challenges brought in federal court concerning rest rictions on employment or the renting of property have led to conflicting court rulings in some cases the relevant state or local measure has been upheld as legally and constitutionally valid in other cases the measure has been struck down in still other instan ces the parties have reached settlement agreement that precludes enforcement of the contested ordinance or the presiding court has enjoined the enforcement of the ordinance pending trial these cases illustrate the difficulties st ates and localities face in attempting to regulate the presence and rights of aliens within their jurisdictions in manner consonant with federal law over time the courts have narrowed the legal bases upon which states and localities may enact gislation affecting aliens state and local authority to regulate aliens has also been limited directly or impliedly by the growing scope of federal immigration law with the enactment of federal employer sanctions welfare reform and other recent immigration laws congress has left increasingly few gaps and crevices for states and localities to fill significantly these laws have not only broadene d the substantive regulation of aliens eg employment eligibility but have also established discrete procedures for determining alien eligibility for employment and certain benefits perhaps ironically then even as new state and local measures to deter illegal immigration are motivated in part by perceived lack of federal enforcement of immigration law the degree to which states and localities may regulate immigrationrelated matters has arguably been curbed by the growing breadth of federal immigra tion law on the books conflicting courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34345crs2 1 the other twothirds of foreignborn us residents

is estimated to increase by 500000 annually3 the movement of aliens both legal and nonlegal to nontraditional areas4 and the growth in the unauthorized alien population5 have led some states and

aliens falling within those categories on the other hand the ina establishes an enforcement regime to deter the unlawful presence of aliens including through the use of employer sanctions criminal andor civil penalties and deportation although there is little room for state or local action ddressing immigration the supreme court has never held that every state enactment which in any way deals with aliens is regulation of immigration and thus per preempted13 in the 1976 case of decanas v bica the supreme court held that state regulation of matters only tangentially related to immig ration would absent congre ssional action not be an invalid state incursion on federal power14 the court further indicated that field preemption claims against state action that did not conflict with federal law could only be justified when the complete ous ter of state power was the clear and manifest purpose of congress15 equal protection the equal protection clause of the f ourteenth amendment provides that state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws16 being entitled to equal protection does not equate to equal treatment generally the judicial review standard applied to state and local laws that treat different categories of persons differently the rational basis test is highly deferential however if di stinction disadvantages susp ect class or relates to fundamental right reviewing court will require the state or locality to demonstrate that the distinction is justified by compelling government interest strict scrutiny other tests falling

states in the measures it may take with respect to aliens see matthews v diaz 426 us 67 8487 1976 the equal protection analysis also involves significantly different considerations because it concerns the relationship between aliens and the states rather than between aliens and the federal government id at 8485 however the s upreme court has suggested that undocumented status coupled with some

the circumstances and intere sts involved in the case of matthews v eldridge the supreme court announced the prevailing standard for assessi ng the requirements of due process finding that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors first the private interest that will be affected by the official action second the risk of erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used and probable value if any of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally the governments interest including the function involved and the ad ministrative and fiscal burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail25 although the requirements of due proce ss may vary depending

or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions upon those who employ or recruit or refer for fee for employment unauthorized aliens30 however state and local regulation of such practices through licensing and similar laws is exempted from this provision31 accordingly while federal law clearly preempts the imposition of any additional criminal or ci vil penalties upon those involved in the unlawful employment of aliens states and localities are not expressly preempted from denying business license to an entity that hires or employs unauthorized aliens as will be discussed later32 it is question of ongoing legal bate as to whether this exclusion from preemption is intended to apply to all state and local measures denying licenses to employers of unauthorized aliens or only to those that deny licenses to businesses that have been found to have violated ina 274a ina 274ah2 does not expressly preem pt every state or local measure denying licenses to businesses that employ illegal aliens nor does it expressly authorize such measures however even if state or local regulation of certain conduct involving immigration is not pr eempted in all circumstances the manner and scope of

natura lization including determinations regarding the immigra tion status of aliens though such determinations are subject to judicial review in many circumstances33 accordingly states and localities are preempted by federal law from substantively categorizing aliens or making an independent assessment as to whether an alien has committed an immigration violation34 such authority is conferred exclusively to designated federal authorities by the ina35 state or local measure targeting unauthorized aliens may have better chance of surviving preemption challenge if its penalties are

federal laws barring the harboring of such persons see ina 274a 8 usc 1324a discussing penalties for harboring an illegal alien or encouraging or inducing an alien to reside in the united statesordinance is preempted by federal immigration law is whether the ordinance focuses directly upon essentially cal problems and is tailored to combat effectively the perceived evils39 prior to the

high unemployment deprives citiz ens and legally admitted alie ns of jobs acceptance by illegal aliens of jobs on s ubstandard terms as to wage s and working conditions can seriously depress wage scales and working conditions of citizens and legally admitted aliens and employment of illegal aliens under such conditions can diminish the effectiveness of labor unions40 because ina 274ah2 recognizes the ability of states and localities to at least in certain circumstances deny business permits to entities that employ unauthorized aliens such measures appear more likely to survive legal challenges when they are narrowly tailored and based on legitimate purposes as was the case for those that were upheld in decanas states and localities may have greater leeway in restricting the establishment of day labor centers within their jurisdic tions though such f acilities may indirectly facilitate the hiring of unauthorized aliens as previously mentioned states and localities are not preempted from regulating matters only tangentially related to federal immigration law41 federal immigration law is silent on the matter of day labor centers based on the courts reasoning in decanas it would appear that states and localities could generally restrict the construction of day labor centers at least so long as it could be demonstrated that such restrictions were addressed at essentially local problems and were tailored to combat effectively the perceived evils42 procedural due process state and local restrictions on the hiring and employment of illegal immigrants also may be challenged on procedural due process grounds depending upon the form such restrictions take if for example state or locality re voked the business permit of an entity that employed or hired

discriminate against aliens who are here illegally72 and the federal government by contrast has wi discretion to discriminate both between citizens and legal aliens as well as between classes of legal

federal antidiscrimination laws under title vii of the civil rights act79 employers are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race colo r religion sex or national origin80 the supreme court has ruled that with respect to title vii the term national origin does not embrace requirement of united states citizenship81 in reaching this result the court reasoned that national origin refers to the country in which someone is born or from which his or her ancestors came because individuals who share the same national origin do not necessarily share the same citizenship status the court determined that title viis prohibition on national origin discrimination does not necessarily make it illegal for employers to discriminate on the basis of citizenship status or alienage any state or local m easure restricting the hiring or employment of unauthorized aliens must comply with title vii requirements82 thus for example local ordinance that authorized the enforcement of an employment complaint that alleged violations solely on the basis of an employees race or national origin would not be legally enforceable however it is possible that an ordi nance restricting the employment of unauthorized aliens could when implemented encourage violations of title vii in situations where discrimination on the basis of citizenship would have the effect or purpose of discriminating on the basis of national origin for example employers who are concerned about inadvertently hiring unlawful workers may become reluctant to hire individuals from certain ethnic backgrounds and such reluctance could have the unlawful effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin in other cases an employer might use citizenship test as pretext to disguise what is in fact national origin discrimination as the court has noted t itle vii prohibits discrimination on the basis of citizenship whenever it has the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin83 in an effort to comply with such ordinances therefore some employers may engage in practices that could give rise to legal challenges under title viihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34345crs20 84 42 usc 3604a 85

had the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin85 as result any state or local measure that authorizes the enforcement of housing complaints ba sed solely on the na tional origin of dwellings inhabitants would be impermissible86 further if landlords who are attempting to comply with an ordinance barring the tenancy of illegal aliens engage in national origin discrimina

arizona statute employers were accorded fair and adequate procedural protections it acknowledged that circumstances could occur where the arizona statute might be applied in manner that did not accord adequate procedural protections but such hypothetical situations were not sufficient for the court to find the statute to be facially unconstitutional 109 finally the court dismissed plaintiffs claim that the arizona statute violated the commerce clause of the us constitution finding that the statute did not regulate em ployees outside the state110 following the district courts ruling plaintiffs

affidavit to the city affirming that they do not knowingly hire or use the services of persons who are not lawfully present within the united states114 upon receipt of valid complaint that business violated ordinance requirements the city could request the business to submit identity information regarding persons alleged to be unlawful workers the city would thereafter attempt to verify an

294294 at 8 119 id at 912 120 id at 12 the court also noted that the va lley park ordinance provides that the federal government must verify that an employee is an unauthorized alien before local enforcement measures can be taken according to the court the only circumstance in which the ordinance would not comply w ould be if the federal law required that an employer be found to be in violation of the federal stat ute before any state action could be taken however nowhere in the legislative history c ited by plaintiffs nor more importantly within the language of the statute is th is requirement stated id at n15 121 id at 13required under the ordinance for reinstatem ent of business license when two or more violations have occurred116 in upholding the valley park ordinance the district court ruled against plaintiffs claim that the measure was preempted by federal immigration law the court began by noting supreme court jurisprudence recognizing strong presumption against preemption of the histor ical police powers of states unless that was the clear and manife st purpose of congress117 the district court applied this presumption in consideration of preem ption arguments against the ordinance characterizing the measure as regulation of business licenses an area historically occupied by states and localities rather than regulation directly concerned with immigration an area falling under the clear purview of the federal government118 the court rejected plaintiffs argument that the valley park ordinance was expressly preempted by ina 274ah2 while ina 274ah2 clearly preempts states and localities from imposing criminal or civil sanctions against employers of unauthorized liens the court held that the valley park ordinance constituted licensing or similar law expressly exempted from preemption119 the court also disagreed with plaintiffs cont ention that the legislative history of irca indicated that the exempti on contained in ina 274ah2 should be read narrowly so as to only permit state or local licensing restrictions upon entities that were already found by the federal government to have violated federal i mmigration law requirements the court found the portions of the legislative history relied upon by plaintiffs to be at best ambiguous and insufficient to contravene the plain meaning of the statute which clearly provides for state and local governments to pass licensing laws which touch on the subject of illegal immigration120 turning to the issue of field preempti on the court conclude d that federal law regulating the employment of unauthorized liens was not so pervasive as to preempt every state or local action on the subject according to the court the inclusion of provision in ina 274a as well as comment s in the legislative history allowing some state licensing regulations to exist clearly conflicts with an intent to preempt the entire field of immigration regulation121 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34345crs26 122

disagreed with plaintiffs c ontention that the valley park ordinance was unenforceable on conflict preemption gro unds the court concluded that the differences between the requirements of federal law and the local measure were not significant enough to constitute c onflict sufficient to support finding of preemption122 among other things the grey court held that the ordinances requirement that certain employers participate in the basic pilot program did not conflict with federal law which generally does not mandate participation in the program123 the grey court ruled against plaintiffs with respect to their equal protection and due process claims under the fourteenth ame ndment as well as their claim that the ordinance was inconsistent w ith missouri state law th court found that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring an equal prot ection claim on behalf of employees or potential employees of hispanic origin who would allegedly be discriminated against under the ordinance124 in the alternative the court held that plaintiffs had failed to provide evidence supporting cons titutional violation finding that the ordinance was not facially discriminatory against hispanics and that insufficient evidence had been presented to establish that the ordinance had discriminatory purpose125 with respect to plaintiffs due process claims the grey court held that the ordinance provided affected business entities with sufficient procedural protections to satisfy due process requirements126 finally the court held that the ordinance did not violate missouri state law concerning local au thority to suspend or revoke business licenses127 national coalition of latino clergy inc v henry in national coalition of latino clergy inc v henry 128 recent case related to an immigration law

plaintiffs including an association of latino clergymen several churches nd several businesse s did not have constitutional standing for variety of reasons including failing to identify specific association member with standing and alleging injuries that were speculative and nonimminent however the court noted that these plaintiffs would easily be able to cure these defects by filing wellpled

limitation on standing an illegal alien in willful violation of federal immigration law is without standing to challenge the constitutionality of state law when compliance with federal law would absolve the illega l aliens constitutional dilemma particularly when the challenged state law was enacted to discourage violation of the federal immigration law129 because the case was ultimately dismisse d on standing grounds the court did not consider the merits of the plaintiffs claims lozano v city of hazleton in the case of lozano v city of hazleton decided on july 26 2007 the us district court for the middl district of pennsylvania struck down an ordinance enacted by hazleton pennsylvania intended to deter the housing and employment of unauthorized aliens hazlet on initially enacted an ordinance in july 2006 that denied business permits to entities that employed illegal aliens and imposed civil penalties upon persons who rented dwelling units to such aliens in the following months hazleton enacted substitute ordinance and thereafter amended this replacement ordinance to further clarif its scope and application130 in general the hazleton ordinance at issue in lozano 1 denied or suspended the business permit of any entity that employed unauthorized aliens 2 created cause of action for lawful employees against their employer if they were discharged at time when the business employed unauthorized aliens and 3 barred persons from letting leasing or renting dwelling unit to an unauthorized alien with offenders subject to revocation of their rental license and in th case of second or subsequent violation civil fine the district court found that the ordinance was unconstitutional on preemption and procedural grounds and so violated 42 usc 1981 though the court did reject plaintiffs claims that the ordinance violated the equal protection clause or the fha131 the district court held that the zleton ordinances restrictions on the employment of unauthorized aliens were unconstitutional on express field and conflict preemption grounds in ruling that the hazleton ordinance was expressly preempted the court interpreted the licen sing exception to preemption found in ina 274ah2 narrowly according to the c ourt the legislative history of ina 274h2 indicated that the only state or local licensing requirements intended to be excluded from preemption were those which denied licensing permits to entitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34345crs28 132 the court did not clearly specify whether st ate or locality may find that business violated the requirements of i na

the employment of unauthorized aliens and deny permits to those businesses on account of violating these nonf ederal requirements the lozano court also held that the employmentrelated provisions of the hazleton ordinance were impliedly preempted under field preemption grounds the court reasoned in enacting irca the federal government had created comprehensive scheme to control the employment of unauthorized aliens this scheme left room for state or local regulation of such matters133 except by allowing states and localities to impose licensing restrictions upon entities found to have violated fe deral requirements finally the court held that the employme ntrelated provisions of the ordinance were unenforceable on conflict pr eemption grounds because th ey imposed supplemental requirements on employers above and bey ond what was required under federal law134 the district court also held that the hazleton ordinances restrictions on the housing of illegal aliens we re unenforceable on conflic t preemption grounds the court stated that while the ordinance woul d deny housing to any alien lacking legal immigration status the federal government permits several categories of persons who may not be technically lawfully present in the united states to work and presumably live hereincluding 1 aliens who have completed an application for asylum or withholding of removal 2 aliens who ve filed an application for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident 3 aliens who have filed an application for suspension of deportation 4 aliens pa roled into the united states temporarily for emergency reasons or reasons deemed strictly in the public interest and 5 aliens who are granted deferred action an act of administrative convenience to the government which gives some cases lower priority135 the court also noted that federal law may permit certain unlawfully present aliens to adjust to legal status and eventually become us citizens136 the court therefore concluded that the hazleton ordinan ce conflicted with federal law and washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34345crs29 137 the lozano court also held that the housing provisions of the ordinance

that an aliens legal stat us may only be determined by an immigration judge id at 533 quoting language in ina 240a3 th at states that removal proceeding before an immigration judge is the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be admitted to the united states or if the alien has been so admitted removed from the united states but see supra note 36 discussing

employment components of the hazleton ordinance did not provide procedural safeguards sufficient to fulfill the due process requirements of the fourteenth am endment as affected individuals were provided with insufficient notice and opportunity to be heard before being susceptible to city action that deprived them of liberty or property interest138 notably the court found procedural safeguards were owed not only to affected bus inesses and property owners but also to employees who might be fired or tenants w ho might be evicted by entities attempting to comply with ordinance requirements139 the court dismissed plaintiffs claim th at the ordinance vi olated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment140 as well as the claim that the ordinance violated the fair housing acts prohibition on discrimination in residential real estaterelated transactions on the basis of race or national origin141 in doing so the court held that the ordinance did not facially discriminate against suspect class or implicate fundamental right142 the court also found that the ordinance was rationally related to legitimate government interests in reducing crime caused by illegal immigrants in the city and safeguarding community resources spent on law enforcement education and heath care143 however the court found that the ordinance violated 42 usc 1981 by eff ectively

plaintiffs request for the issuance of temporary restraining order precluding enforcement of the ordinance based on preliminary determination pending trial that the ordinance was preempted by federal
