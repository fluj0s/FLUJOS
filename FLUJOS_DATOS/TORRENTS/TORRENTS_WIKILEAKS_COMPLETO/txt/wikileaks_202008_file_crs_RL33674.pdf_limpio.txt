loan and william d ford direct loan programs background and provisions introduction the federal government operates two major student loan programs the federal family education loan ffel program and the william d ford direct loan dl program these programs can trace their roots to the guaranteed student loan gsl program which was enacted as part of title iv of the higher education act hea of 1965 to promote access to postseconda ry education by making lowinterest loans available to students from low and middleincome families the ffel program formerly named the gs l program is authorized by part b of title iv of the hea under the ffel program loan capital is provided by private lenders and the federal gove rnment guarantees lenders against loss through borrower default ffel program loans are origin ated by private lenders and state and nonprofit guaranty agencies r eceive federal funds to play the lead role in administering many aspects of the ffel program the federal government provides lenders variety of incentives to invest private capital in ffel student loans for example to ensure that private capital will be consistently available to support ffel ans the program provides private lenders with loan subsidy known as special allowance payment this loan subsidy which is tied to financial market index ensures that private lenders receive specified level of return on student loan investments in addition the federal government he lped establish secondary purchase market for ffel loans to help ensure that the ffel program would be fully capitalized the federal government created the student loan marketing association also known as sallie mae1 sallie mae was created to purchase loans from lenders seeking to sell them thereby providing liquidity to help ensure that the ffel program is fully capitalized the dl program authorized under part d of title iv of the hea established in 1993 was intended to streamline the student loan delivery system and achieve cost savings the dl program was originally intended to gradua lly expand and replacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33674crs2 the ffel program the dl program provi des the same set of loans as the ffel program but uses different administrativ structure and draws on different source of capital under the dl program the federal government essentially serves as the banker that is the federa l government provides the ans to students and their families using federal capita l ie funds from the us treasury and owns the loans under the dl program schools may serve as direct loan originators or the loans may be originated by contractors working for the us department of education ed ed also hires contractors to service the loans while the dl program was originally introduced to replace the ffel program the 1998 amendments of the hea removed th provisions of the law that referred to phasein of the dl program and t hose which specified the proportion of new student loan volume to be made through the dl program in particular academic years currently both programs are author ized postsecondary institutions apply to participate in one progra m or both borrowers borro w annually under one

postsecondary educational pursuits than any other source in fy2005 these programs provided 562 billion in new loans to students and their parents in that year the ffel program provided 10323000 new loans averaging approximately 4193 each and the dl program provided 2971000 new loans averaging approximately 4352 each the loans made through the ffel and dl programs are lowinterest fixed rate loans interest rates are determined by statutory provisions the loans disbursed through these programs include subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans for undergraduate and graduate students plus loans

incentives improvement act of 1999 pl 106170 dec 17 1999 included an amendment to the hea acting these formulas for calculating the special allowance for loans disbursed on or after jan 1 2000 and before july 1 2003 pl 107139 adopted feb 8 2002 include d provisions that extend these formulas to loans disbursed on or after july 1 2003 16 the cp rate used in the special allowance calculation is based on the average bond equivalent rates of the daily quotes of the threemonth commercial paper rates for each of the days in quartera quarterly basis special allowance calculations are performed to determine the amount borrower rate is above or below the lender rate when the borrower rate is below the lender rate the federal government pays special allowance equal to the difference when the borrower rate is bove the lender rate th lender rebates the excess interest amount to the federal government14 special allowance payment key component of the ffel program for lenders is the special allowance payment it is payment of additional interest on student loan that is made by the federal government when the borrowers interest rate does not meet statutorily specified level of return to the lender the provision dates to the early days of the gsl program wh the return on student loans was low compared to what lenders could receive from other types of consumer credit and congress wanted to provide an incentive for lenders to put their capital in gsls the special allowance compensates the lender for the difference between the statutorily set interest rate charged to borrowers and th market rate of return in essence the special allowance payment is in place to keep student loan investments appealing to private lenders during periods when th statutorily capped interest rates for borrowers would provide lower rate of re turn than other investments the special allowance payment has been sustained to ensure that the program is consistently fully capitalized the special allowance payment amount is determined quarterly under statutory formula the special allowance paid for each loan is dependent on the formula in effect when the loan was disbursed the federal government pays any special allowance due lenders from the time the loan is disbursed through the entire repayment period effective for stafford plus and cons olidation loans for which the first disbursement was on or after january 1 200015 the special allowance payment amount is determined through the use of series of special allowance payment formulas displayed below each formula establishe

month cp rate premium 174 or 234 borrowers interest rate 4 plus and consolidation loans lender rate 3 month cp rate premium 264 borrowers interest rate 4 in these formulas the cp rate represents the cost of borrowing to banks ie banks borrow the funds that are used to make loans at roughly this rate the premium reflects other costs associated with making and servicing loans as well as return rate subsidy ie an agreed upon minimum profit margin deemed to be appropriate to keep the loans appealing to lenders the borrowers interest rate reflects the interest rate the borrower is paying the bank on the loan and the denominator 4 reflects the fact that the calculation is done to derive quarterly payment if the result of this special allowance calculation is positive the lender receives payment of this additional interest from the federal government by multiplying the result times the outstanding principal on the an if it is negative the lender receives quarterly special allowance payment nd for loans made on or after april 1 2006 the lender would rebate to the federal gove rnment the excess interest received the amount of excess interest that must be reba ted is determined by subtracting the lender rate from the borrower rate multiplying the result by the average daily principal balance during quarter and dividing by four for example if the average daily principal balance on loan during qua rter was 1000 and the borrower rate and lender rate were 68 and 58 respectively the amount of excess interest rebated would be determined as follows 1000 x 14 250 for stafford loans first disbursed on or after july 1 1998 and before january 1 2000 the special allowance rate is the m of the average bond equivalent rates of the 91day tbills auctioned during the quarter and 22 in school and 28 in repayment the plus and consolidation loan rate for loans disbursed during that time period is based on the 91day tbills auctioned dur ing the quarter plus

is administering federal loan guarantees when loans are in default and when loans are eligible for discharge eg in instances of death or permanent disability the guaranty agency pays the lenders insurance claim the gu aranty agency subsequently files claim with the federal government for reinsurance payment default aversion assistance upon receiving request from lender not earlier than the 60th day after loan has become delinquent guaranty agency is required to provide the lende r with default aversion assistance this assistance is aimed at preventing default by the borrower collections after the guaranty agency pays lenders insurance claim on defaulted loan the note is assigned to it and the agency becomes responsible for making efforts to collect on the loan as part of its reinsurance agreement with the federal government guaranty agency is like the lender required to exercise diligence in pursuing defaulters for repaym ent of principal nd accrued interest due on their loans under many of the same pr ocedures required for lenders during loan delinquency20 when guarantor is assigned loan it can convert the loan from defaulted status by rehab ilitating it through loan rehab ilitation or consolidation or the guarantor can collect on the loan assignment of defaulted loans to the federal government subrogation at any time the secretary may require guaranty agency to assign the defaulted loan to the federal govern ment for collection under the assumption that the federal government will have more success in collec tion on particular loan or group of loans than the

payments the 1998 hea amendments established default aversion fee that is intended to provide added incentive for guarantors to work with borrowers to rehabilitate loans in danger of going into default under the provisions guaranty agencies are paid default aversion fee qual to 1 of unpaid principal and accrued interest on loan for which default claim is not paid within 300 days after the

default aversion fees are calculated and paid21 default fees the hea requires guaranty agencies to assess federal default fee equal to 1 of loan principal this fee helps defray some of the federal cost of insuring loans the fee is borrower fee that must be assessed it can be either deducted proportionally from the proceeds of the loan received by borrowers or paid on the borrowers behalf from

reinsurance paymen ts cover 95 of the cost of the claim plus certain administrative costs provided that overall reimbursements dont exceed 5 of the loans in repayment that are insured by the guaranty agency the reinsurance rate drops if the guarantor has default claims that are high compared to the loans in repayment if more than 5 of the guarantors loans in repayment are in default in any fiscal year the reim bursement rate drops to 85 and if default claims exceed 9 of loans in repayment status the reimbursement rate drops to 75 for lender of last resort loans the reinsurance rate is 100
