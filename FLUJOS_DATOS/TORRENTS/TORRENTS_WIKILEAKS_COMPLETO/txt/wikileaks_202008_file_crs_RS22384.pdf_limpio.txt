stateme nt of sen sununu we feel the provision in the conference report that require d the recipient of national security letter to disclose the name of their attorney to the fbi was punitive and might have the result of discouraging an individual from seeking legal adviceremoval of requirement to disclose identity of attorney sought to obtain legal advice regard ing section 215 order or an nsl the conference bill expressly clarifies that recipient of section 215 order or an nsl19 may disclose its existence to an attorney to obtain legal advice as well as to other persons approved by the fbi20 the recipient is not require d to inform the fbi or the authorized government agency of the intent to consult with an attorney to obtain legal assistance however upon the request of the fbi director or his designee or upon the request of the government agency authorized to issue the nsl the recipient must disclose to the fbi or the government agency the identity of the person to whom the disclosure will be or was made21 according to one of the sponsors of s 2271 this provision of the conference bill might have an unintended chilling effect on th individuals right to seek legal counsel regarding the section 215 order or the nsl22 section 4 of s 2271 amends fisa and the five statutes providing nsl authority to federal intelligence investigators to exempt explicitly from the identification disclosure requirement the name of the attorney sought to obtain legal advice with respect to the section 215 production order or nsl s 2271 achieves this exemption by omission in the case of section 215 order and by explicit language in the nsl statut as described below under the conference bills proposed 50 usc 1861d1 the recipient of section 215 order is prohibited from disclosing to an other person that the fbi has sought the tangible things described in the orde r except to the following individuals those persons necessary fo r compliance with the order b an attorney to obtain legal advice with respect to the order or c other persons as permitted by the fbi director or his designee s 2271 amends the conference bills proposed 50 usc 1861d2c to provide that the fbi director or his designee may require any person to disclose the identity of personshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22384crs5 23 proposed 18 usc 2709c4 the language us ed to describe this exception in proposed 18 usc 2709c4 is substantially similar to that used in the proposed amendments to the other nsl statutes 24 however library could still be subject to section 215 order under fisa for the production of tangible items such as loan records s 2271 does not carve out any exception for libraries under section 215 for more information on this issue see crs report rs21441 libraries and the

notably it omits b which effectively removes from the identity disclosure requirement attorneys sought for legal assistance section 4 of s 2271 also amends the five ns l statutes by adding language expressly exempting the identity of attorneys from the disclosure requirement established by the conference bill at the request of the director of the federal bureau of investigation or the designee of the director any person making or intending to make disclosure under this section shall identify to the director or such designee the person to whom such disclosure will be made or to whom such disclosure was made prior to the request except that nothing in this section shall require person to inform the director or such designee of the identity of an attorney to whom disclosure was made or will be made to obtain legal advice or legal assistance with respect to the request under subsection a23 nsls not applicable to libraries section 5 of s 2271 entitled privacy prot ections for library patrons addresses the concern that library could potentially be subject to an nsl issued under 18 usc 2709 to obtain certain transactional and subscr iber records pertaining to its patrons24 18 usc 2709 provides nsl authority to the department of justice to obtain certain transaction records from electronic communication service providers for counterintelligence purposes because libraries often offer patrons the ability to access the internet current law is unclear as to whether libraries might be considered electronic communication service providers for purpos of 18 usc 2709 s 2271 amends 18 usc 2709 by adding the following section library the services of which include access to the internet is not wire or electronic communication service provid er for purposes of this section unless the library is providing the services defined in section 251015 of this title25 according to one of the sponsors of the b ill this provision makes very clear that libraries operating in their traditional ro including the lending of books including making books available in digital form incl uding providing basic internet access are not subject to national security letters26 however if the library provides the services described in 18 usc 251015 which are electronic communication services then such library would still be subjecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22384crs6 27 17 usc 512 k1 28 large library affiliated with university fo r example may function in capacity similar to an isp and thus could be considered communica tions provider subject to nsl authority these libraries may offer their student s the ability to post materials on website servers operated by the library 29 see 152 c ong rec s1390 daily ed feb 16 2006 statement of sen sununu some have noted or may note that basic internet access gives library patrons the ability to send and receive email by for example accessing an internetbased email service but in that case it is the web site operator who is providing the communicati on service the internet communication service provider itself and not the library which is simply making available computer with access to the internet 30 see 152 c ong rec s1390 daily ed feb 16 2006 statement of sen durbin by way of comparison gas station that has pay phone isnt telephone company so library that has internet access where person can find an internet email service is not communications service provider therefore it would not fall unde r the purview of the nsl provision in 18 usc 2709 it is critically important distinctionto nsls 18 usc 251015 defines elect ronic communication rvice to mean any service that provides to users the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications yet this definition poten tially could include libraries that offer electronic mail access to their patrons depending on the meaning of the words italicized above there are few instances in federal law that explicitly provide definition of service provider for possible insight into th intent of the language used in 18 usc 251015 it may be useful to consult the digital millennium copyright act which defines service provider as follows27 the term service provider means an entity offering the transmission routing or providing of connections for digita l online communications between or among points specified by user of material of the users choosing without modification to the content of the material as sent or received b the term service provider means provider of online services or network access or the operator of facilities theref or and includes an entity described in subparagraph although the second of these two definitions is broadly worded and arguably could be used to encompass library that offers internet access to patrons another reasonable interpretation of the foregoing suggests that to be considered an electronic communication service provider under 18 usc 251015 lib rary must independently operate the means by which transmission routing and connection of digital communication occurs28 in contrast local county library likely has service contract with an internet service provider isp to furnish the library with the electronic communication service as many businesses and individuals do the fact that th library has set up computer with internet access for the use of its patrons probably does not by itself turn the library into communications service provider under this characterization the actual provider of internet access is the isp not the library29 therefore public library offering basic internet access would likely not be considered an electronic communication service provider at least for purposes of being an entity subject to the nsl provisions in 18 usc 270930
