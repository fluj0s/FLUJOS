systems cannot effectively check transliterated watchlisted nonwestern names this could allow terrorists to receive us visas or enter the united states if travel documents do not match the name check

intelligence agency directorate of intelligence alqaida railways high priority target ufouo 7 april 2004 comprehensive review of reporting has shed light on alqaidas strategic doctrine and its possible targets and methods for attacks inside the united states key theme that drives the groups operational doctrine is selecting targets that will have psychological and economic ripple effect in the united states ufouo reporting points to attacks on railways and subways as means to hurt the us economy and incite mass hysteria alqaida reportedly considered planning attacks against us railways after observing the economic impact of the 11 september attacks on the us airline industry gb7g20rail or subway terminals present many of the same attractions as airport terminalslarge crowds and the ability to move about freely and inconspicuously large terminalssuch as union station in washington dc and grand central station in new york cityoften are in key downtown locations magnifying the potential disruptive effects of an attack gb7g20trains and subways may also be attractive to alqaida because so many businesses in major urban areas especially in the northeast depend on these systems

attacks to circumvent enhanced weste rn security measures the group still tends to rely on operatives between the ages of 18 to 35 but may now place an added premium on finding suitable nonarab candidates or those with citizenship andor residency in targeted country although alqaida may believe using nonarab operatives would facilitate easier entry and movement within the united states the use of arab operativesespecially if these individuals are already present in the united statescannot be discounted ufouo on the basis of alqaidas established operational ties to north africa central and south asia afghanistan and pakistan and southeast asia the group may look to these regions in hopes of finding nonarab operative candidates taken alone the following ethnic backgrounds do not point to terrorists identities but when combined with other informationsuch as suspicious financial transactions andor travel patternsmay provide possible indication of terrorist preoperational activity gb7g20pakistanis and other south asians north africans especially moroccans but also algerians libyans or mauritanians are nationalities from which extremists could be tapped many south asians and north africans have lived in the united kingdom andor other european countries or in canada providing them western documentation and knowledge of the english languageattributes considered valuable by alqaida gb7g20malaysian and indonesian extremistsmany linked to the southeast asia terrorist group jemaah islamiyamay be considered suitable operatives for attacks inside the united states gb7g20alqaida networks in east africa especially in kenya and somalia remain strong and may provide suitable operatives for attacks gb7g20central asians particularly uzbeks affiliated with the extremist islamic movement of uzbekistan collaborate with alqaida these ties could spawn cooperation for us homeland attack plotting ufouo other possible profile characteristics ufouo alqaida traditionally favors using male operatives which would most likely be the case in usbased attack nonetheless extremists attitudes might be more liberal in north and east africa and the levant region where alqaida has supporters about using women operatives gb7g20moreover terrorist operatives might travel with wives or female relatives as means to lessen their operational profile ufouo finding operatives who already have an in inside the united states would be extremely important to alqaida in preparation for homeland strike for example alqaida app ears to emphasize finding candidates with citizenship or residency status in targeted country gb7g20familiarity with the us homeland and area where targets are located enables greater freedom of movement and access and makes operatives less

particularly this year in the runup to the us presidential election ufouo travel patterns and signatures ufouo looking back at major plotting efforts against the us homeland by alqaida operatives tended at least once to travel to south asia afghanistan and pakistan for consultations and training in several identified cases western operatives have been instructed to report their passports lost or stolena move most likely taken to conceal the operatives entry and exit into afghanistan and pakistan other signposts of possible preoperational terrorist activity are gb7g20individuals of interest who have traveled or show pattern of travel to south asia gb7g20unused visas in passports alqaida operatives might obtain visa from countries they perceive are prounited statessuch as australia and the united kingdomto present themselves as better candidate to us consular officers gb7g20presence of forged nonus stamps in suspect passports some terrorists attempt to counter the fresh look of newly issued passport by placing false stamps in them to create fictitious travel history ufouo following the money ufouo although the funding methods alqaida is most likely to use in support of us homeland strike are largely dependent on the scope of the planned attack the following indicators may assist in identifying avenues worthy of further investigation gb7g20single large transfers into newly opened bank accounts gb7g20individuals of interest holding debit cards for bank accounts held overseas use of these cards would eliminate the need to answer required questions that often times accompany wire transfers and also require little interaction with banking and other us government authorities gb7g20individuals of interest who pay cash for high priced ticket items for example international and domestic airfare training opportunities purchases or lease for extended periods of time of large vehicles or trucksespecially if there is difficulty explaining why and from where the money for that purpose came gb7g20large amounts of cash carried in at us ports of entry and border crossings alqaida operativespossibly fearing heightened banking regulations involving electronic

terrorist plans and operations against us interests please treat this information as law enforcement sensitive material ufouo alqaida leaders and operational planners have long viewed the southwest border as an access route for operatives infiltrating the united states although we have evidence that indicates alqaida operatives have made successful forays into the united states via this method we remain concerned that the group is seeking to surreptitiously exploit and traverse the vulnerable border and known smuggling networksparticularly to conduct highimpact attacks during symbolic time frames such as the anniversary of 11 september or the november 2004 elections ufouo border seen as vulnerable ufouo alqaida leaders including those involved in us operations have long viewed the southern border as an exploitable vulnerability gb7g20alqaida reportedly has concluded that it is easy to move people across the border and that drug smugglers would know the best routes gb7g20cinematic films the internet and other media sources have contributed to alqaidas knowledge on border vulnerabilities which some members believe is similar to border crossing posts in south asia several alqaida leaders believe operatives can pay their way into the united states through mexico ufouo some alqaida members believe that illegal versus legal entry from mexico into the united states is more advantageous for operational security reasons gb7g20legal entry was assessed to be risky because us officials kept files on individualseven us citizensinvolved in extremist activities in addition us watchlisting efforts can be circumvented if an operative transits the border illegally uf ouo nonmexicans difficult to intercept ufouo many alien smuggling networks that facilitate the movement of nonmexicans have established links to muslim communities in mexico making them attractive to alqaida nonmexicans often are more difficult to intercept because they typically pay high end smugglers large sum of money to efficiently assist them across the border rather than haphazardly traverse it on their own gb7g20penetration and disruption of these networks might provide critical information on individuals paying them to cross the border ufouo border security challenges ufouo significant strides against smuggling networks have been made but the huge number of legal and illegal border crossings per day remain challenge gb7g20the total number of individuals crossing legally into the united states from mexico by car bus and foot was more than 250 million in 2002 according to us department of transportation statistics the san ysidro californiatijuana mexico port of entry is the largest landcrossing border in the world with more than 45 million persons crossing in 2002

directorate of intelligence primer of alqaidas modus operandi and possible attack signatures ufouo 28 july 2004 the following information should not be considered the sole indicators of alqaidas attack planning since signatures may vary with planners targets and methodology moreover alqaida is known for its operational creativity and flexibility in dealing with shifting security environments please treat this information as law enforcement sensitive material ufouo alqaida is planning to attack inside the united states in the coming months although there are specific details on the targets operatives or methods of attack review of the groups strategic targeting doctrine provides insights into the groups past criteria for target choi ces in the united states and general operating style for usbased attacks ufouo targets and methods of an attack ufouo the group is most likely to select political military andor economic targets based on the following three criteria gb7g20targets that are recognized symbols of us life and power especially in the muslim world gb7g20targets that will result in mass casualties and spread fear and panic hurting us morale gb7g20targets whose destruction will negatively impact the us economy ufouo potential targets that meet these key criteria can be hard targets such as key us government buildings andor military bases or soft targets such as bridges commercial buildings andor mass transit systems gb7g20near simultaneous multiple attacks against critical us infrastructuresuch as mass transit systems andor key energy sector facilitieswould most likely meet all three targeting goals gb7g20similarly attacks in the host cities for the democratic and republican party conventions or presidential debates also have the potential to meet these key criteria ufouo review of alqaidas modus operandi suggests the methods of attack will ve ry likely be dictated by target selection alqaida operatives are most likely to opt for an attack method that has the highest probability of success having made this determination based on security around given target gb7g20alqaida leadership encourages senior plotters and operatives to brainstorm and propose ideas based on previous operations available operatives and open source reports the groups use of commercial aircraft as missiles the use of shoes to conceal explosives and th use of vehicleborne improvised explosive devices vbieds disguised as security vehicles are examples of the innovative methodologies alqaida has applied to given targets and security situations gb7g20although alqaida leadership generally has played central role in target selection in us homeland plotting deployed field plannersparticularly post11 september 2001may have more autonomy to pick and execute attacks against selected targets already pproved by top leaders ufouo this report was prepared by the dci counterterrorist centers office of terrorism analysis comments and queries are welcome and may be

the forwarddeployed leaders of given operationmost likely knowledgeable of all facets of the operation including the intended targets timing and methods of attack gb7g20these are the muhammad attas of the plot atta was pilot and the senior field coordinator of the 11 september 2001 attacks gb7g20ideally these operatives would have arrived at least year before the planned attack and may not travel with other members of the team gb7g20these operatives may have autonomy to change both targets and timing of the operation if the situation on the ground dictates gb7g20should field planners be known to us government agenciesa risk that qaida leaders might be willing to accept to ensure the necessary skills and experiencethe timely collection and reporting of suspect individuals names aliases and other contact information may help in disrupting planned terrorist attack ufouo operational foot soldiers ufouo due to heightened security since 11 september 2001 the muscle of given operation may now be chosen by field planners if s ecure communication or access to senior leadership is not available gb7g20to safe guard the operation attack operatives would most likely be told only as much as needed about terrorist operation and may not know exact details until the moment of execution gb7g20depending on the operation these operatives may not enter the target country until it is absolutely necessary to decrease chances of compromise in addition muscle operativeswhile possibly traveling together in small groupswould most likely travel in staggered fashion to avoid suspicious travel patterns and other activity that could raise their profile or the risk that large sets of operatives could be detained at one time ufouo expected behavior of operatives ufouo although operatives are expected to behave in certain ways to reduce their profile and avoid drawing the attention of authorities they can make mistakes and may not adhere to strict operational instructions gb7g20operatives are told to live as close to their cover as possible for example students should enroll in classes and tourists should have maps brochures hotel bills and other items consistent with their selected cover gb7g20operatives should not live near the target due to security precautions and sh ould avoid contact with anyone including arabs and muslims outside their immediate operational group gb7g20operatives are instructed to pray quietly at home vice openly at public gathering and should generally downplay their religion gb7g20to further minimize contact with broad range of individuals operatives are instructed to only acquire jobs if appropriate for cover ufouo timing of the attack ufouo determining the precise day or time of attack is extremely difficult since the field planners and operatives will very likely have autonomy to select the optimum time gb7g20external factors beyond the control of leadership or ground operatives including weather andor increased security postures of designated targets may alter decisions in the final stages gb7g20although alqaida leaders may prefer to time attacks with anniversary dates of previous attacks or unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouo 3other symbolic occasions the single most important factor in executing the attack appears to be operational readiness and probability of success regardless of the date ufouo procuring weapons ufouo the following signatures are based on the possibility that alqaida may use vbieds in an attack gb7g20ideally explosives and precursors would be acquired in nonalerting manner month or more in advance which would allow more flexibility in choosing the timing of the attack gb7g20some likely choices such as ammonium nitrate mixtures however absorb moisture and degrade if mixed too far in advance gb7g20in addition vehicle bombs are usually assembled just before the attack for security reasons gb7g20the explosives or precursors should be purchased in small quantities from the lowest source of distribution possible in order to limit possible alerting tipoffs to law enforcement authorities gb7g20the vehicles used in an attack should be purchased weeks to months before the actual attack date to test its functionality and load capacity gb7g20stealing vehicle to be used in an attack is discouraged because of the unnecessary risk of exposure in addition buying allows more control over the situation and the vehicles leaving limited trail for law enforcement to follow gb7g20operatives most likely would rely on private enclosed space to build vbiedsincluding garages storage units andor rented or abandoned warehouses ufouo unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouo central intelligence agency directorate of intelligence alqaida eyeing vehicular bombs for us homeland attacks ufouo 24 august 2004 the following information should not be considered the sole method of alqaida attack planning since the group is known for its operational creativity and flexibility with shifting security environments please treat this information as law enforcement sensitive material ufouo reporting during the last few months has indicated alqaidas intent to conduct largescale attacks against the us homeland ahead of the presidential election in 2004 the plan may involve using vehicle borne improvised explosive devices vbieds alqaida has long and successful history of using vbieds in attacks against us and western targets gb7g20over the past year and half alqaida and associated groups in four separate geographic regions have used largescale vehicular bombs to attack range of targets overseas including foreign housing compounds in saudi arabia the british consulate jewish synagogues and western businesses in turkey and nightclubs and hotels in indonesia and kenya ufouo proven skill and tactics ufouo methods used in such attacks and disrupted plots underscore the groups experience in employing explosiveladen vehicles trademark of the group is an attack incorporating multiple vehicles combined with an armed assault to tackle somewhat protected structures gb7g20each of the three attacks in riyadh in may 2003 drew on the use of two vehiclesone carrying armed assailants to gain entrance to the compound followed by second containing bomb for use inside the compound all three attacks occurred within fifteen minutes of one another ufouo alqaida also may combine high explosives with other combustible or toxic material to boost the damage from vbied attacks alqaida operatives had previously pursued using trucks carrying hazardous material or fuel for such attacks in the united states gb7g20detained alqaida operative iyman faris who had ties to khalid shaykh muhammad was licensed to transport hazardous materials within the united states ufouo highvalue targets still accessible ufouo alqaida will likely select targets that it judges will have significant physical and psychological impact if attacked plotters may turn to alternative targets if they judge the primary targets too difficult to strike gb7g20attacking symbols of us power especially key us government buildings in washington dc and economic centers such as wall streetwith multiple vbieds would still have significant psychological and economic impact even if physical damage were minimal gb7g20alqaida has long considered attacks against major infrastructure such as bridges ports airports and tunnels in part because of the difficulty in protecting them alqaidas disrupted millennium plot targeted the angeles airport with vbieds ufouo other soft targets such as banks shopping malls major us companies and tall buildings in major cities are at risk of vbied attacks large body of reporting since 2001 suggests alqaida continues to view soft targets as prime alternatives to more hardened targets hitting number of such structures simultaneously could have the same cumulative impact as attacking single highprofile target ufouo this report

2004 surveillance is critically important part of alqaidas attack planning and strategic targeting doctrine alqaida relies on preoperational surveillance to conceptualize an attack driving the selection of targets appropriate operatives and the mode of attack gb7g20an understanding of alqaidas surveillance tactics helps us to identify set of specific behaviorsindicators that could help the law enforcement and intelligence communities more easily detect such activities ufouo security assessment key to target selection ufouo in assessing possible targets alqaida looks intently at security measures and vulnerabilities gb7g20alqaida might look for targets that would appear to offer the greatest probability for successful attackbased on an assessment of the targets security leveleven if hitting such target would result in lower number of casualties gb7g20for example alqaida might seek multiple small attacks instead of larger sensational attacks ufouo reliance on surveillance tradecraft ufouo alqaida employs securityconscious surveillance methodology operatives are instructed to conduct surveillance using the following methods gb7g20alqaida operatives may use various static and mobile surveillance techniques to acquire the pertinent information without drawing attention surveillants are expected to be familiar with the physical layout of the target buildings local security measures the area around the target surrounding streets and buildings and vehicular and pedestrian traffic levels during rush hour and off peak hours gb7g20alqaida operatives may use disguises to evade detectionthis may include wearing cross ordering alcohol or being accompanied by women gb7g20operatives are taught to be comfortable functioning in an unfamiliar urban environment gb7g20alqaida operatives might test the security response and reaction time at target sitesthis might include leaving baggage unattended parking cars in conspicuous places or possibly carrying bags of suspiciouslooking material through security checkpoints to assess the response time of target security personnel ufouo unknowns timing and team composition ufouo although alqaida relies on comprehensive surveillance reports to determine the final target timing and method of an attack there is required time frame for casing targetsuggesting that surveillance can be conducted during period of days months or even years gb7g20although the duration nature and frequency of surveillance most likely depends on the target and its surrounding environment we assess that surveillance of potential targets in the united states would most likely start up to year in advance of an attack gb7g20if potential target has enhanced security operatives might choose to case the target only few times ufouo this report was prepared by the dci counterterrorist centers office of terrorism analysis comments and queries are welcome and may be directed to the chief alqaida plans and organization

although we have specific intelligence to indi cate the target timing or method of the attack alqaida may seek to employ its surveillance tactics in the runup to the attack gb7g20consistent with alqaidas determination to evade security measures after 11 september we assess the group is looking to use nontraditional operatives to conduct future operationsthis includes operatives who might resemble local residents or tourists commonly seen in the target area who might speak the local dialect and who might easily adapt to cover legend as tourist or student ufouo given its critical role in alqaidas planning cycle surveillanceif detectedwould serve as an indicator of an upcoming attack alqaida operatives have been taught to case targets at every phase of the planning cyclesuggesting multiple opportunities to detect preoperational activity gb7g20the importance that alqaida places on weak security in determining its final target selection suggests that proactive and variable security countermeasures at suspected targets may at least interrupt the attack planning ufouo nevertheless operatives have been taught to conduct target casings multiple times before an attack making it difficult to determine whether plot is in the preliminary or final stages gb7g20we assess that if alqaida decided to abort an operation inside the united states operatives would likely turn over their targeting studies to new operatives if the target remained viable ufouo
