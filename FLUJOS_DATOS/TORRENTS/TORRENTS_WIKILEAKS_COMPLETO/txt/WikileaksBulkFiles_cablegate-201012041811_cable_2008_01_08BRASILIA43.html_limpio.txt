1664 classified by deputy chief of mission phil chicola for reasons 14 b nd d 1 snf summary the government of brazil remains highly sensitive to public claims suggesting that terrorist or extremist organizations have presence or are undertaking activities in brazila sensitivity that appears to be the rise and is resulting in more than symbolic reactions at an operational level and away from the public spotlight however the gob is cooperative partner in countering terrorism and terroristrelated activities even though the argentinabrazilparaguay triborder area tba exclusively dominates headlines the primary counterterrorism concern for both brazilian officials and the us mission in brazil is the presence and activities of individuals with links to terrorismparticularly several suspected sunni extremists and some individuals linked to hizballahin sao paulo and other areas of southern brazil to lesser extent the tba remains concern primarily for the potential that terrorists may exploit conditions thereincluding lax border controls smuggling drug trafficking easy access to false documents and weapons movement of pirated goods uncontrolled cash flowsto raise funds or arrange logistics for operations post will focus over the coming year on keeping the higher levels of the brazilian government engaged politically and diplomatically on ct objectives and on seeking to ensure that they do not undermine the productive partnerships at the operational level end summary policylevel sensitivities 2 snf the brazilian government is cooperative partner in countering terrorism and terroristrelated activity in brazilto include investigating potential terrorism financing document forgery networks and other illicit activitythat could contribute to the facilitation of attacks in the region or elsewhere nonetheless the highest levels of the brazilian government particularly the ministry of foreign relations are extremely sensitive to any public claims that terrorists have presence in brazilwhether to raise funds arrange logistics or even transit through the countryand will vigorously reject any statements implying otherwise this sensitivity results in part from their fear of stigmatizing the large muslim community of brazil estimated but unconfirmed by some sources at over 1 million or prejudicing the areas image as tourist destination it is also public posture designed to avoid being too closely linked to what is seen as the uss overly aggressive war on terrorism this sensitivity manifests itself in various symbolic and concrete ways c the gob participates reluctantly in the 3 1 mechanism on security in the triborder area which annually gathers diplomatic law enforcement and intelligence representatives of the three triborder tba countries together with the us to deliberate strategies to deter host of transnational criminal activities that could be exploited by potential terrorists to facilitate attacks at the conferences the brazilian delegations often decry statements made by us officials claiming that the tba is hotbed of terrorist activity and challenge us participants to present the evidence on which us officials base those statements itamaraty officials repeatedly question the value of this fourway cooperation insisting that bilateral concerns should be addressed bilaterally reftel u the gob refuses to legally or even rhetorically label usdesignated terrorist groups such as hamas hizballah or the farc as terrorist groupsthe former two being considered by brazil as legitimate political parties as result their threshold for accepting evidence of terrorism financing brasilia 00000043 002 of 004 activity in the region at least publicly is very high and any information indicating that individuals in the tba send funds to the groups in lebanon in their view does not necessarily constitute an activity supporting terrorism u at the diplomatic level the gob has twice refused to officially endorse argentinas claims that the perpetrators of the 1994 terrorism attack in buenos aires may have received support from individuals in the tba by abstaining from voting in favor of issuing interpol capture notices for the 5 iranian and 1 lebanese national suspected of involvement in the attack u two key ctrelated legislative initiatives continue to languish neither the antiterrorism nor the antimoney laundering legislation has been introduced to congress despite both being ready for more than year if passed the bills would establish the crime of terrorism and associated activities and would facilitate greater law enforcement access to financial and banking records during investigations criminalize illicit enrichment allow administrative freezing of assets and facilitate prosecutions of money laundering cases by amending the legal definition of money laundering and making it an autonomous offense combined with operational cooperation 3 snf despite negative rhetoric in itamaraty and at higher levels of the gob brazilian law enforcement and intelligence agenciesprincipally the federal police customs the brazilian intelligence agency abin and othersare aware of the potential threat from terrorists exploiting the favorable conditions existing in brazil to operate and actively track and monitor suspected terrorist activity and follow all leads passed to them the federal police will often arrest individuals with links to terrorism but will charge them on variety of nonterrorism related crimes to avoid calling attention of the media and the higher levels of the government over the past year the federal police has arrested various individuals engaged in suspected terrorism financing activity but have based their arrests on narcotics and customs charges 4 u brazil is capable of monitoring domestic financial operations and effectively utilizes its financial intelligence unit the financial activities oversight council coaf to identify possible funding sources for terrorist groups the gob has carried out name checks for persons and entities on the unscr 1267 and 1373 terror finance lists but has so far not found any assets accounts or property in the names of persons or entities on the terrorfinance lists brazil also established national strategy to combat money laundering encla and is creating data base called the electronic declaration of cash carriage edpv which will assist in monitoring individuals who transfer funds abroad although the system is prototype and is still being tested brazilian law enforcement officials are encouraged by initial results primary concern individuals linked to terrorism in southern brazil 5 snf the primary counterterrorism concern for both brazilian officials and the us mission in brazil is the presence and activities of individuals with links to terrorismparticularly several suspected sunni extremists and some individuals linked to hizballahin sao paulo and other areas of southern brazil the federal police and to lesser extent abin monitor the activities of these suspected extremists who may be tied to terrorist groups abroad and brasilia 00000043 003 of 004 share this information with their us counterparts 6 snf brazilian law enforcement officials actively monitor the presence of several suspected sunni extremists with possible ties to terrorist groups abroad who may be capable of lending logistical supportthrough financing safehaven false travel documents for terrorist attacks in the region or abroad in 2007 the federal police arrested potential sunni extremist terrorist facilitator operating primarily in santa catarina state for failure to declare funds entering the country and is in the process of deporting him also in 2007 brazilian federal police took down rio janeirobased false document ring that was supplying falsified brazilian documents to nonbrazilians among them suspected international drug traffickers secondary concern argentinabrazilparaguay triborder area 7 snf to lesser extent the tba remains concern for the us mission and brazilian counterparts primarily for the potential that terrorists may exploit the favorable conditions therelax border controls smuggling drug trafficking easy access to false documents and weapons movement of pirated goods uncontrolled cash flowsto raise funds or arrange logistics for operations while there are some individuals suspected of having links to hizballah and hamas there is little evidence these groups have an operational terrorist presence in the region according to brazilian security service sources the muslim presence in foz do iguacu represents very small percentage of the muslim population in brazil and even those who provide some financial support to the groups have little or connection to them the gob pursues ct investigations in the tba and shares the results of their investigations but their principal concern remains the array of other transnational criminal activity that takes place in the region the area is major entry point for drug traffickers into brazil in addition it is focus of concern for brazil in other areas such as arms trafficking smuggling of pirated and counterfeit goods as well as money laundering and terrorist financing 8 snf to cover this range of transnational criminal activity the gobs police and intelligence services have an extensive presence in the region and liaison relationships with argentine paraguayan and other national intelligence services including usg agencies furthermore the gob has attempted to institutionalize some of this crossborder cooperation although with mixed success for example brazilian customs completed new inspection station at the friendship bridge in the tba this should enable the gob to intensify its crack down on contraband crossing the bridge though law enforcement officials expect that traffickers will respond to the tough controls by trying to move their goods clandestinely across the border elsewhere via boat brazil also conducts maritime patrols on their side of the itaipu lake to deter smuggling activity although resource constraints and lack of equipment hampers their effectiveness the longstanding goal of conducting joint patrols with the paraguayans remains elusive finally in order to more effectively combat transborder criminal organizations with its neighbors brazil established joint intelligence center jic in the tba but staffing issues have hampered its operations and it is not apparent that the gob has pushed the other countries too vigorously to send representatives comment 9 snf operational elements of the various brazilian security and law enforcement agencies understand that the brasilia 00000043 004 of 004 full scope of the problem goes beyond the tba and is almost certainly more significant in sao paulo and other parts of brazil however the constant barrage of terrorismrelated media coverage regarding the tba tends to heighten gob sensitivities and particularly those of itamaraty increasing their reluctance to countenance any claims that terrorists could possibly have presence in any part of brazil while this sensitivity generally manifests itself in nothing more than public rebukes of declarations by us officials and sniping during meetings by itamaraty officials it does occasionally result in more than symbolic reactions by the gob brazils amia abstention at interpol reversal on ct legislation and inflexibility on 3 1 all represent concrete challenges to local law enforcement officials and regional partners in advancing ct cooperation post will focus over the coming year on keeping the higher levels of the brazilian government engaged politically and diplomatically on this issue and on seeking to ensure that they do not undermine the work being done at the operational level end comment sobel 20080108
