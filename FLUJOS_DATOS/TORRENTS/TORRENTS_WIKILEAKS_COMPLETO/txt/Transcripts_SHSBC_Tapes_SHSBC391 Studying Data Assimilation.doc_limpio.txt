studying data assimilation lecture given on 9 july 1964 how are you today audience fine whats the date audience nine july nine july nine july ad 14 all right now what are you weakest in female voice auditing auditing yeah frankly i havent anything to talk to you about because youre all doing so well its i who am lagging you see but ive given you quite few lectures about study and how to get through it and how to do this and how to do that and theres very little that can be added to what i have told you but i better add that very little in trying to in trying to assimilate piece of information these are the points to watch and these are the points that trip you nomenclature nomenclature what does word mean and thats what trips you basically because then you cannot read sentence with that word in it and know what the sentence says so nomenclature is major stumbling block in any study now there are vast well workedup glossaries in scientology but there is glossary on class vi material and part of nomenclature is the recognition of what the definition is its one thing just to have the definition and its another thing to have an idea of what the definition means now you get yourself thing like gpm all right lets take that as nomenclature gpm means goals problem mass unless you combine such thing with an observation and work on the clay table and so forth even the nomenclature is relatively meaningless it is thing in other words there is something called gpm its not an idea it is gpm now there are theres one or two pcs around not necessarily in the course who are stumbling all over the place on gpm because they are in disagreement with that piece of nomenclature and they are saying well it doesnt have mass its just rons idea that it has mass see and it doesnt have mass so therefore of course there is such thing as gpm well now trying to audit somebody on something of which there is such thing as is just little bit difficult now if youre running gpms correctly the mass simply expresses itself as heat and pressure it does not express itself as visio you never see it unless youve made mistake when youve made mistake youll see it you get an end word in the wrong situation and you can see this long parade of mass going out there well there must be something wrong with it to see the mass so here is the oddity about this the gpm its true its goalsmatched items one against the other and very matched and held in midair from which it gets problem although that isnt too good word because problem is an end word also and mass is also an end word so that nomenclature is adapted to the subject at time when not all is known about it so it can be described and worked with dont you see now we move on little bit further and we find out there probably could have been better nomenclature but by this time everybody knows this as this and you would get total catastrophe if you went and shifted the thing and we cant go on referring to it as the thing so we go on calling it gpm well now of course gpm means goals problem mass but thats not important its not important what the g means or the p means or the m means this is symbol that stands for something well what is this thing so if youre simply content to say well gpm is thing and it has this form and construction and work with it on clay table all of sudden you begin to understand what it is now youre in never never land that has never been explored there is language to adequately represent any of these parts of the mind if you used any terminology that is used by the psychiatrist you dont know what youre getting into you frankly have clue what youre getting into because hes wayout man and when he uses word to describe something there may be innuendoes in relationship to that word that would if we then used it would impart totally incorrect zone or area and would make somebody think he knew what you were talking about when you hadnt he hadnt clue what you were talking about so youve crossed up your terminology with some other field that meant something else well the reason you cant cross it up it has different purpose that other field it has different target and it has an entirely different basis of operation their well their purpose is to make people quiet to give you how wildly different this is you want to get upset when you see very quiet pc man his idea of treatment is based on the common denominator as far as hes concerned that men are animals that rose spontaneously from sea of ammonia and he wots not of and all thinking is done by the brain and so forth so this is different completely different zone or area and it has not produced results so we neednt pay any attention to it we dont care how loudly somebody beats the drum and says this is authority those people are the authorities who can get the results and those are the authorities painter is somebody who can paint picture an authority on painting has been hobsonjobsoned over into somebody who can criticize picture well anybody can criticize picture so i guess any child then is an authority on painting so that the thing doesnt hold up when you take it from critical viewpoint you see an authority is the fellow who can do it and the world in apathy and failure driving out in various lines and directions where they have been unable to do anything have elected authorities on subjects that cant do them so therefore you would become all crossed up with fields that have failed and that would enter all by itself an ingredient of failure into scientology so we have to leave their technology alone we have to leave their nomenclature strictly alone we cannot talk about ids and egos we cant really talk about the unconscious which by the way is another end word in gpms we cant discuss in other words what we are doing in terms of what they were doing because they didnt do anything and we would immediately come cropper and we would be in very bad shape indeed so we have to have technology named in certain way as to convey meaning and we are the people who can get results in the field of the mind so therefore we are the authorities so therefore we dont have to pay any attention to anybody else who sets himself up an authority because any raving madman could go down here at the crossroads and say i know all about grapes see i am the worlds greatest authority on grapes and any raving madman could do this you see he could just go on screaming i am the worlds greatest authority on grapes well he could get few other madmen who would come around and say youre the worlds greatest authority on grapes nobody ever would think of asking this madman perhaps the question have you ever eaten grape seen grape raised grape or done anything with grape and of course if the answers were all to those questions then of course it would be quite obvious that he was raving madman and thats the psychiatrist you see he has never seen mind he never created one he never changed one and he never brought about any results in this particular field and the only thing he can brag about is being bit destructive on the subject and hes screaming that hes an authority so therefore somehow or another you should borrow his nomenclature now any one of you sooner or later is going to run into this down at some crossroads why dont you use standard terminology well the answer to it is whose standard terminology it would have to be the terminology of person who could produce result before it could be said to be even terminology so man has had not much understanding of this particular field and has even gone into an inversion where he has elected to have the nomenclature of the field standardized by people who know nothing about it now thats wildest inversion that anybody could ever dream of not only is there terminology but there is great deal of false terminology that terminology is false and you start to lead down that line youre going to be in trouble somebodys going to say to you sooner or later why dont you use standard nomenclature why dont you do this and why dont you do that well my rebuttal on it of course is always very savage when somebody starts in on like this i have idea that theyre trying to be helpful i never make that mistake so i just cut them up and serve them for dinner and its something on this particular particular line i would answer well why havent you developed anything that could be used so doctor spinbin is standing there well why dont you use standard terminology so that somebody can understand you why the hell havent you invented any what do you mean well why dont you know something about the mind what do you stand around being such fake for well really i have degree i know that that degree doesnt mean anything take one of these patients out of one of these rooms that youve got down here bring him out here and heal him i want to see it well you cant do anything like that therefore youre fake to hell with you this is my idea of polite conversation with one of those guys i hate fakes and its interesting that the only mud they can throw at us is that were somehow fakes see the overt doth speak loudly in accusation shakespeare rewritten now therefore you cant help but have trouble with terminology nomenclature ive had trouble with it dont think i havent how do i dream up some word that will describe something that can be found can be examined and does exist that will not conflict with some other school of nomenclature which has failed how do i move into that perimeter oh we could probably do much better job but part of the trouble is you you accept certain lines and start using them in your common communication and then the last thing in the world that i could do is pull them away from you and say well actually better word is soandso what little scientology terminology you know is now dead and nonexistent were going to substitute brandnew terminology and you would be upset right so terminology has to deal with this factor of evolution in use we not only have evolved it and theyve wobbled little bit on their meanings occasionally but then they get into use and they get fixed on the printed page they get into bulletins and they get into your certificates and so forth certify an hca well hes supposed to know what reactive mind is great so the next day were going to call it something else weve immediately wiped out part of his education havent we and weve made it hard for him to communicate with anybody who is trained later if we want dissonance why were going to get it in very large cacophony if we go knocking apart the terminology we have developed so we have to safeguard the terminology weve developed so therefore when we learn more about the subject you see the word may become unreal but were still using it so the only thing we can do is actually elect those things which are the most important in the mind and keep that terminology as standard as possible first try to evolve it as cleverly as possible so that it wont conflict first try to evolve it cleverly so it wont conflict and bring about misunderstanding in some older activity and then weve got to carry it forward as standardized item and then not go changing it all over the place just about the time everybody learns what it is so theres certain necessity here to maintain constant on nomenclature and terminology and the word gpm will never never be changed its in too much too long too often dont you see and even though goals end word problem end word mass end word but it becomes just gpm well it could become xyz it wouldnt matter much now another responsibility is not develop too many of them not to not to go whole hog on the subject not to try to name everything in sight some new peculiar name that nobody would ever get around the end of the vocabulary of scientology is probably about 472 major words which is small enough technical vocabulary the medical vocabulary is something on the order of 20 to 40 thousand somewhere in that range of very peculiar words that dont mean thing so your task in learning scientologese is relatively short relatively brief compared to other technical fields now you could complain about any technical field on the subject of its nomenclature and its nomenclature is just very often five times as silly if you look at it that way as scientology is inapplicable some of these specialized fields are really marvelous but if you have bent for it if you have knack for it and are amused by these nomenclatures and terminologies and special languages you might say you can have lot of fun with some of these i know i recently have been hobnobbing in the world of the circus well fortunately i know little of the circus terminology but from an american circus viewpoint and i dont know that this holds good in the english circus you see well you darent use ill show you now the upper class of terminologies theyre all snob these languages are all snob languages including scientology see the boy that comes out of his hca class you see and he throws off couple of words theres two or three who understand what hes talking about and so forth and they chinchin together see they its like the lodge has just passed the password see other people stand around with their jaws dropped and say they are listening to the upper elite well to that degree they are you see somebody has superior understanding but this is signal system and actually i couldnt take that away from the subject if i had to if i didnt invent it you would give you in the circus world if you use carnival the carnival you see is pretty downscale to the circus carnival is almost beneath contempt these things are quite definitely fixed on the social strata so you darent use carnival terminology of which i know of about four or five hundred words in carnivalese you darent use that in referring to the same identical objects and actions in the circus world and the circus world has maybe seveneight hundred thousand words you see for these same things its youve seen the same thing there you run into it in low dutch and high dutch in languages and so on so you have to be very careful about some of these but quite the reverse you can tell real organist this is in the world of music you can tell great concert pianist by the awe with which he speaks the word steinway and with which he speaks of his instrument and with which he speaks of his scores and so on you can tell him he acts the part of snob in his longtailed coat and his flowing gestures and his poseurs with his hands over the keyboard and all that sort of thing you know this boy for what he is you see he is classical pianist classical concert pianist now his terminology is quite staggering if he and symphony orchestra conductor were to start conversation in your immediate vicinity you would be snowballed youd never know that many musical terms taken into or out of italian and other and german and that sort of thing could exist and it would frankly be over the head of most of the very men in the symphony orchestra they would say god listen to that you know but the field of the organ does complete reverse now an organ is an instrument which piano is not an organ is percussion instrument only to the degree that you turn on percussion key and beyond that you can get music out of it but piano of course is solely and only percussion instrument this is according to modern classification see they classify it as percussion instrument well its pretty trick percussion instrument and you have to be very virtuosity on it but an organ will also you can throw key on an organ and make it sound like piano you can also make it sound like clavichord you can make it sound like almost anything and ive been hobnobbing recently with pro organists real pros you know theater organists circus organists guys like this you know and i actually my hairs been standing on end these boys rank in their field just as high as the concert pianist ranks in his field in fact bit higher because youve got to grow youve got to be like vishnu before you can play an organ you know eight arms and their terminology would absolutely bowl you over theres two fields of terminology and when you get to be real pro in the field of the organ where youre an organ designer as well as performer you know real upscale you actually shift gears on terminology and the organ terminology with which youre familiar is the organ terminology which is referred to by the musician the normal musician but when you go up scale you go into new field of terminology so theres two fields of terminology in the field of the organ and the real pro and the real snob in that particular field does volteviscomplete voltevis when he leaves the field of mere music into the field of playing an organ and designing them second we get into that field were in another pasture it doesnt even look or smell the same thing and that is so rarefied that when i first heard those boys talking and so forth i wotnotted anything they were saying you know it was just like listening to the hottentots jabbering about the next feast of roebuck i didnt have clue well i finally got hep to it and did bit of organ work and designing and that sort of thing and hobnobbing with these birds and i still dont have but small edge on their terminology and theyre always startling but ive gotten to point now where i know what theyre talking about you know well for instance the organist at saint pauls cathedral who probably would be probably the toptoptop amongst mere organists you see in england refers to the pedalboard see those are that board that you walk on you know well he calls that pedalboard when you get into the real snobs that is longer pedalboard thats firewood now the top organist at saint pauls undoubtedly refers to notes and pipes and footages and the real snob calls them noises theyre noises and he says this with complete complete straight face so the first time i heard this i thought they were gagging you see and every time ive heard one of these things ive made the repeated mistake which i am now beginning to recover from doing of laughing like mad you see thus displaying my great ignorance of the whole subject ive gotten so i can chatter back and forth on it now what the hell was it that i heard the other evening i think it was blackpool snarl this organ was capable of was capable of good solid blackpool snarl i think ive probably got the word snarl wrong but it was it was capable of making terrible clashing dissonance which would reverberate see and that was the way it was described see you catch up with it after while im getting there though im getting there im getting there im getting up to point where ive now developed something that i dont think theyve thought of yet with regard to firewood and i can play piece on firewood that they havent thought could be played on firewood so im practicing this very hard and the next time im going to get even im going to throw them but the point is as you enter into the inner sanctum of any profession you quite normally leave the purely snob language and get into slanguage lord knows what medical doctor calls tonsils while he is dining with other medical doctors see but he probably calls them something else his terminology shifts then from the very formal with enormous forced formality that almost has worship mixed up with it you see and shifts then as his familiarity increases with his subject into something that sounds more like slang and we have not bothered then to go through the country of pomposity to reach the world of slang weve just shortcircuited the whole thing this is true what i tell you about nomenclature as nomenclature really gets up amongst the knowing it is never serious it is very unserious subject the things which great electronic engineers that can whip you out rocket for the moonwiring circuit or connection probably what they call it is not what is taught in college you see theyve got this stuff and its rattledybang its almost jive talking moved upstairs into the profession you know its pretty wild well weve taken straight road since none existed we havent really developed secondary language were in our secondary language so that is another way that the thing has been narrowed down we could develop highly pompous formal nomenclature vocabulary perhaps of two or three thousand words and expect you all to learn it verbatim and be able to discuss it with great solemnity only to have you eventually evolve much less lengthy vocabulary which is in the field of slang weve taken the step at one jump so our language does not sound dignified see our nomenclature is not pompous since there was reason to enter this other extraneous step into it now anybody then who is talking to you about not using proper psychoanalytic nomenclature probably himself is the veriest tyro in the field of psychoanalysis see he hes just well if he graduated well and kept his nose clean hed become neophyte you know or he wouldnt be expressing this reverence for nomenclature because its symptomatic of the stage where you are simply memorizing without knowing after boy gets to know something and so forth he normally shortens his nomenclature quite markedly and rapidly and of course what an organist has to know who is up in the field of engineering and design and so forth this circus organist kit francis for instance hasnt any stop well actually the stops on his organ do not agree im sure with what it says on the stops and hes pulled out most of the stops hes thrown them away when he had the organ rebuilt he threw them away what he did was just get the noise combinations from the generators and he put stop on each variable noise combination of the generators knowing how they hooked up and he knows that if he throws bing bing and why hes got then these two noises come out of the generator they will combine and theyll sound in certain way hes setting it up by electronic sound electronic combinations of sound so hes even done away with all of the izzards and piccolos and diapasons and nothing says anything you know there it is its just as matter of fact the other day i saw him throw 64foot pipe together out of an upper scale there werent any even 32foot pipes in the thing but he just got couple of things that would then sound like they built down and he threw those in and the next thing you know why he had saint pauls cathedral going at very mad rate but that organ doesnt happen to have any such stops so he doesnt even refer to noises by their traditional names anymore see in other words when guy gets to know his business he generally throws away when he really knows his business he throws away the nomenclature he doesnt need he gives it the heave and he quite commonly amongst his brethren who are in the know and part of lodge develops shortcircuited slangtype nomenclature to describe what he is well knowing some of these things and so forth ive tried very hard to reduce the nomenclature of scientology as far as possible and keep it only in the realm of slang where it would have evolved to anyhow and that would save you lot of trouble but if you went back over the years and found the name of everything that had been named you would probably arrive with much larger vocabulary than 472 but lot of those things have been given the heave but lot of oldtime auditors would still know what they were you talk about dedex most any johnnycomelately would look at you with his eyes whats that you know well actually it was dedex thats what it was now the dependence of knowledge upon nomenclature is extraordinary and as matter of fact almost never appreciated by teachers or students they are trying to talk and use language they dont know and this can get so bad that they think the subject is incomprehensible or that they are incapable of understanding it when as matter of fact this is not what is wrong at all its just that they havent grasped the meaning of some of these symbols that are being used to designate and they havent got an instantaneous grasp of these meanings theyve got fumble grasp of them that is if they thought for while they might possibly be able to remember what an engram is see now thats the grasp of it so they read sentence and it says of course there may be an engram in the middle of the gpm thats not necessarily true but its certainly true of implant gpm and they have to think there might be an engram an engram an engram i dont quite know quite what that means so ill just learn this much of it there might be something in the middle of gpm and they go on into the next paragraph and this has made an impression on them that theres something they dont know about gpm and thats what carries on into the next paragraph and as they go on studying past these points of uncomprehended nomenclature they begin to stack up an opinion that they dont know about it and it isnt it that they dont know about to get persistent thing you see youd have to have lie and the lie is that it isnt the subject they are having trouble with it is simply the nomenclature they are having trouble with they dont know about the nomenclature so they however wind up with an opinion that they dont know the subject or that there is something very incomprehensible about this subject it isnt the subject at all they just dont know their nomenclature now it may start back someplace in hca see or hpa class and one day why somebody jumped up and he said well thats lock and the individual you know he said well you see thats not important because its just lock you see and the person says just lockalocklocklock whats lock and then he was interrupted before he could think the thought through and remember what lock was so this in actual fact stays there as little basic incomprehension of nomenclature and thatll hang up on the track and he will develop an automatic comm lag around this word lock hell get up to point where hes reading sentence here at saint hill and it says you want to check this out because it might be just lock and again that hunted feeling comes over him you see and now he thinks he doesnt know much about checkouts because he will misassign the other being out of sight so his opinion now is that he doesnt know much about checkouts he didnt know word in sentence discussing checkouts you see how important nomenclature is but comprehension of the nomenclature which is used is primary to the study of anything now for instance im studying parallel course to get insights into study of scientology and very very smart thing an extremely smart thing to do is to take page of material and look over it for words you dont know words that dont instantly react to you circle each one of those words or make list of each one of those words and look up and study their definitions or ask people and get definitions for them find out exactly what those words mean dont tackle the subject of the page just tackle the nomenclature of the page get that nomenclature slick as whistle tackle the subject youll find out the subject was very easy all the thing was trying to tell you is that if you went ahead and ran service facsimile which didnt give ta action on exploration why the pc would get loused up because you were running without ta action and this is all this whole thing is devoted to but one runs across this thing service facsimile ohhh whats that another word ohhh whats that you see and whats that and whats that well if you want to put yourself in total mystery go ahead and study pages you dont know the words on then you can put yourself into gorgeous mystery now this language is so common to your instructors its so common to people around here and their snob action which we have dont doubt about that see and will continue to have because it is an index of status and competence will cause them to explain these things to student with bit of sneer and theyre liable to cure you of asking what is service facsimile because you will hear in the answer that comes back to you at least the tone for well you idiot why dont you look it up in your bulletin you know fancy anybody not knowing that see this is sort of reflected in the atmosphere you get back when you ask these things and that again makes you feel stupid for not knowing well actually nothing can be done to minimize this latter why i could say always answer students questions politely and youd probably only build up covert hostility theyd answer the questions politely and flunk all tests for 24 hours you see something wild is liable to go awry when you start to put the brakes on some natural action so the only point im making here is dont let yourself be put off because somebody thinks youre stupid because you dont know it youre not stupid because you dont know it youre simply uninformed well if youre uninformed dont get so status happy of thinking that you must appear bright in order to be thought well of when it has nothing to do with it youre here to learn and anybody is studying anything is studying it i suppose to learn it not to acquire he may acquire status through having learned it but he doesnt acquire status by pretending he knows it when he doesnt as matter of fact he acquires himself quite headache so the point is in spite of any rebuff that you get or of difficulty digging into some book to find out what it means you actually put yourself in ä soup at once the moment that you leave one word in sentence behind you you do not know the meaning of one unknown piece of nomenclature left behind you can absolutely ruin your comprehension of the whole thing youre studying now if you want to speed up your grasp of the situation apparently do it the slow way this obviously is slow way to do it isnt it but its not the slow way to do it because it snowballs youll get faster and faster and faster whereas if you dont do it this way you will get slower and slower and slower so never leave word behind you in study that you dont know the meaning of and when you hear use word in lecture and i try to minimize nomenclature actuary in lectures when you hear use word in lecture that you dont know the meaning of for gods sakes write it down in your notes and right after the lecture find out what it is what is that word see its something that has passed you by well its that which you dont understand not the mind not scientology not the theories and practice of scientology the stumbling block first and foremost is simply nomenclature now nomenclature will be there regardless of any reform undertaken because in the first place we are examining things which are not hitherto known so they have to have name now somebody uninformed may try to tell you that some of these things were known but thats merely his misinformation talking he doesnt know what you were talking about so he thinks it was previously known he will try for instance to compare an id and thetan see and he says well freud described all that he said id and an id was something and well probably person saying this to you really doesnt know what freud said was an id see his nomenclature failure is prior to his misunderstanding where you are see so if you want to wind yourself up in ball and become very confused and get lot of slow passes and go slower and slower and slower and slower just start leaving words behind you you dont know what they are you get halfway down the page all of sudden theres word youve never seen before just say well ill catch that later and go on why dont you just say well ill cut my throat right now and add several weeks onto my course progress because thats just what thatll do you cannot help but wind up at the end of that page now the next thing is the subject matter itself arrangement and understanding of now this is your second one now its all right to name something and get definition for something but what is being named and if you were very very clever you would worry it and worry it and snarl at it and walk around the circles of any piece of subject matter now were talking about the thing see were talking about were not talking about the name of the thing were talking about the thing youd walk around any one of those pieces of subject matter until you had good comprehension of what that was all about what the devil are we talking about see ill give you an idea you say well person has bad opinion of another person because they have an overt against that person all right there is thing you see that is the mechanism that surrounds the overtmotivator sequence thats one of the phenomena joe is mad at bill and if you search little bit youll find out hes mad at bill because hes done something to bill joe has done something to bill now this is contrary to the explanation everybody makes in life so it is very easily read this way see because life is that way you can get this thing scoong wrong way to in your skull see so joe is mad at bill because bill has done something to joe yes i understand that well you missed the whole point thereafter if youve done that you will really never then understand how to pull an overt or why you must do so see that has just gone up in smoke see very important mechanism joe is mad at bill because joe has done something to bill all right that is the thing now several things can get in the road of the acceptance of this thing and first and foremost is it isnt usual or ordinarily thought of this way and that gets in your road by misinterpretation you think youve read something you havent read see because its so usual for it to be the other way you think youve read it the other way or it is so widely accepted the other way that it is simply unbelievable so theres the next thing that gets in your road is the unbelievability of it you say well that couldnt possibly be true now for heavens sakes make sure when you come to the unbelievability of something that you know what youre unbelieving now thats important thats important lets know what were unbelieving now to know what were unbelieving we have to take the first step again the nomenclature you see did i get the word right now the thing the mechanism phenomenon here have i got that right and youll find in about ninety percent of the cases that reexamination at this unbelieve step you are unbelieving the wrong thing you werent unbelieving what was there you were unbelieving something else see so when you run into total gawp see you know you say that couldnt be you know whawha ithatthat couldnt be ino that couldnt be see and instead of going out and jumping in the lake or something like this or taking cyanide the thing to do is to check over nomenclature and the description of the thing itself now if you check those two over youll find out you probably had something in crosswise and that this unbelievable was not unbelievable at all but is quite quite easily seen thats about ninety percent of the time the other ten percent of the time you just cant see how that works that way go back and check your nomenclature check what the thing was that youre not believing and so forth get down to this other thing you still cant see how its that way set yourself up some examples of how its not that way and how it is that way now this is the really the first place where you really have to apply it to you and life where it becomes an abs complete must you must apply it to you you must apply it to life does this thing exist in life or doesnt it has it existed in my life or has it existed in anybody elses life that i know of is there any incident here that demonstrates this phenomena and youll start looking at it and youll find out that the reason it wouldnt go that way is normally button got in its road or something like that you know you didnt dare believe that it was this way something like that just an examination of it trying to how does it apply to how does it apply to life has it ever applied to life did anybody ever see this thing you see and do i know of any incident or anything of the sort which would exemplify this thing why the other ten percent that ive been talking about here that will tend to evaporate too and youll say ah yes now we got it now this procedure followed actually gives you terribly firm grip on what you know and careful study is not necessarily either thorough or brilliant or wise or anything else its merely careful and if you work right along at it on the subject of being careful with it and what youre careful about is as youre going down the page pocketapocketapocketa you all of sudden see this word boojum see what the hell is that now ill show you how you can be stupid thats to go on read the next word to it in the hopes that somehow or other the explanation will all drop out into your lap gloss over that word youve done yourself in whats this word boojum boy you better find out right now you might glance at the rest of the sentence does there parenthetical description what boojum is in it as you sometimes occur or theres nothing there its evidently word im supposed to know its not new word because its not explained in this paragraph so its word i know boy you go any further than that youve just hung yourself up in nice little brass mystery and there youll be going around with lamp looking into the dark corners and wondering what youre being mystified about and then youll think youre mystified about the subject youre mystified about anything its tracing back to this time you read this paragraph and you didnt understand word in it so of course then it didnt communicate by not understanding the word you inhibit any communication youve inhibited communication between what youre studying and yourself youve also inhibited your communication between yourself and other auditors and you also oddly enough have inhibited your communication with yourself and pc because this is something in pc that you will not thereafter recognize because you dont know what it is now following down some sort of of routine like this in study youll find out that you can study its all right for somebody to come around and say well you cant study and you just dont apply yourself and that sort of thing and theyre theyve done this to people in school theyve done it to they used to do it to in school they used to say you dont know how to study and i used to say gee thats very interesting you i dont know how to study and i accepted this that i didnt know how to study and i dont know that i made much of ruckus about it but i did manage to finally find out that this was not accompanied by any method of study in other words you were saying somebody was saying to you you dont know how to hang up skyhook and therefore youre very stupid indeed because you dont know how to hang up skyhook and its sort of like catching snipes same kind of gag see youre supposed to stand out in the woods for hours holding sack while they drive them in on you actually theyre home having some coffee and youre standing in the damp woods for hours you see its just that crude gag they say you dont know how to study well what pretentious people they dont know how to study either see there is theres subject called study if there was subject called study theyd start teaching it to you in kindergarten they would certainly start teaching it to you before you were into the your high schools and that sort of thing theyd say this is how to study ive run across various systems but theyre not in the formal textbooks ive seen them in remember the pete smith specialties from way back when that used to show on the screen and so forth gag onereel comedies and so forth well ive seen methods of remembering things and methods of knowing things and so forth come up in that form but ive never seen it on textbook basis i myself developed method quote method of study in defense and i remember vividly applying this in the field of history its just not going onto the next paragraph unless i could shut my eyes and rattle off the last paragraph see it didnt increase my knowledge of history i actually get along better just by reading history textbook at the end of the line when i finish off the history textbook and somebody asks for dates i look in the book i find that is the best method by which to do this the only other method of study that i ever developed for myself in school might be of some interest and that was just to get every book on the subject i could get hold of and read all of them and not try to concentrate on any of them you see i think one of the most stellar grades i ever got and bragged about all over the place and so forth and called upon to give lectures on every hand made feel little guilty i was taking american history and i simply got hold of every textbook i could find on the subject of american history and read them all including woodrow wilsons fivevolume history of the united states you see thats one of those things that you put on bookshelf to hold it down in case of an earthquake and i read all these textbooks but i dont think i ever told the professor that because i was allergic to its very very bad prose that i had never read that classs textbook id never read the classs textbook id read all the other textbooks i could lay my hands on but i couldnt stand its prose its prose was horrible and i it was sort of socialistically weirdly put together and it was pedantic in the extreme it wasnt that it was full of difficult words as matter of fact the fellow was sort of underplaying the places where he should have used good big pompous word you know why hed put some offbeat word and so forth he didnt know how to write see and so i didnt read the schools textbook but i read all the other textbooks and i got oh i dont know pluses and gave lectures on history for them and got gold stars and silver cups and all this sort of thing as being terrific student well actually it was just to the degree that i just covered everything in sight and i find out thats fairly reliable as method fairly reliable when there isnt any training available you know like an american school when theres absolutely training available why what you want to do is just get ahold of every book on the subject in sight and then just read them all from cover to cover see making very sure i would now and do and always did that you didnt cross over words you didnt know get yourself great big dictionary and get yourself some kind of an anthology or something that went along with it and look up word you didnt know and find out what that was related to and then get that word real good and then go sailing on your way it wouldnt matter if you read book in five hours you see it wouldnt matter how fast you read the book or didnt read the book thats in absence of formal knowable training on any subject thats very good method excellent method as matter of fact because you wind up at the end of the thing youve seen this word so often youve looked it up so often you eventually know what it is you know you say there again is the rembrandt profile now what the hell does it mean rembrandt profile well rembrandt profile is actually well i guess it must have been something painted by rembrandt but they must mean something here ill turn back over here i saw mention of it over here heres description of the thing yeah well so on and so on and so on and so ohh oh i get it its the main light is not showing on the front of the face oh good yeah its just the fill shows on the thing ahh thats good yeah i got that now all right sail along the line and so forth and finally why forgot all about that you see but chapters later we run into rembrandt profile see what oh something about fill yes well i know where i can find it ill go back ah yes yes main light back of the person fill in the front of the person yeah mainface mainly in shadow yeah i got it nothing to it all right running down the line chapters later in another textbook on the subject when shooting rembrandt profile so on so on so on so onoh thats how you do you add spotlight to it also okay you see the word longer operated as an impasse to your study looking up words and meanings and so forth is sort of the erosive course of the river and it eventually grinds away on the banks until it has good strong flowing stream you see actually i dont think there are bright students and dull students i dont think this at all i dont think so because ive never seen any real coordination between knowledge of the subject and the brightness and dullness of student but there is careful student and careless student now student can be very fast and still be very careful it hasnt even too much to do with speed but he knows when hes whipped thats about the only thing he knows hes reading down this paragraph and all of sudden he wakes up to the fact he hasnt the foggiest clue what the devil hes talking about what hes reading about so he goes back and finds out where he got tangled up ah well here was word and here was phenomenon he didnt know anything about now if hes careful student he puts it all away until he finds out what that word and what that phenomena is and exactly what that is and he gets that straight he may cruise around in the thing just little bit further to find out if its defined in that particular publication see but hes looking for the definition hes not any longer doing it now theres careful student and his brightness on the subject is dependent upon the degree he does this it isnt dependent on any native talent or anything else it isnt even dependent on his buttons and in scientology because of the tremendous amount of breadth of study we are doing and because we are studying what we study with why then its necessary to have some command of the subject of study it becomes absolutely imperative in our field to know something about how to study and its longer walking up to some poor luckless student and saying well the trouble with you is you dont know how to study then walking off you see or saying about some other student well hes just stupid thats all you see that explains it all see frankly it doesnt explain doggone thing weve talked we hear about the lightningquick student we hear about the very very fast fast fast student and we hear about the very very very very slow student and we hear about the grind and we hear about the brilliant student and honest those classifications have more validity than the field of psychiatry why because they have never produced uniform fast study theyre apparently merely excuses and justifications of something theyre an effort to classify on something nobodys cracked so why should we talk about dull students and slow students and brilliant students and so forth there are certain phenomena in study which are worth commenting upon and one of those is the oddball who can memorize almost at glance and who can go back and spit out the memorized words ive known chinese students that got anybody whipped i ever in the anglosaxon world or in the western world anything whipped on this line i know chinese students who could go ahead and give you pages of mathematical formulas and things of this character and descriptions of it and so forth about the wildest thing you ever listened to and theyd come to school the next morning with their lessons and kawow you ask them all right now lets go into the slope formula well the slope formula is soandso and soandso and soandso kow kow powpow kowwow its all there see you say wow dont say instantly well then this is the very man we need to build the dam because building dams has very little to do with study of that particular kind or character we dont even know if he could solve the problems on the page but he sure could remember them now thats test mainly of memory now if you want to be sure of this person in examining this person youll find immediately whats going wrong here immediately youll find whats going wrong theres way of examining this person that would only be fair to the instructor and to the student alike take any oddball word that occurred in the first paragraph you have just got back so glibbishly and ask for definition of that word the definition is not given on the subject matter which the person is doing and if you want to see hunted horrified look come into anybodys face its the perfect memory repeat see and youve thrown an ax into it because youve asked for something which isnt memory youve asked for the definition of certain word and if this person now look at this if this person could give you this whole paragraph and tell you all about it but couldnt define word in it that person must be in total mystery about that so the missing ingredient is understanding and then naturally the missing ingredient application will show up soon afterwards do you see how that would work in other words this very very fast study falls down exactly as the slow study would fall down in other words everybody eaves in on this same point uniformly now if somebody comes up and he takes this same thing and he stumbles all over the place and he tries to get it out and he spits it out and so forth the examiner could ask him too the same word whats the definition of that word and hed say well i dont know puts him in the same boat as the fast study doesnt it so the direction and end purpose of study is understanding and of course you with an unknown word in the middle of it and an unknown phenomenon in the middle of it youre not going to get understanding at all youre going to get disbelief noncomprehension youre going to get mystery youre going to get of course also nonapplication now if we examine study little bit further the main complaint about study is that it does not immediately and at once result in good clean clear application this is one of the primary scolds about modern education primary criticisms is if you educate an engineer or it was you educate an engineer and you dont dare send him out to build bridge see well thats in the field of application or practice of application but if this man cant go out and build bridge after hes been taught to build bridge the familiarity ingredient of course is missing but even so if somebody had borne down on him like mad for the definition of every word that he was stumbling across in the direction of bridge building he should be able to go out and unroll his sextant and transit and get to work he should he should hes now got the horrible task of acquiring his familiarity but he wouldnt be doing it across the barrier of misunderstanding of his terminology and misunderstanding of his tools and he theoretically could do it i found myself doing it the other day i just had textbook command of certain problem on this line parallel line im studying i just had textbook command of the thing nothing but and i saw it saw it happened and applied the textbook and it resolved bang and i had about something on the order of maybe two or three seconds to do the whole thing because something was happening and i had to straighten it out fast see just textbook it worked it worked perfectly so therefore you could and should be able to take purely textbook thing if it was valid textbook and valid subject and apply it directly without familiarity now think of what whiz you would be however if you also had the familiarity at the same time and thats why we study auditing while auditing see but if this other ingredient of careful study is missing the nomenclature is missing you cant make the boat it just wont make the boat i studied been studying this parallel subject very hard because it is bearcat on the subject of terminology too its terminology that youd think anybody that had been around photography very long would be very familiar with he couldnt help but be familiar with it oh not when youre studying text after text after text after text after text well if you were taking some little course that didnt have much to do with the price of fish that didnt intend to make pro out of you along any line and this is see this is how you develop pictures the eastman book for the home beginner you know ive read those by the ton that hasnt got anything to do with it it says hammer pound hit em with the grape you know holds barred now we charge with the bayonets you take the metabisulphite and pour it into the yattapin and you say you take the what you know and then youre busy in the very next lesson studying completely disrelated field of the same subject make sure that you adjust the headscreen the what where the hell did this come from ive never met it before around here anyplace headscreen headscreen now what is headscreen scatter scatter flutter flutter look in the dictionary and so forth what do you know it isnt in the dictionary its so common they dont have to define it but i dont know it worry now about how stupid this makes you see flutter flutter bingbang finally figure it out by context and by illustration there was picture of all of the photographic material needed headscreen obviously headscreen was what you hold back corner of the main light force so as to get prominent ear to be less prominent obvious isnt it headscreen who would have dreamed it man nonsensical but very usual piece of equipment the guy writing the textbook being so familiar with his subject would make the same statement that you would make you see you say well you set your emeter down on the table first of course you have said it almost sarcastically you see well you set your emeter down on the table of course before you start auditing if you want to be really sarcastic youd make such remark you see this guy this bloke this expert on portraits to end all experts on portraits says well of course you adjust the headscreen to hold back that thats the way you subdue the light he just says this parenthetically you see this is how you make less prominent undesirable features on subject in portraiture you hold back the light on them what do you hold back the light with get the same answer out of the textbook oh dont be an ass yeah but what do you hold back the light with you know you hold it back with headscreen of course you idiot whats headscreen what is headscreen what is this thing put it over the piece put it over the lens of the camera so it doesnt show the fellows head so this has been its been very amusing because i can look at subject you see from an oblique look at the same study problems that you run into and ive been analyzing these problems and putting them together what ive been talking to you about and what ive talked to you about in recent things has been the views ive had on this as worked out and as i know they apply in our own field and i think youve been making some progress as result but there are just these points about study and you expected there would be probably lot more complex points about study but there are more complex points about study than i have just given you now of course if you didnt read or write english there would be further study on nomenclature but remember it would just be further study on nomenclature so it even falls into that particular field now the person who cant talk at all or let us say an animal trying to arrive at this particular line hes totally out of communication he hasnt got the vocal chords he cant be educated in the first place you say well thats totally lost field well im im not completely willing to lose that field utterly because ive already raised animals in tone to remarkable degree and ive already met dogs that could talk see yeah i met dog one time he used to say hungry every time he wanted chow he managed it somehow he used some hollywood scheme of how you breathe from the diaphragm you know but he could say it clear as could be that he was hungry startled people almost to death because theyd say well thats funny the dog probably makes grunt you know and this mistress thats taught him and so forth is just being too too for words and then theyd hear this dog and this dog would say hungry and theyd go ahhhh and i was talking to an elephant the other day that wanted his picture taken as i told you and ive run into animals that know their cues much better than their trainers and have to pull the trainer through the act somehow and make him look good so i dont know what the barriers to communication are i have greater insight into the fifth dynamic lately than i have had before and i have found that theyre you can go lot deeper into the fifth dynamic in fact ive pretty well got an idea of what gpms and so forth certain animals and insects and so forth get stuck in and just about how they go into that particular zone or area and how they go out the bottom ive had little quite little bit more insight into this but anyway that being as it may the point is that the communication of the nomenclature of the language of the ability to talk or communicate would be the first barrier dont you see and so it remains into the fellow who does know english who can read who sits there and so forth its still his first barrier but of course he is so high on this level of communication he is contemptuous of these little inabilities to communicate and so neglects them and neglecting them then of course he comes an awful cropper when he gets into the field of study and that is about the first place where he really falls down there are many ways you could make person fail in studying but mostly it would be in denying them an insight into the necessity of understanding the communication symbols used that would be big failure in delivering the field of study we never published dictionary as such there are several manuscripts of dictionaries around but they unfortunately all depend on my reediting from beginning to end and they just go fantastic quantities of words and it is just those extra twelve hours on top of the fortyeight in the twenty four to get such job completed its very rough 18 rough beef and i particularly would not want to attempt the job until i felt it was pretty wrapped up so its just about now it would be wrapped up but i did have definitions of the various words at level vi and so forth codified which im sure has been issued and so that you could look those things up and know what the score was on that but despite the lack of glossy dictionary you nevertheless can look up these words and they are known and people all over the place know what they are here and there really isnt much excuse going to one so it takes you half an hour to learn what this word is boy thats half an hour that wont get multiplied and added on to the end of your course when youre busy floundering around wondering why you just cant seem to get to first base on that particular quarter well i hope what ive told you today will be of some use to you thank you very much
