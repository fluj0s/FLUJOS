confidential noforn level the key data elements are stored and retrieved for display by the proton interface include called and calling telephone numbers date time and duration of calls snf for approximately the last 5 vi years the cia crisscross now proton program has been incorporating nsa provided sigintderived us and secondthird party data nsa provides this information to crisscrossproton agencies for snf the decision to disseminate sigintderived signaling outside comint channels also had_policy and operational dimensions tests have demonstrated that sigint derived and traditional humintderived call record data can be stored and displayed in manner which makes them appear to be indistinguishable which in general terms make the risks to sources and methods approximately equal however under some circumstances eg signaling data form unique target area which could have come only from sensitive sigint source dissemination of data to crisscross would be inappropriate this is the case when the data also includes information elements that are only available and could only come from exploitation of signaling the moa is silent on this point leaving to nsa full decision authority to decide which data to provide and not provide c for several years prior nsa had been providing sigintderived signaling information to cia and dea to support multiagency counter narcotics analysis as approved by ddo ogc and the office of policy calling data from several latin american collectors and from thailand had been of great value to the dea and to the dci crime and narcotics center and there were adverse operational or legal impacts to nsa snf operationally the flow of large volumes of intercepted signaling data could place additional burden onnsas it infrastructure while as above the moa did not address it infrastructure nsa retained full discretion over volume and timing of information flow even as nsa chose to support the crisscrossproton program with certain sigint inputs snf requisite human and communications resources are in place in sid to support the transfer of moderate volumes of signalingderived call record data to the cia crisscrossproton program office increase in personnel was required to initiate data flow under the terms of moa cia provided the list of us overseas commercial phone numbers to be minimized in nsa processing of signaling data similarly the department of state and department of defense telephone directories will be researched by nsa to identify official us government overseas phone numbers in order to minimize call records associated with them to this end the nsa crisscrossproton program manager agreed to obtain the dos and dod directories annually and with cia assistance extract the overseas numbers that function was transferred to the communications event analysis center ceac in s2s in 2x4 the software to extract call record data and to support minimization exists on handle via comint channels only secretnofornmr secretnofornmr server under s2s control huge volume of signaling data 400m records flows to that server on daily basis to meet nsa analytic needs and sufficient communication bandwidth is currently available to support the transfer of processed call records 37m per day to cias crisscrossproton program for reformatting we anticipate s21 will continue to be responsible for loading cia crisscrossproton output on nsas crisscrossproton server and ceac will continue to be responsible for maintaining minimization and audit controls on allsource data received from cia finally sid office of oversight and compliance would be responsible for oversight of ussid 18 compliance s community analytic interest in dialing analysis continues to grow and is directed at discovery of new specific targets or topics and demand for additional call record volume to support contact chaining and geolocation has increased signaling links are competing for collection priority just like any other potential sigint target as with other targets the potential to expand collection is limited by available resources to include field processing of signaling links as well as bandwidth to support forwarding from collection sites to nsa snf the crisscross program in which nsa already participates as user of data has had notable successes since its inception in 1990 such as enabling major narcotics arrests monitoring ramsi yousef s colleagues unraveling the mubarak assassination plot and providing insight into pakistani nuclear weapon test activities the program has received high marks from senior community levels such as the pfiab and assistant dcis for both collection and production crisscross was also cited in the report by admiral jeremiah on indian nuclear testing as potential improvement to community analytic strength since 911 the contributions to the gwot due to our increased collection of signaling metadata are innumerable and significant it is safe to say that it has been contribution to virtually every successful rendition of suspects and often the deciding factor hence the benefit to the intelligence and law enforcement communities of any sigintaugmented inputs could be considerable as sigint has the potential to access broad range of targets current proposal snf ref requests additional data elements from sigint collection be included in the data set transferred to proton specifically they want mobility management information relating to digital cellular and mobile satellite systems to include global cell ids location area codes spot beams international mobile subscriber identifications international mobile equipment identifications latitudelongitude and inmarsat return ids they also requested content from short message service exchanges which we are required to audit queries against discussion snf the current data push to ciaproton is roughly 40 million records per day which has resulted in approximately 30 of the proton data set 19962005 coming from sigint sources 20022005 the addition of the requested data elements would more than double the volume of data sent to proton on daily basis this would increase the percentage of sigint contribution to proton significantly cia is positing proton as the community resource for targetlead handle via comint channels only secretnofornmr secretnofornmr development based on contact chaining techniques in this regard it is extremely difficult to envision it playing that role at nsa proton requires nofornorcon access must be licensed has api that would allow access integration with other tools eg federated query and represents significant funding investment and dependency on cia contractor recommended response snf in the context of the atmosphere created by the events of 091101 and the following investigations into the perceived intelligence failure recurring theme has been the lack of data sharing 011 the part of the ic members against that background it is difficult to deny requested access to sigint only datasets that are thought to have value to other intelligence analystsmissions in an effort to provide access to the requested data and b break new ground in the information sharing arena while c not moving any more data out of nsa and into duplicative storage we propose to utilize the ic shared information space icsis on intelink and implement ic access to our globalreach federated query service via accounts and access verified by pki certificates this service will provide the access requested and permit the auditing legally required of nsa further we request that cia forward proton data from nonsigint sources to nsa for inclusion in the dataset searched by globalreach for data that must remain in hcs channels we will create an hcs partition in fascia ii this will permit onestop access to contact information for ic analysts we believe that we can have globalreach available in the icsis shared space by 01 oct 2005
