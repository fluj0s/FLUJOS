7s meir dagan subsequently told levey that the cbi had engineered way for the undesignated iranian bank sepah to conduct foreign business transactions through use of the iranian postal bank bank melli

instrument being used by melli levey commented that any such investment fund or financial instrument could be listed as derivative designation of melli if enough evidence could be shown linking the

subsequently dagan asked levey whether the usg was considering designation of the cbi although treasury had looked into the possibility said levey designation of the cbi would be ineffective without multilateral effort international support for such an effort simply did not yet exist levey explained he told dagan that we need to build support by sharing info about the cbis illicit conduct similar to the support we built for cutting off the uturn license levey said that it would be better to focus on limiting other central and commercial banks business with the cbi noting that the banking

and the uk to further efforts in this area effect of sanctions on iran 13s dagan told levey that the economic problems iran is experiencing as result of sanctions are encouraging debate within the regime he said that in order to preserve the revolution some key figures have begun to consider the need for change the pressure is on dagan said but he could not estimate when iran would hit the brink he noted that the lower cost of oil at the moment would likely prompt iran to increase its production thereby encouraging more business through the cbi with oil prices low everywhere however dagan and levey agreed that iran was less attractive place for investment levey told dagan that the present low oil prices provide critical opportunity to convince other members of the international community to apply more pressure 14s livni asked levey if there was risk of iran regaining foothold in certain markets as result of the world financial crisis levey said that the market turmoil has

department but that her concern was the central issue being debated by policy makers in washington in leveys previous meeting with mfa officials bar and gal he said that engagement with iran would not work without leverage indicating that sanctions would need to be in place matter what the usg decides to do stemming palestinian terror finance goi pleased with pas progress 16s levey told arditi that
