adequate steps on its own to achieve full compliance with the goals and objectives established by the 1988 antidrug trafficking convention country not qualifying on this basis may escape imposition of sanctions if the president certifies that us vital national interests justify waiver of sanctions on that countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98159crs2 what sanctions are mandatory if decertified the following mandatory sanctions would apply to nation suspension of all remaining us assistance for the current fiscal year except for antinarcotics and humanitarian assistance nb withholding of 50 of assistance for the current fiscal year is required total suspension of us assistance for subsequent fiscal years unless the country is recertified in the interim requirement that the united states vote against loans to the country in the multilateral development banks what sanctions are discretionary in the event of decertification discretionary sanctions available to the president under section 802 of the trade act of 1974 include denial of preferential tariff treatment to countrys exports under the generalized system of preferences gsp the caribbean basin economic recovery act andean trade preference act and any other law providing preferential tariff treatmentduty increases of up to 50 on the value of countrys export items which are currently duty free duty increases of up to 50 on the value of countrys export items which are currently subject to dutycurtailment of air transportation and traffic between the united states and the noncertified country withdrawal of us participation in any preferential preclearanc customs arrangements with the noncertified country what qualifies country for the majors list section 490h of the foreign assistance act of 1961 requires the president to submit to congress by november 1 of each year list of countries he has determined to be either 1 major illicit drug producing countries or 2 major drug transit countries definitions provided by law allow an administration substantial flexibility in determining which nations qualify for drug transit status in contrast standards for drugproducing country offer little flexibility major illicit drug producing countries are defined by law in section 481 of the 1961 act as cultivating or harvesting at least 1000 hectares of opium poppy 1000 hectares of illicit coca or 5000 hectares of marijuana in the case of marijuana such production must significantly affect the united states major illicit drug transit countries are defined by section 481 standard which permits subjectivity such country because of its transit activities must be significant direct source of illicit drugs to the united states information on major illicit drug producing and transit countries as well as information on major precursor chemical source countries and major drug mone yhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98159crs3 laundering countries is then included in the state departments march 1 annual international narcotics control strategy report incsr what does the 2000 certification report include on february 29 2000 president clinton submitted to congress his annual list of major illicit drug producing and transiting countries eligible to receive us foreign aid and other economic and trade benefits certified as fully cooperating and deserving of us assistance are bahamas bolivia brazil china colombia dominican republic ecuador guatemala hong kong india jamaica laos mexico panama peru taiwan thailand venezuela and vietnam the president decertified and denied assistance to afghanistan and burma countries not fully cooperating but eligible for continued us assistance because such assistance is deemed in the us national interest are cambodia haiti nigeria and paraguay changes from the 1999 certification are removal of aruba and belize both previously fully certified from the list of countries subject to certification of the presidents determinations his decision to certify mexico has often been the most contentious mexico has regularly been focus of congressional attention and an important focus of us foreign narcopolicy as early as 1988 resolution to decertify mexico for lack of narcotics cooperation passed the senate on march 13 1997 the house passed 251175 hjres 58 which would have delayed decertification of mexico by 90 days and blocked it entirely had the president failed to certify that mexico had moved forward on six narcoticscooperation related issues in floor debate on march 20 1997 the senate passed 945 the coverdellfeinstein amendment to hjres 58 the amendment instead of disapproving the presidents certification would have required report by september 1 1997 on mexican efforts to strengthen the fight against trafficking in 10 areas and us efforts in three areas president clinton agreed to abide by the senate version in 1998 resolutions of disapproval were introduced in both houses but sj res 42 was defeated in the senate and floor action was taken in the house see crs report 98174 and crs report rl30080 by k larry storrs which are specifically mexico focused congress is also increasingly concerned over administration determinations as to who is and who is not on the majors list an area of contention for many in congress has been removal of iran from the drug majors list and his removal of syria and lebanon from the list in november 1997 to the dismay of many in congress the president notified the hill of his decision to remove syria and lebanon from the list 24 members of congress had signed letter calling upon president clinton to retain syria on the list in the case of iran on february 3 1998 21 members of congress sent letter to the president protesting such anticipated action followup letter sent february 6 was signed by 15 members nevertheless last year the administration removed iran from the list also earlier in the year members of congress sent letter to the secretary of state asking the administration whether north korean drug trafficking activity warranted that nations placement on the majors list the march 1999 incsr which for the first time includes section on north korea expresses profound concern over reports of north korean drug trafficking activity and contains pledge to continue to monitor any such activity in the coming year and to add north korea to the majors list should evidence require httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98159crs4 in the case of syria and lebanon the administration argues that the definition of major drug transit country does not apply because the impact of drugs transiting these two nations does not substantially affect the united states moreover the law does not make major drug refining nations subject to sanctions only crop producing growing nations and syria appears to be growing less opium poppy though apparently refining more heroin how can congress disapprove presidential determin ation of certification congress has 30calendardays from receipt of the presidents determination of certification to enact joint resolution disapproving the presidents action for 1998 the deadline for congressional passage of joint resolution of disapproval is expected to be march 27 1999 if the president vetoes such joint resolution of disapproval twothirds enacting majority in each legislative chamber would be required for it to become law if congress were to disapprove presidential certification could the president avoid imposition of sanctions by some other general waiver authority yes special waiver authorities are available but because certain political costs might be involved it is uncertain whether the president would exercise these waivers section 614a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 provides special authority for the president to furnish assistance without regard to any provisions of the act if he notifies congress in writing and determines that to do so is important to the national security interests of the united states sales credits and guarantees under the arms export control act also may be provided if to do so is found by the president to be vital to the national security interests of the united states section 614 of the act does not specifically authorize waivers of requiremen ts for us representatives to vote against loans in the multilateral development banks officials at the general counsels office at the treasury department are of the preliminary opinion that section 614 waivers would not apply to requirements under section 490a2 that us representatives in the multilateral development banks vote against loans to the decertified country if the president uses section 614 in contentious circumstances however such use may result in 1 congress removing the authority or 2 actions by congress in subsequent appropriations bills to deny or limit assistance to the country in question if congress were to disapprove the presidents certification of major illicit drug producing or transit country and override the presidential veto of such action potential subsequent attempts by the president to change his certification to one based on national interests would apparently need to be implemented under recertification provisions of section 490f this section provides that the president may submit national interests certification at any future time this recertification becomes operable however only if one of the two following conditions is met the president also certifies there has been fundamental change in government or change in conditions leading to the decertificationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98159crs5 or b in the absence of this additional certification regarding changes in government or conditions congress enacts joint resolution approving the national interests certification has congress ever overridden presidential dete rmination of certification however many say major strength of the certification process is the impact it has on the administration in shaping congressionally sensitive presidential determinations before they are sent to congress in the 100th congress resolution disapproving certification of panama sjres 91 passed the senate on april 3 1987 but the house failed to consider it within the required statutory time as early as 1988 resolution to decertify mexico for lack of narcotics cooperation passed the senate more recently on march 13 1997 the house passed 251175 hjres 58 which would have deferred decertification of mexico if the president reported that mexico had moved forward on six narcoticscooperation related issues in related move the senate on march 20 1997 passed 945 the coverdale feinstein amendment to hjres 58 which required report on mexican and us efforts to strengthen drug control activity the report was subsequently submitted in the event of decertification could antidr ug and humanitarian assistance continue yes section 481e4 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 exempts narcotics assistance narcoticsrelated aid disaster relief food and medicine as well as refugee assistance from mandatory certification sanctions however under what many see as technical loophole in the law narcoticsrelated foreign military financing fmf is not exempted in the event of decertification to counter this perceived loophole president clinton on august 16 1997 signed section 614 national interests waiver to the foreign assistance act permitting foreign military financing and other narcotics assistance to colombia in the amount of 306 million nb assistance in the form of providing drawdown articles and services is generally not considered assistance under the definitions of the 1961 foreign assistance act in the case of colombia the president also signed section 506 a2 waiver permitting dod drawdown articles and services to colombia and other nations in the western hemisphere on september 30 1997 what is the impact of the us voting against multilateral development bank loans to decertified country it is unlikely that the world bank ibrd and multilateral development banks mdbs would terminate or reduce their levels of assistance to country solely because the united states voted against such loans the united states is the single largest member country in both categories of banks but its 171 voting share in the world bank and to cite one mdb example its 341 share in the interamerican development bank idb would not be sufficient to prevent lending majority 51 of the vote cast by quorum of members is needed to approve such loans it is likely that they will continue supporting assistance to nation even if the united states opposes it in the world bank ibrdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98159crs6 note this report incorporates material contained in crs report 97320 narcotics certification and mexico by raphael perl jonathan sanford and k larry storrsother advanced industrial countries japan canada and the countries of the european union control about 40 of the vote it is unlikely that they will oppose lending to nation simply because the united states opposes it developing countries control about 40 of the vote in the ibrd and are likely to support loans to decertified nation regardless of the us view the us administration however might be able to persuade some countries to oppose lending to decertified country if it argues in convincing manner and especially if linkage to other matters is established us arguments along this line will not be very persuasive however if other countries believe the us administration is opposing multilateral bank assistance to the nation in question because it is required to do so by law and not because of its own conviction that opposition to such loans is the right thing to do and important to the united states it is unlikely that the united states will be able to persuade top management at the world bank or the mdbs to suspend action on any pending loan applications by decertified country if most other bank member countries support continued lending the united states has been chronically late in its contributions to the world bank and other multilateral banks in recent years bank management and other member countries may be less willing than usual to accord the united states special influence over decisions where they hold contrary views
