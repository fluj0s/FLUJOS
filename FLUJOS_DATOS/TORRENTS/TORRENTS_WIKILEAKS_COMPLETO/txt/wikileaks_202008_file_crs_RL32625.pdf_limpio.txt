in the last few years have demonstrated the vulnerability of passenger rail systems to terrorist attack the number of riders and access points makes it impractical to subject all rail passengers to the type of screening airline passengers undergo nevertheless steps can be taken to reduce the risks of terrorist attacks the 911 commission called for systematic analysis of transportation assets the risks to those assets and the costs and benefits of different approaches to defending those assets the commission also called for homeland security assistance to be distributed based on these assessments of risks and vulnerabilities rather than according to population comprehensive assessment of risk across all passenger rail operations has not been submitted to congress most federal assistance for passenger rail security has been allocated to systems judged by the department of homeland security dhs to be at highest risk the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 did not directly address passenger rail security but did direct dhs to create national strategy for transportation security this plan would identify national transportation assets set riskbased priorities for their protection assign responsibilities for their protection and recommend appropriate levels and sources of funding for these efforts dhs delivered classified report on national strategy for transportation security to congress in september 2005 this report was updated in april 2006 security plan for the surface transportation sector was due to congress by the end of 2006 dhs announced the plans release in may 2007 the government accountability office has noted that this plan is only first step as it is only required to describe how the most critical transportation assets will be identified and how their risk will be assessed but is not required to address how risks to transportation assets are actually being assessed or how those assets will be protected the implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 hr 1pl 11053 signed into law on august 3 2007 included comprehensive surface transportation security legislation this act authorized total of 35 billion for transit security and 20 billion for rail security including grant programs for which commuter rail operators amtrak and state and local governments will be eligible recipients some funds are specifically authorized for amtraks security and tunnel safety projects the act also authorizes dhs to regulate the employee security training programs of transit and rail entities the fy2008 dhs appropriations act division of the consolidated appropriations act 2008pl 110161 provides 47 million for surface transportation security activities including 22 m illion for rail security inspectors and dogs and 400 million for public transportation and railroad security assistance grants this report will be updated

priority in the 110th congress congress greatly expanded the fede ral role in passenger rail security in title xiv the national transit systems security act of 2007 and title xv surface transportation security of the implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 hr 1pl 11053 multiple bombings of passenger trains in india in 2006 and 2007 preceded by the bombings of london subway trains on july 7 2005 the alleged attempt to bomb london subway trains again on july 21 2005 and the bombing of spanish commuter trains in 2004 provide backdrop to congresss efforts to reduce the risk of attacks against passenger rail operations in the united states the 911 commission characterized the federal emphasis on aviation security spending as fighting the last war noting that opportunities to do harm are as great or greater in maritime or surface transportation 1 this report summarizes the challenges of securing passenger rail systems options for making decisions about security funding industry requests for funding and passengerrail related legislative action it does not address the security of freight rail operations however since some passenger rail operations use the same track and facilities as freight rail these topics cannot be completely separated

passenger rail systems have vulnerabilities that are difficult to mitigate but the risk to passengers on these systems from terrorist attack is quite small relative to the number of trips these systems provide daily and travel on passenger rail systems is safer overall than the primary alternative the automobile passenger rail service takes four forms heavy rail eg subway systems like washington dcs metro commuter rail eg marylands maryland rail commuter or marc and virginias virginia railway express or vre trains light rail eg dallass dart and intercity passenger rail amtrak the first three are forms of public transit which along with amtrak share certain characteristics that make them vulnerable to attack 1 they make scheduled stops along fixed routes 2 their operations depend on people having quick and easy access to stations and trains 3 the number of access points volume of ridership and pace of operations make it impractical to subject all rail passengers to the type of screening that airline passengers undergo and 4 the number of operators and scale of operations of all forms of passenger rails systems in the united states make it difficult to provide uniform levels of security to each and every rail system congress remains concerned about rail security in part because in recent years there have been number of attacks on passenger rail systems in other countries the 911 commission noted in its final report surface transportation systems such as railroads and mass transit remain hard to protect because they are so accessible and extensive 2 with one possible exception crs has been unable to find case of terrorist attack on passenger rail system in the united states in recent history3 this does not mean however that these systems are not vulnerable to attack 1 the 911 commission report final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states new york w w norton 2004 p 391 2 the 911 commission report 2004 p 391 3 in 1995 an amtrak train was derailed in arizona resulting in the death of one amtrak employee and injuries to 78 passengers this act of sabotage has sometimes been characterized as terrorist attack but the responsible party has never been identified so the case remains unsolved c

resulted in hundreds of deaths yet in the context of millions of people riding passenger rail every day the risk to rail passenger of dying in any country as the result of terrorist attack continues to be extremely small conversely during the years 20032005 more than 80 passengers died in accidents on rail systems in the united states4 given that americans take more than 35 billion trips on passenger rail systems each year the risk of dying in rail accident is also extremely small but it is not zero the goal of terrorist attack is not simply to kill people but as the name implies to sow terror to disrupt the social order by spreading fear and uncertainty about the future people have died as result of accidents on passenger rail systems which are more common than acts of terror against such systems but terrorist attack would have greater shock value one possible consequence of such an attack could be for people to switch from using rail to other modes of transportation switching to one likely alternative driving would actually raise the risk of death due to the higher risk of accident and injury faced by drivers compared to rail passengers 5 in short while rail systems and their passengers may be vulnerable to attack the risk of attack is smaller than other risks those passengers face including the relatively remote risk of death by accident perhaps more vulnerable to attack is the nations sense of the social order in the aftermath of an attack people experience fear especially as they consider the possibility of further attacks while government can do things to reduce the risk of an attack on passenger rail systems such attacks cannot absolutely be prevented if an attack on passenger rail system were to occur the psychological impact could be reduced by restoring sense of normalcy as quickly as possible 6 this could be accomplished by among other things resuming passenger rail operations and apprehending the persons responsible for the attack as tim otoole managing director of londons subway system testified we believe our greatest defence comes from our rapid response and restoration of service denying terrorists the chaos and fear they are seeking and thereby discouraging their return 7

prioritize security actions8 william millar president of the american public transportation association apta testified in january 2007 that the transit industry has spent 25 billion since september 11 2001 on security and emergency preparedness measures9 in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 congress directed dhs to prepare national strategy for transportation security and security plans for each transportation mode the national strategy was completed in 2005 the modespecific security plans were released in may 2007 congress has provided total of 109 billion for grants to passenger rail systems since september 11 2001 mostly through dhs annual appropriations acts these funds can be used for securityrelated planning acquisition of equipment training exercises and administrative expenses on may 20 2004 after the bombings of commuter trains in madrid tsa issued security directives for us passenger rail systems 10 although these directives were not made public they reportedly reflected actions already taken by many us rail systems11 these included removing or hardening trash containers on boarding platforms that could be used to hide bombs increasing the presence of security officers using video surveillance in and around stations conducting random inspections of passengers and baggage sometimes with the help of bombsniffing dogs and encouraging riders to look for suspicious activity12 the government accountability office gao has noted that the issuance of these directives was an effort to take swift action in response to current threat13 however the gao goes on to write that because the rail industry and federal stakeholders were afforded only limited input and review the directives may not provide the industry with baseline security standards based on industry best practices14 furthermore gao recommended that tsa collaborate with the department of transportation and the passenger rail industry to develop rail security standards that reflect industry best practices and that can be measured monitored and enforced15 the fra and the passenger rail industry have raised concerns about some of these directives including at least one that seems to conflict with other federal safety regulations16 according to 8 gao passenger rail security enhanced federal leadership ne eded to prioritize and guide security

partner with the passenger rail industry to develop security standards and directives17 since september 2005 tsa has hired 100 surface transportation inspectors to monitor and enforce compliance with tsa rail security directives in september 2006 fras and tsa s roles and responsibilities for compliance inspections were outlined in an annex to the existing memorandum of understanding between dhs and dot additionally according to tsa their inspectors have developed relationships with security officials in passenger rail and transit systems coordinated access to operations centers participated in emergency exercises and provided assistance in enhancing security 18 g3g141g141g146g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 in studying the security measures taken by us and some foreign transit agencies gao found that the domestic and foreign agencies were doing many of the same things 19 but gao identified three practices used by limited number of nations that are not currently in general use in the united states these are 1 covert testing of employee response to incidents by placing suspicious items throughout the system or setting off alarms 2 random screening of passengers and baggage and 3 national government clearinghouse of security technologies and best practices20 gao noted that attempts to implement these three practices in the us could face political legal fiscal and cultural challenges21 gao also identified government centralization of the process for researching and developing passenger rail security technologies as potentially useful practice gao found that us federal agency has collected or distributed information on research and development of passenger rail security technologies or other best practices for passenger rail security22 g20g146g156g148g561g15g138g151g138g144g142g150g142g151g157g561 tsa is using riskbased methodology to guide its security efforts23 gao24 and the 911 commission25

be used for protecting key resources and critical infrastructure assets threatbased risk management includes three components vulnerability threat and criticality or consequence26 vulnerability encompasses the ways system may be open to attack threat considers the likelihood of an attack on system and criticality refers to the potential consequences of an attack the assessment of the level of risk results from the interplay of these components one implication of risk analysis is that there is more than one way to manage risk to passenger rail system specific strategies can be tailored to specific rail systems by combining one or more of the following approaches one approach is to make changes in passenger rail systems to lower their vulnerability to attack eg hiring more police officers introducing random screening of passengers and bags installing security cameras another is to reduce the potential consequences of an attack eg through coordinated emergency response training exercises with local first responders yet another is to make changes elsewhere that reduce the level of threat to those systems eg putting more money into intelligence and law enforcement to combat terrorism g11g156g156g158g142g156g561

highest security priorities in 2006 dhs also issued national infrastructure protection plan nipp to serve as guide to using risk management principles for prioritizing protection efforts within infrastructure sectors eg transportation and across sectors 29 the nipp required that sectorspecific agencies submit plans to dhs by december 2006 identifying critical assets evaluating the risk to them and developing measures to protect them the nipp ca lled for the sector plans to be developed by councils of federal state and regional and local government agencies involved in that sector along with sector councils made up of private sector stakeholders the government council for the transportation sector was formed in january 2006 but alone among the seventeen infrastructure sectors the transportation sector did not have private sector council as of march 2007 though reportedly each transportation mode has sector council 30 dhs indicates that once the modes are organized an overall transportation sector council will be formed31 dhs announced that the transportation sectorspecific plan along with the other sector plans and transportation modespecific annexes were completed on may

to all passenger rail and some other transit agencies and amtrak for fy2008 congress increased the amount provided annually for these grants significantly to 400 million 34 the passenger rail and transit communities have made security improvements but say they are constrained by the limits of available funding they assert that their primary security issue is finding way to pay for additional security improvements as noted earlier william millar president of apta has testified that the transit industry which includes busonly systems as well as rail systems but does not include amtrak has spent over 25 billion on security activities since 911 35 in 2004 survey apta members transitsystem operators were asked how much additional funding do you need in the longterm to complete your capital program to maintain modernize and expand your security function36 based on survey responses apta estimates that there are over 6 billion in unmet longterm security needs 52 billion in securityrelated capital investment for protection of infrastructure and vehicles enhancing evacuation capabilities and improving emergency response and 800 million annually in ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures 37 apta has repeatedly requested significant increases in federal grants to help pay for those security improvements funding security improvements for passenger rail has been primarily state and local responsibility advocates of greater federal responsibility for security funding argue that since the current concern is chiefly about attacks from terrorists the federal government should bear more responsibility for providing security funding reflecting its role of providing for the national defense advocates for more limited federal role in funding passenger rail security improvements argue that the federal government is exercising its national defense responsibility through funding national defense efforts and that taxpayers all over the country should not be required to pay for security improvements for relatively small number of transit agencies located in large metropolitan areas they note that comparisons with the level of federal spending for aviation

security and efficiency few would argue that passenger rail could ever be made invulnerable to attack also there appears to be general agreement that there are other federal security priorities beyond passenger rail some observers noting that the number of potential terrorist targets in the united statessuch as passenger trains and stations buses schools shopping malls sporting events etcis virtually limitless question the value of efforts to make each of these targets more secure they argue that many such efforts are not costeffective given that if one set of targetsfor example trainsis made more secure terrorists might simply shift to softer targets such as buses or shopping malls attacks on these targets could plausibly have similar impact to an attack on passenger train or subway moreover these security efforts impose variety of costs on the public in money time inconvenience and limitations on personal freedoms some observers argue that more effective strategy is to increase efforts to disrupt the terrorist groups that are the source of these threats eg funding for intelligence and law enforcement agencies and efforts to respond to an attack eg funding for first responders 41 also efforts to prepare transportation systems to resume operations quickly after an incidentreferred to as the resiliency of the systemis also seen by some observers as more valuable than efforts to further secure inherently vulnerable systems especially t hose systems that are not at the greatest risk or those assets that are not the most critical to system 42
