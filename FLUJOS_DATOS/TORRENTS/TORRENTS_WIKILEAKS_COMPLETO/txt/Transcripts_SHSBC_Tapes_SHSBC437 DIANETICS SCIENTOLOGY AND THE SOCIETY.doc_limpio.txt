dianetics scientology and society lecture given on 4 august 1966 thank you thank you very much what is the date audience four august ad 16 four august4 august ad 16 very good im glad you know what day it is now thats an advance now im real proud of you thewhat else do you know come on what else audience you are here you know audience yes hey good thats all right all right good enough what else huh female voice scientology works all right very good scientology works thats fine thats fine male voice dianetics works too what was that one male voice dianetics works too now now youre not supposed to say dianetics works the next thing you know youll have everybody doing dianetics and gettinggetting well and so forth you know there was one psychotherapist in new york completely packed up his practice in 1950 because hed been looking for cheap psychotherapy and he had found it in dianetics he said thats it he washas been researching for it and he said well youve got it and thats it it was quite interesting he had seen the various results of it its also interesting to that the medical world has not picked up the fact that psychosomatic medicine has been wrapped up now for some sixteen years oh well theyre bit slow you know bit slow well all right i havent the least idea of what im going to talk to you about today not the least i didnt bring any notes papers nothing i listenedi listened to mary sue on what shed been getting on the lines and she hadnt been getting very many errors through on her lines and i was around looking at everybody today though they all looked rather sad they were saying hello ron but you dont look sad now so i cant even undertake to merely pep you up you see well it could be worse i could give ayou know it could be worse you could be on some other planet of course the real laugh is somebody who came to the other dayyou know i just feel just like prisoner on this planet you know it was wog i said boy iwhat do you know perceptive well dianeticsdianetics is what ill talk to you about i could talk to you about lot of interesting history dianetics has probably got more history per square inch connected with it than any other activity thats ever occurred on this planet it hit something on the order of battering ram and it completely disorganized all lines in all directions but the planet has really never recovered from the impact thats the truth of the matter something did happen and then because along about 51 or something like that i stopped shoving dianetics as such you see why it sort of left the missing step at the bottom of the steps you know sort of feeling but of course thats sneaker because there is intention of leaving it abandoned forever because it is this field and sphere which does disclose the anatomy of the mind it is the entrance point to what the mind is all about it gives very definite if somewhat superficial clues to human behavior i say somewhat superficiallyits hilarious you know sometimessomebody trying to find his aberrations in this lifetime this poor bloke that just gotwent on mad jihad or amokthats the word the malays go amok and we had an american university boy go amok the other day and got up in the tower of the university of texas and slaughtered lot of people with rifles and that sort of thing it was interesting to that hed been to see psychiatristjust been to see psychiatrist told the psychiatrist all about it that he had impulses to do it and so forth and the psychiatrist said good boy and the fellow didnt turn up for his next appointment the psychiatrist never much bothered about it and then he went out and killed about 39 people ori dont know what the figure was 14 or something like that but it was interesting to meit was interesting to just as little side comment that if you read carefully into such casesmovie star commits suicidejust been to see psychiatrist another movie star commits suicide you know marilyn monroetype thingjust been to see psychiatrist what were those two guys that committed enough overts to blowburgess and who audience maclean oh burgess and maclean thats right they had just been to see psychiatrist at thejust before they departed they went to see psychiatrist now this bloke he had just been to see psychiatrist you see i dont like these statistics that go 100 percent now if guy wants to sit around and be something called psychiatrist thats perfectly all right with perfectly all right with for him to draw pay with it you know sit around back of the desk and look important and all that sort of thing but im novel im peculiar i think somebody whos being paid to do something should do it of course i know thats new strange idea now if the world of mental healing and that sort of thing was all wrapped up in dianeticsand with the refinement and smoothout which you have in dianetics right this minute that does wrap it up youre just using it for practice because let tell you somethingdianetics is small game thats like shooting rabbits when youre after water buffalo now thats the difference its not even that order of magnitude its like oh i dont know its like digging ditch by going out and counting the grains of sand that lie on top of where it should be you see its veryits very junior because when it was vivid and obvious that you were engaged in the resolution of the human spirit the address of the surface manifestations of the mind became quite secondary do you follow that now heh you dont head for few hours relief from lumbosis when you can give somebody eternity do you follow the order of magnitude you see between dianetics and scientology is hardly comparable but at this moment man is playing about pretending he knows something about the mind and he is playing about with shooting people in their gluteus maximus hoping that they will suddenly cease to be schizoparanoid or something they havent even got classifications that mean anything one dayone dayive told this story beforebut one day i was in an institution asking some of the psychiatrists some questions and i walked around and im always quite welcome in these institutions by the way they never look at with sneer they always talk to very respectfullyit throws themthrows them for complete loop you know they go huuh you know like that but then they re very nice and feed tea which im very careful to not drink and they talk to about it and they show all their records and they look at sort of oddly out of the corner of their eye and so forth but you see the secret is is they know what we do works you see it is not mystery to them their backflash where it exists against dianetics or scientology is because it is rival they think of it as rival and they think if it got ahead everybody would get well and where would they be weve had psychoanalysts and so forth quit being auditors because it wrapped up their practice and it was too much work for them to get more and more patients and they couldnt make enough money out of the patients fact fact one very prominent one up here in london he almost went broke on the subject because his procurement lines were too bad and hed been living off thirtyfive patients and then he started into practice and he cleaned up thirtyfive patients and that was that and all of sudden he found he was broke and he had to go outand where they procure people is in social engagements they go out andparties and things like this you see and hethe social strain then had to be stepped up and this was very tiring and he complained to about it very very bitterly and what we miss in these chaps is they dont have any goal of helping the human race and the psychiatrist who is seen merely just before the accident or the catastrophe is not there to help anybody or even prevent disaster you would be very interested to have discussion with such bloke because he wouldnt make any sense to you you know why youre processing people you see well he doesnt give you the same answers and these boys however are not all bad boys they are wrapped up into some kind of routine which they cant get out of in many states and areas its against the law not to electric shock people now theyve got new one on experimental surgery that one has to weigh the value of the individual i think it is or the individual against the good that the research will do whetherbefore you butcher one up and they call this equitable practice you see now that itnow ethicalits now ethical to butcher up if you can resolve it in your own mind that this will benefit lot of other people and then theres sort of shifty think here well lot of these boys are sps and those that arent soon become very pts and operating in an atmosphere of that particular character is quitenot to make any pun but is in actual fact quite maddening it is now when ive walked in the front door of an institutionthe early days i used to be very covert about itput collar on backwards and so forth but nowadays if it entered my head to go up and call on one of the local spinbins and so forth i would simply drivedrive up and walk in and hand them my card these boys well they dont understand what were doing because they dont have the same goals now if you want to help somebody why then you do something effective but supposing you didnt want to help anybody and supposing also you had mission of bringing law and order and supposing you didnt want to help the society either youd say well why is he in business well i dont know someday ill assign one of you project to go around and visit them all and find out why they are in business but its basically goals there is doubt in their mind but that dianetics worked and that was what made it so fearsome from one year to the next there are all sorts of philosophies come out they must come out at the rate of thousand or two year you know at least that even get into print and so forth well where do they go they dont go anyplace there must be new schools of psychology and so forth invented every couple or three months its quite rapid undoubtedly and yet one never hears anything of them and here sixteen years later we are still going forward and growing and that sort of thing well thats whats frightening about us were making headway now if we stopped helping people why maybe theyd be satisfied if we started to adopt goal line similar to the goal line of the current representative state or goal line that was representative of medicine or psychiatry or something like that and we fitted ourselves into their goal lines you see and perverted the technology so that it would act in that direction we would be very acceptable well i think its too high price its not even thinkable so i have philosophy about all of them and its very quickly statedto hell with them i rarely go around zoos wondering if im acceptable to the monkeys in the cage so dianeticsdianetics if we went straight forward with it as it exists in its present version would undoubtedly cut fantastic swath in the healing professions in the mental professions and that would be fine and one of the things that restrains us to some degree is its more or less owned territory but youre rewarding down statistic now you want to knowask this questionhow did medicine spin in because its pretty spinny how did psychiatry spin in how did the old alienist go by the boards you see the field of mental healing is one field where every decade or so you get change of title you realize that theres change of title now in an unsuccessful activity you get these title changes as you come along so that well in the 20s they were known as alienists not as psychiatrists now you go back down the line youll find out that they were known as different things weve forgotten the earlier ones but one day i was amusing myself and i thought isnt this interesting since about 1850 on forward theyve been known as about dozen different things and currently theyre known as psychiatrists and i imagine that will fade out and one of these days they will be known as mentalists or some other title now it isnt that the schools are going down its that the whole profession goes down and thats because that profession is giving all of its time and effort to an existing down statistic and it becomes very enturbulated now were we to engage upon such an activity we would have to be ourselves based so strongly our feet would have to be so solidly on the ground our economic framework would have to be so fantastically good and our success in other lines would havein thein what we are doing you see would have to be so great that we could afford at that time to take an offbeat or even distractive activity and carry on now thats very odd frame of reference to look at this sort of thing in but i wonder if you can envision standing on rather slippery log across roaring little brook with leather shoes on and trying to reach over while standing on that log and pick up big heavy stone out of that running water what do you think would happen to you now if you are firmly planted on the bank and you had rubber boots if you did step in the water and you were of stature and strength that if you were hit with 16inch shell it would dent itselfyes you could pick up that great big stone with the greatest of ease do you see well now an organization or activity which is going along in somewhat barbaric environmentyou know the west is scientific barbarism it is really not civilization not yet but it is very scientific and so on but its usages according to many societieswhat passes for politeness for instance in the west is so outrageously discourteous in more civilized societies that their hair stands on ends when they see people saying hello to each other the way they do in the western societies im not saying that is anything very important but man has to be pretty civilized and he has to be pretty understanding and he has to know his business pretty shocking well to be trusted with very much power actually the society is unbalanced at this time to the degree that it possesses scientific power without the gentler graces it has power without humanity and that to that extent is not civilization any group of cops can whistle up or any army in the west can whistle up an unlimited number of machine guns tear gas bombs all sorts of materials with which to injure wreck and ruin people you see but you know that they couldnt at this time whip up single technology to make somebody who was crying laugh or somebody who was laughing cry they are attempting to alter human behavior with forte main if you dont change and act better im going to hit you on the head with sledgehammer you see that is the approach of this civilization now into scene or view like that it is very dicey to put technology broadly in the road of those who are already accustomed to the abuse of technology you could only do it successfully if the technology itself advanced the state of case with such rapidity that it completely overcame the basic or any impulse to abuse it ive had the maddest conversations with psychiatrists very mad conversations very weird ive taught them how to run an engramtaught them how to find and run an engramive taught psychiatrist this and the guy comes back to absolutely bubbling over with enthusiasm oh ron he said this is marvelous this is marvelous you really have something in dianetics ive been trying for years and years and years with one of my paranoid schizophrenics to find the incident that was responsible for his insanity and he said you just handed it to on silver platter and i said well what was the incident well his father hadnt changed his diapers well i said very good after you found this what did you do well he said it was quite remarkable he all of sudden conceived that he was lying there in the crib with dirty diapers and he was starting to tell something about being angry with his father at that point and that was just what id been looking for so i was able to tell him at that moment that that explained all of his symptoms and i explained it all to him and so forth and i said well is the guy sane he said whats that got to do with it and i think that was the first time i ever reeled on the subject whats that got to do with it this person was sort of guinea pig that he kept in padded cell and he was able to find point in this guinea pig that hed been looking for for some time because he knew it was there and he used dianetics found the point in the guinea pig reverted to psychoanalytic evaluation techniques and so on and it put him right back in the padded cell again well ive had enough experiences this way that although i every now and then get an impulsewell i ought to whistle up whole bunch of psychiatrists and give them coursehuhhh i remember these things you know god for instance i had an argument the other day with medical doctor on the subject of the emeter he thought it worked because the auditor had strong personality he did he explained the whole thing to on that particular basis and what is shocking is electrogalvanometer in the detection of emotional responses have been known for 100 years he should have known this in his own technology but he had selected out the whole subject of the electrogalvanometer and had blamed it over on scientology and then he had said well actually its what the auditor wants it to say that it says well it gave you immediately his level of technical development now that was as much technical insight as he was capable of and he happens to be the most advanced physician in very large district and is the most liberal one there so when i see these things i say well we wont push in that directionwe wont push in that direction not yet we wont stand on this slippery log halfway across this stream and try to pull up any great big boulders like the totality of the health level of the human race the totality of the insane population of the west and so on i dont know how many heads of government there are in the west but anyway its just little bita little bit something but now you of course youve got your hands on refined smoothedout highly experienced dianetics this is sleekedup alfa romeo compared to model t ford of 1912 you see and the dianetics which you got your hands on if you listen to the couple of lectures i have given you on it and studied the bulletin real hard read dianetics the modern science of mental health for interest and background but follow the directions in those tapes and bulletin and youve got very very very smoothrunning proposition you have your paws on an emeter which tells you whether or not the fellow is running or not we didnt have those things in 1950 youve got all kinds of things to assist you in this direction you have technical materials of the composition of the mind which are in actual fact senior to those we had in 1950 great many unexplained things still existed 16 years ago well theyve all been solved in scientology see youre taking off from the tremendous technical background of scientology and going back to its immediate entrance background of course this isthis isthis is very very easy to clarify and its very easy to do and i am very sure that more than one is going to get terrific urge to get ahold of mama and cure her lumbosis well go ahead but dont please hang out shingle its true the world will beat path to your door but we have to modify that on the basis that it will be very sick world that beats path to your door now you say this is good entrance point you can do this and you can do that the best way to handle this is bring them into scientology and then teach them dianetics so that they can get grip on the subject and tell them its just training procedure go ahead and let them get well were looking here at somethingthat something is going to happen theres something going to come out of this that is differentthat is peculiar we are advancing the most powerful psychosomatic technology on the planet out as training technique into planetary area which never dreamed of anything that advanced now please as it advances dont lose sight of the fact that there is such thing as scientology and that the salvage of body is secondary to the salvage of being now true enough it is great to be able to salvage body so that you can salvage the being and there you will find use for dianetics fellows just got through having an automobile accident and so you want to straighten him out so he can get back to his auditingwell run the engram you see some girl has just lost her husband or something run the moment of loss as secondary and spill it and you can get on with more serious auditing it has use it has use but the main thingthe main thing is remember that youre in the field of the salvage of the actual being not the salvage of his peculiarities now if you wanted to trace the particular peculiarities of joe jinx or bill slats you undoubtedly could find chain of engrams which would match those characteristics which when run would change his behavior to some degree do you know why because its more fundamentallife has been dedicated to going wrong in that direction so of course hes accumulated tremendous number of incidents which demonstrate going wrong in that direction do you follow this fellowthis fellow he just loves to crack up airplanes it seems like every time he turns around hes cracking up an airplane so you decide that those three crackups that he had in world war ii which have got him all messed upthat these if run would of course solve his cracking up airplanes well youre in for big lose you turn him loose and he doesnt crack one up for quite while but then he cracks one up and this tends to give you lose well you didnt go fundamental enough actually hes been cracking up airplanes for very long time hes probably been cracking up airplanes for an awful long time and therefore if you dont accept the spiritual nature of man you cant make dianetics work because it goes back too far he was cracking up airplanes on marcab and he was cracking up airplanes in the galactic federation and he has just been having ball cracking up airplanes now there is scientology technique which gets him over cracking up airplanes and thats have him go out and do reach and withdraw on airplanes until you get free needle just bring him up to present time on the subject and bring him out of the masses which are making him crack up airplanes without bothering to inquire what mass is making him crack up airplanes you get the different approach now the probability for cracking up airplanes probably be very slightbe very slight he might go for several lifetimes before he gets stuck in it again and the possibility is that he would havehe chipped off enough of it that it ceases to be game but scientology technology is just that much stronger now it is perfectly true that in one lifetime several experiences can absolutely ruin somebody it is absolutely true that as long as theuse freudian expressiontraumatic shock is contained in broken leg that is to say the mental reaction to having gotten the broken leg of the experience itselfas long as that remains intact healing of the leg will be normal youll get normal healing or you will get long drawnout healing but if it takes six weeks for broken legs break to heal if you ran the incident of breaking the leg and if it didnt run trace it back down just in this lifetime to the first time he hurt that leg you would reduce the time of healing from six weeks to two weeks and this is one of the wildest bafflers that medical doctors have ever run into with dianetics you see auditors for very long time have been using dianetics its one of the tools of the auditor now today with faster techniques and so on why we have auditors who have sort of dropped this to marked degree out of the kit but most of your oldtimers will still think in terms of running an engram ah well the guy busted his head on the walk and so lets run the engram you know i burned my finger and he will either do scientology touch assist on it but if that isnt working too well hell get more fundamental and run an engram they still were using engram running as patchup mechanism all of this is very amusing to look at healing technology as merely an assistive and somewhat unimportant activity but thats what it is but it comes into the auditors kit at time when injury or illness prevents auditing and thats its use in practice if actual advance for the being is being seriouslyseriously hindered why youve still got the running of secondaries and engrams to help you out in other words you have use for it you can patch him up so that you can audit him on scientology techniques well this is possiblethis is possible somebody is so arthritic that they can hardly sit stillwell one of the things that running of engrams does and secondaries and so forth is tends to cure arthritis but it keys it out and lot of people have recovered this way theres lot of these things you see you wont say its cure for arthritis it isnt because the time would go on and the basic reasons the person had arthritis might key back in on it again and hed get arthritis again but it would give you enough time to come out of it for instance i know of an instance relatively short time ago where too much overwhelm on case had resulted in an illness which had to be addressed by running out some of the efforts to cure the illness you know efforts had been made to cure the illness and then they had to be run out but this was on high level auditing and it was rather disheartening to find in very short space of time that it blew anyway on the auditing which it had but there was just this moment when it seemed to be too overwhelming to permit actual auditing and so process of running some engrams was utilized in order to take the edge off and let the person go on with it that was actual physical illness occurring so it has some use and its certainly something that fellow ought to know how to do ive seen some very spectacular things happen ive seen goiter about the size of very large baseball visibly shrink and disappear in the space of one half of an hour right after an engram was run and i will say thisthe engram was not well run either i have seen several bad conditions of the body and so on disappear ive also seen mental conditions alter i have also seen the insane turn sane and thats one of the easier tricks youd be surprised how many insane can run engrams person is considered to be totally hopeless you know and yet they were just ptsjust potential trouble source that was all and you run few incidents and you would be very interested how well they do run the incidents it was up to point where i concluded that being sane or insane had nothing whatsoever to do with the state of case i know that sounds absolutely outrageous but it would just be manifestation or behavior pattern it wasnt whether the person could be audited easily or with difficulty that determined whether he was sane or insane person could be audited with great ease person was audited with great difficultyit had nothing to do whatsoever with his state of case i know that it sounds so funny but the insane very often audit like baby buggy and theyll run incidents the funny part of it is theyre usually trythey usually want to run the incident the psychiatrist has kept telling them it isnt true theyve run this incident and they tried to tell the psychiatrist about this and psychiatrist just says delusions hallucination wont even listen so they arc break him on it and about the first thing they do is present you withis something and theyll run it off and of course it possibly is by this state of the game bit delusory and that sort of thing the basic incidents gotten all messed up you see with so much suppression but they kind of want to run that then they sometimes will be very very very thoughtful about telling you anything about it and you eventually can get it rolling but the alarming thingthe alarming thing in institutions and so oni found in institutions very large population in the institution has been put there for different reasons than sanity theyve been put there by the family for this reason or that reason or the other reason and finally you get to conclusion that families tend to be bit suppressive in some cases and they get suppressive to the point of where even where person isnt insane they will get the person put away that is the main danger of having an institution and of having civil rights suspended because of condemnation of insanity you mustnt suspend civil rights simply because somebodys declared insane he hasnt ceased to be member of the human race when youwhen you look outsidethe behavior outside institutions and behavior inside institutions and so on you begin to wonder if the psychiatrist does know his job you wonder about it the rising statistic of the number of insane in western countries is so fantasticitd only be very suppressive society or government that would ever give it another penny appropriation theyd say hey you guys have failed man you failed in big way but going up against an activity that is already being rewarded if it has down statistic tends to bring you into the picture as being rewarded because you make down statistics and the next thing you know why everything youre trying to do is corroded so my solution for the whole thing is to leave it alone let themlet them golet them go spin let them go spin practitioner and practicedon alike and so on and do what you can because you see we are on winning line you see making the able more able may not be as profitable financially as it could be made but it is much sounder on basis of personal and organizational repute and growth what do you wind up with you wind up with bunch of able people well how able can somebody get ah well this is not lecture on that subject but the mainthe main thing to keep in mind about this and there is something here to know is that if you for instance set up someplace to cure lumbosis on all comers you yourself are standing on slippery log across roaring stream because trying to pick up one of those guysaaaaaaaaah manits picking up the black rock out of the middle of the roaring brook its very slippery you find yourself being caved in on from all quarters not the law you find yourself being caved in on by the family and the friends and by the guy himself and so on you are in immediatelyin an enturbulated area your own case tends to park up i have seenive seen an auditor attempting to handle an insane personauditor despite ones remonstrances not to and so forth just went out and tried to handle this insane person and either out of the goodness of his heart or because of the size of in one case of his brothers fortuneauditor was being paid fortune to do something for this insane brotherand in every case i have seen the auditor solely and totally tied up completely utterly and so forth for months on end doing nothing else but holding somebodys hot hand and trying to carry through and do something about it wow you talk about the investment of effort terrific and at the end of that time ive never seen it otherwise happen that the auditor that did it even when hes got the guy slightly out of the woods or has brought him out of the woods ive never seen him otherwise than get kick in the teeth my case histories on this sort of thing is that it doesnt pay to award the down statistic so here are five guys walking down the street and one of them is as mad as the hatter now if that bird who is quite mad had brother who had 80 million pounds who was willing to pay an auditor 10000 dollars or 10000 pounds an hour to cure him and the other four fellows didnt have any money at all i can assure you you would be much further ahead to audit any other of the four youd be much further ahead to audit any others of the four its just experience pure unadulterated experience now institutionally ive gone into jails and gone into institutions and looked at people ive had lots of discussions with doctors on their patients and so on im not quite as illinformed on this subject as psychiatrists if you or i went out and shot somebody dead theyd throw us into the electric chair or the gas chamber or something like that and we would be dispensed with with great rapidity but not an insane person not an insane person he can go out and he can take pistol and shoot 15 people and if he doesnt get killed in the process why he comes into court and his friend the psychiatrist comes in and says the mans insane oh hes insane is he well well put him in nice institution and he can sit there for the rest of his life or as long as it takes the doctors to do something for him well well put him over there we take allcare of him and get all the social workers working on him an appropriation of about 18000 bucks and so forth and there he is and good and do you know that in some of those cases nobody ever bothers to follow them through do you know that in as little as three days the guy is right back on the street having been sent to the institution as insane for murder just give him an electric shock and put him out in the street and sometimes not even electric shock the psychiatrists look him over and say well the man isnt dangerous and let him out in the street again it happens at saint elizabeth all the time washington its got the washington police absolutely groggy guy beats up about three cops and busts up whole bar they send him in and some psychiatrist drooling and buhrgling and blibbling comes in and says oh hes insane your honor so this guy is just shipped across the river to saint elizabeths and walks around there for two or three days and then the doctors let him out and hes back on the street again and its gotten so the cops wont arrest them anymore they say why bother why bother how can we keep law and order because if guys good and insane he can get away with anything thats pretty steep reward for down statistic isnt it pretty steep reward for total lawlessness and so on yeah man you start doing that very long you get all kinds of wild things happening very unpleasant things start happening in society i notice now that every time the us police try to stop riot somebody in congress or somewhere in washington will be very critical of the police handling of the situation but wont say very much about the ringleaders theyre working up to point now where the creditable action is to riot this is the rewarded action if you riot you get prize they pass bill in congress to reward you well thats rewarding the down statistic the fellow is not supporting the country not keeping law and order busting things up looting stores tearing everything to pieces so what do we do with this well lets give him more lets give him more social workers lets give him more dole lets give him more votes lets give him more rights you get the idea rewarding that down statistic hey how about all of the citizens around who werent in riots and who werent looting stores you see well they have to pay the tax that rewards the guy who did so the penalty of an up statistic now suppressive society always penalizes the up statistic and it rewards the down statistic so in society such as this one you could make yourself very agreeable by awarding the down statistic of illness and insanity and penalizing the up statistic sayinggoing around saying well we dont know that youngthat boy in school seems to be awfully bright hes probably very abnormal we probably ought to put him in an institution he got through his classes twice as fast theres great liability to genius you see they always go to piecesuh you know i mean if we went along with total agreement like this society would love us well i dont care to be loved in that framework were swimming against the stream but we have to ask the question is it any kind of stream you want to swim with because by swimming with the stream youd go over niagara falls with barrel now therefore in some peculiar way we are able to hold constant and we are holding constant of ethical conduct we are holding constant on the subject of doing the best we can and helping other people weour impulses in this direction are very good they are not neither getting better nor worse theyre very good theyve been constant for about sixteen years always tried to help our fellow man keep our own nose clean and so forth and while we have been doing thatif we were just doing that we would get someplace you see the rest of the society has been kind of going by the boards you didnt see riots like this ten years ago in the united states twenty years ago they werent quite handling psychiatry the way theyre handling it today you didnt see millions of dollars being appropriated to the reward and housing and feed and care of bunch of nuts if we were merely holding constant we would win i remember fred allen the old american comedian and he said one time that the quality of humor and humorists had sunk to such low ebb as to leave him on pinnacle and we would sort of be like that you see i mean if it was just constant and we kept on true to our own ideals and so on wed still be holding the fort as the society decayed we would remain pretty well where we were and it would leave us on pinnacle and we would then be turned to eventually now however that is not what were doing although our motives and so forth are quite constant our state of case or size of the movement is not thats growing thats with exclamation points now everyone connected with it is getting more able individually and we have at this moment 22 clears well theyre just now being enrolled in part i of the ot course and i dont know if itll ever cost anything or not but i have said just as start so that we can get the enrollment done that the first 30 clears got part i for nothing we reward up statistics early up statistics we reward but actually the curriculum on it is all mapped for part i and so on its very precise very sensible we do things in very straightforward sort of way now this of course doesnt present picture of us remaining on constant plateau with the society sinking away it presents us on rising plateau while the society sinks now where do you think thats going to leave us as far as control and influence in the society is concerned it right now my whereabouts and activities are source of worry to governments and they are and if government which recently said i shouldnt stay then refused to make any statement on the subject time after time and even in their parliament refused to all the parliamentary members to give any reason why hubbard was not permitted to stay its rather interesting isnt it compounded with the fact that communication has just been received sort of around the back door that if i would request permanent residency now it would be granted second thoughts are occurring here this is proving embarrassing i got letter the other dayif they reject you then i dont want anything to do with them some chap there you see and i found out that it has caused split in political parties and new party is being formed yes and somebody sent through document the other day and asked to rewrite it for this new political party weird things are happening now what is the importance of this the importance of this is we are of concern not we and what i do and so forth is well iswell is two three years ago when that fda thing was onprobably nobody has ever told you what happened to the fda thing i dont think the thing was ever finalized because the government doesnt dare finalize it because weve got suit against them for million or million and half if we want to place it and i dont know what the final outcome of that is or if any more recent news than this isexists on it but were longer being obstructed and there were two senate hearings pardon two congressional hearings one senate and one house in which the government came off second best the courts all found in our favor and so on and i keep hearing that our lawyers are supposed to have conference with the government lawyers so that they can find some resolution to the problem of how do they give us our materials back without themselves getting sued and i keep hearing about that i wish somebody would do something about it because i dont think the government should be permitted to stand around like that if iti think it should be brave enough to say all right you can sue us or maybe we could make deal with them and so forththey give us the pentagon or something and but that was fiasco to end all fiascoes and when it was at its height why they said you have to be awful careful about this fellow hubbard because hes liable to appear almost anywhere theres telling where he will pop up and this was evidently of considerable importance although australia was willing to knock us all over the place and say all sorts of things and so forth the one thing they wouldnt permit was my appearance nouh they knew they were safe as long as they didnt do that they knew somebodyit could all be made look silly see unless somebody started talking sensibly see so their whole strategy was to keep out while it did it well actually libel and slander in great britain in the commonwealth is toexists if fair trial has not occurred of course i wasnt on trial anyhow but scientology was but fair trial if fair trial occurred it can then be reported in newspapers but if it was not fair trial its libel and slander so the poor old daily mail and the rest of those papers hehhehheh there they go theyre right over niagara falls and theyre very worried naturally because they reported something where the principal was not permitted to appear and you cant get less fair trial than that on the principals request to appear to the attorney general the head of the inquiry the like said couldnt appear and even went so far as i couldntwe couldnt guarantee his personal safety if he did appear and then wrote letters and signed them to this effect so of course the second that this is presented in the court in great britain obviously everything has been written since that time is libel and slander and the judge cannot help but find in that direction for the excellent reason that by definition if it was not fair trial it mustnt be reported so the only contest is not whether scientology is good or bad but whether or not that australian inquiry was fair hearing in view of the fact that its very easy to demonstrate that it was notthey perjured theythe qc was sitting there scratching himself under the armpit saying well yes we know you lied and so forth and its all right yes go ahead he did its right inits right in the transcript he knew that it was perjury and he knew the fellow had been lying throughout the whole thing and said good good didnt strike it from the recordnothing intimidated witnesses one psychiatrist started to testify in our favor the qc instantly called recess got ahold of the guy took him out in the lobby talked to him and the guy went and sat back on the stand and became hostile witness we dont know whether money or threat changed hands but its in the transcript and this sort of thing their irregularities were as great as you would expect from bunch of criminals and so therefore thats very easy to win but you look this over youll find out that as we go along the line and so on we win these things but it looks like were not doing too well because nobody ever announces in the newspapers that we win now east grinstead up here on their planning heh or whatever they call itits planning they always played this gag in the courier doctor hubbard refused planning thats headlines see and several years ago the society and the little community here had gotten into the opinion that we just were turned down all over the place and all of sudden the manager of the felbridge hotel saidtook look down here and he said how do you people get all these planning permissions because the truth of the matter was that every time we got planning permission it was buried in the last paragraph along with bunch of others in minutes of the local committee see but every time we were refused one we were given headlines the fact is that we get more planning permissions than anybody else in this entire area they frankly just shovel them out to us this is very peculiar you see but the attitude of mind is that we fail along this line all the time thats very funny so you get this on an international basis it must at length appear very surprising and very peculiar that these scientologists who are always being knocked aroundeverybody says how bad they arein the press and that sort of thinghow they keep on being there and keep on growing now the end result of all this regardless of whether we do anything or not will be for people to realize that thats been nothing but pack of lies the whole way thats been said about us the truth will eventually out dont you see but we of course are source of terror to suppressive type activities and i was told by the rhodesian heralds chief reporter that the only thing their government some of the sps in the government were worried abouthe didnt use that terminology but he said the only thing theyre worried about is i might teach scientology to the africans and they considered this would be something they would not like and we just had visitor from there yesterday came up had lot of interesting news nothing we didnt know really but it doesnt make any sense in the final analysis that if youre so bad how come you keep on getting better see that wont make any sense so you could probablywe could probably go on up the track and live that out and everybodyd forget about the rest of it anyway regardless of what we did about it in the last result entheta can normally be dropped you can normally drop entheta enturbulated theta you can just normally drop it it looks bad for while and it might have some lousy consequences to drop it that way but if you use this rule why just remember that the only person who would find this hard and fast rulethe neglect of enthetawould be an ot he can always neglect entheta he couldnt possibly be hurt by it you see but if youre way down the line and somebody is doing this that and the other thing and so on why if you sometimesif you dont take some action why you find yourself very much in the soup and sometimes you have to act rather rapidly but the higher you get the more you can ignore it now i go too far ive alwayshave gone too far in this because i dont thinki dont think thati am known for what the newspapers say about nor will i be known for what the newspapers say about and i dont think fool talking requires any attention now this of course sometimes makes it rather hard on other people occasionally that i dont get up and make thorough steamroller campaign out of something or other i made campaign out of that fda thing i backed it right straight up and they did great job backing up in washington and we settled it the only reason the australian inquiry went so far is that was really being shoved over and badly handled by the persons who were handling it for us there on the ground at the time they wouldnt obey any of our instructions that was what made that rough one now the problem of what you do with what you know is determined by the framework of the society in which you are working and it is notits not always the same solution you dont always get the same answer because you get different society you get different environments different surroundings into which you can use what you know now you can imagine violinist from the philharmonic orchestra going out to lumber camp and playing for the lumberjacks now im sure he would amuse the lumberjacks but if he did not monitor his action or exhibition of skill against the environment in which he was performing he would probably be quite unpopular and might even become damaged so although it is very well to have constant of action and we can really congratulate anyone who is sufficiently powerful to always act constantly and apply the same solution to all situationsthis is quite admirablewhen you still got one foot in the human race and human yourself you wont find that this is too easy to do youre not strong enough yet so you monitor your use of technology against the environment in which you find yourselfyour application and use of it now ive just had sort of roundabout invitation from another african country we get invitations every once in while weve had an invitation from communist country within the last year to train some auditors for them we didnt care to reward the down statistic and we didnt do it but another country has just been heard from ifs very nebulous theres nothing concrete about this but you speak of different environments if i were operating in that country which is athe african has taken over there the operating atmosphere would be entirely different i can assure you of that but what id probably have to teach them would be dianetics very fast very easy to grab very few misunderstood words could occur because you could teach them solidly you could bring about the results with definitely that and the possibility of there being any obstruction to your activities or necessity to take counterlegal action i mean ethical action to safeguard what you were doing is practically zero because the proposal comes from the minister of health now this sort of thing tells you that you wont always act or operate in the same way in every society or group in which you find yourself now ill give you good example dont go in amongst group of people dedicated to the fact that there is god and eternity and man is meat and try to pull gradient that they can easily reject because they can reject an abrupt approach that man is spiritual being etc etc etc see once more you would find yourself way ahead by using dianetics thatll give you very good entrance point but i seriously doubt amongst moslems that dianetics would be much of an entrance point and i can tell you from experience that amongst asians it would be hardly any entrance point at all the headon entrance point amongst asians would be is well actually you can achieve bodhi now in about 30 seconds and theyd say hey waitwait hold it hold it hold it wheres the red carpet where is and then your main problem would be trying not to choke to death in the midst of joss fumes because they got the early technology on this 2500 years ago very choked up with the subject of burning incense and casting brass idols see theyd be different approaches now medical doctor will in actual fact listen to dianetics and so will psychiatrist where he cant even begin to grasp or handle any part of scientology which treats man as spiritual being its so slight that you couldnt even teach him really touch assist so that he would be convinced that it was working see touch assist belongs to scientology scientology are the broad shotgun techniques that got things done you see dianetics is running it out bit by bit now when you try to disseminate scientology youre really up against problem today of not how do you stand up and suffer all the slings and arrows but how do you tailormake what you know to fit the group to whom you speak to because listen it isnt false to do that you have the whole vast panorama of existence the mind the spirit religion youve got the entirety of life as bin out of which you can pull fragments out of the subject to offer people and it is simply in actual fact our dullness that prevents us from disseminating we just dont select the pieces which would come near enough the case and social framework of the person were talking to in order to bring reality you see youre trying to sell him what he already knows see down deep he knows this but this is all covered by tremendous amount of false information but somewhere there is an entrance point in every case really there is an entrance point and there being an entrance point all you have to find is that point of gradient of what you know about existence which he does not have to protest and which he does not have to argue with in order to preserve quote his own integrity unquote thats it so at what point or what point can we enter see the problem i talk by the hour to medical doctors about dianetics and scientology i dont have to talk to them very long but theyre sitting there with their mouth dropped very appreciative of the whole thing is that so oh yes you know and they fit it into their framework and run with the ball and youre all set you know if you cant get the other guy to contribute somewhat to the conversation its ceased to be an agreement so in actual fact if you wanted with malice aforethought to disseminate broadly madly in all directions and so on you would simply estimate the persons or groups to whom you were seeking to speak and having estimated would then give them something with which they could agree without violating their own mores without violating their own fixed ideas and also never give them something which is false just to agree because your force and impact consists of the fact that you speak truth well now truth is such fast arrow that it can go through without the fellow ever finding out hed been shot he merely experiences tiny little shock its below his level of reality and inspection he merely feels uncomfortable and any resistance that you get in any conversation and so forth is youre just machinegunning the guy down and some of the bullets are going through and theyre making him very uncomfortable and so on hes not quite sure whats happening to him he recognizeshe begins to feel that hes under attack he doesnt recognize he is he doesnt think hes being helped he thinks hes being attacked i remember person that was properly approached by scientologist it was actually the scientologist sold it to her mothersold scientology to her mother thats almost impossible in most cases you know thats very hard to do and i remember now she gave her mother sighting the problem that her mother was having gave her the scientology datum that resolved the problem that her mother was having and persuaded her mother to use it and her mother used it and from that time thereon actually cant be made to advance or anything else because that was too good and then the girl since that time has not foundnever flattened the process seenever found another problem mother was having to give her the scientology datum that solved that problem but of all things you see scientology is useful and unless you give people things they can use you know that you can use data you dont have to use processing all the timeunless you can give somebody something that he can use why hes not likely to have much use for it hes not likely to be terribly interested in it but you have to estimate your audience very very accurately and if you do that right your proper response isshort of youre having confronted an spyour response of course is gee wheres this been all my life it hasnt really anything to do with their religious fixations or convictions it hasnt anything to do with their social mores or anything else now there is something about the road to truth it can never be traveled partially so if you do not provide some way in which to let them go on travelling on the road you can also get into trouble if there is notno matter how tiny the crack in the door is left open there must be some way for them to go further dont just leave them totally parked thats tantamount to to introduce somebody to the fact hey heres the broad highway by which you go to glory eternity you become eternal life and you know yourself that you are immortal and there you are and there are certain technology is known about this and there are certain books and courses that are taught i dont have the address just now of where this is taught but anyway it exists and goodbye you just sentenced somebody to auditing you see but an estimation of to whom you are trying to speak and an estimation of where they sit on the tone scale and an estimation of what problems they have and what use they can have for the data and so onall of these things come into the whole field of dissemination now dianeticsdianetics definitely has dissemination role and when i tell you not to practice dianetics on people im being very very factual but im not telling you the whole statement let them practice dianetics you digging it now the greater truth lies in the field of scientology but the experience lies in dianetics so for scientology auditor to go and run dianetic engrams on somebody or hang up shingle on this in fact would be silly but to get together group of people teach them all about the fundamentals of the mind and get them to run secondaries and engramsthat wouldnt be silly just tell them youre getting them in practice so that they can go on and practice so that they would know something eventually about the mind now we have use for dianetics right now and its very positive use for dianetics were trying to get auditors so they can have some auditing time and get some practice auditing because in scientology you dont get any practice auditing and thats its positive and direct reason but looking this over little bit further youre also absorbing lot of very valuable technology and that valuable technology comes into the field of dissemination and so that if you get very slippy and very smart with this technology its just about the most interesting sales technology or dissemination technology you ever had anything to do with and you can say well what do i do with group of people that i gather together well you actually had passed out of the field where that you could give them an auditing technology because you couldnt give them scientology auditing technology they overran it and abused it and that sort of thing but you can give them dianetic technology and you might find that it would be very very difficult for you to stand up and have many people stay around if you simply talk to them about their souls whereas you might find they got very very enthusiastic indeed if you taught them how to run engrams and secondaries do you follow so its dissemination technology now youll find theres many points fit in this ive done lot of drills with this myself ive even sold scientology to newspaper reporters with dianetic techniques take metertake meter tune it in put the guy on it say here ill show you how this thing works yes thats good fine all right good now i dont want you to say anything youre not to say word dont answer any of my questions and im going to tell you about your last accident and have you ever been in the newsin an automobile accident yes all right youve been in an automobile accident and lets see how many years ago was that was that more than five years less than five years its less than five years is it one year two years three years its three years all right now lets see three years ago okay thats fine now were you driving were you not driving the fellow all of sudden he cant behe cant be prevented from speaking any longer and he simply tells you all about it he gets the somatics turned on and so forth and he suddenly realizes that he had never known before that he went into the dashboard with his knee you see guy walks out of there sold theres lot you can do with this sort of thing well now i didnt tell him he had lived before i didnt tell him he was spiritual being i didnt tell him anything i just found piece of his experience almost as featherweight as being fortune teller i was mean enough in that instant not to run it out i just left the somatic on dissemination and what youre learning right now in dianetics is your finest dissemination technology now it has the liability that if you tell everybody they can cure up everything on each other with it youre in trouble the odd part of it is i never wrote that forward to book one and i never made that statement about any two people its very interesting isnt it they were both publisher promotions it was medical doctor who wrote thatany two people can cure up 70 percent of mans illness actually went into their first literature without my permission medical profession is saying that is what is wrong with it well it was one of their honored members who invented it he invented that statement i never agreed with it particularly now you have terrific dissemination tool when you talk to people about scientology why go on talking about scientology dont tell them this is dianetics dont try and get technical and deny everything and explain it all sideways and so forth say well scientology has great deal to do with the mind i want to show you something about the mind and so forth have you ever been worried about anything you know as though this would be rare you know dont solve it for him with scientology technology of overt actmotivator sequences people cant accept that much responsibility solve it for them quite otherwise say did you ever have member of your family that was worried like that the old straightwire technique aunt agatha do you ever remember aunt agatha being worried like that yes as matter of fact i do good how are you now gosh for gods sakes i ceased to worry about it well what have you done youve justyouve just attracted his attention to picture and keyed it out there are some tricks of this particular charactervery interesting tricks theres also the tricks of incidents youve explained to somebody to meyou should hear explaining how an engram prevents blood circulation in the area of an injured limb to medical doctor they buy it every time i say well it cuts down communication so of course that cuts down the blood circulation too doesnt it oh yes i see oh thats how it speeds up healing i say yeah thats the way it speeds up healing of course there are few other things in connection with it but we wont go into those just now now i want you to think along this line while youre talking to people and trying to explain it to them and so forth you have the raw materials that are very close to the surface in any human being if he could see his first picture he would make terrific case gain youre handling then not just an auditing practice drill and so forth you are in actual fact handling the most powerful dissemination tool there is your knowledge of the anatomy of the engrams and secondaries of the mind and so on put into your hands terrific absorbing interest on the part of any human being you talk to now i want you to get little practice using them that way and stop telling people that theyre immortal thetans who will be ots tomorrow and have lived before okay thank you very much
