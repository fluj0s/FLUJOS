implications for us interests and crs issue brief ib92109 armeniaazerbaijan conflict are related reports updated regularly background levon terpetrosyan the first president of independent armenia resigned on february 3 1998 terpetrosyan had been an active member of the karabakh committee created in 1988 to advocate unification with armenia of the mostly armenianinhabited nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan in 1989 members of the karabakh committee formed the armenian national movement anm to work politically on armenian issues within the thenrapidly changing soviet system and won seats in the armenian supreme soviet or parliament in august 1990 parliament elected terpetrosyan from among six candidates to be president communist was his main opponent terpetrosyan was elected president of independent armenia with 83 of the vote in an october 1991 national election that was widely lauded as both free and fair terpetrosyans main objective as president was to ensure the survival of armenia as an independent state status it had enjoyed only from 191820 during the twentieth century terpetrosyans commitment to democracy was questioned as he apparently came to regard the legitimate political opposition as threat to his goal in june 1992 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 terpetrosyan accused leader of his possibly strongest rival the armenian revolutionary federation arfdasnaktsutyun or dashnaks of collaborating with russian intelligence and exiled him in december 1994 terpetrosyan banned the arf accusing the party of terrorism and other crimes the supreme court upheld the ban only on the grounds that some arf leaders were noncitizens terpetrosyanled constitutional commission created system of government with very strong president and weak legislature the constitution was approved in july 1995 referendum held simultaneously with parliamentary elections which international observers termed free but not fair the presidents anm and its supporters secured overwhelming control of the legislature in september 1996 terpetrosyan was reelected president in vote so severely flawed that international observers suggested it might weaken public confidence in the integrity of the election process1 the conduct of the 1995 and 1996 elections undermined the legitimacy of the ter petrosyan regime in response the president reshuffled his government but was still considered isolated from the people to shore up domestic support terpetrosyan named robert kocharyan then president of the selfdeclared but internationally unrecognized nagornokarabakh republic to be prime minister of armenia kocharyan is national hero because of his leadership of the karabakh selfdefense forces which defeated azerbaijan militarily and achieved physical control over nagornokarabakh and adjacent areas totaling 20 of azeri territory prior to may 1994 ceasefire in the war terpetrosyan had begun market reforms and during his tenure armenia initially made more progress in this area than most other former soviet states nonetheless the transition from communism brought economic hardships and the poverty of many armenians increasingly contrasted with the corruption and wealth of few moreover in the last few years the economic growth of other former soviet republics including neighboring georgia and azerbaijan has outpaced armenias as structural reform in armenia lost momentum in 1997 armenias gross domestic product gdp grew by 3 its estimated rate of inflation was 22 and unemployment was 20 according to the international monetary fund imf terpetrosyan contended that economic progress was inhibited by azeri and turkish blockades imposed in response to the karabakh armenians territorial gains he concluded that armenians had to make concessions in the peace process to get the blockades lifted and stabilize their economy effects of the minsk group peace plan international mediators have been trying to end the conflict over nagornokarabakh since 1992 in september 1997 terpetrosyan accepted the twostage peace plan of the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce minsk group cochairs2 in the first stage karabakh armenians would withdraw from all azeri geographic positions except the lachin corridor connecting armenia and nagornokarabakh international peacekeepers would deploy refugees would return and the azeri blockades of armenia and karabakh would be lifted among other measures discussion of karabakhs political status would occur in later second stage terpetrosyan argued that 1 see crs report 96981f armenia democratization derailed by carol migdalovitz 2 the formal osce proposal has not been made public however media azeri armenian and american officials have reported on aspects of the plans contents crs3 the international community would not accept either karabakhs full independence or its unification with armenia perhaps leading him to conclude that talks on status at this time would be unproductive for the armenian side other armenians did not share terpetrosyans assessment his domestic political opponents accused him of treason while his prime minister and other government officials openly disagreed with him nagornokarabakh government officials rejected phased solution and insisted that any agreement contain at least outlines of political status that would not resubordinate karabakh to baku they argued that if armenians withdrew from azeri territory first then baku would have incentive to negotiate status terpetrosyan reportedly was totally isolated at heated joint meeting of armenian and karabakh officials on january 78 1998 events in the following weeks included mysterious assaults on terpetrosyan allies3 and strident charges and countercharges by his supporters and opponents on february 1 yerkrapah parliamentary grouplegal militia comprised of veterans of the karabakh conflict formally headed by the defense minister fatefully joined its voice to calls for ter petrosyans resignation over 40 anm deputies defected to yerkrapah depriving the anm of its control of parliament and prompting the parliaments speaker committee chairmen and other anmaffiliated officials to resign the debate in the armenian government ended with terpetrosyans resignation as president on february 3 in his letter of resignation terpetrosyan declared the known bodies of power have demanded my resignation this was believed to refer to prime minister kocharyan minister of defense vazgen sarkisyan and minister of interior and national security serzh sarkisyan the ministries of defense and interior control the army and police and all physical power in the country although force was not used to effect terpetrosyans departure its specter may have expedited his resignation the president bereft of popular support lacked any means to counter his opponents with speaker available to act as president as constitutionally required prime minister kocharyan the second in line became acting president on february 4 election of president the first round of an extraordinary election to choose terpetrosyans replacement was held on march 16 there were 12 candidates none was from the anm the main contenders were acting president kocharyan defeated 1996 challenger vazgen manukyan and karen demirchyan the communist leader of armenia from 1974 to 1988 who had not been politically active in years candidate achieved majority and run off election was held between kocharyan and demirchyan on march 30 demirchyans strong showing in the first round was attributed to nostalgia for economic and other stability of the past his views on karabakh were less formed than those of kocharyan although demirchyan said that he could deal with his old communist colleague azerbaijans president haidar aliyev on the issue 3 the minister of interior and national security later suggested that the attacks had been fabricated crs4 on march 30 kocharyan received 5949 of the vote to 4051 for demirchyan with 6814 voter turnout the osce office of democratic institutions and human rights osceodihr fielded the largest number of observers 150 who were led by us ambassador sam brown and included 65 americans its preliminary report found flaws in the electoral process but noted improvements over 1996 as step forward towards functioning democracy and concluded that irregularities did not affect the election outcome4 the final report however said that the 1996 election was not the appropriate standard for evaluating the 1998 election which had not met the osce standards to which armenia had committed itself it reached conclusion about the possible effect of irregularities on outcome5 council of europe and commonwealth of independent states parliamentary assembly observers who were far fewer than those of the osce were less critical and even praised the process demirchyan labeled the result fraudulent and vowed to stay politically active policies and politics kocharyan named 33yearold minister of finance and economics armen darbinyan to be prime minister the new young cabinet is predominantly technocratic and most members are not affiliated with political party ten out of 21 ministers are holdovers from the previous regime including defense minister vazgen sarkisyan and minister of interior and national security serzh sarkisyan the cabinet includes eight economists kocharyan has said that the azeri and turkish blockades are not completely to blame for armenias economic problems the government program will focus on the economy and continue market reforms following international monetary fund imf recommendations kocharyan desires more foreign investment especially from the armenian diaspora and special department for diaspora affairs will be created in the foreign ministry he also intends to continue reforming customs and tax laws to make the country attractive to investors kocharyan wants to create jobs by developing small and medium enterprises in number of sectors such as mining chemicals tool construction and electronics in which armenia traditionally has been strong and to transform armenia into regional exporter of electricity domestic politics remain fluid as acting president kocharyan had legalized the arf and freed prominent arf leader vahan hovanessian from prison the arf supported kocharyans presidential candidacy and has been rewarded with the education and culture ministry and hovanessians appointment as presidential advisor the party is regaining its feet as its representatives routinely meet with government officials and its newspaper resumes publication the national democratic union ndu also has indicated willingness to support the government depending on the issue the anm has kept low profile terpetrosyan was present at kocharyans inauguration but refused to speak to the press the issue of possible recriminations against terpetrosyan and some of his allies for their actions or corruption is unresolved and has not received much attention except for the question of karabakh kocharyan has not criticized ter petrosyan publicly and parliament granted the former leader house and car 4 organization for security and cooperation in europe preliminary assessment reuters april 1 1998 5 reuters april 13 1998 also noyan tapan april 13 1998 translation carried by fbis online april 14 1998 crs5 parliamentary election may be held early as noted the 1995 election was flawed and parliament is not believed to reflect the popular will the arf is not represented in parliament because it was banned during the 1995 election and thus the party supports holding an election other parties which supported the kocharyan candidacy appear to agree preliminarily deputies are focusing on new electoral code which may reconfigure parliament to include some deputies representing single member districts while majority still will be chosen from party lists after an electoral reform law is passed an election is likely changes in the constitution were termed urgent by kocharyan in his april 9 inaugural address he wants to redistribute powers more equitably among the legislature executive and judiciary ie to strengthen parliament and make the judiciary more independent one suggested revision would allow parliament to dissolve itself and pave the way for an election under the present constitution the president alone has the power to dissolve parliament kocharyan also seeks to permit dual citizenship implications for the peace process and relations with turkey much media coverage described kocharyans election as setback for the peace process this view is predicated upon the belief that terpetrosyans acceptance of the osce plan was the major breakthrough which would have led to peaceful settlement of the conflict over nagornokarabakh however terpetrosyans downfall and kocharyans rise demonstrated clearly the lack of domestic support in armenia for terpetrosyans policy public opinion poses fundamental constraints on any leader and will set the parameters for the new governments negotiating policy in reality progress toward resolution of the conflict has been made since international mediation began except for the 1994 ceasefire the karabakh armenians never compromised with the azeris or with osce negotiators on their demands for self determination and package deal in which all issues would be resolved simultaneously and not in stages kocharyans views could not have set back process that had advanced so little neither however do they bode well for future success in an april 8 1998 interview kocharyan declared that karabakh enjoys real independence and wont renounce it6 he outlined principles to serve as the basis for future negotiations 1 the right of the karabakh people to selfdetermination 2 guarantees of karabakhs security widely interpreted to include role for armenia and 3 permanent geographic link between armenia and karabakh ie armenian retention of the lachin corridor kocharyan and karabakh maintain that terpetrosyans policy of concessions led azerbaijan to believe that it need not negotiate with the karabakh government they call for direct karabakhazerbaijan talks and insist that karabakh is an independent actor which will have the final say on its status azerbaijani president aliyev has said that he is ready to cooperate with any president elected in armenia he expressed hope for resumption of minsk group talks on the same grounds as before despite kocharyans stated opposition to that formula aliyev faces an election in october and is unlikely to modify his position in the coming months he has 6 with izvestia carried by interfax in foreign broadcast information service online hereafter fbis on april 8 1998 crs6 been counting the prospect of azerbaijans oil wealth to induce the minsk group cochairs the united states france and russia all of whom have economic interests in the azeri energy sector to pressure the armenians to concede7 the armenians and some analysts believe that minsk group proposals favor azerbaijan aliyev and kocharyan met on april 28 and agreed to continue to work with the minsk group and to abide by the 1994 cease fire minsk group emissaries will visit the region in may it is not clear how they will adapt to changes in the armenian government more process without progress is likely armenias relations with turkey also may be more problematic under the new government in yerevan foreign minister vardan oskanyan has said that recognition of the 1915 armenian genocide must be included in any future armenianturkish dialogue this contrasts with terpetrosyans offer to put history aside to enable the two neighbors to focus on current bilateral relations again armenian government officials would maintain that terpetrosyans concessions produced positive response from turkey which has blocked land transit to armenia since 1993 out of sympathy for azerbaijan turkey had made ties with terpetrosyans government contingent on armenias withdrawal from azeri lands the new yerevan policy is even less likely to improve bilateral relations because turkey denies that there was genocide us policy armenia is major recipient of us foreign aid in fy1998 the united states will provide 875 million to armenia and 125 million to nagornokarabakh the administration has requested 80 million in aid for armenia plus 161 million for the peace corps for fy1999 but made request for karabakh the administration is uneasy with congresss separate treatment of karabakh believing that it might impair the us role as mediator by prejudging the possible outcome of the talks the us state department accepted the official armenian position that the change in government was carried out according to the rule of law and the armenian constitution terpetrosyan had adopted position toward the osce plan that the united states believed was constructive yet us policymakers who seek to further democracy in the former soviet republics apparently did not help him build domestic support by encouraging baku to make reciprocal gestures to prove to the armenian people that what they viewed as concessions would lead to positive result and not harm their long sought security the state department endorsed the osce preliminary report on the election and wished kocharyan well in further implementing economic and democratic reforms and political resolution of the nagornokarabakh conflict8 it has not commented on the final osce report the new armenian leadership will pose challenges for the negotiators will the united states work to revise the plan and make it more acceptable to the armenians if so how will that affect us relations with azerbaijan which the us views as valuable avenue for the diversification of international energy resources undersecretary of state strobe talbott has indicated that the united states and the minsk group will persevere in their efforts 7 see comments of aliyev advisor vafa guluzade in an interview with baku panorama on march 12 1998 fbis online march 13 1998 8 us state department official statement april 1
