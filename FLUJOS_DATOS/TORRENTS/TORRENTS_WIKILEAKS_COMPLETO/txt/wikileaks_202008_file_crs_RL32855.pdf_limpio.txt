branch for comment president reagan issued an execu tive order requiring agencies to prepare inflationary impact statements for any major regulatory actions and president carter expanded presidential review through the i ssuance of an executive order requiring regulatory analysis of all proposed major rules in 1981 president reagan issued executive order 12291 ushering in new era of presidential asserti ons of authority over agency rulemaking efforts eo 12291 required costbenefit analyses and blished centralized review procedure for all agency regulations eo 12291 legated responsibility for this clearance requirement to the office of information and regulatory affairs which had recently been created within the office of management and budget as part of the paperwork reduction act of 1980 the impact of eo 12291 on agency regulatory activities was immediate and substantia l generating controversy and criticism opponents of the order asserted that review there under was distinctly antiregulatory and constituted an unconstitutional transfer of authority from the executive agencies the review scheme established in the reagan administration was retained by president george hw bush to similar effect and controversy many of the concerns voiced regarding eo 12291 were assuaged by president clintons issuance in 1993 of executiv order 12866 which implemented more selective and transparent review proce ss eo 12866 has been retained by the current administration which has utiliz ed it to implement review regime subjecting rules to greater scrutiny than in the clinton administration the actions of both the clinton and george w bush administrations in implementing the provisions of eo 12866 coul d be taken to indicate conception of presidential authority consonant with that conveye d by the reagan order however the comparatively nuanced exercise of this asserted authority by these administrations has largely diminished arguments against the constitutionality of presidential review accordingly presidential review of agen cy rulemaking has become widely used and increasingly accepted mechanism by whic h president can exert significant and sometimes

increasing presidential involvement in agency rulemaking efforts has often been cited as one of the most significant developments in administrative law and domestic policymaking since the introduction of the first formal review programs in the 1970s1 the evolution of presidential revi ew of agency rulemaking efforts since the reagan era in particular constitutes significant assertion and accumulation of presidential power in the regulatory context while initial presidential forays into centralized regulatory review were limited in scope presidential review of rules has emerged as one of the most widelyused and controversial mechanisms by which president can ensure the realization of his regulatory agenda the first formal regulatory review program was instituted by president nixon in 1971 through the establishment of q uality of life review program designed to improve the interagenc coordination of proposed ag ency regulations standards guidelines and similar materials pertaining to environmental quality consumer protection and occupational nd public health and safety2 under this program agencies were required to s ubmit significant proposed nd final regulations to

prepar inflation impact statements for any major regulatory action3 president carter expanded presidential review through the issuance of executive order 12044 whic h required agencies to prepare

primarily to facilitate interagency dialogue6 however these programs laid the foundation for the impleme ntation of much more extensive and vigorous review process unde r the reagan administration7

12291 required agencies to submit any proposed major rule to oira for review along with regulatory impact analysis of the rule including costbenefit analysis the reagan order was significant in comparison to earlier efforts in this context in that it centralized review within omb and had the practical effect of giving omb substantial gree of control over agency rulemaking president reagan expanded this review scheme with the issuance of executive order 12498 which required agencies to submit an annual plan listing proposed regulatory actions for the year to omb for review this procedure enabled omb to exert influence over agency regulatory efforts at the earliest stages of the process and to ensure that agency actions were in accord with the aims of the administration additionally the order created task force for regulatory reliefwhich was tasked with reviewing and seeking the elimination of unneeded or ineffective regulations in practical effect the impact of the

generated criticism and controversy in particular the review scheme was seen by some as having distinct antiregulatory bias leading to charges that the orders constituted an unlawful transfer of authority from the agencies to omb that the review process was too secretive and subject to influence by private interests that omb lacked the resources or expertise to properly assess submitted regulations and that the required costbenefit analysis did not take into account the unquantifiable social bene fits of certain ty pes of regulations11 additionally eo 12291 was cr iticized on the gr

regarding usurpation of agency decisionmaking authority by mandating that none of its provisions were to be construed as displacing the agenci responsibilities legated by law13 additionally the department of justices office of legal counsel olc drafted an opinion shortly before the publication of eo 12291 supporting its constitutionality14 the olc asserted that the provi sions of the order

statutes delegating rulemaking authority will usually support the lega lity of presidential supervision of rulemaking by executive agencies15 the opinion acknowledged however that the presidents exercise of supervisory powers must conform to legislation enacted by congress and went on to state that presidential supervision is more readily justified when it does not purport to wholly displace

constitutionality of such review in public citizen health research group v tyson for instance the court addressed the validity of rule promulgated by osha governing ethylene oi xide including challenge based on the argument that critical portion of the pr oposed rule had been deleted based on command from omb18 while stating that ombs participation in the rulemaking presents difficult constitutional questions concerning the executives proper rule in administrative proceedings and the appropriate scope of delegated power from congress to certain executive agencies the court nonetheless found that it had occasion to reach the difficult constitu tional questions presented by ombs participation given its finding that the challenged deletion was not supported by the

environmental protection agency rule epa acquiesced in the councils decision and excised the provisions from the final ru when this deletion was challenged in court the court of appeals for the

involvement the court declared that epas deletion of the provi sions at issue in light of the councils advicedoes not mean that epa failed to ex ercise its own expertise in promulgating the final

administration many of the concerns voiced over the effects of eo 12291 were assuaged at least temporarily by the review regime established by the clinton administration upon assuming office president clinton supplanted the reagan administrations review scheme through the issuance of executive order 12866 entitled regulatory planning and review25 the preamble to eo 12866 characterizes its provisions as presenting more nuanced approach to the management of agency rulemaking and declares that the objective of the order is to enhance planning and c oordination with respect to both new and existing regulations to reaffirm the primacy of federal agencies in the regulatory decisionmaking process to restore the integrity and legitimacy of regulatory review and oversight and to make the process more accessible and open to the public in pursuing thes objectives the regulatory process shall be conducted so as to meet applicable stat utory requirements and with due regard to the discretion that has been entrusted to the federal agencies26 while this language could be interpreted as retreat from the broad executive authority asserted in the reagan order it is important to note that substantive changes to the regulatory review process made by eo 12866 do not appear to have been developed as the result of divergent interpretation of presidential power in this context rather as is addressed in more detail below the provisions of eo 12866 indicate similarly expansive view of presidential authority to control agency rulemaking eo 12866 was selfavowedly designed to ensure that federal agencies p romulgate only such regulations as are required by law are necessary to interpret the law or are made necessary by compelling public need to accomplish this goal the order requires agencies to supply oira with regulatory plan of the most important significant regulatory actions that the agency reasonably expects to issue in proposed or final form in each fiscal year27 furthermore the order provides for centralized review of all re gulations requiring each agency to periodically submit to oira list of all planned regulatory actions indicating those which the agency believes are significant regulatory actions28 the order defines significant regulatory action as any regulatory action that is likely to result in rule that mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32855crs6 29 id

this executive order29 upon receipt of such list oira has n days to determine whether planned regulatory action not identified as significant by the agency is in fact covered under the aforementioned definition planned actions that are not deemed sign ificant are not subject to oira review while those that are must be subjected to costbenefit analysis by the agency30 regulatory action that is deemed significant is further subject to the review and clearance provisions of the order31 under this process oira is required to waive or complete review of preliminary regulatory actions such as notices of i nquiry or advance notices of proposed rulemaking within ten wo rking days after the submission of the draft action32 for all other regulatory actions such as notices of proposed rulemaking or final rules oira must waive or complete review within 90 calendar days after the date of submission33 the review process may be extended once by more than 30 days upon request of the agency head and the written approval of the oira administrator34 these requirements mark significan t departure from the provisions of eo 12291 which as was noted above was criticized for allowing oi ra to delay most rules indefinitely35 the administrator of oira may also remand regulatory action to the agency for further consideration of some or all of its provisions36 in the event that disagreement or conflict between an agency head and oira cannot be resolved by the administrator the president or the vicepresident acting at the presidents request may resolve the issue such consideration by the president or the vicepres ident may only be initiated by the director of omb or the relevant agency head37 the clinton administration drafted this language to make the oira review process less onerous on agencies than had been the case in the preceding reagan and bushhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32855crs7 38 see lubbers n1 supra at 163 39 id 40 omb draft report n8 supra at 15018 41

fewer rules38 for instance while oira reviewed an average of 2080 regulations in fiscal years 19821993 the number of regulations reviewed fell substantially during the c linton administration from 1100 in 1994 to 663 in 1995 and down to 498 in fy199639 furthermore an average of 600 significant rulemaking actions were approved per year during the clinton administration while only 25 rules and none after 1997 were returned to ag encies for further consideration40 additionally the clinton order provides for more transparent review process than was the case with eo 12291 in particular eo 12866 imposes substantial disclosure requirements on oira in order to ensure greater openness accessibility and accountability in the regulatory review process41 specifically the order regulates oral communications initiated by individuals not employed by the executive branch mandating that only the administrator of oira or particular designee may receive any such communications regarding the substance of re gulatory action under oira review42 the order further controls all substantive communications be tween oira personnel and individuals outside the executive branch by requiring that repres entative from the issuing agency be invited to any oira meetings held with outsiders and that oira forward any such communications including the dates and na mes of individuals involve d in all substantive oral communications to the issuing agency within ten days of receipt43 additionally the order requires oira to maintain publicly available log containing information regarding contacts of the type mentioned above44 finally the order requires oira to make available to the public all documents exchanged between the agency and itself during the review proceeding after the regulatory action has been published in the federal register or otherwise issued to the public or after the agency has announced its decision not to publish or issue the regulatory action45 from these requirements it is evident that eo 12866 imposes significant information sharing and disclosure requireme nts between oira and an issuing agency particularly with regard to substantive communications betw een oira and individuals outside of the executive branch it should be noted however th at the disclosure requi rements of the order are less stringent in the context of interagency communications with oira during the review process specifically whereas 6b4 requires oira to disclose to the issuing agency any substantive communications with pe rsons not employed by the executive branch there is similar requirement regarding comm unications with other agencies given this distinction oira would not seem to be requi red to disclose comm unications with otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32855crs8 46 this would appear to be the case even in lig ht of the requirement in 4 of the order that oira circulate regulatory plans provided by an issuing agency to other affected agencies and forward any communications received therefrom to the issuing agency see eo 12866 4c34 as noted above regulatory pl an is essentially list summarizing the most important significant regulatory actions that the agency reasonably expects to issue in proposed or final form in that fiscal year id at 4c1 as such this circulation and forwarding requirement seems inapplicable to oira review of agency regulatory actions under 6 of the order given that the focus of the review is on substantive action by an agency that could lead to the promulgation of final rule or regulation as opposed to the initial summary of potential regulatory ac tivity contained in regulatory plan id at 3e 47 specifically given that 6b4d require s oira to make all documents exchanged between itself and the issuing agency availa ble to the public upon completion of the review process it would appear that any communicati ons between oira and another agency would be subject to the disclosure requirements of the order in the event that oira did in fact provide them to the issuing agency it should so be noted that irrespective of the disclosure requirements of eo 12866 an interested party could request access to interagency communications under the freedom of information act subject to foias deliberative process exemption see 5 usc 552b5 48 see percival n6 supra at 996 49 see percival n6 supra at 996agencies regarding draft regulatory action to an issuing agency by the terms of the order46 accordingly oira would likewise not appear to be required by the order to make such communications available to the public upon co mpletion of the review process as is generally required unless it affirmatively discloses the communications to the issuing agency during review proceedings47 as touched upon above the effects of oi ra review during the reagan and bush administrations generated great deal of debate regarding constitutional issues adhering to the displacement of agency decisionmaking authority not surprisingly then the transparency and selectiveness of eo 12866 c oupled with the more proregulatory stance of the clinton era omb led to rather rapi d drop in debate concer ning the proper scope of presidential review of agency rulemaking howe ver it does not appear that the drop in rates of oira review during this period should be taken to indicate cession that there were limits on presidential control over the agency rulemaking process particularly in light of the vigor with which the clinton administration pressed agencies to effectuate its regulatory goals for instance president clinton grea tly expanded the use of formal presidential directives to executive agencies compelling specific action on their part president reagan and president bush issued nine and four presidential directives respectively three of which instructed agencies to either delay or terminate the issuance of regulations48 president clinton however issued 107 presidential dir ectives several of wh ich were designed to compel agencies to initiate regulatory action to address particular issue of importance to the administration49 also aspects of the clinton order indicate just as expansive view of presidential authority as the reagan and bush orders spite the selectiveness and transparency that characterized oira review during the clin ton administration for example eo 12866 unlike reagans order includes i ndependent agencies within its ambit to certain extent the order does not require independent agencies to submit individual rules for review but doeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32855crs9 50 eo 12866 4c 51 eo 12866 7 52 eo 12866 7 53 see kagan n10 supra at 2319 54 while the george w bush administrati on has retained eo 12866 it should be noted that executive order 13258 67 fed reg 9385 feb 28 2002 removes the vice president from the regulatory review processrequire them to comply with the regulatory planning process established in the order50 another example of the broad assertion of presidential aut hority included in the clinton order is the fact that the order provides that conflicts between agencies or between omb and an agency are to be resolved to the extent permitted by law by the president or by the vice president acting at the request of the president with the relevant agency head51 this language could be taken to indicate that agency heads are to retain some role in the resolution of disagreement but the order appears to vest ultimate decisionmaking authority in the president or vice president stating that the president or the vice president acting at the request of the president shall notify the affected agency and the administrator of oira of the presidents decision with respect to the matter52 similar to the reagan order eo 12866 mitigates the potential controversy that th is type of presidential displacement of agency authority could generate by providing th at this authority is to be exercised only to the extent permitted by law thereby giving an agency head the opportunity to argue in given case that the president could only issue an advisory opinion but it seems that the potential implication of this provision is that the president is perceived as having determinative authority in this context this provision has turned out to have little effect given that clintons assertion and exercise of authority over the regulatory pro cess manifested itself out side of the traditional omb process as noted above president clinton used devices such as presidential directives to direct agency heads to take specific course of action in furtherance of his administrations regulatory agenda in contrast to the reagan and george hw bush administrations approach of using the pro cesses mandated in eo 12291 to curtail agency rulemaking efforts however from the perspective of analyzing presidential control over the administrative process it is interesting to note that unlike the reagan order eo 12866 could be interpreted as asserting direct presidential authority over discretionary actions that have been assigned to agency heads by congress53 accordingly while the operative aspects of eo 12866 were welcomed by many as improving upon the transparency and selectiveness of oira review ot her aspects of the order could be taken to indicate that the clinton administrations view of presidential authority over agency rulemaking was largely consonant with that of the reagan and george hw bush administrations with the manifestation of this perspective differing pr imarily due to the obvious differences in the political aims of these administrations b george w bush administration the george w bush administration wh ile retaining eo 12866 has developed regulatory review policy that is subjecting rules to more stringent review than was the case during the clinton administration54 in particular it has been asserted that the current administration has returned to the regulatory review dynamic that prevailed under

text infra 60 omb draft report n9 supra at 1502012291 with oira going so far as to desc ribe itself as the gatekeeper for new rulemakings55 at the same time however the george w bush administration appears to be taking more nuanced approach to oi ra review than was the case under eo 12291 enabling it to have substantial impact on agency rulemaking while avoiding the degree of criticism and controversy occasioned by regulatory review under the reagan and george hw bush administrations oira has markedly increased the use of return letters to require agencies to reconsider rules under eo 12866 according to memorandum from oira administrator john d graham for the presidents management council return letters may be issued if the quality of the agencys analyses is inadequa if the regulatory standards adopted are not justified by the analyses if the rule is not consistent with the regulatory principles stated in the order or with the presidents policies or pr iorities or if the rule is not compatible with other executive orders or statutes56 under administrator grahams tenure oira has returned over 20 rules for agency reconsideration57 omb has discussed two notable effects of the reinvigoration of this practice first the willingness to issue such letters emphasizes to agencies that oira is serious about th quality of new rulemakings second agencies have begun to seek oira input into earlier phases of regulatory development in order to prevent returns late in the rulemaking process58 in practical terms this type of collaboration is arguably beneficial to the extent that it enables oira to ensure that rulemaking efforts comply with the aims of eo 12866 while givi ng agencies confidence that their regulatory proposals will not be returned after the inve stment of significant resources in their formulation conversely this dynamic buttre sses executive control over agency rulemaking efforts by allowing the exertion of influence at the earliest stages of the formulation process and as is discussed in more tail below raises concerns rega rding the extent to which this type of influence is disclosed59 in significant departure from the nature of oira review under the reagan and george hw bush administrations under the current administration oira s taken proactive stance in identifying issues that the office feels are ripe for regulation and has instituted the practice of issuing prompt letters to the ppropriate agency to encourage rulemaking on those issues oira has described the prompt tter as modest device to bring regulatory matter to the attention of agencies60 as acknowledged by oira prompt letters do not have the mandatory implication of presidential directive rather the device simplyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32855crs11 61 id 62 id it is interesting to note that oira has also declared that there is reason why members of the public should not suggest ideas for prompt letters to the oira administrator id 63 see crs report rl32397

reportconstitutes an oira request that an agency elevate matter in priority61 oira has also taken steps to ensure that prompt letters are available to the public in order to stimulate agency public and congressional interest in potential regulatory priority noting that prompt letters could be treated as confidential oira has further stated that it feels publication is warranted in order to focus congressional and public scrutiny on the important underlying issues62 by specifically identifying regulatory issues of importance to the administration through prompt tters oira has presumably been able to exert substantial degree of influence over the pursuit and scope of regulatory efforts in those areas63 in addition to the use of prompt letters oira has staved off criticism of the degree leveled at the reagan and george hw bush administrations by increasing the transparency of the review process as di scussed above the reagan admin istration in pa rticular was criticized for its reluctance to open the oira review process to outside inspection eo 12866 as issued by president c linton estab lished fairly expansive disclosure standards requiring omb and oira to disclose any cl osed door meeting between federal officials outside groups regarding regulation under administrator graham oira has retained these requirements and has significantly ex panded access to this information by placing information regarding meetings and oira decisions on the oira website64 with this step information that was previously accessible only at oiras record room is now available via the internet increasing access to oira information regarding meeting logs communications between oira and agency officials nd general oira guidance on rulemaking65 this approach has effectively undercut what was once major avenue of attack on oira review although concerns remain regarding oiras influence on the rulemaking process and the extent to which its i nvolvement is disclosed in particular 2003 study by th general accounting office gao66 raised concerns regarding the level of transparency governin g certain preinformal review omb contacts with outside parties as well as with contacts between oira and agency officials during informal review67 specifically one of the significant oira disclosure policies instituted by administrator graham establishes that oira will disclose substantive meetings and contacts with outside parties re garding rules under review even in instances where oira was engaged only in an informal review including substantive telephone calls initiated

available at httpwwwombwatchorgarticlearticlevi ew27461309topicid 1 however oira maintains that this review program is simply component of ombs multiyear effort to modernize or rescind outmoded rules see n75 supra at 3administrator68 however the gao report found that oi ra does not consider rule to be under review for purposes of these disclosure re quirements if oira is in general consultation with an agency regarding matter that has not become substantive or for which the agency has not submitted draft rule for informal review accordingly during this socalled preinformal review period oira may communi cate with outside parties without triggering the aforementioned disc losure requirements69 additionally the gao report found that with regard to contacts with agencies oira interprets disclosure requirements as applicable only to the period where rule is under formal review pursuant to eo 1286670 in practical effect this review dynamic allows varyin g degrees of unreporte d contacts both between oira and outside parties and oira and the executive agencies71 furthermore as noted by gao these preformal review proceedings would allow an agency to submit proposal to oira for informal review and to alter that proposal in accordance with oiras i nput without revealing any such changes to the public72 additionally oira appears to have reinvigorated review of existing rules and has taken steps to involve the public in the re view process in ma 2001 oira solicited the public to nominate rules that should be c onsidered for recision or modification oira received 71 nominations from 33 commentators and concluded that 23 of the rules nominated merited high priority review73 in february 2004 oira solicited public nomination of reforms of regulations in th manufacturing sector specifically requesting suggestions for reforms to regulations guid ance documents or pape rwork requirements that would improve manufacturin g regulation by reducing unnecessary costs increasing effectiveness enhancing competitiveness reducing uncertainty and increasing flexibility74 oira received 189 reform nominations from 41 commentators determining that 76 of the 189 nominations have potential rit and justify further action75 this review process serves to further illustrate the degree of invol vement of the current administration in all facets of regulatory review76 as touched upon above oiras use of mechan isms such as return and prompt letters have served to encourage agency collaboration with oira at the earliest stages of the rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32855crs13 77 see 2002 omb report n55 supra at 16 gao report n67 supra at 57 78 see 2002 omb report n55 supra at 13 79 see lubbers n1 supra at 31formulation process indeed oira has stated that it is at these early stages where oiras analytic approach can most improve the quality of regulatory analyses and the substance of rules77 the obvious potential for oira to exert degree of influence over rulemaking at this stage of development that rivals or perhaps even exceeds that wielded during formal review proceedings could be seen as tempering the salutory effects of the increased transparency requirements imposed during the formal review process nonetheless oira has maintained that its interactions with agencies prior to formal regulatory review are pre decisional communications that should generally be insulated from public disclosure in order to facilitate valuable deliberative exchanges78 in light of these developments it seems apparent that while the aforementioned changes to disclosure requireme nts pertaining to the formal oira review process have shielded the current administration from the degree of criticism occasioned by eo 12291 the potential that oira may play an important and potentially unacknowledged role in the formula tion of agency rules during preformal review proceedings may be viewed as raising the same concerns that have traditionally adhered in this context conclusion as has been illustrated by the considerati on of the review reg imes discussed above there has been steady evolution of presidential review of agency rulemaking from the nixon administration to the current administration of george w bush while the initial programs established in the 1970s were generally viewed as benign president reagans issuance of eo 12291 ushered in new era of presidential asserti ons of authority over agency rulemaking efforts raising attendant concerns with regard to the proper allocation of authority between the president and congress in this context despite these separation of powers based concerns over the propriety of such review regimes reviewing court has squarely addressed the issue79 furthermore while the actions of both the clinton and george w bush administrations in implementing the provisions of eo 12866 appear to indicate conception of presidential authority consonan t with that conveyed by the reagan order their more nuanced approach to exercising this authority has largely diminished charges against its constitutionality in turn presidential review of agency rulemaking has become widely used and increasingly accepted m echanism by which president can exert significant and sometimes determinative authority over the agency rulemaking process
