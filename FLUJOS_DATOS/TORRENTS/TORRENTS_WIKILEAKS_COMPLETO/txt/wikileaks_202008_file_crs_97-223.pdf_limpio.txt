science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223the army corps of engineers nationwide permits program issues and regulatory developments summary permits issued by the us army corps of engineers authorize various types of development projects in wetla nds and other waters of the united states the corps regulatory process involves two types of permits gene ral permits for actions by private landowners that are similar in natu re and will likely have minor effect on wetlands and individual permits for more significant actions the corps uses general permits to minimize the burden of its regulatory program they authorize landowners to proceed with project without the timeconsuming need to obtain standard individual permits in advance about 90 of the corps regulatory workload is processed in the form of general permits nationwide permits are one type of general permit nationwide permits which currently number 49 are issued for fiveyear periods and thereafte r must be renewed they were most recently reissued in to tal in march 2007 the current nationwide permit program has few strong supporters for differing reasons developers and other industry groups say that it is t oo complex and burdene d with arbitrary restrictions that limit opportunities for an efficient permitting pr ocess and have little environmental benefit nvironmentalists say that it does not adequately protect aquatic resources because the review pr ocedures and permit requirements are less rigorous than those for individual or standard permits at issue is whether the program has become so complex and expans ive that it cannot either protect aquatic resources or provide for fair regulato ry system which are its dual objectives in addition to general objections inte rest groups have number of specific criticisms of the permits such as requirements that there must be compensatory mitigation for impacts of some authorized activities impacts of regional conditioning through which local aquatic considerations are addressed concern that coal mining activities authorized by these permits have significant adverse environmental impacts and the need to define minimal adverse effects for purposes of implementing the nationwide permit program coordinating implementation of the nationwide permits between federal and state governments also raises number of issues of particular concern to states is tension over whether their authority to certify the nationwide permits is sufficient to assure that water quality standards or coastal zone management plans will not be violated congressional interest in wetlands permit regulatory programs has been evident in the past in oversight hearings and in connection with bills to fund the corps regulatory programs for some time there has been stalemate over legislation that would revise wetlands regulatory law nd that could if enacted modify the nationwide permit program during this time consensus has emerged on whether or how to reform overall we tlands policy legislatively congressional involvement in these issues could arise again as result of reissuance of the nationwide permits in 2007httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223contents

introduction federal laws require government approva l prior to beginning any work in or over waters of the united states that affects the course location condition or capacity of such waters or prior to discharging dredged or fill material into us waters regulatory programs that implement these laws are administered through permits issued by the us army corps of engineers the corps which shares responsibility with the environmental prot ection agency epa under the authority of the clean water act the rivers and harbors act and th marine protection research and sa nctuaries act the corps regulatory process involve s two types of per mits general permits for actions by private landowners that ar similar in nature nd will likely have minor effect on wetlands nd individual permits for mo re significant action nationwide permit is form of general per mit that authorizes category of activities throughout the nation and is valid only if th conditions applicable to the permit are met these permits are issued under author ity of section 404e of the clean water act and section 10 of the rivers and harbors act of 1899 under section 404 permits are required for discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the united states under section 10 permits ar required for any structures or other work that affect the course location or condition of navigable waters of the united states nationwide permits which currently number 49 are issued for fiveyear periods and thereafter must be renewed they were most recently reissued in total in march 2007 at issue in the nationwide permit pr ogram is the balance of two objectives providing regulatory protection to ensu re minimal impacts on aquatic resources and providing fair and efficient regulatory system for several years however interest groups of differing perspectives have criticized the program and increasingly question whether either objective is be ing achieved much less both objectives stakeholders involved in this debate include on the one hand industry groups members of building especially homebu ilding design realtor and petroleum and mining organizations and on the othe r environmental advocacy groups along with many state water quality water resources and environmental agencies particularly under the clean water act the corps regulatory authority is broadly defined it covers wa ters of the united states including the territorial seas and includes traditionally navi gable waterways capable of supporting interstate and foreign commerce plus their tributaries and adjacent wetlands and isolated watershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs2 1 debate about the jurisdictional reach of the corps regulatory program has been controversial policy and judicial issue for some time it is beyond the scope of this report but for additional information see crs report rl33483 wetlands an overview of issues by jeffrey zinn and claudia copeland 2 64 federal register 32268 july 21 1999where the use degradation or destruction of such waters could affect interstate or foreign commerce1 in fact much of the public concern about the nationwide permit program with regard to impacts of aut horized activities nd terms and conditions intended to limit impacts often focuses on permits for projects that affect the nations wetlands controversies about the permit progra m are compounded by disputes about the data on which the co rps bases its conclusions that adverse environmental impacts of authorized ac tivities are minimal critics especially environmental advocates argue that the corps data are dated the most recent available statistics are from 2003 and inaccurate because the corps lacks an effective tracking and monitoring system for evaluating impacts the nationwide permit regulatory program has drawn congresss attention several times in the past in 1997 hous and senate committees held oversight hearings to review several issues and controversies in 1999 and again in 2000 congressional appropr iators directed the corps to take certain actions concerning its overall regulatory program and nationwide permits in particular this report describes and reviews the nationwide permit program and discusses several major issues that ve drawn the attention of stakeholder interest groups including program complexity coordination with states and assessing cumulative impacts of the program background general permits including nationwide permits are key means by which the corps seeks to minimize the burden and delay of its regulatory program they authorize landowner or developer to pr oceed with the covered activity without having to obtain an individual sitespecific permit in advance individual permits are subject to public notice public hearing and casebycase evaluation which typically involve longer time before the ac tivity is authorized general permits are intended to allow certain activities to proceed with little delay or paperwork according to corps data in 2003 general permits entailed average processing time of 24 days in contrast w ith individual permits which on average took 187 days of processing and evaluation once an app lication was completed approximately 74000 activities per year representing 92 of the corps regulatory workload were authorized by nationwide and other gene ral permits the corps acknowledges that it does not have resources to evaluate all of these activities as individual permits general permits including nationwide permits authorize activities that usually would be authorized through the indivi dual permit process with little or change in the scope of the work2 while more than half require advance notification to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs3 3 the full text of the current nationwide perm its and related general conditions issued in march 2007 is available at httpwwwus acearmymilinetfunctionscwcecworeg nationwide_permitshtmcorps for some or all covered activities others only require afterthefact notification the following are examples of nationwide permits3 placement of aids to navigation approved by and installed according to us coast guard requirements nationwide permit 1 activities related to construction and maintenance of authorizedoutfall structures and associated in take structures nationwide permit 7 stream or river bank stabilizati on activities necessary to prevent erosion nationwide permit 13 minor dredging that is dredging of more than 25 cubic yards ofmaterial nationwide permit 19 activities associated with restoration enhancement or establishment of wetlands and riparian areas where the activities result in net increase in aquatic resource functions and services nationwide permit 27 discharges of dredged or fill material for the construction orexpansion of residential developments nationwide permit 29 and discharges for construction or expansion of recreational facilitiessuch as ski areas and golf courses nationwide permit 42 many nationwide permits have specific conditions and terms such as maximum acreage limitations in addition number of general conditions apply to some or all nationwide permits for example activity may cause more than minimal adverse effect on navigation activity ma jeopardize threatened or endangered species discharges into spawning areas and migratory waterfowl breeding areas must be avoided to the maximum extent practi cable and discharges of dredged or fill material must be minimized or avoided through mitigation to offset more than minimal impacts on the aquatic environment to the maximum extent practicable the specific statutor authority for these permits is section 404e of the clean water act in carrying out the functions relating to the discharge of dredged or fill material under this section the secretary of the army may after notice and opportunity for public hearing issue general permits on state regional or nationwide basis for any category of activities involving discharges of dredged or fill material if the secretary determines that the activities in such category are similar in nature will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment nationwide permits 19772002 the corps first issued regulations fo r general permits in the mid1970s and congress codified the concept in amendmen ts to the clean water act in 1977 plhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs4 4 section 404e of the act authorizes the corp s to promulgate general permits on regional state or nationwide basis the corps regu lations authorize the issuance of general permits on regional substate or statewide basis by district or division engineers rather than headquarters which issues the nationwide pe rmits the corps uses the general permit authority to authorize statewide general permits covering activities in states that are deemed to have sufficient state regulatory authority these statewide general permits programmatic general permits or pgps are derived from an existing state local or other federal agency program and are designed to avoid duplication with that program they function as substitute for full state program authorization to administer the 404 program depending on the core state program state pgps may encompass all wetlands regulation in state certain waters only or certain types of regulated activities once pgp is approved the corps suspends its permit activity in lieu of th authorized state or substate entity although the corps retains the right to override the pg p and issue federal permit in individual cases thus in addition to 49 nationwide permits the corps has authorized several hundred regional general permits rgps and more than 50 pgps also some activities qualify for abbreviated permit processing with authorization by district engineers in the form of letters of permission 5 pcn is brief document that is intended to provide the corps district engineer with enough information to determine whether an ac tivity is authorized by nationwide permit detailed studies or anal yses are not required95217 nationwide and other general permits4 are valid only for period of five years as is the case with other clean water act permits thus they were reissued in 1982 and 1987 they were reissued as group in november 1991 taking effect in january 1992 prior to 1991 the nationw ide program involved little individualized review of these permits as the guiding criterion was that covered activities impose so minimal an environmental impact that the full review given individual permits was not warranted in the 1991 revisions however district engineers were given greater authority to modify suspend or revoke nationwide permits for specific activities and division engineers were authorized to exercise discretionary authority to revoke applicability of specific nationwide permits in high value aquatic areas and to then require individual permits for the activity further preconstruction notification pcn to the corps was required for several of the nationwide permits5 and when such notice is required the app licant must provide wetlands delineation as well advance notification is intended to give the corps time to determine that the adverse effects of the discharge or activity will be minimal the district engineer generally has 45 days to notify the person of approval to proceed or instead of the need to obtain an individual permit before the applicant may pro ceed even with those changes the nationwide permits did not attract significant controversy when they were reissued in 1991 more attention and more c ontroversy focused on the corp s process of reissuing the permits in 1996 much of it centering on nationwide permit 26 nwp 26 the corps had several substantive purposes behind modifying the permits at that time one was the need to better ensure that permits have minimal adverse effects especially on isolated wetland areas s econd was the need to better regionalize the program by emphasizing that corps offici als 38 district and 11 division engineers should cond ition nationwide permits on local basis with limitations that reflect differences in aquatic ecosystem functions and values that exist across the nation httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs5 6 us department of the army corps of engineers proposal to issue and modify nationwide permits 63 federal register 36041 july 1 1998 7 presentation by michael davis deputy assistant secretary of the army for civil works at the environmental law institute february 4 1997nationwide permit 26 background and controversies controversies about the program are refl ected especially in one of the nationwide permits nationwide permit 26 which author ized discharges in headwa ters or isolated waters it had been added to the program in 1977 and expanded in 1982 headwaters and isolated waters are areas that many people have difficulty identifying as wetlands because they may appear dry for much of the year or lack the types of vegetation commonly associated with wetlands yet they meet criteria developed by scientists and wetland delineators of areas that are in fact wetlands criteria concerning characteristic hydrology soil and vegetation and are increasingly recognized as providing important functions w ithin entire aquatic ecosystems permit 26 had been controversial for several reasons unlike other nationwide permits it did not authorize specific activ ities such as minor dredging or bank stabilization instead it author ized discharges to certain types of waters based on acreage and lack of hydrologic connecti on to navigable waters environmental groups had long been concerned that this nationwide permit wa s overly broad could be abused by applicants through segmentin g of projects and could result in large amounts of unmonitored wetland losses many believed th at the permit was illegal because it violated the clean water act s requirement that activities covered by nationwide permits are similar in nature environmental groups and other protection advocates including federal and state natural resource agencies pressed for repeal or modification of nwp 26 industry groups including developers and landowners viewed nwp 26 as an important mechanism for minimizing regulatory burdens on small businesses and other permit applicants according to corps statistics residential development and transportation activities were the major types of activities authorized by nwp 266 from the perspective of these groups nwp 26 was valuable for much the same reason that the permit was controversial with environmentalists it authorized discharges to types of waters and was not restricted to specific activities corps data also indicated that 75 of all envir onmental impacts resulting from all of the nationwide permits were aut horized under this one permit7 in 1996 the corps reissued nwp 26 but with modifications in two major respects first it reduced the acreag limits to cover discharges to nontidal headwaters and isolated waters larger than 3 acres and to require advance notification by the applicant if the discharge would affect acre or more compared with 10acre and 1acre thresholds previ ously second the corps reissued this permit only for two years intending to replace nwp 26 with activitybased permits the corps proposed permits to replace nw p 26 in july 1998 but it took until march 2000 for these permits to be finalized nw p 26 remained in effect during that time replacement permits for

final permits8 repealed nwp 26 entirely authorized five specific activitybased permits as replacements modified several existin g nwps and general conditions and added two new general conditions they becam effective june 7 2000 the five new permits cover the following activities residential commercial and institutional developments including construction of building pads building foundations and attendant features nwp 39 reshaping of existing serviceable drainage ditches constructed innontidal waters in manner that benefits the aquatic environment or improves water quality nwp 41 recreational facilities facilities with low environmental impact suchas playgrounds campgrounds biking and hiking trails this permit may be used for the constructi on or expansion of recreational facilities that

43 aggregate and hard rock mineralmining activities with minimaladverse effects on the aquatic environment primarily commercial sand gravel stone and hard rock metals and minerals nwp 44 all but the new permit for reshaping existing drainage ditches nwp 41 were limited to activities that do not cause the loss of greater than ½ acre of nontidal waters 9 compared with the previous 3acre maximum in nwp 26 or more than 300 linear feet of streambed even with th at size limitation seve ral of these permits require preconstruction notification to the corps for impacts of greater than onetenth of an acre to ensure that any activity that potentially may have more than minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment is reviewed on casebycase basis several of the new permits issued in 2000 residential commercial and institutional activities recreational facilitie s and stormwater management facilities required compensatory mitigation to offset unavoidable losses of waters of the united states compensatory mitigation may be provided through restoration enhancement or creation of aquatic habitats preserva tion of adjacent open or green space land trusts or mitigation banks mitigation bank is site where wetlands or other aquatic resources have been restored cr eated enhanced or preserved to provide compensatory mitigation in advance of the authorized impacts the entity that developed the mitigation bank provides these aquatic resources in return for paymenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs7 10 63 federal register 36045 july 1 1998from the permittee10 specific compensatory mitigation requirements are determined by district engineers on casebycase basis but the basic corps concept was that there should be minimum requirement of an acreforacre 11 wetland replacement as compensatory mitigation fo r all activities requiri ng preconstruction notification greater than 11 ratio can be required in some cases to adequately replace aquatic resource func tions and values lost as result of nwpauthorized activities the corps also modified six existing permits in 2000 to increase the number of activities authorized by them for example nwp 40 was expanded to authorize certain discharges associated with agri cultural activities which are necessary for increasing agricultural producti on and constructing farm buildings one of the goals of nwp 40 is to reduce duplication between the corps and the natural resources conservation service which implements wetlands programs on agricultural lands under federal farm law and provide some regulatory re lief to agricultural producers however to ensure that authorized activities will have minimal adverse effects like other nationwide permits nwp 40 restricts the types of agricultural activities and sets acreage limits in terms of discharges into wetlands allo wable under the permit further the corps lowered the acr eage limit for nwp 29 which authorizes singlefamily housing activ ities from ½ acre to ¼ acre in nontidal waters ie discharges associated with construction or expansion of singlefamily home and attendant features may not cause the loss of more than ¼ acre of nontidal waters or wetlands this permit must be obtained by the person who will use the house as personal residence not by contractors or developers who offer house for sale upon completion the new general conditions adopted in 2000 put limits on the use of nationwide permits for projects within critical res ource waters and for permanent abovegrade wetland fills within the 100year floodplain as defined by the federal emergency management agency fema critical resource waters are those designated as having particular environmental or ecological significance such as designated marine sanctuaries and state natural heritage s ites regarding the 100year floodplain the corps said it sought to sure that the nationwide permit program discourages further development that woul d reduce the flood storage capacity of the floodplain but not create undue constraints or costs on th regulated public unless necessary to improve th aquatic environment as with the previous nationwide permits corps officials retained the authority to apply special conditions to use of an of the proposed new permits or even to revoke use of specific permits in aquatic environments of particularly high value or in specific geographic areas indeed the corps expected that its district and division engineers would utilize significant am ount of regional conditioning to ensure effective protection at the local level of wetlands and other water resources because aquatic resource functions and values vary considerably across the country andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs8 11 65 federal register 12838 12 us department of the army

be used to make an nwp less restrictive11 lawsuits challenging the replacement permits soon after the final replacement and modified permits were published in 2000 several industry groups challenged the permits in court the wsuits contended that the corps exceeded its authority by imposing broad restrictions through the nwp program and that the program longer is the streamlined permitting approach intended by congress when it authorized general permits in 1977 they also said that the corps had not considered impacts on small businesses i ndustry petitioners wanted the corps to re instate nwp 26 however the corps has re peatedly said that since nwp 26 expired in 2000 this permit will not be reinstated the consolidated cases were initially dismissed by federal district court in 2003 the court said it lacked jurisdiction saying that final agency action does not take place until project seeking to be c overed by nationwide permit has exhausted all of its permitting options in 2005 fe deral appeals court pa rtly reversed the ruling and remanded the case to the district court national association of home builders v army corps of engineers 417 f3d 1272 dc cir 2005 the appeals court said that the challenged permits constituted final action subject to judicial review this court also determined that nationwide permits are regulations for purposes of the administrative procedure ac t and thus are subject to the regulatory flexibility act and other administrative requirements to assess impacts on small businesses and unfunded mandates and also are subject to requirements to prepare environmental documentati on and comply with the congressional review act previously the corps had taken the position that the nationwide permits do not constitute regulations upon remand of the case the federal dist rict court rejected the lawsuit for second time in 2006 national association of home builders v army corps of engineers 453 fsupp 2d 116 ddc 2006 the court ruled that the corps had not acted arbitrarily capriciously or contrary to the law in its issuance and reissuance of nationwide permits as the corps had adequately explained its reasoning and had acted within its authority reissuance of all nationwide permits in 2002 in august 2001 with the approaching expiration of the 1996 nationwide permits the corps proposed to reissue thos and others that had been issued and modified since 1996 including the 2000 re placement permits for nwp 26 in order to put all of the nationwide permits in the program on unified fiveyear schedule12 the proposals

of the nations we tlands and streams on the other hand industry groups said that the proposal involved only minor changes these changes offered some benefits they said but any ch benefits are more than offset by problems with the 2000 replacement permits whic h developers and other groups continued to oppose saying that the permits impose arbitrary and burdensome restrictions following public comment period that generated more than 2100 comments the nationwide permits were reissued in ja nuary 2002 essentially as propos ed with an effective date of march 18 2002 the corps action modi fied

reissued in march essentially as proposed with an eff ective date of march 19 200715 the reissued permits also modified some of the general conditions and definitions that apply to nationwide permits the six new permits are repair of uplands damaged by di screte events this general permit is intended to apply to activities for restoration of upland areas that have been damaged by storms floods fire or other discrete events the permit only authorizes activities to restore damaged areas to previously existing conditions nwp 45 discharges in ditches this permit applies to discharges of dredged or fill material into certain types of ditches and canals that are constructed in upland areas that receive water from another water of the united states and that dive rt water to another water of the united states the corps argues that with these limitations the types of ditches and canals covered by the permit are likely to affect few aquatic resources thus ensuri ng that the environmental impact of the discharge is minimal the permit is limited to discharges that cause the loss of more than one acre of waters of the united states nwp 46 pipeline safety program designated timesensitive inspections and repairs this permit authorizes inspection repair rehabilitation or replacement of any currently serv iceable structure or fill forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs10 pipelines that are timesensitive for example following pipeline rupture and are done in accordance with department of transportation procedures the new permit would allow rapid response when needed to reduce environmental impacts pcn would be required nwp 47 existing commercial shellfish aquaculture activities this permit authorizes structures or works in navigable waters as well as discharges into all waters of the united states for the continued operation of existing commercial oyster clam geoduck mussel or scallop aquaculture operations it does not apply to new projects or expansion of existing ones and w ould not include operations that raise crustaceans or finfish nwp 48 coal remining activities this permit is intended to authorize activities for the restoration of coal mine sites that are causing physical andor chemical impacts to water many are likely to be abandoned or closed sites th permit would allow new mining either at the site or as part of reclamation project or together with adjacent unmined areas and would authorize related discharges of dredged or fill material into nontidal waters of the united states there is specific acreage limit for this permit which would apply only to activities already authorized under the surface mining control and reclamation act by the federal office of surface mining or qualified states the pplicant must demonstrate to the corps that the overall project including the reclamation activity and any new mining will result in net increase in aquatic resource functions nwp 49 underground coal mining activities this permit authorizes number of different activities ssociated with underground coal mining such as excavating rock and soil on the surface in order to expose coal seams providing road access for people and equipment to site and constructing aci d mine drainage impoundments or sedimentation ponds it could be used to authorize permanent structures or fills that would remain after reclamation of the site the permit authorizes discharges to nontidal waters only it would not authorize coal preparation and processing activities outside the mine site but these could be aut horized by nwp 21 like nwp 21 surface coal mining specific acreage limit applies nwp 50 the reissued permits include modifi cation of number of the nationwide permits for example previously two nwps applied to construction of residential developments nwp 29 which authorized si ngle unit residences ie single family homes see page 7 and nwp 39 which authorized multiple unit residential developments as well as commercial and institutional developments in 2007 the corps modified these permits so that nwp 39 now authorizes commercial and institutional developments and nwp 29 authorizes all types of residential developments the change in effect liminates the previous nwp 29 which had ¼acre limit on authorized discharges as reissued the revised nwp 29 has thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs11 16 gulf restoration network et co mments submitted on docket number coe2006 0005 undated pp 12same conditions as nwp 39 authorized discharges would be limited to impacts affecting ½ acre of nontidal waters and 300foot linear foot limit on the loss of stream bed the corps rationale for the changes to these two permits was that it is inappropriate to establish different permits for single and multiple unit residential developments because impacts to the aquatic environment are determined by permit conditions such as the ½acre limit not the type of residential development regarding the changes to nwp 39 the corp s argued that commercial developments eg retail stores industr ial facilities and shopping centers and institutional structurets eg schools fire stations hos pitals and places of worship are different from residential developments in number of ways such as different state and local requirements concerning planning zoning and stormwater management therefore it is appropriate to group them in one permit nwp 39 and to group re sidential structures in separate permit nwp 29 both industry groups and environmental advocates criticized the modifications to nwp 29 industry groups particularly home builders objected to the fact that new nwp 29 would require prec onstruction notification pcn for all applications previously nwp 29 required pcn for proj ects with certain impacts over onetenth of an acre arguing that it is unclear wh pcn should be requi red for all activities regardless of size many si ngleunit projects that prev iously were not required to submit pcn would have to do so under the re vised permit they said further they objected to the 300foot linear limit and the ½acre threshold under this permit saying these limits are too stringent presumably for multiple unit developments and will exclude many projects with minimal impact from seeking nationwide permit environmental groups on the other hand argu ed that the ¼acre threshold in nwp 29 should be retained not increased critiques by stakeholder groups as noted previously as the nationwide permit program has become more complex over time major intere st groups are increasingly united in arguing that the program as it has developed fails to meet its overall obj ectives although their reasons for this criticism are very different one view was expressed by an environmental advocacy group in comments on the 2006 draft nwps the nationwide permit system was presumab ly developed in order to balance two somewhat contrary objectives to ensure that the permits issued result in only minimal impacts on aquatic resources and to provide predictable fair and simply regulatory system for citizens pplying for permits given the complexity and confusion surrounding the nationwide permit program together with the clearly more than minimal environmental impacts we question whether either of these objectives is being achieved16 similar views were expressed by group re presenting one set of land developershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs12 17 national association of home builders advice and recommendations of the national association of home builders on the depart ment of the army corps of

comments submitted on docket coe20060005 and ohio valley environmental council re proposal to reissue and modify nationwide permits docket coe20060005 november 27 2006over time however the nwps have become increasingly restrictive and complex to the point that they fain tly resemble the streamlined permitting process congress envisioned when it enacted section 404e the program waivers between providing administrativ relief and imposing red tape between truly streamlined process and one that is so severely limited that few projects can qualify the history of the nwp has been consistent tightening of the eligibility for the program each tim the corps has drawn the line between nwp eligibility and ineligibility eligibility has been restricted never relaxed17 beyond apparent broad agreement that th program fails to meet its objectives the views of industry and environmental advocacy groups diverge greatly major industry groups support the nwp program or the type of streamlined program that they believe was originally intended and agree with the corps that the use of nationwide per mits w ill result in minimal adverse environmental impacts nevertheless they were highly critical of many aspects of the corps 2006 proposal the corps attempt to illegally expand its jurisdiction the stringent and largely inflexible acreage and pcn preconstructi on notification thresholds the lack of proper administrative process and record to support the proposal the problematic regional conditions and the overall trend toward the elimination of nwps all contribute to permit package that is hardly even semblance of the streamlined process directed by congress18 major environmental groups argue that permitted activities w ill have more than minimal impacts on the environment and that the corps has substantial or scientific evidence to conclude otherwise they argue that the permits are unlawful because they violate the re quirements of section 404e that there may be more than minimal adverse environmental eff ects on aquatic resour ces both individually and cumulatively environmental groups are highly critical of many aspects of the program such as inconsistent and in adequate pcn require ments overly vague requirements which will result in weakened regulatory protection the granting of excessive authority to corps district engineers to waive permit limits in individual cases and what they descri be as irrational reliance on compensatory mitigation to offset the harmful effects of permitted activities19 specific critiques in addition to general objections number of specific concerns became evident after issuance of the 2002 permits nd continue with the 2007 permitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs13 300 linearfoot prohibition one of the most significant changes in the permits that were issued in 2002 affect ed development activities along streams several of the 2000 pe rmits that had repl aced nwp 26 included prohibition limiting the permits to devel opment activities affecting 300 linear feet or less of streambed projects affecting larger areas would not qualify for nationwide permit the corps believed that this restriction had resulted in requir ing individual permit review for many projects that involve more than minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment in the 2002 reissuance the corps modified this prohibition for nationwide permits 39 residential and commercial developments 40 agricultural activities 42 recreational facilities and 43 stormwater management facilities to allow corps districts to issue caseby case waivers to the 300 linearfoot limit for discharges affecting intermittent streams streams that only have flowing water only during certain times of the year when gr oundwater provides water for stream flow as reissued in 2002 the prohibition remained in effect for pere nnial streams which have flowing water yearround the corps decided at that time that this limitation on perennial streams was necessary to sure that losses result only in minimal adverse effects since significant impacts are more likely to occur in perennial than in intermittent streams the modification concerning the 300 lin earfoot prohibition was needed the corps said to add flexibility to the permit process by allowing district engineers to authorize activities that have minimal adverse effect on the aquatic environment it was not intended to relax aquatic protec tion the corps said but was intended to allow the corps to focus limited resources more intensively on areas where impacts are likely to be more than minimal oppone nts of the modification argued that the waiver would lead to severe stream struction from construction agricultural and other activities some said that the 300 linearfoot limit gives pr edictability to the regulated community and state agencies and that the waiver authority would result in decisionmaking variations between corps districts and even within the same district the corps disagreed and said that district engineers will use their knowledge of the local aquatic environment to make casebycase determinations whether waiver is applicable this topic was addressed again in the 2007 reissued permits the corps extended the 300 linearfoot limit under nwps 39 40 4 2 43 and revised 29 to include ephemeral streams streams that ve flowing water only during and for short time after precipitation event as well as permanent and intermittent streams however the corps also will allow dist rict engineers to waive the 300 linearfoot limit for discharges to ephemeral streams on casebycase basis in addition to case bycase waivers of discharges to intermittent streams that have been allowed since 2002 commenters on this change viewed the issue from two very different perspectives environmental advocates endorsed extending the 300linear foot limit to ephemeral streams so as to protect them as well as permanent and intermittent streams but they criticized the proposal to allow district engineers to waive the limit linear foot limits should be firm they sa id and proposed actions that exceed these limits should be subject to individual per mit requirements the corps provided justification for proposing to allow district engineers to waive the limit they said nor criteria for how waiver decisions will be made httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs14 20 for

preference for restoration deri ves from the fact that preservation does not provide new acres and thus cannot compen sate for wetlands loss on an acreage basison the other hand regulated industry gr oups said that extending the 300linear foot limit to ephemeral streams would greatly increase the regulatory burden of the overall program and reduce th utility of permits like nw ps 29 and 39 while serving environmental purpose they observed that the only apparent rationale for treating ephemeral streams in the same fashion as other streams is corps administrative convenience since the corps stated that it may be hard to distinguish between intermittent and ephemeral streams in the field 71 federal register 56261 several industry commenters noted that the legal ba sis for the corps to assert regulatory jurisdiction over waters that are dry nearly all the time is uncertain in light of recent court rulings including the supreme courts june 2006 ruling in rapanos v united states that have narrowed rather than expanded corps jurisdiction while the courts plurality ruling in that case was split there was majority opinion and left open to many jurisdictional questions20 these groups argue that ephemeral waters are for the most part not legally jurisdictional or subject to requirement for section 404 permit the corps stated that it will assert jurisd iction over ephemeral streams on casebycase basis in accordance with case law as it evolves and with any future agency guidance on recent court cases mitigation requirements the corps acknowledges that although minimal adverse effects are anticipated from the nationwide permit program the use of nwps may still affect the aquatic environment therefore the permits include general condition detailing how district engineers may require compensatory mitigation to offset the authorized impacts mitigation is intended to compensate for lost functions and values resulting from permitted activities compensatory mitigation can be accomplished through the restoration creati on enhancement andor preservation of aquatic resources either by the permittees individual project or the use of mitigation banks or other consolidated mitigation efforts mitigation requirements incorporated in the nationwide permit program have become more specific over time especially since 1996 and are viewed by environmen tal protection advocates as critically important before reissuance in 2002 this ge neral condition required oneforone mitigation of adverse impacts to wetlands with stated preference for restoration of wetland impacts over preservation see discussion on page 621 in 2002 the corps revised the mandate to allow casebycase waiver of this requirement in cases where the corps determines that some other form of mitigation such as establishment of vegetated buffers is more appropriate the intention of the change the corps said was to have more ecolo gically and watershe dbased approach to mitigation in the agencys view the oneforone acreage requirement was too restrictive in that it focused solely on wetlands but did not allow the corps to mitigate aquatic impacts to streams nd other nonwetland quatic resources because the corps regulates the entire aquatic environment not just wetlands it said mitigation should consider the entire aquatic environment as well the corps saidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs15 22 us

inaccuracies in wetlands permit reporting press release january 16 2002that it will require mitigation for impacts based on watershed approach often involving mix of vegetated buffers and other mitigation in nonwetland areas thus for example district engineer might authorize project with impacts on particular wetland and require mitigation within the overall aquatic environment of the particular watershed involved but not wetlandacr eforwetlandacre mitigation this approach the corps said allows district engineers to require the mitigation for project impacts that best prot ects the aquatic environment22 environmentalists strongly opposed this change in 2002 saying that it effectively ignores the principle of ne t loss of wetlands which has been goal of national wetlands policy since 1990 in re sponse corps officials said that under the revision project applicants must ensu re that wetland functions are replaced and that the net loss goal be met on an acreage basis within corps district23 environmental groups also argued that the corps is too quick to look towards mitigation as the answer for developmen t activities affecting wetlands and should focus on avoiding impacts as first priority in 2007 the corps also made certain modi fications to the general condition for mitigation previously compensatory mitigation was require d for all activities requiring pcn and for permanent losses of us waters at minimum oneforone ratio unless the district engineer decides that another form of mitigation would be more appropriate the corps modified th is requirement in 2007 by adding one tenth of an acre threshold that is if pcn is required and if the proposed activity is expected to result in the loss of more than onetenth of an acre of wetlands the permittee must comply with compensatory mitigation requirements mitigation banks and inlieu fee programs can be used for compensatory mitigation activities authorized by nationwide permits the corps also added language stating that district engineers may require mitigation when certain functions and services of waters of the united states would be permanently changed by the permitted activity such as conversion of forested wetla nd to herbaceous wetland in permanently maintained utility line rightofway in the decision documents accompanying the nwp proposal in 2006 the corps estimated that in total the permits including the six new permits will be used 52434 times per year and are expected to impact 6366 acres of wetlands and other waters per year the corps also estimated that 19501 acres will be mitigated to offset the impacts of authorized activities the data in these estimates was based on reported use of the nwps during fy2003 and the period of july 1 2005 to june 30 2006 as well as survey of corps district offices environmental groups were skeptical of these data asserting that it is unclear how the numbers were obtained due to inconsistencies in the corps permit

the maximum extent practicable remaining unavoidable impacts will then be mitigated to the extent appropriate and practicable in sequence beginning with avoidance of impacts followed by minimization of advers impacts and then compensatory mitigation continuedeven more troubling is the notion that the corps uses these flawed permit numbers to arrive at the acres of wetlands and waters impacted and for the presumed use and impact of the propos ed nwps again we can only assume that the corps has averaged the impacts associated with some subset of known nationwide permit applications this type of statistical mean does not provide us with the actual impact to waters of the united states nor can it be used as basis for predicting the future cumulative impacts of the proposed nwps24 in their comments on the 2006 proposal environmentalists continued to be critical of the corps reliance on mitigation as the basis for concluding that impacts of the nationwide permits will be minimal they pointed to the incomplete track record of mitigation projects described in number of re ports including june 2001 report of the national research council25 and 2005 gao report showing that mitigation is not fully successful and doe s not compensate for wetlands lost to permitted fills26 in light of the lack of data that mitigation is performed or that it would successfully replace lost functions and values they asserted that the corps lacks sufficient evidence to conclude that mitigatio n will render the impacts of authorized activities minimal if an activ ity requires mitigation these critics said by definition it has more than minimal adve rse effects to begin with and under the clean water act activities with more than minimal adverse effects can only be authorized by an individual permit th ey noted that the council on environmental quality has said that relying on mitigation to assume impacts are reduced below the threshold of significance violates the national environmental policy act27 the corps acknowledges that ecological success of mitigation varies widely but argues that mitigation is important to ensuring that nationwide permits result in minimal adverse effects the corps says that it s increased its compliance efforts to ensure that authorized projects are constructed as authorized and that mitigation is successful under the reissued nwps

on current controversies by claudia copelandengineers flexibility to determine the extent to which mitigation is needed on case bycase basis environmental groups on the other hand strongly objected to allowing waivers from mitigation requirements and giving discretion to district engineers particularly because the nwps contain criteria or performance standards that would govern mitigation coal mining activities the use of nationwide permits to authorize coal mining activities has been and continues to be controversial particularly in connection with nwp 21 which concerns rface coal mining activities critics say that the environmental impacts of coal mining are typically far greater than the standard set forth in the clean water act cwa section 404e that authorized activities will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects individually and cumulatively the mining industry argues that nationwide permit procedures are necessary to minimize regulatory burdens th at would threaten the economics of coal mining and to provide the kind of flexibility needed by industry to respond to quickly changing operating requirements the co rps responds that the terms and conditions of nwp 21 are sufficient to ensure that environmental impacts are minimal nationwide permit 21 authorizes discha rges from surface coal mining activities which result in more than minimal impacts sitespecifically and cumulatively to the aquatic environment there is acreage limit or threshold for project to use this permit the corps reissued nw p 21 in 2002 with two changes intended to strengthen environmental protection for projects authorized by the permit first the reissued permit requires the corps to termine appropriate mitigation in accordance with nationwide permit gene ral conditions rather than relying primarily on less restrictive staterequired mitigation estab lished under the surface mining control and reclamation act as had previously b een the case second the revised permit requires explicit authorization before the activity can take place rather than only requiring preconstruction notif ication as in the past critics were less focused on these 2002 ch anges than on the basic permit itself because environmentalists ve long contended that th permit authorizes disposal of coal mining waste material which bur ies streams with ove rburden material thereby disturbing the natural stream processes and water quality in entire watersheds and resulting in permanent ss of habitat according to that view mitigation cannot sufficiently compensate for these impacts and any use of this permit is inconsistent with ensuring minimal adverse eff ects on the aquatic environment contributing to controversy over nwp 21 is the fact that in recent years the corps has allowed the use of this per mit to authorize mountaintop mining activities in several appalachian states g west virginia and kentucky29 this practice involves removing the tops of mountains to expose and remove underlying coalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs18 30 us department of the army corps of gineers issuance of nationwide permits 67 federal register 2043 january 15 2002seams upon completion of the coal rem oval some amount of the waste rock is placed back on the top of the mountain while the majority is disposed in nearby valleys where streams and wetlands are filled with the excess mining waste environmentalists have sought to strength regulation of mountaintop mining if not halt it altogether in part by arguing that the practice should be regulated under more stringent clean water act provisions than section 404 which authorizes the nationwide permit program so far protection advocates have been unsuccessful in their efforts the corps continues to assert that use of nwp 21 for surface mining and mountaintop mining activities avoids and minimizes impacts to the extent practicable and that adequate mitigation can be used to determine that project has minimal effects these activities the corps believes can result in substantial improvement in downstream water quality and aquatic habitat within watershed30 citizen groups have filed wsuits seeking generally to halt the corps use of nationwide permit 21 for mountaintop mining operations in the first such case federal district court ruled that nwp 21 violates the clean water act by authorizing activities that have more th an minimal adverse environmen tal effects in 2004 the court enjoined the corps from using nwp 21 to authorize new mountaintop mining in southern west virginia and ordered the corps to revoke previous authorization for 11 operations on appeal the judgment of the district court and the injunction against nwp 21 were vacated when the court of appeals found that the corps had complied with the clean water act when it promulgated nwp21 ohio valley environmental coalition v bulen 429 f3d 493 c a4 2005 the case was remanded to the district cour t to address remaining issues

kentucky valley fills kentucky riverkeeper v rowlette civil 05 181 edky both of these cases are pending in the september 2006 proposal to rei ssue the 2002 permits the corps noted number of administrative steps that have b een taken to address public concerns about nwp 21 such as adopting standard ope rating procedure for review of permit applications in the proposal the corps requested public comment on the need for an acreage limit for this permit as it prev iously included none the mining industry generally supported nwp 21 nd two related new permits 49 and 50 however they opposed any acreag limit on nwp 21 saying that the permit would be useless to them if it included an acreage limit most coal companies would not be able to comply with such limit and would therefore be required to obtain an individual permit they said getting an individual permit imposes costs of time and money to applicants and to government industry c ontended without add itional environmental benefits in the revised permits issued in march 2007 the corps did not include an acreage limit for nwp21 environmental critics cited data on the degrading impacts of current nwp 21 to aquatic life in

acknow ledged that fills authorized by this permit have eliminated more than 1200 miles of streams in the past31 in the 2006 decision document for nwp 21 the corps estima ted that in total this permit will be used 204 times per year and is expected to impact 81 acres of wetlands and other waters per year the corps also estimated that 71 acres will be mitigated to offset the permits impacts environmental groups argued that there is support for the corps claim that mitigati on will reduce impacts of this permit to minimal level and urged that individual permits should be required in th eir view nationwide permits should only be used for mining related activities with lesser impacts than valley fills such as road crossings tem porary sediment ponds or stream diversions the corps responds that nwp 21 like th other nationwide permits requires compliance with general conditions which address many of these criticisms two of the new permits 49 and 50 also address coal mining activities the corps intention with the proposed new pe rmits was to provide incentives to coal remining and underground mining activities arguing that for permittees that meet specified terms and conditions such as acreage impact limits it will be faster to gain authorization under an nwp than it would be to obtain an individual permit it is the corps judgment that the environment will benefit from encouraging coal remining in this manner by allowing such ac tivities to proceed under nationwide permit rather than requiring an individual permit the environmental benefits of remining such as removing existing sources of wa ter pollution that harm downstream waters are more likely to occur according to the corps further while acknowledging that permits 21 49 and 50 have the potential to result in more than minimal adverse effects on water quality the agency contended that compensatory mitigation opportunities for division engineers to impos regional conditions and sitespecific evaluation of pcns will ensure that adverse environmental effects are minimal in the decision documents accompanying th nwp proposal the corps estimated that permits 49 and 50 will be used 204 times pe r year and are expected to impact 475 acres of wetlands and other waters per year the corps also estimated that 404 acres will be mitigated to offset the impacts of authorized activities environmental critics said that the corps has factual basis for determining that impacts of the new coal mining permits will be minimal since there are documented data for estimating future impacts of permits that did not exist before 2007 they point out that coal mining wa ste contains chemicals that are toxic to aquatic life there have been cases of spills of impounded wastes with impacts that are more than minimal underground mining is destructive practice they said that results in loss of stream and wetland functions through subsidence and waste disposal they also argue that the general permit process is inappropriate for such large scale activities fills within the 100year floodplain as discussed above in 2000 the corps established general condition for the nationwide permit program limiting activities within the 100year floodplain as defined by fema in 2002 the corpshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs20 modified portion of this general condition to delete mandate that permittees document that the project meets fema approved requirement s and delete requirement for preconstruction notification to the corps for certain activities occurring in the 100year floodplain nvironmental critics argued that the modification allows development in eco logically sensitive floodplain areas the corps said it believed that requiring applicants to comply with fema requirements is just as effective as also requiring applicants to document their compliance and that the changes to this general permit condition would not reduce the floodplain restrictions adopted in 2000 this general condition prohibits the use of certain nwps 39 40 42 and 44 to authorize discharges of dredged of fill material in waters of the united states resulting in permanent above grade fills within mappe d 100year floodplains located above or below headwaters of streams it also prohibits the use of nwp 43 stormwater management discharges w ithin mapped 100year floodplains located below headwaters activities covered by these permits are subject to pcn requirements meaning that the permittee must notify the district engineer before beginning the work and cannot proceed s ooner than 45 days after filing complete pcn without written notice from the corps in 2007 the corps modified the general condition related to mitigation to simply require permittees to comply with applicable state or local floodplain ma nagement requirements that have been approved by fema thus potential impacts to 100year floodplains will be addressed through casebycase review resulting from preconstruction notification by the permittee the corps argued that modifying this general condition will increase government efficiency by promoting conformity with state and local planning and zoning efforts and federal programs since fema is the lead federal ag ency for floodplain management while industry groups supported this ch ange environmental groups and others criticized lifting restricti ons on activities in the 100year floodplain saying that allowing fills in the 100year floodplai n could lead to cat astrophic consequences during significant flood events restrictions should be retained or even strengthened some said so as to prevent cumulative losses of valuable resources which are allowable under fema require ments without regulatory limits development can occur in the floodplain inducing citizens to ccupy areas that are at risk of severe flooding environmental groups argued that the job of reducing us flood losses by controlling new development should not be ft just to state and local governments and that the corps regulatory responsib ility under the cwa is not lessened by the involvement of other agencies in the 2007 reissued permits the corps said that the revised general condition w ill provide protection to floodplain values that is appropriate to the scope of the corps regulatory authority additional restrictions or prohibitions on development in the 100year floodplain are more appropriate to land use planning and zoning not corps regulations other issues concerning nationwide permits the nationwide permits issued since 1996 have raised number of additional issues for example the program is intended to balance desire for administrative simplicity and reduced regulatory burde n on the one hand with protecting aquatic resources including wetlands yet many industry stakeholders question whether ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs21 32 six new classes of activities covered under proposed corps replacement permits daily environment reporter

regional conditions are tilted too much in the direction of protecting aquatic resources and not enough in the direc tion of regulatory relief while also making the nationwid permit program unduly complicated regional conditioning the purpose of regional conditioning is to consider local differences in aquatic resource functions and values to ensure that nationwide permits do not authorize activities with mo re than minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment one type of regi onal conditioning is done by district and division engineers who propose specific cond itions if there are concerns for the aquatic environment in pa rticular district watershe d or other geographic region corps officials also may propose revocation of nwp authorization for all some or portions of the nationwide permits sec ond type of regional conditions is imposed by state section 401 water qua lity certification or for stat coastal zone consistency see discussion below re gional conditions might include identifying distinct watersheds or waterbodies where certain nationwide permits s hould be suspended or revoked thus requiring landowners to obt ain individual project specific permits reducing the acreage thresholds in certain types of waters or adding notification requirements for all permitted work in certain watersheds the permits issued in 2000 provided new and somewhat more fo rmal approach than in the past to developing appropriate conditional require ments in each corps district providing explicitly for public input and coordina tion with federal resource agencies the 2002 permits emphasized that lik the 1996 and 2000 permits the nwp program will rely greatly on regional conditioning to adju st the national program to local watersheds district engineer can either add special conditions to the nwp authorization or exercise discretionary authority to require an individual permit this flexibility continues to cause various concerns among stakeholders with some environmentalists arguing that more re strictive national standards on the nwps should be imposed instead of relying upon discretionary authority process some in industry believe that the discretionary authority results in greater complexity and less predictability for regulated entities however regarding increased use of regional conditioning to strengthen permits some envir onmental groups have been skeptical that the corps would be able to attach meaningful conditions while developers have d the opposite concern that restrictions imposed by co rps regions would be unduly burdensome32 the 2007 reissued nwps continue the corps reliance on regional conditioning and review of preconstruction notification of specific projects as way for regulators to ensure that impacts of activities are min imal echoing their concerns about the corps reliance on compensatory mitigati on environmental groups criticized the corps expectation that regional conditioning can assure that

activity is consistent with the states coastal zone manageme nt czm program review under the 401 water quality certification process or czm concurrence is an important means by which states ensure that their water quality concerns will be considered in federally licensed activities because state can use this authority to place its own conditions on the federal permit or to deny the permits use

especially when states deny certification or czm concurrence nwp reissuance public review and coordination state responses issuance or reissuance of nwps begins approximately six months in advance of

initiates 60day public comment period on the draft permits and also serves as the corps request to states to issue deny or waive certification of the nwps concurrent with the federal register notice corps district offi ces solicit comments on proposed regional conditions and also on their proposals to susp end or revoke some or all of the nwps if they have issued or propose to i ssue regional

only authorize activities that result in minimal individual adverse effects on the aquatic environmental at the regional level also during the 60day postpublicati on period states and indian tribes complete their 401 water quality certifica tion and czma consistency decisions water quality certifications andor czma consistency determinations may be issued without conditions issued with conditions or denied for speci fic nwps conditions placed as result of 401 certification or cz ma concurrent by state automatically become part of nationwide permit in that state many states have denied blanket water quality certification for certain nwps for example many states have opposed nwp 29 since it was first issued in 1995 and about onethird of states have denied 401 certification because the pe rmit was determined to be inconsistent with state water quality standards or other state wetlands management activities other states have attached additional conditions to the use of nwps to ensure that water quality impacts are minimal the corps believes in general that activities authorized by nwps will not violate state or tribal water quality standards and will be consistent with czm plans thus if state denies water quality certification or disagrees that the activities authorized by the nwps are consistent with state czm program the corps will deny authorization for the affected activitie s within that state but does so without prejudice thus when applicants request approval of such activities and the corps determines that the activities meet the rms and conditions of the nwp the corps will issue provisional verification letters notifying the applicant that nwp authorization is contingent upon obtaining the necessary proj ectspecific water quality certificate or waiver thereof or czma consistency termination from the state through process called individual certification of nwp use on casebycase basis an issue of longstanding concern to states is the fact that if state denies 401 certification or czm concurrence the corps does not necessarily consider the states action sufficient cause to deny issuance of the federal permit when this happens in the case of nationwide permits the state is forced either to accept the permitted activity as authorized by the corps or to expend its resources to review the project separately and issue 401 certif ication with conditions specifi c to that project states object that when the corps issues provisi onal verification of nw p authorization this puts pressure on states to certify projects ma ny states take the position that if state denies certification the corps should evalua the project under the individual permit process states would like the corps to treat 401 denial of an nwp as veto the corps may deny the permit withdrawing its applicability in state but will not always do so the corps does not believe th at state denial of 401 certification should be the sole basis for requiring an individual permit the corps position is that denial of state water quality certification for nationwid permit does not necessarily mean that unacceptable advers effects will occur on casebycase basis and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97223crs24 corps prefers that the burden of conditioning or restricting the project at that point be with the state through issuance of projectspecific 401 certification or czm consistency determination this tension over state and federal responsibilities does not exist unde r other clean water act permits for example unde r the acts discharge permit program for industrial and municipal sources the national pollutant discharge elimination system program in section 402 of the act if state nies 401 water quality certification epa insists on changes to the project until it gains certification one option is for states to seek pproval of programmatic general permit pgp see discussion in footnote 4 if the state is qualified and has sufficient regulatory authority the corps would then suspend federal permitting and there would be less question over state water quality or other requirements this is the case in number of states with pgp programs which replace some or all of the federal nationwide permits state pgps are duplicative of some nationwide permits and offer more streamlined regulatory process for applicants another option is for states to seek authorization for full assumption of the 404 program more complicated process than pgp approval and only michigan and new jersey have done so however not all states are intere sted or able to seek pgp approval or full program authorization thus even though th corps has stated its intention to work in partnership with states most states will continue to conduct 401 certification reviews of nationwide and other wetlands permits and it is likely that conflicts over water quality certification will persist defining minimal adverse effects assessing cumulative impacts some observers have been critical that while the corps has made some environmentally strengthening improveme nts to many of the nationwide permits since 1996 it has not addressed number of outstanding concerns for example both environmental groups nd industry groups have cr iticized the corps for declining to define what ar minimal adverse effects industry groups contend that determination of minimal effects is central to whether an individual permit is required if the corps cannot define min imal effects they say how can it claim that any particular restric tion is required to achieve it environmental groups argue different point that wit hout defining what minimal is the corps cannot argue that even with specified restrictions given activity will have only minimal environmental impacts on these points the corps general position is that it is not appropriate to define or dictate these matters on nationwide basis because what constitutes minimal adverse environmental effects can vary widely from state to state and watershed to watershed environmentalists have urged the corps to conduct cumulative impact analysis of the nationwide permit program the agency has declined to do so contending that the permits do not constitute major federal action having significant effect on the human environment since corps data on the usage of permits suggest that the adverse effects even cumulatively

corps announ ced in june 1998 that it would prepare programmatic environmental impact stat ement peis on the nationwide permit program and would consult with the othe r federal resource agencies although the corps continued to hold that the pr ogram has significant impact on the environment or on endangered species36 the corps viewed voluntary preparation of this peis as part of its commitment to ensure that the nationwide program authorizes only activities with minimal individual and cumulative environmental effects draft peis was issued in july 200137 and the corps said at the time that final peis would be issued early in 2002 this did not occur because the corps determined that it was not necessary to complete the peis for the nationwide permits the corps contends that it fulfills the requirements of nepa through the issuance of environmental assessments38 rather than conducting an eis for any of the nationwide permits individually or peis for the package of permits the corps prepares preliminary decision documents for each proposed nwp includi ng an environmental assessment and finding of significant impact these documents consider the environmental effects of each nwp from national perspective and thus comply with requirements of nepa environmental groups are strongly critical of these documents saying that they consist mostly of rote boilerplate with little actual analysis and real evaluation of alternatives39 others argue that the documents are nearly identical in language for each nwp and merely reitera the language of section 404e of the clean water act as if repeating the mantra that the impacts are minimal they magically become minimal40 by extracting data from each of the 2006 draft decision documents environmental groups estimated that the permits proposed by the corps would impact 31800 acres over five years or 497 square miles while these groups argue that the data used by the corps are flawed and undercount likely impacts they also argue that it is not reasonable to conclude that impacts of that scope are below the required th reshold of minimal even w ith the addition of regional conditions and district engineers

it saying that the study was unnecessary and would increase wetlands loss in the nation by laying issuance of replacement permits the final bill pl 10660 mo dified the house language by directing the

and that processing time and pending applications would rise steadily each year in principle the additional permitting time could be avoided if the corps permitting budget were increased sufficiently
