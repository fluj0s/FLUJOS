economic relationship summary the united states and the european union eu share huge dynamic and mutually beneficial econo mic partnership not only is the useu trade and investment relationship the largest in the world but it is also arguably the most important agreement between the two partners in the past has been critical to making the world trading system more open and efficient given the high level of useu commercial interactions trade tensions and disputes are not unexpected in the past useu trade relations have witnessed periodic episodes of rising trade tensi ons and conflicts onl to be followed by successful efforts at dispute settlement this ebb and flow of trade tensions occurred again in 2006 with highprofile disputes involving the doha round of multilateral trade negotiations and produc tion subsidies for the comme rcial aircraft sector major useu trade disputes have vari ed causes some disputes stem from demands from producer interest s for support or protection trade conflicts involving agriculture aerospace steel and contingency protection fit prominently into this grouping these conflicts tend to be prom pted by traditional trade barriers such as subsidies tariffs or indus trial policy instruments wh ere the economic dimensions of the conflict predominate other conflic ts arise when the us or the eu initiate actions or measures to prot ect or promote their political and economic inte rests often in the absence of significant private sector pressures the underlying cause of these disputes over such issues as sanctions ilateral trade actions and preferential trade agreements are different foreign policy goals and priorities of brussels and washington still other conflic ts stem from an array of domestic regulatory policies that reflect differing social and environmental values and objectives conflicts over hormonetreated beef bioen gineered food products prot ection of the audiovisual sector and aircraft hushkits for example are rooted in different useu regulatory approaches as well as social preferences these three categories of trade conflic ts traditional foreign policy and regulatory possess varied potential for future trade conflict this is due mostly to the fact that bilateral and multilateral agreements governing the settlement of disputes affect each category of disputes differently by providing fairly detailed map of permissible actions and obligations trade agreements can dampen the inclination of governments to supply protec tion and private sector pa rties to demand protection in sum useu bilateral trade conflicts do not appear to be as ominous and threatening as the media often portray but th ey are not ephemeral distractions either rather they appear to have real beit limited economic and political consequences for the bilateral relationship from an economic perspective the disputes may also be weakening efforts of the two partners to provide strong leadership to the

world trade organization wto proceedings the term dispute is used more narrowly for issues that have been subject to wto consultations including t hose requests which have led to panel and appellate review proceedings unless referring to particular dispute the two terms however are often used interchangeably 2 data sources for this section unless ot herwise noted are drawn from the following

wweurunionorgprofilefacts and various editions of the survey of current business department of commercetrade conflict and the useuropean union economic relationship introduction the bilateral economic relationship between the united states and european union eu is shaped by two outstandi ng trends on the one hand the two transatlantic economies share high degree of commercia l interaction most notably huge trade and investment relationship nd growing number of corporate mergers cooperation between the two partners has been cr itical to the promotion of world trade on the other hand the bilateral economic relationship is subject to limited but increasingly contentious trade conflicts that potentially could have adverse political and economic repercussions1 these include weakening of shared interests and bonds as well as an undermining of the cr edibility of the world trade organization the dimensions of the mutually benefici side of the econo mic relationship are well known the united states and eu are pa rties to the largest twoway trade and investment relationship in the world nnual twoway flows of goods services and foreign direct investment exceeded 13 tr illion in 2005 this sum means that over 3 billion is spent every day on transatlantic purchases of goods services and direct investments2 the european union as unit is the second largest next to canada trading partner of the united states in merchandi or goods in 2005 the eu accounted for 206 or 186 billion of us exports nd 185 or 309 billion of us imports the eu is also the largest us trading partner in services in 2005 the eu purchased slightly over 34 of total us services exports or 130 billion but the united states since 1993 has been importing more goods from the eu than it has been exporting in 2005 the resu lting us trade deficit with the eu totaled 122 billion or 16 of the us merchandise trade deficit with the world this trade deficit is partially offset by us surpluses in services trade which have averaged around 10 billion dollars over the 20022005 periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30732crs2 canada 33eu25 130 latin am 62 other asia 53japan 43australia 8other 33billions of us dollars

along with the introduction of single currency the euro for twelve members the eu market is also increasingly open and standardized the fact that each side has major ownership stake in the others market may be the most remarkable aspect of the commercial relationship at the end of 2004 the total stock of twoway direct inve stment reached 19 trillion composed of 942 billion in eu investment in the united stat and 965 billion in us investment in the eu making us and european companies the largest investors in each others market roughly 60 of corporate americas foreign investments are located in europe while almost 75 of europes foreign investme nts are based in the united states this massive amount of ownershi p of companies in each others markets translates into billions of dollars of sales production and ex penditures on research and development in addition an estima ted 67 million americans are employed by european affiliates operating in the united states and almost an equal number of eu citizens work for american companies in europe4 foreign direct investment also serves to spur international trade flows this is due to the fact that trade taking place within the same company imports by us affiliates from their eu parent firms and exports by us companies to their eu affiliates accounts for around one third of us total trade with the eu the trade and employment linkages associated with foreign direct investment engender strong and politically active interest groups that l obby on both sides of the atlantic in favor of maintaining friendly b ilateral ties

current s bilateral trade disputes have been an important part of the relationship during the cold war as well as after they are nothing new nor unexpected given the hug volume of commercial interactions historically with the possible exception of agriculture the disputes have been managed without excessive politi cal rancor perhaps due to th balanced nature of the trade and investment rela tionship policymakers nd many academics often emphasize that the us and eu always ve more in common than in dispute and like to point out that trade disputes usually affect tiny fraction often estimated at 12 percent of the trade in goods and serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30732crs5 all in the family the notion that trade disputes with the european union generally have engendered less political rancor and bitterness than us trade disputes with number of developing countries and japan is popular one whethe r the proposition is valid or not the most common explanation put forth relates to the vi ew that transatlantic trade relations are underpinned by comparable levels of socioeconomic development and by more balanced economic interactions eu member states unlike many developing countries have wage rates and labor and environmental standards that equal or exceed us standards from one perspective this fact shields europe from charges of cutthroat competition and unfair trade that are often directed at lowwa ge developing countries possessing relatively low labor and environmental standards several indicators support the argument that trade between the united states and eu takes place on level playing field as measured by the value of imports and exports of goods and services as percenta ge of gdp for example case can be made that both economies are similarly open to tr ade in 2005 the trade openness ratios of both trading partners ranged between 25 and 30 percent the composition of trade and pattern of trade deficits are also used to illustrate that useu trade ties are balanced and nonadversar ial unlike us trade with china us eu trade is characterized by high level of intraindustry trade where both sides import and export similar products such as cars comput ers aircraft and integrated circuits nor have us merchandise trade deficits with th eu given rise to the same kind of concern that us trade deficits with china have sparked macroeconomic factors such as differential economic growth rates and the exchange rates are generally thought to explain most of the fluctuation in the useu bilateral deficit rath er than trade barriers or other structural attributes in the middle of this decade however washington and brussels are still at loggerheads over number of issues rangin g from bioengineered food products and aircraft to the treatment of ag riculture in the doha round of mu ltilateral trade negotiations the conflicts have not been eas to resolve and some of the efforts at dispute resolution have led to escalation and titfortat retaliation instead of compromising in an effort to find solutions policymakers on both sides sometimes appear more interested in getting even congress has been in the middle of many of the trade disputes by both crafting and passing legislation cong ress has supported the efforts of us agricultural and industrial interests to gain better access to eu markets congress has pressured the executive branch to take harder line against the eu in resolving number of disputes but has also cooperated with the administration in crafting compromise solutions combined with growing value of trade now being disputed the political and economic effects of trade discord between brussels and washington are important questions why are many disputes so di fficult to resolve what can be done to improve dispute resolution efforts are the disputes undermining business confidence or efforts at economic policy c oordination are the disputes weakening the credibility of the wto dispute settlement system do the political disputeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30732crs6 reflect differences between the two partners in terms of basic valu and orientations if so could the disputes force fundament reevaluation of the importance of the bilateral relationship in short what is the significance of trade conflict to the bilateral relationship this report considers these overriding ques tions in three parts the first part categorizes and evaluates the trade conflic ts according to their underlying causes and characteristics in light of the causes nd dimensions of the disputes the second section examines the potential for conflict management final section assesses the role that trade disputes may be play ing in the useu economic relationship sources of trade conflict changes in government regulations laws or practices that protect or promote domestic commercial interests at the expense of foreign interests are at the heart of most trade conflicts while governments are the sole providers or suppliers of trade protection there are range of parties or interest groups th at demand or request measures that result in protection for domes tic parties these include producers and workers as well as consumer and envir onmental interest groups governments may also be the primary demanders or initiators of actions that have trade protectionist effects useu trade conflicts vary according to the nature of the demand for protection many of the major useu trad conflicts are classi fied and discussed below according to the nature of the mand for protective action while many of the conflicts are spurred by multiple demanders and causes an attempt is made to classify disputes according to categories that seemin gly account for the overriding cause or demand for government action as most trade conflicts em body mixture of economic po litical and social dimensions there is ample room for di sagreement over the dominant cause of any particular dispute by and large this report classifies most of the conflicts according to american perspectives useuropean disagreements over the cause and nature of the controversy of cour provides the basis for many of the conflicts whether the conflict is propelled by protectionist or other dom estic aims remains key question in some disputes as well traditional trade conflict producer protection some conflicts stem primarily from demands from producer or vested interests for protection or state aids these ki nds of disagreements arise when both transatlantic trade partners in support of vested interest s and key industries craft policies that try to open markets for exports but keep markets protected from imports as much as possible trade conflicts involving agriculture aerospace steel and contingency protection fit prominently in this grouping these are examples of traditional trade conflicts prompted by trade barriers such as tariffs subsidies or industrial policy instruments where th economic

agricultural trade disputes historically have been major sticking points in transatlantic relations accountin g for declining percentage of output and employment in both the eu and united st ates the agricultural sector has produced disproportionate amount of the trade tension between the two sides in the past the majority of what can be called trad itional conflicts stemmed primarily from government efforts to shield or protect fa rmers from the full effects of market forces nontraditional agricultural disputes invol ving food safety and the application of biotechnology to food producti on are discussed below under regulatory protection from the us perspective the restrictive trade regime set up by the common agricultural policy cap has been the real villain it has been longstanding us contention that the cap is the largest single distortion of global agricultural trade american farmers and policymakers have complained over the years that us sales and profits are adversely affected by 1 eu restrictions on market access that have protected the european market for european farmers 2 by eu export subsidies that have deflated us sales to third markets and 3 by eu domestic income support programs that have kept noncompe titive european farmers in business5 agricultural conflict particularly over the decline in us exports to the eu and growing eu competition for sales in third markets was intense in the 1980s during this period the majority of us sectio n 301 cases were directed at the cap and fierce subsidy wars were waged over third country markets

whose primary objective is supporting farm in come since its inception in 1962 the cap has been guided by three principles 1 free flow of agricultural commodities within the eu 2 community preferences whereby eu products have priority in the internal market over imports and 3 common financing of agricultural programs historically the high support prices of th cap have provided strong incentives for investing in eu agriculture since 1970 the eu has shifted from being net importer to one of the worlds largest net exporters of wheat sugar beef pork poultry and dairy products one effect of the cap has been to raise ov erall food prices for consumers in the eu most us farm programs in contrast s upport farm income without raising food prices to the consumer spending on the cap accounts for over 50 percent of the eu budget high budget outlays in the past have caused several budget crises leading to policy reforms aimed at curbing agricultural expenditures eu largement to include number of east european countries that have large agricultu ral sectors is providing additional pressures for reforming the cap tensions however have moderated markedly since the completion of the uruguay round in the mid1990s the 1994 uruguay round agreement on agriculture defined more clearly what both partners can do in their agricultural and trade policies as well as defined more clearly the qua ntities of agricultural products that countries can export with subsidies and strengthened the procedure for settling disputes involving those ru the agreement also contained nineyear peace clause whereby wto members agreed not to challenge other countries subsidies with domestic cases or wto challenges7 for the most part the us and eu have honored their uruguay round agricultural commitments including due

ource of friction in useu relations over the past several decades the fights have focused primarily on eu member state support for airbus industrie consortiu m of four european companies that collectively produce airbus aircraft according to the office of the us trade representative ustr airbus member governments france uk germany and spain have provided massive subsidies since 1967 to their member companies to aid in the development producti on and marketing of the airbus family of large civil aircraft the us has also accused the eu of providing other forms of support to gain an unfair advantage in this key sector including equity infusions debt forgiveness debt rollovers marketing ssistance and favored access to eu airports and airspace10 for its part the eu has long resisted us charges and argued that for strategic and economic purposes it could not cede the entire passenger market to the americans particularly in the wake of the 1997 boeingmcdonnell douglas merger and the pressing need to maintain sufficient global competition the europeans have also countercharged that their ac tions are justified because us aircraft producers have benefitted from huge indirect governmental subsidies in the form of military and space contracts and governme nt sponsored aeros pace research and development11 the most recent round of this longsta nding trade dispute stems from may 30 2005 wto filing by the united states alleging that european community ec member states provided airbus with illegal subsidies giving the firm an unfair advantage in the world market for large commercial jet aircraft the following day the ec submitted its own request to the wto claiming that boeing had received illegal subsidies from the us government two panels were established on october 17 2005 one handling the us charges against airbus and the other handling the eus counterclaims against boeing and both panels have begun hearing the cases final panel rulings are not

member firms will provide 60 of this sum with the remaining 40 coming from subcontractors stateaid from eur opean governments is also source of funding for airbus member firms state aid is limited to onethird of the projects total cost by the 1992 agreement on gove rnment support for civil aircraft between the united states and the european union eu now repudiated by the united states but not by the ec shortly after the a380 project was nnounced boeing dropped its support of competing new large aircraft boeing belie ves that the market for a380size aircraft is limited it has therefor settled on the concept of producing new technology 250seat aircraft the 787 which is viewed as replacement fo r 767size aircraft13 the 787 is designed to provide pointtopoi nt service on wide array of possible international and domestic us routes the aircraft design incorporates features such as increased use of composite materials in structural elements and new engines with the goal of producing an aircraft that is si gnificantly more fuel efficient than existing aircraft types boeing formally launc hed the program in 2004 and obtained 56 firm orders during the remainder of 2004 by the end of 2005 the order book for the 787 had expanded dramatica lly to 291 aircraft to construct this aircraft boeing is proposing to greatly expand its use of non us subcontractors and nontr aditional funding for example japanese group will provide approximately 35 of the funding for the project 16 billion in return this group will produce large portion of the aircrafts structure and the wings this will be the first time that boeing commercial product will use nonus built wing alenia of italy is expected to provide 600 million and produce the rear fuselage of the aircraft in each of these instances the subcontractor is expected to receive some form of financial assistance from their respective governments other subcontractors are also expected to take large financial stakes in the new aircraft the project is also expected to benefit from state and local tax and other incentives most notable among these is 32 billion of such incentives from the state of washington many of these nontraditiona l funding arrangements are specifically cited by the ec in its wto complaint as being illegal subsidies whether the wto litigation provides an incentive for the united states and the eu to resolve the dispute bilaterally remains to be seen to date the two sides have wrangled over host of procedural issu but have not been negotiating on possible settlement to the dispute some analysts believe that

the 1990s the us gove rnment in the past has alleged that many eu companies still benefit from earlier state subsidies andor engage in dumping steel products selling at less than fair value in foreign markets us steel companies also have aggressively used us trade laws to fight against eu steel imports by filing antidumping and counter vailing duty petitions that include imports from eu countries in return the eu has countered with numerous challenges in the wto against the alleged us misuse of its countervailing duty and antidumping laws in addition to unfair trade disputes president bush in june 2001 requested the us international trade commission i tc undertake new section 201 trade investigation on the steel industry14 the petition had broad support from congress the steel industry and labor unions the it c subsequently ruled that much of the industry was being injured by increased imports and recomme nded relief measures to president bush on march 5 2003 the president decided to impose threeyear safeguard tariffs with top ra tes of 30 he imposed the restrictions for three years on all major steel exporting countries except us free trade partners such as canada and mexico the us decision raised cries of indi gnation and protectionism from european leaders and prompted quick respons on march 27 2002 citing threat of diversion of steel from the us market to europe the eu announced provisional tariffs of 15 to 26 on 15 different steel products the eu and number of other countries adversely affected by the us tariffs also formally challenged the us action as being

has been the conti nued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa or byrd amendment enacted by the us congress in october 2000 this provision required that the proceeds from antidumping and countervailing duty cases be paid to the us companies responsible for bringing the cases instead of to the us treasury soon after enactment the eu and eight other par ties challenged the statute in the wto on the grounds that th provision constituted nonpermissible specific action against dumping or subsidy contrary to various wto agreements basically the plaintiffs argued that the action benefitted us companies doubly first by the imposition of the antidumpi ng or countervailing duties and second by receiving the duties at the ex pense of their competitors the wto in january 2003 concluded that the byrd amendment was an impermissible action against dumping or s ubsidization and gave the united states until december 23 2003 to comply with the wto ruling when the united states did not comply with the ruling the complaining members requested authorization to impose retaliatory measures wto arbitr ator determined in august 2004 that each of the eight complainants could impose countermeasures on

keep the sanctions on us imports in place as long as the disbursements continue th eu in particular elected to increase the amount of retaliation by nearly 9 million from 278 million to 369 million

from us perspective the eus preferential dealings with third countries the foreign sale s corporation fsc export taxrebate dispute and challenges to varied us trade laws could be said to be driven primarily by eu foreign policy priorities eu concerns us legislation which re quires the imposition of trade sanctions for foreign policy or nontrade reas ons has been major concern of the eu while the eu often shares many of the foreign policy goals of the united states that are addressed in such legi slation it has opposed the extraterritorial provisions of certain pieces of us legislation that seek to unilaterally regulate or control trade and investment activities conducted by companies outside the united states although these issues have been relatively quiet in recent years number of the provisions remain us law including the cuban li berty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 socalled helmsburton act and the iran libya sanctions act ilsa which threaten the extraterritorial imposition of us sanctions against european firms doing business in cuba iran and libya16 other eu concerns about different instances of us extraterritoriality relate to various environmentally driven embargoes export control legislation and subfederal sta tes procurement provisions or boycott activities17 the helmsburton act passed in 1996 af ter the cuban military shot down two small us based civilian planes led to firestorm of protest in europe perhaps not since the us imposed sanctions against companies doing business on russian pipeline in the early 1980s had the europ ean outcry been so vociferous the bill which was designed to further isolat cuba economically imposed secondary boycott against foreign nationals and comp anies that traffic in cubanexpropriated properties formerly

helmsburton and iranlibya sanction act19 formal implementation of the understanding however still awaits legislative action by congress20 closely related to eu concerns about extraterritoriality are complaints about us trade laws and procedures that allow for the unilateral imposition of trade sanctions against offending c ountries or companies most eu complaints relate to the section 301 family of trade provisions which authorize the executive branch to impose trade sanctions in an effort to enforce us rights under international trade agreements and to combat foreign unfair trade practices in addition to general trade barriers which the us government deems discriminate against or burden us commerce other more specialized provisions dealing with government procurement barriers often legislated by states and intellectual property rights violations are also subject to eu charges as examples of us unilateralism additionally upsetting to some ameri can interests the eu during the

supported both enlargement and deepening in the political interest of european stability thus raising question concerning the compatibility of us political and trade goals for its part the eu has expressed fears that free trade agreements being pursued by the united states could lead to discrimination against its exports specifically the eu is concerned that us efforts to negotiate free trade agreements with asia through the asian pacific economic coope ration apec process and with latin america through the free trade area of the americas ftaa could lead to discrimination against eu

including regulations and standards that produce conflict by altering the terms of competition in the name of promoting social cultu ral or environmen tal objectives often domestic producers benefit either intenti onally or inadvertently at the expense of foreign producers many of these clashes ve occurred as result of efforts by both partners to strengthen food safety and environmental sta

values and distinctiveness these disputes tend to involve complex ne w issues that have arisen as result of increased economic interdependence nd of significant useu differences in regulatory approaches the eu approach to regulation is based on the notion that every important economic activity shoul d take place under legal framework whereas the central premise of the us pproach is that government does not need to regulate unless problem arises while the impact on trade may be the same as in other disputes these conflicts are often characterized by delicate considerations of motives

if food safety is used as disguise for protectionism support for fr ee trade could also erode the four disputes summarized below are rooted in different regulatory approaches and public preferences

sector has strong cultural basis steeped in perceived need to preserve west european society from us dominance and clash over an eu regulation banning airplanes outfitted with hushkitted or retooled engines ostensibly was driven by environmental demands to reduce noise pollution surrounding european airports numerous other disputes could also be included in the following discussion for example dispute over da ta privacy reflects very different approaches between the us and eu as well as popular attit udes towards the pr otection of personal information that is transmitted electronically the issue of multifunctionality in agriculture where the european s claim agriculture is more than just another industry has deep cultural roots that divide the two sides disputes involving environmental wildlife and animal welfare pr otection such as us restrictions on imports of tuna from europe and eu efforts to ban fur im ports from the united states also reflect competing social and cultural differences beef hormones the dispute over the eu ban implemented in 1989 on the production and importation of meat treated with growthpromoting hormones has been one of the most bitter and intractable trade disputes between the united states and europe it is also dispute that on its surface involves relatively small amount of trade the ban affected an estimate d 100 200 milli on in lost us exports less than onetenth of one percen t of us exports to the eu in 1999 but the dispute has played off each sides sovereign right to regulate the safety of its food against its wto obligations25 the eu justified the ban to protect th health and safety of consumers but several wto dispute settlement panels subsequently ruled that the ban was inconsistent with the uruguay round sanitary and phytosanitary sps agreement the sps agreement provides criteria that have to be met when country imposes food safety import regu lations more stringent than t hose agreed upon in international standards these include scientific asse ssment that the hormones pose health risk along with risk assessment although th wto panels concluded that the eu ban lacked scientific justification the eu refused to remove th ban primarily out of concern that european consumers were opposed to having this kind of meat in the marketplacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30732crs18 26 pollack mark political

this led th way for the united states to impose 100 retaliatory tariffs on 116 million of eu ag ricultural products from mostly france germany italy and denmark countries deemed the biggest supporters of the ban these tariffs in turn sparked protests among french and european farmers who seized on the beef hormones case as symbol of the threat pose by americanization and globalization to european regulations and traditions26 the us hard line was buttressed by c oncerns that other countries might adopt similar measures based on health concerns that lack an objective scientific basis according to us standards other us interest groups are concerned that non compliance by the eu undermines the future ability of the wto to resolve disputes involving the use of sps measures in october 2003 the european commi ssion notified the wto that it had changed its hormone ban legislation in way that it believes complies with international trade rules the legislation made provisional prev ious permanent ban for five growth hormones used to raise beef and keeps in place permanent ban on the use of oestradiaol 17 on the basis that it is carcinogen as result the eu argued that it should longer be subject to punitive trade sanctions by the united states as well as by canada and on n ovember 8 2004 took the initial step in the wto to challenge the us and canadian sanctions still in effect the us and meat industry however argued that making ban provisional for the long term does not meet wto obligations nevertheless in february 2005 the eu secured the establishment of panel to determine whether the united states and canada were in violation of wto rules by maintaining punitive tariffs on number of eu products in the dispute wto dispute panel h earing on this issue was held on august

continued hushkit dispute in transatlantic economic disputes pp 247280conflict management the three categories of trade conflicts traditional foreign policy and regulatory appear to offer different possibilities for conflict management this is due not only to the fact that the causes and dimensions of these categories of conflicts differ but also because the institutional rela tionships and forces th at affect the supply of and demand for protecti on are operative in varying degrees from category to category these factors include the presen ce or absence of bilateral or multilateral agreements and rules that govern the settlement of the disputes the extent to which the disputes fit into the standard free tr ade versus protectionism dichotomy the relevance of underlying econo mic and political trends and the effectiveness of other institutional arrangements designed to prevent or resolve the disputes bilateral and multilateral trade agreements can dampen the inclination of governments to supply protection and the private sector to demand protection by pr oviding fairly detailed road map of permissible actions and obligations while often litigated and disputed the obligations tend to be relatively clearcut and help resolve disagreements when new spats arise builtin procedures of many agreements can facilitate settlement or help avoid escalation conflicts that fall into the standard free trade versus protectionism dichotomy also have builtin potential for undercutting any rationale governments may have to supply protection or private parties may use in manding protection this happens due to an ideological consensus in both the u s and eu in favor of resisting protectionism on both economic nd political grounds as result most demands for protection from producer interests must be justified as exceptions to the generalized support for freer trade arrangements and policies diverse economic and political tre nds can also suppress the supply and demand for protection for example declining support for industrial policy initiatives as has been the case in both the us and eu could make industryspecific pleas for government assistance less compelling high priority political commitments such as the eus policy towards enlargement may also create incentives for reform and liberalization as opposed to protection both formal and informal cooperative arrangements have proliferated over the past decade to better manage transatlantic trade disputes these have included effo rts to strengthen regulatory co operation and the establishment of forums for bilateral consultations by attempting to incorporate the views of wider range of domestichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30732crs22 interest groups these efforts have also aimed at preventing disputes from arising applying these factors to the three categ ories of trade disputes there are grounds for judging that traditional trade conflicts may become less disruptive to the bilateral relationship in the future but more limited grounds for projecting diminution of foreign policy induced friction the pros pects for future domesticpolicy related trade disputes fall somewhere in between these two extremes with reasons for foreseeing reduction in friction associated with some disputes but not all the basis for this assessment is presented below traditional trade conflict traditional trade conflicts involving demands from producer interests for protection or state aids by definition rais fairly routine commercial questions that have been addressed by governments for d ecades as result most are governed by some bilateral or multilateral agreement or understa nding the wto in particular provides body of multilateral ru governing the use of ta riffs and other restrictive trade practices and forum for consultation and dispute resolution and in the event of noncompliance with wto rulings reta liation can be authorized to provide incentives for compliance with wto rulin gs disputes involving agriculture aerospace steel and contingency protection have all been tempered by the wto framework of rules and obligations the uruguay round agreement on agricu lture significantly dampened trade conflict in the areas of eu home market pr otection and export subsidy wars for third country markets the multilateral agreem ent on subsidies provides the terms of engagement for the current clashes over launch aid for the a380 steel trade conflict in recent years has pivoted ar ound the utilization of antidumping and safeguard laws procedures that both the us and eu employ with considerable frequency and which both sides in the past have considered legitimate the fact that the steel trade battle in 2002 was so heated may stem from mutual perception that each side did not adhere to the letter or spirit of the safeguards agreement traditional trade conflicts also tend to fit into the standard free trade versus protectionism dichotomy as in the case of agriculture aerospace steel and the byrd amendment proposals or requests fo r additional protecti on or promotion will be subject to full transparency investiga tion and debate give n that both the united states and european union have open soci eties with an ideological consensus in favor of competition and open markets petitioners for protection will have the burden of arguing that their request merits being excepted from the dominant policy orientation several economic and political trends ma also serve to lim it future disputes involving producer protection these incl ude decline of

single market that is deregulated and more competitive subsidies and state aids to individual companies have been increasingly challenged scru tinized and curtailed this trend which is reenforced by budgetary constraints associated with fiscal targets required of member states participating in the european monetary ion could serve not only as strong force for reducing conflict in aviation and

resolve very basic foreign policy differences over how to respond to violations by third countri of international norms affecting human rights or security many trade measures taken in foreign policy context are either exempt from wto disciplines because they are either mandated by the united nations or applied against nonwto countries or only very loosely regulated by the wto the latter arises because the national security provision of gatt article 21 provides wide latitude for countries to pur sue sanctions if they deem the measures to be in their national security interest33 wto rules

24 provisions that allow regional agreements to deviate fro m the nondiscrimination principle of the wto few challenges have been launched major obstacle has been the difficulty of measuring the value of trade diverted from efficient producers to the beneficiaries of preferences granted as result the drive to cut preferential deals continues to grow along with mistrust while the ability to challenge deals that raise new trade barriers remains quite weak as the us and eu embark on even more aggressive efforts to negotiate preferential trade agreements increased conflict in this area may

regulatory policy conflict useu trade disputes have focused in creasingly on differences in regulation rather than traditional barriers such as tariffs or subsidies regulatory requirements established primarily with legitimate domestic concerns of consumer and environmental protection or public health in mind do not discriminate at least directly between domestic nd imported goods and services but they may have the secondary effect of distortin g or discriminating against th free flow of international trade which in turn leads to disputes for this reason transatlantic regulatory disputes can be more bitter and difficult to resolve than traditional trade disputes in so far as both sides feel their actions are justified by democratically derived decisions in this context such disputes are often difficult to resolve within the context of the wto because they require balancing of domestic concerns with international obligations36 in trying to resolve or prevent most re gulatory disputes the united states and the eu have tended to rely more on bilateral cooperation and nego tiation than on the wto dispute resolution system the two si des have made much progress bilaterally in mitigating divergent standards and certification systems as source of bilateral trade conflict bilateral efforts to promot regulatory cooperation have been top priority in both governments and private

analyst has argued that trade disputes resulting from such differences are unlikely ever to be resolved at best they can be contained42 on the other hand transatla ntic consumer views ma be converging in some areas for example while us consumers generally have been quite receptive to genetically modified organisms gmos kraft foods nationwide recall in 2000 of taco shells that contained genetically engineered corn not approved for human consumption indicates some underlying di scontent the recall was initiated by coalition of environmental and consumer groups critical of bioengineered food43 others argue that in number of other areas including corporate mergers and internet privacy the european unions more active role in protecting consumers will gain growing appreciation and support in

transatlantic trade trade conflicts rather appear to ve real albeit limited economic and political consequences for the bilateral relationship perhaps more significantly trade disputes may also pose

exports over the banana and beef disputes and the over 2 billion in eu tariffs imposed on us exports over the fsc now suspended nd byrd amendment disputes provide the most visible economic costs of trade conflict the retaliatory tariffs are designed to dramatically increase the costs of selective european and us products making it much more difficult for those targeted foreign producers to sell in the us or eu markets in theory foreign exporters denied access to markets are expected to pressure their respective governments to change the policies that are in violation of wto rules retaliation is not however costfree the process also hurts importers consumers and firms dependent on thos imports as inputs in their production process these entities intensively l obby congress and the european commission to keep their products off any retaliation list that is drawn up domestic political pressures thus limit the scope and flexibility trade officials on both sides of the atlantic have in devising retaliation list as result most retaliation lists tend to be dominated by luxury items or high valueadded agricultural items that are produced by both economic superpowers under these

polls indicate that there is great deal of fear in europe that the united states due to the strength of its economy has th ability to impose both economic and social changes on the rest of the world this fear and perhaps frustration may translate into antipathy to the united states often expressed as antiamericanism us retaliation against europe for not accepting hormoneenha nced beef for example may only fuel these generalized antiamerican feelings that the united states is bully47 the reaction to us retaliation may be even more acute among some european policymakers by selectively targeting only those eu members that have clearly benefitted fro m wto illegal policies many eur opean policymakers view retaliation as frontal assault on european unity an oldfashioned divideandconquer strategy48 commenting on the us proposal to rotate items unde r trade sanctions from product to product and c ountry to country french president chirac complained bitterly that carousel retaliation is much closer to 19th century gunboat diplomacy than to 21st century diplomacy49 whether or how these reactions affect cooperation in other problem areas is difficult to know clearly if trade tensions work to undermine the notion that the united states and europe share common interests or lead to view that weaker europe or weaker america is in the othe rs interest then the consequences could be major but there is evidence to suggest that this is happening as the united states and the eu to date have been able to compartmentalize trade problems to remarkable

have brought complaints to the wto that may have been motivated more by desire to score points with domestic political interests or to rack up negotiating leverage by successfully prosecuting cases
