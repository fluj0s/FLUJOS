the federal housing administration fha was created by the national housing act of 1934 during the height of the great depression1 the act had three objectives 1 to broaden homeownership 2 to shore up and protect home financing institutions and 3 to stimulate employment in the building industry prior to the creation of fha few mortgages exceeded 50 of the propertys value and most mortgages were written for terms of five years or less at the end of the fiveyear term the remaining loan balance had to be repaid or the mortgage had to be renegotiated borrowers generally had little trouble in obtaining new mortgages during the great depression however lenders were unable or unwilling to refinance many of the loans that became due thus many borrowers lost their homes through foreclosure and lenders lost money because property values were falling lenders became wary of the mortgage market fha institutionalized revolutionary idea 20 year mortgages on which the loan would be completely repaid at the loan term if borrowers defaulted fha insured that the lender would be fully repaid mortgage instruments were standardized and new confidence was instilled in the mortgage market investment in housing was stimulated and its ripple effects were felt throughout the economy eventually lenders began to make longterm mortgages without fha insurance if borrowers made significant downpayments over time 25 and 30year mortgages have become standard mortgage products when the department of housing and urban development hud was created in 1965 fha became an agency of hud this
