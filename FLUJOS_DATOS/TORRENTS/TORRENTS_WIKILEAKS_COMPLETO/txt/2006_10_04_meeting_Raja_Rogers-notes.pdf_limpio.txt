wednesday october 4 2006 domain 4 conference call raja rogers talks with his recertified governors 1 increase initiations by redoing website and setting up national call center raja rogers said that this information should not be shared with even directors in other domains but that he always try to share with us 1st raja rogers announced that the news of the day is that rajas have been speaking together and want to increase initiations raja rogers is the point man for this with input from all rajas mum redid their website and got 50 increase in students this year people stay on the web site longer etc the other angle is to have national call center because many cant answer the phone regularly because we are all moving around and cant always answer the plan is to increase initiations by 50 at least ron barnets research says if you get an answering machine on an 800 number call then only 30 will leave message 70 of calls generated are being lost and most of the 30 are going to answering machines national call center is being set up currently if you call 888learntm it rings to nearest tm center that will change because nearest tm center will be answered most of the time by an answering machine currently we are having about 22 calls day on the 888 number we hope to double that at least by redoing tmorg website initially one call center person will be on the east coast 2 at mvc one on the west coast we are considering even having one in hawaii these will be paid positions if anyone is interested let know on east coast need to do earlier program because answer starting at 9 am 95 of our calls come between 9 and 9 weekends are heavier as we test with these 4 people we will slowly or rapidly expand as we work bugs out this does not mean that you will loose your local tm number but you wont have national calls for people that go to the website coming in national site will answer phone and speak to people about tm and then will send you an email and also call you so we need an email you check regularly and phone where you can actually be contacted the call center will say for example i talked to tom jones today and he is interested in learning tm we find at the raj that if we dont get back to people within 24 hours then the closely ratio drops dramatically this is the project that is up in the awareness now questions i what will happen about email messages will they continue to be directed to us directly answer from raja rogers probably will not change that right now we will continue to do tests and see how quickly people are responding this is coming from recertification where maharishi wanted peace palaces open 12 hours daily we will do this with internet phones we do this at the raj with internet phones we will track all the responses we are setting up webbased computer system at the national call center it will not be extra duties for you we will do the phones 1st and think about email later we will get calls for lectures we will be setting up webbased list of all lectures and we will book people for that and email you we will send email that says for example 3 people have made reservation for your lecture at the library on such and such night ii im nervous about your sending people to lecture here since im the only person here answer from raja rogers initially you will do it then in the future if you have lecture at the hyatt for example then national can direct people to that you will always be the one setting the lecture up the national call center can then say we have told this person about your announced lecture and then you can call the person if the date changes iii people talking on the phone will have to know what is closest center in states like florida have to be careful answer from raja rogers yes this is problem with current system area code may not be enough like the current routing of calls everyone on the call tonight should send an email to elaine with succinct list of areas you cover we will need your cell phone and email and description of the city you cover probably charlie and elaine have this already iv on the tmorg website you can jump to state and see list the of cites with phone numbers will that remain on the site answer from raja rogers in 1st phase that will remain as is we need to purify that we need to know that the numbers work and are going to the right area right now try to just capture people who dont do that and call the 888learntm number you still will probably get some calls from the tmorg website answer those judiciously and promptly 24 hours is when people are most interested if you have family situation then thats the karma that you cant pick up the voice mail v if you are doing whole state answer from raja rogers yes then you will get those directed to you concern is that heavy volume in am will be hard for one person to handle we are finding most call after 11 when we will have mvc on also the number will ring in all 3 places we currently think that 911 with one person will work out very well all details about evening etc being worked out this will facilitate all calls some of you are diligent about getting back to people but we know statistically that 70 are not going to leave message 2 raja rogers asked for report on the education conference jeff murphy announced that all the nc and ky mailing went out and that he has had about 20 responses so far also the conference organizers had call with molly cutter today and got lots of answers very exciting 3 report on coronation raja rogers sais i sort of have an inside track on the goings on in holland with the coronations what will the ladies do will the new rajas stay or go into the field one knows coronation went very nicely the men are called raja the ladies are called raj rajeswari which is combination of raja and iswari lord of the universe this signifies tremendous creative power and grace of mother divine they are called raj rajeswari you will hear yesterdays speakers using that terminology talking to candace and her sister its extremely powerful and blissful experiences are superlative the next question is what maharishi will have everyone do in earlier coronations of purusha men they were given universal domain the ladies are upholding enlightenment in the consciousness of the world so sort of like universal domain of purusha rajas 4 celebration in
