repairs and coastal louisiana restoration the corps is responsible for much of the re pair and fortification of the hurricane protection system of coastal louisiana particularly in the greater new

tions process in addition to the posthurricane emergency repairs these funds are being us ed for construction of levees floodwalls storm surge barriers and pump improveme nts to reduce the hurricane flooding risk to the new orleans area to 100year leve l of protection ie protection against storm surge of an intensity that has 1 probability of occurring and to restore and complete hurricane protection in surrounding areas to previously authorized levels of protection by 2011 of the 143 billion 73 billion was provided in fy2008 supplementals the administration included in its fy2009 budget request for 58 billion in emergency supplemental funds to complete these cons truction activities and for related purposes the request said the 7 billion in previous ly appropriated funds were insufficient to complete these activities because of increas ed costs improved data on costs and other factors the supplemental appropria tions act of 2008 pl 110252 provided the requested 58 billion as proposed by the administration and enacted in pl 110152 the state of louisiana would be responsible for 13 billion as its nonfederal costshare contribu tion for the work subsequen tly in the

request legislative language to consolidate the authorities for corps hurricane protection projects in the new orleans area into sing project consolidation would allow for the hurricane protection activities funding to be managed sy stematically rather than on projectbyproject basis lthough neither pl 110252 nor pl 110329 provides this authority they provide for flexibility in the expenditure

acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34417crs6 wrda pl 110114 in november 2007 estimates of the backlogs size had varied from 11 billion to more than 60 billion depending on which projects were included the backlog raises policy questi ons such as whether there is disconnect between the authorization and appropriations process the administration developed performancebased budgeting approach in order to identify which projects from the pool of authorized projects to include in its budget for example the administrations request limited the number of new activities started to only two planning activities and targeted projects nearing completi on the presidents request would fund 79 construction projects of whic h 12 are anticipated to be completed in fy2009 both the house and senate ppropriations committees included funding for numerous projects not include d in the presidents request operation and maintenan ce om funding approaches unlike previous budget requests the fy2009 fy2008 and fy2007 requests did not specify the amount that individual corps proj ects would receive for operation and maintenance om instead the administr ations request woul d have divided the country into regions and specified om funding for each region by six different categories of activities commercial navigation flood and coastal storm damage reduction environment hydropower recr eation and water supply the fy2009 request divides the nation into 54 river syst ems congress did not adopt the regional approach in its fy2008 funding for the co rps om instead the conference report specified amounts for individua l projects and directed the corps to prepare integrated om budgets for four regions the ohio ri ver the great lakes the texas coast and the california coast both the h ouse and senate appr opriations committees report for the fy2009 appropria tions reiterated their suppor t for more systematic and regional approach for operation and maintenance budgeting however they chose not to adopt the administrations pproach due to the absence of regional analysis of how the amounts for each of the 54 systems were derived the earmark debate also has attracted attention to the operation and maintenance account unlike for the fy2007 and fy2008 requests the corps provided estimates of how much individua l projects within each of the 54 systems would receive in fy2009 until re quested by congressional co mmittees attempts by congress to specify om amounts for individual projects may be considered congressionally directed since amounts appear in the presidents

reduce the longterm hazard of sp ent nuclear fuel and recover additional energy such technologies would involve separation of plutonium uranium and other longlived radioactive materials from spent

the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act rejected funding for development of afcf as did the house appropriations committee for fy2009 removing uranium from spent fuel would eliminate most of the volume of spent nuclear fuel that would othe rwise require disposal in deep geologic repository which doe is developing at yucca mount ain nevada the urex process also could reduce the heat generated by nuclear waste the major limit on the repositorys capacity by removing cesium and strontium for separate storage and decay over several hundred years plutonium and other longlived elements would be fissioned in accelerators or fast reactors to reduce the longterm hazard of nuclear waste even if technically feasible however the economic viability of such waste processing has yet to be determined and it still f aces significant opposition on nuclear nonproliferation grounds nevertheless proponent s believe the process is proliferationresistant because further pur ification would be required to make the plutonium useable for weapons and because the high radioactivity of the plutonium mixtures would make the material di fficult to divert or work with under the administrations gnep initiative plutonium partially separated from the highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear reactors would be recycled into new fuel to expand the future supply of nucl ear fuel and potentially reduce the amount of radioactive waste to be disposed of in permanent repository under the initial concept for gnep the united states and ot her advanced nuclear nations would lease new fuel to other nations

lower amount of 575 billion both committee recommendations are more than the presidents request of 553 billion and the 569 billion that congress enacted for fy2008 after rescissions in its draft report the house appropriations committee commented on the overall effectiveness of the program noting its concern that significant health and environmental risks persist at many sites despite the substantial expenditure of resources over time to address them both committees also expressed similar concerns that the presidents pr oposed decreases for some sites may delay compliance with cleanup mile stones ie deadlines cleanup milestones can be critical in gauging efforts to address potential risks at individual sites as these milestones establish time frames for the completion of specific actions or steps within the cleanup process cleanup milestones are identified in written agreements among doe the environmental protection agency epa and state regulatory agencies various federal cleanup statutes aut horize epa and the states to oversee cleanup actions at federal facilities including doe facilities to ensure that such actions are protective of human health and the environment although cleanup mile stones are legally binding the ability to meet specified deadlines depends upon the availability of funding to carry out necessary actions the technical feasibility of those actions and in some cases the resolution of other re gulatory issues upon which milestone may be based consequently it should be noted that funding alone does not necessarily determine the ability of doe to comply with cleanup milestones of the sites still in need of cleanup the hanford facility in the state of washington is the largest and most complex site administered under the environmental management prog ram this site alone recei ves about onethird of the funding for the entire program the ade quacy of fundi ng to clean up hanford has been particularly controversial for ma ny reasons

fy2007 estimated that 1887 billion would be needed to complete cl eanup and dispose of wastes at all sites currently administered by the environmental management program30 this estimate is 295 billion more than the estimate of 1592 billion in does fy2006 financial statement31 the higher cost estimate in the fy2007 financial statement is attributed to various factors such as shifts in individual project baselines and greater uncertainties in does assumptions it so should be noted that the cost estimate of 1887 billion is in fy2007 dollars the partment noted that future inflation could cause actual costs to be substantially higher over time32 in addition to inflation other factors c ould cause actual costs to exceed the more recent 1887 billion estimate for example actual costs could be higher than expected depending on whethe r federal and state regulato rs require more stringent and more costly cleanup actions than doe pl ans to take costs also could rise if initial cleanup actions prove in adequate to protect human health and the environment over the long term future performance of cleanup actions is especially critical for nuclear waste sites because hazar dous levels of radioactivity can persist for thousands of years depending on the pa rticular radionuclide predicting the effectiveness of methods to contain radioactiv wastes over such long peri ods of time is challenging if not impracticable in some cases consequently additi onal funding could be needed at sites where cleanup was thought to be complete if the initial cleanup proves inadequate over timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34417crs48 33 ibid 34 doe performance and accountability report fiscal year 2006 doecf0012 p 173 35 doe us department of energy agency financial report fiscal year 2007

care of sites once wastes ar disposed of and cleanup remedies are in place to ensure the protection of human health and the environment into the future does fy2007 financial statement estimated that 294 billion would be needed for longterm care of sites after work under its environmental ma nagement program is completed33 this estimate is 112 billion more than the estimate of 182 billion in the departments fy 2006 financial statement34 it should be noted that substantial tion of the increase in the more recent estimate is attributed to difference in accounting of the estimated costs for the disposal of certain materials including surplus plutonium the fy2006 financial statement listed the cost of this re sponsibility separately whereas the fy2007 financial statement included it in the estimate for legacy environmental liabilities along with longterm site care adjusting for this difference in accounting the estimate of 294 billion for legacy envir onmental liabilities in the fy2007 financial statement is 13 billion more than the comparable prior year estimate of 281 billion when the estimated costs of the di sposal of surplus plutonium and other materials are included doe explained that its more recent estimate of 294 billion for postclosure site care and other longterm stewardship activities would be incurred over 75 years through fy208235 doe also assumed that some additional funds would be needed to continue the longterm care of sites be yond this time frame but stated that such future costs over lengthy planning horizon cannot reas onably be estimated36 the

total request for the office of legacy management is relatively small decrease below the fy2008 enacted appropriation the funding needs for the office are likely to grow significantly in future years
