domestic social policy division child nutrition and wic legislation in the 108th and 109th congresses summary child nutrition programs eg school meal programs summer food service child care food programs and the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program are subject to periodic comprehensive reviews when appropriations and other authorities expire and have to be reauthorized they were up for reauthorization review in the 108th congress and the only substantial child nutritionwic legislation in the 108th congress and so far in the 109th congress has been the 2004 reauthorization law the child nutrition and wic reauthorization act of 2004 pl 108265 enacted june 30 2004 the 2004 law extended virtually all expiring authorities through fy2009 and contained important but incremental changes in child nutrition programs and the wic program the congressional budget office estimated that it will generate net new spending totaling about 230 million through fy2009 its major feature was set of amendments aimed at improving the integrity and administration of the school meal programs significant changes were made in procedures relating to the way childrens eligibility for free and reducedprice school meals is certified and verified and new initiatives to upgrade schools administration of their meal programs were put in place however minimal revisions were made to the school meal programs themselves for example expansion of eligibility for homeless runaway and migrant children loosened rules for certain higher school breakfast subsidies and major proposal to phase in higher income eligibility limits for free school meals was limited to an authorization for pilot project relatively minor amendments also affected the summer food service and child and adult care food programs for example making permanent and expanding coverage of lugar rules facilitating participation by summer program sponsors and making permanent and nationally applicable rule loosening child and adult care food program eligibility rules for forprofit child care centers another area of concern addressed by the reauthorization law was nutrition health and nutrition education here the biggest initiative was requirement that all schools participating in school meal programs establish locally designed wellness policies to set nutrition physical activity and other goals and strategies for meeting them coupled with it were 1 authorizations for new nutrition education efforts 2 an expansion of the program offering free fresh fruit and vegetables in selected schools and 3 significant changes in food safety rules finally large number of revisions were made to the law governing the wic program the most important among them were amendments aimed at strengthening rules that help contain food costs incurred by the program these included provisions placing substantial limits on vendors receiving the majority of their revenue

nutrition and wic legislation in the 108th and 109th congresses background child nutrition programs and the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program are governed by three basic federal laws1 the richard b russell national school lunch act this law was originally enacted in 1946 as the national school lunch act it was renamed in 1999 it provides authority for the school lunch program the child and adult care food program the summer food service program afterschool programs those run under both the aegis of the school lunch program and the child and adult care food program food commodity support for child nutrition programs training and technical assistance including the food service management institute compliance program integrity and accountability activities and an information clearinghouse it also includes number of generalpurpose provisions governing the operation of multiple child nutrition programs eg income eligibility and inflation indexing rules nutrition requirements for meals general rules participating schools must follow the child nutrition act this law was originally enacted in 1966 it provides authority for the school breakfast program the wic program the special milk program assistance for state administrative expenses related to child nutrition programs and nutrition education activities section 32 of the act of august 24 1935 7 usc 612c section 32 authority provides funding for cash child nutrition subsidies permanent appropriations under section 32 are transferred to the child nutrition account annually as part of the appropriations process it also includes additional authority to that in the richard b russell national school lunch act and funding for the acquisition of food commodities for distribution to child nutrition 1 in addition to these laws congress has used annual appropriations measures and omnibus agriculture legislation to direct the agriculture department to take actions affecting child nutrition and wic programs these directives typically take the form of requirements related to commodity support for child nutrition efforts but they also can encompass amendments to the underlying law or changes in program policies crs2 programs section 32 money is used to buy and distribute surplus commodities2 prior to the 108th congress the most recent comprehensive amendments to child nutrition and wic law were made by the 1998 william f goodling child nutrition reauthorization act pl 1053363 and under the reauthorization schedule the next wideranging review of child nutrition and wic programs was set for 2003 however number of significant laws affecting the child nutrition and wic programs were enacted in the 106th and 107th congresses 1999 through 2002 these are covered in the immediate predecessor to this report crs report rl31578 child nutrition and wic legislation in the 106th and 107th congresses by joe richardson information on the programs covered by child nutrition and wic legislation is contained in crs report rl33307 child nutrition and wic programs background and recent funding by joe richardson only one significant law governing child nutrition programs eg school meal programs and the wic program has been or is likely to be enacted in the 108th and 109th congresses the child nutrition and wic reauthorization act of 2004 pl 108265 signed on june 30 2004 the child nutrition and wic reauthorization act of 2004 pl 108265 history the authorization of appropriations for several child nutrition programs and the wic program as well as authority to carry out certain child nutrition activities were scheduled to expire september 30 2003 under the terms of the previous reauthorization law pl 1053364 anticipating renewal of these authorizations congress began consideration of child nutritionwic reauthorization legislation in the spring of 2003 however primarily because of budgetrelated concerns as to how much if any new funding might be available to be spent on new or expanded initiatives action was taken in 2003 other than hearings and the introduction of bills proposing various individual program changes instead shortterm extension of expiring authorizations pl108134 was enacted pushing most expiration dates to march 31 2004 and giving congress time to act 2 for more information see crs report rs20235 farm and food support under usdas section 32 program by geoffrey s becker 3 for information on this law and other child nutrition and wic legislation in the 104th and 105th congresses 1995 through 1998 see crs report 96987 child nutrition legislation in the 104th congress and crs report 97108 child nutrition issues in the 105th congress both by joe richardson available on request 4 it should be noted that appropriations for the majority of child nutrition programs eg the school meal programs are permanently authorized crs3 on march 24 2004 the house passed an amended version of its child nutrition wic reauthorization bill the child nutrition improvement and integrity act hr 3873 hrept 108445 which included provisions that would have resulted in estimated net new mandatory spending of 235 million through fy2009 however with the march 31st deadline approaching and definitive senate action another stopgap law extending most expiring authorities through june 30 2004 was enacted pl 108211 while there was formal action in the senate the house and senate committees of jurisdiction the house education and the workforce committee and the senate agriculture nutrition and forestry committee with the administrations participation informally discussed potential final bill through march april may and into june 2004 on may 19 2004 the senate agriculture nutrition and forestry committee ordered reported the child nutrition and wic reauthorization act of 2004 s 2507 srept 108279 reported june 7 2004 this bill as amended with unanimous consent on the senate floor passed the senate on june 23 2004 it reflected agreements that had been reached in the housesenate discussions that had been taking place over the past several months and included many house and administration proposals and perspectives on june 24 2004 the house passed it without objection this final measure encompassed changes in law estimated to result in 232 million in net new mandatory spending outlays slightly more in budget authority through fy2009 the end of the reauthorization period it was enacted as the child nutrition and wic reauthorization act of 2004 pl 108265 on june 30 2004 the new law much of the debate over and content of the 2004 reauthorization law was driven by the availability or lack of availability of funding for new initiatives or program expansions budget reconciliation agreements offered little new mandatory money total of about 230 million through fy2009 and if house and senate legislators wanted to fund new initiatives or expansions with mandatory dollars beyond these budget constraints they effectively were forced to use savings from changes they made within child nutrition programs5 in the alternative they could and did authorize appropriations for new initiativesexpansions or establish pilot projects rather than create or expand entitlementmandatory programs the final product encompassed some 395 million in new gross spending through fy2009 however this was financed with an estimated 163 million in savings achieved primarily by revisions to the system for certifying and verifying eligibility for free and reduced price school meals see immediately below perhaps the biggest issue confronted by congress was concern over overcertification the degree to which ineligible children are judged eligible for free or reducedprice school meals though estimates and perceptions differed as to the extent and seriousness of the problem overcertification was widely judged significant issue and provoked accompanying questions as to schools administrative 5 virtually all child nutrition programs are mandatory entitlements on the other hand the wic program is discretionary crs4 strength and how to ensure that eligible children were not disadvantaged by any legislative solution as result the most important amendments in the 2004 law dealt with program integrity improvements to rules governing certification and verification of eligibility new procedures to upgrade administration of school meal programs and new technical assistance and training as to school meal program operations few changes were made eg expansion of eligibility for homeless runaway and migrant children and youth loosened rules for higher severe need school breakfast subsidies and major and costly proposal to phase in higher income eligibility limits for free school meals was limited to authorization for small pilot project another major set of issues involved nutrition health and nutrition education aspects of child nutrition programs particularly childhood obesity trends and the role of child nutrition programs and school environments like physical activities in dealing with this the rules governing the offering of milk and milk substitutes foods sold in competition with school meals food safety and the desire of some to substantially increase funding commitments for nutrition education while number of federally led options were offered in the end the most significant change was requirement that all schools participating in school meal programs establish locally designed wellness policies to tackle obesity and nutritionhealthrelated issues like competitive foods and students physical activity with federal technical assistance and other support nutrition education provisions encompassed series of authorizations but new funding in related amendments the program offering free fresh fruit and vegetables operating in selected schools in few states was expanded and made permanent and important changes were made to food safety rules small changes also were made in the summer food service and child and adult care food programs for example making permanent and expanding the coverage of preexisting simplified summer program socalled lugar rules that make it easier for summer program sponsors to participate making permanent and nationally applicable preexisting rule loosening eligibility requirements for forprofit child care centers wishing to participate in the child and adult care food program finally large number of revisions were made to the wic program but the most significant were several aimed at strengthening rules containing food costs incurred by the program of these the most controversial was new provision placing substantial limits on vendors receiving the majority of their revenue from wic vouchers socalled wiconly stores the 2004 reauthorization law extended virtually all expiring child nutrition and wic appropriations authorizations and other authorities through fy20096 in 6 five authorities were made permanent 1 requirement to use section 32 funds to maintain commodity support for child nutrition programs 2 simplified summer food programs 3 certain rules governing the treatment of forprofit child care centers 4 the fresh fruit and vegetable program and 5 permission to use section 32 funds to dispose of continued crs5 addition it made wide range of changes to child nutrition and wic law as described in the following sections program integrity in school meal programs certification and verification of eligibility role of local educational agencies leas stipulates that leas are effectively responsible for certification and verification of eligibility for free and reducedprice school meals as opposed to local school food authorities which conduct school meal program daytoday operations and also were in charge of certification and verification under preexisting law descriptive materials and communications with families requires that descriptive materials provided to parents contain notification that 1 participants in certain other incometested programs may be eligible for free or reducedprice school meals and 2 documentation may be requested for verification of eligibility also directs that any communications with families for eligibility determination or verification purposes be in an understandable format in language that parents can understand to the extent possible grants explicit permission for internet applications and descriptive materials individual applications for each child in family are in most cases barred direct certification of eligibility in order to reduce the number of paper applications that need to be reviewed by relying on verification already conducted in other venues requires that leas use direct certification certification of eligibility for free and reducedprice school meals without application by direct communication with appropriate state or local agencies for any child who is member of food stamp household this direct certification mandate is phased in beginning with the largest leas through the 20072008 school year in addition permissive authority is granted to employ direct certification for children in temporary assistance for needy families tanf households homeless children children served by programs under the runaway and homeless youth act and migrant children note under pre 6 continued unsafe foods one authority management support initiative in the child and adult care food program that expired with fy2003 was reinstated for fy2005 and

clearinghouse one expiring authority authorization of funds for certain training and technical assistance activities was extended through fy2008 one authority for nutrition education and training program was replaced with new initiative and one expiring authority small effort funding food and nutrition projects that are integrated with elementary school curricula was not renewed crs6 existing law direct certification was permitted for children in food stamp and tanf households verification of sample of applications for those not directly certified eligible for free or reducedprice school meals mandates that sample of approved applications be selected for verification of their eligibility by directly communicating with the family or direct verification see below note prior to verifying with the family the application must be reviewed by an individual other than the person who approved it the required sample size for each lea varies but in most cases the new law calls for it to be significantly larger than under preexisting regulatory rules direct verification in conducting eligibility verification of the sample of approved applications permits leas to first use direct verification obtain and use income and program participation information about the applicant family from certain public agencies before contacting the family direct verification is to be evaluated and if found to be effective in obtaining adequate information and reducing the number of applications that must be verified by contacting families directly may be made mandatory individual family verification for families not directly certified or directly verified requires leas to conduct verification through contact with the family this includes written request for information and phone contact if necessary in the case of families not responding to verification request leas are required to make at least one additional attempt to obtain information and may use third party to assist them in these followup activities note nonresponse results in disqualification funding provides mandatory funding 1 to assist in carrying out direct certification and verification activities and 2 to
