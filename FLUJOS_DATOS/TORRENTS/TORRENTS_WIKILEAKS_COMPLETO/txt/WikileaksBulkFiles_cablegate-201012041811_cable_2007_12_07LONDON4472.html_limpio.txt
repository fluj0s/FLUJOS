summary your december 78 visit to london comes after prime minister gordon brown has finished putting his own stamp on the government following this summers transition from tony blairs tenure and begins focusing on governing it also comes at time during which major infrastructure programs such as heathrow terminal 5 are nearing completion and new proposals such as london crossrail and new runway for heathrow are being launched ruth kelly secretary of state for transport has highlighted security liberalization and environmental protection as key priorities kellys tenure began two days before terrorists drove car with crude explosives into the glasgow airport terminal and security remains key transport concern in the uk end summary u uk political scene 2 cnf after leading the labour party for 13 years and her majestys government for ten years tony blair stepped down in june and gordon brown succeeded him as prime minister brown had served as chancellor of the exchequer finance minister throughout blairs premiership and had always been the obvious choice to succeed him it was brown who ran the economy the new labour program that made the labour party electable again after 18 years in opposition was as much his creation as blairs brown got off to strong start over the summer the public welcomed his solid competence as refreshing change after blairs perceived slickness and hoped he would turn the page on the deeply unpopular iraq war the new pm responded well to several early crises abortive terrorist attacks in london and glasgow the worst flooding in 60 years and an outbreak of footandmouth disease browns unexpected lead in the opinion polls fueled disunity within the main opposition conservative party and prompted speculation that he would call snap election this fall though he need not do so until may 2010 the prospect of fourth consecutive generalelection trouncing caused the conservatives tories to rally behind their leader david cameron who delivered stellar speech to the annual party conference the tories got bounce in the polls and the prime minister decided not to call an election after all that decision was widely seen as humiliating climbdown and his claim that the polls had nothing to do with the decision damaged his reputation for integrity ever since then the bad news has just kept on piling up for brown the labour party general secretary abruptly resigned after it emerged that major donor was using proxies to conceal his contributions to the party and the general secretary knew about it and failed to comply with legal requirements government agency lost personal data including bank account details on 25 million people out of 60 million when junior employee violated security regulations all too easily another case emerged recently in which government contractor kept personal data for year after finishing its project leading to serious questions of the governments handling of data the governments loan guarantees in response to the mortgage bank northern rock crisis britains first run on bank since 1866 put over bps 20 million equivalent to more than usd 40 million of taxpayers money at risk and ministers and civil servants alike are said to be demoralized by browns secretive and controlling approach and parliamentary backbenchers despair at his vulnerability to camerons agile taunting key bilateral issues 3 cnf the uk is our closest and most important ally pm brown is much less outgoing than blair and wishes to avoid being accused as blair was of being president bushs poodle but he wants and knows that britain needs strong relationship with the us administration he considers afghanistan the primary front in the military conflict against islamist terrorism and is increasing the uks involvement there while emphasizing that the global threat of violent islamist extremism cannot be defeated by military means on iraq he is reducing the british presence while insisting that the uk will meet its obligations to the iraqi people and the international community he attaches great importance to resolving the israelipalestinian conflict and is keen to support economic development in the palestinian territories all british nationals detained at guantanamo have been returned to the uk and hmg has requested the return of five detainees who have residency ties here bilateral discussions are ongoing surface transportation programs 4 sbu in 2003 the mayor of london introduced congestion charge of bps 5 usd 10 per day to drive into the central portion of london 50 pence per day for those living inside the zone the city considers this fee for service improved transportation infrastructure decreased pollution and congestion and did not grant diplomatic exemption after determining that the fee was actually tax and therefore not payable under the vienna conventions of diplomatic and consular affairs the department of state engaged in lengthy negotiations with the foreign and commonwealth office and the city of london in july 2005 after negotiations concluded unsuccessfully the department instructed the mission and its members to stop paying the tax the us embassy was not the first to refuse to pay and following the expansion of the congestion zone and increase in the fee to bps 8 usd 16 in 2007 large number of missions including 23 of the 27 european union missions in london now refuse to pay the tax london mayor ken livingstone has focused his ire publicly against the us embassy and the ambassador personally his position however should be seen in the wider context of his antiamerican positions on many issues and his coziness to the likes of hugo chavez and fidel castro 5 u in october pm brown gave the goahead to major light rail program for london that was first raised in the 1980s crossrail will be new eastwest railway linking maidenhead and heathrow in the west with shenfield and abbey wood in the east via tunnels under central london the track will be 118 kilometers and will house 38 new stations enabling an estimated 200 million passenger journeys year construction is set to begin in 2010 with the first trains expected to run in 2017 pm brown said crossrail will be of enormous importance not just for london but for the whole country and would generate up to 30000 new jobs funding projected to be bps 16bn usd 32bn will be met by the government businesses and farepayers with bps 5bn usd 10bn grant coming from the department for transport direct contributions will be made by some of the projects key beneficiaries including the city of london corporation tfl estimates that crossrail will contribute bps 30bn usd 60bn to the uk economy getting approval for this project is seen as major accomplishment for ruth kelly and her department 6 u in 2004 the government announced the creation of the transport innovation fund tif designed to support the costs of smarter innovative local transport packages projects address demand management congestion charging and local and regional schemes to benefit national productivity in 2005 cambridgeshire successfully bid for bps 385000 usd 770000 and was awarded further bps 1055m usd 211m to fund study looking at transport packages that combine demand management measures with measures to encourage modal shift the funding was provided on the condition that the local authority study whether congestion charge would be appropriate in cambridge in october 2007 cambridge submitted another bid for nearly bps 500m usd 1bn which would be used to fund largescale improvements to public transport highways and cycling facilities and demand management measures specifically congestion charging the government is also considering bid from manchester which would involve bps 3bn usd 6bn worth of public transport improvements in exchange for peakhour congestion charge of up to bps 5 usd 10 day 7 u on november 14 the first highspeed eurostar train left the modernized st pancras station for paris the move to st pancras on the north side of central london from waterloo on the south side will make it easier for passengers from northern england and scotland to connect to the continent the move is the culmination of bps 58bn usd 116bn 10year project designed to speed up travel to britain from france and belgium the new 68mile high speed single rail line between st pancras and the tunnel under the english channel is the final section of high speed rail to be completed and enables eurostar trains to hit 190mph it cuts journey times by approximately 20 minutes and links london with paris in two hours 15 minutes and london with brussels in one hour 51 minutes u london olympics 8 u london will host the summer olympic games in 2012 transportation for the games will be delivered through partnership between the olympic delivery authority oda transport team transport for london tfl department for transport dft network rail and other transport providers the oda aims for 100 percent of ticketed spectators to travel to the games by public transport walking or cycling there will be private car parking for spectators except for some blue badge disabled parking an olympic route network orn will be implemented for the transportation of athletes comprising network of roads linking competition and key noncompetition venues in general roads will remain open to the public however some traffic lanes will be dedicated for games vehicles on the busiest sections of the route an olympic transport operations center otoc will be established to manage all modes of transport airport infrastructure and aviation liberalization 9 u the uk remains the destination for the highest number of passengers departing the us by air and heathrow airport processes more international passengers than any other airport in the world in the face of continued rapid aviation growth rates airport infrastructure is key concern in the uk creaking and groaning under the weight of old infrastructure coupled with modern security requirements heathrow operator baa and the flying public will welcome the opening of terminal 5 on march 27 2008 this new terminal which is on time and under budget will nearly double existing capacity and is capable of handling the airbus a380 10 u while there is light at the end of the passenger capacity tunnel heathrow is unique among airports of its size in operating only two runways in fact the southeast of england has not seen new runway since the second world war and the government is eager to see new runway at heathrow stansted or both nor is the issue limited to england as scotlands prestwick airport is the busiest single runway airport in the world on november 22 the department for transport published consultation on adding third runway at heathrow airport by 2020 this has kicked off lively public debate with positions crossing party lines as may be expected noise and local air quality issues dominate the environmental debate around the third runway although climate change concerns figure prominently as well in addition the new runway would require the demolition of an entire village just north of the airport 11 u baa formerly british airports authority which was privatized in 1984 has also come under considerable criticism for its levels of service and the parliaments transport select committee has launched hearings on the issue in addition the competition commission has recently investigated whether baas dominance of the london area should be allowed to continue finally the civil aviation authority has just published on november 20 its proposal for fee structures at heathrow and gatwick along with stansted fees for these airports are regulated by the caa because of baas near monopoly over london which neither airlines nor baa find acceptable on the whole airport issues will remain major topic for ruth kelly for the remainder of her tenure 12 sbu sentiment in the uk regarding the conclusion of the first phase of the useu air services agreement was largely negative and ruth kelly and other ministers are under considerable pressure to conclude successfully second round of negotiations including concessions on foreign ownership of us airlines airlines such as virgin and ba are eager to gain access to the us market as you are well aware public opinion also plays role as the agreement was seen by many as another example of uk interests being subsumed by negotiators in brussels department for transport officials have raised the desire for timely and successful conclusion of second phase on numerous occasions and have not been deterred by explanations of the us political climate especially during an election year secretary kelly may raise this issue with you sipdis ukus climate change differences 13 sbu the predominant environmental concern in the uk is climate change the uk was disappointed the us did not sign the kyoto protocol local air quality is concern but when faced with tradeoff uk policy will tend to favor reducing carbon output as evidenced by the fact that around 50 of vehicles in the uk run on diesel and would not meet most us air quality standards there is strong support for action on climate change legislation across the political spectrum and among the general public in the uk the uk participates in the eu emissions trading scheme ets capandtrade program to help europe meet its kyoto protocol commitments on carbon emissions the uk is also key supporter of european commission proposal to include aviation in the second phase of ets which is working its way through the legislative process the us and other governments have registered concerns over the legality of this unilateral environmental regulation on aviation emissions which should be resolved within the international civil aviation organization secretary kellys office has indicated that she will raise this issue with you 14 sbu transportation is one of the largest and fastest growing contributors to climate change in the uk and aviation is seen as unique in that it is not subject to fuel tax and duty with the sole exception of noncommercial general aviation in an attempt to be seen to address the growth in aviation emissions and make aviation pay its environmental costs her majestys treasury hmt recently mooted proposal to abandon air passenger duty apd in favor of charge on every flight leaving the uk the proposal aims to include previously excluded categories such as cargo transfer passengers smaller aircraft and noncommercial aviation the proposal still lacks detail but the intent is to provide incentives to reduce emissions and more closely align the tax with environmental impact hmt has held several meetings with uk us and other passenger and cargo carriers in addition the embassy met recently with hmt and dft officials to seek more information including hmgs views on the compliance of the proposal with international obligations such as air services agreements and the chicago convention it is clear that uk analysis is not yet well developed but hmg indicated willingness to exchange further information and hold discussions with view to avoiding another conflict over aviation and emissions transportation security 15 u transportation security remains high on secretary kellys agenda as transportation security oversight remains within her department on june 29 just one day after kelly assumed her duties as transport secretary police discovered two failed car bombs in londons west end the following day terrorists drove flaming vehicle equipped with crude explosive device into terminal at glasgow airport this incident came less than year after police foiled an attempt to smuggle liquid explosives aboard usbound airlines and almost two years to the day after the july 7 london bombings in which 52 commuters were killed on three underground trains and bus uk aviation suffered considerably after the liquid explosives attempt with massive cancellations and delays the long term effects of the liquid explosive attempt have been felt far and wide however in the uk the overstretched security infrastructure could not cope with the additional security requirements and passengers were strictly limited to one carryon bag secretary kelly has announced that this restriction will be lifted next year this move along with additional measures ie implementation of new technologies such as ct scans at checkpoints at heathrow and gatwick should improve passenger flow usuk transportation security and counterterrorism cooperation is very strong we are encouraging uk security officials to focus on soft targets countermeasures counter radicalization and intelligence sharing visit londons classified website
