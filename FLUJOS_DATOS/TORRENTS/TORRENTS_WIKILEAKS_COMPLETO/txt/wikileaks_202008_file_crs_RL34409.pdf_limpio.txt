lephone records without the approval of the customer the first method occurs when an employee of one of the phone companies sells the records to the data broker the second method occurs through practice called pretexting where data broker pretends to be the owner of the phone and obtains the records from the telephone company under false pretenses the third method is employed when data

concerning numerous websites dvertising the sale of personal telephone records the federal communications commission conducted rulemaking to determine the extent of the problem nd construct regulati

cell phone num ber the duration of such calls and may include the physical location of the cell phone in addition to lling cell phone call records many data brokers also claimed to provide calling records for landline and voice over internet protocol voip phones as well as nonpublished phone numbers data brokers claimed to be able to provide this information fairly quickly in few hours to few days although personal information such as social security numbers can be found on public documents phone records ar stored only by phone companies3 for this reason data brokers are alleged to have obtained phone records from the phone companies themselves albeit without their pproval it is also believed that data brokers had taken advantage of inadequate company security standards to gain access to customer telephone inform ation data brokers are thought to employ three different practices to obtai n customer telephone records without the approval of the customer the first method ccurs

continuedpretext calling for customer telephone r ecords occurs when the data broker or investigator pretends to be the cell phone account holde r and persuades phone company employees to releas the information the public availability of personal identifiers like the social security number made it easier for someone to impersonate the account holder to convince the employee that they were the account holder for this reason it was suggested that phone companies cease the use of readily available biographical informati on like the social security number for identity authentication telephone companies are encouraging customers to receive electronic statements and to access cu stomer accounts online typically online accounts are set up in advance to be activated at later date by the customer if someone can figure out how to activate and access the online account of the customer the call records can be obtained in response to these concerns c ongress the federal communications commission fcc and the federal trade co mmission ftc have acted to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of phone records the federal government has moved to directly address the problem of pretexting and to more clearly define the protective framework that telecommunications carriers must implement federal laws certain sectors are currently subject to legal obligations to protect sensitive personal information these obligations were created in large part through the enactment of federal privacy legislation in the financial services health care government and internet sectors fe deral regulations issued to carry out requirements of federal privacy laws impose obligations on covered entities to implement information secur ity programs to protect personal information for further

remainder of the recently implemented rules the case is currently in its preliminary stages congressional response legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress to address the problems presented by unauthorized disclosure of telephone records generally the bills would expand the enforcement authority of the ftc to punish pretexting and unauthorized receipt of confidential customer information and would require the fcc to ensure that telecommunications carriers and ipenabled voice service providers are taking proper care to safeguard the privacy of these records many of the substantive requirements for regulatory action contained in the proposed legislation were implemented by the fccs most recent ru lemaking none of the bills has been reported out of committee hr 852 consumer telephone records protection act of 2007 inslee hr 852 is similar in substance to the telephone records and privacy protection act of 2006 in that it prohib its obtaining or attempting to obtain confidential phone records by fraud or false statement nd prohibits the purchase or sale of such fraudulently obtained informa tion the bill also would amend sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34409crs10 222 of the communications act of 1934 to di rect the fcc to promulgate regulations that would require telecomm unications carriers to notify customers when cpni has been disclosed improperly and grants enforcement authority to the ftc hr 936 prevention of fraudul ent access to phone records act dingell hr 936 grants the ftc specific authority to enforce its prohibition on the fraudulent acquisition of customer propr ietary network info rmation as it would violation of rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed by the ftc act furthermore the bill would expand the protections of detailed customer records maintained by telecommunications carriers by prohibiting disclosure of cpni by telecommunications carriers to joint vent ure partners independe nt contractors or any other third parties except with the expr ess prior authorization of the customer the bill also would direct the fcc to promulgate regulations that would require telecommunications carriers for exampl to notify customers of unauthorized disclosures of cpni to main tain records of each time cp is requested or accessed and to establish security policy to ensure the confidentiality of cpni s 92 stevens and s 780 pryor protecting consumer phone records act except as authorized by other law or regulation s 92 and s 780 would make it unlawful to obtain transfer sell or purchase cpni without the express written consent of the customer to whom the cpni relates these proposals would create private right of action against violators of the act for telecommunications carriers as well as ip enabled voice servi ce providers and for consumers with the possible award of treb damages if the court finds knowing and willful violation the bills would fu rther require the fcc to revise its cpni regulations to increase the security and confidentiality of cpni concurrent enforcement jurisdiction would be granted to the fcc and the ftc for violations of the act
