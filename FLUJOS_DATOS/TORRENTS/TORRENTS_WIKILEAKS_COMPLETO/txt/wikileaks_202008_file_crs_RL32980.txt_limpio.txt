support july 7 2005 carmen solomonfears specialist in social legislation domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress legal services and noncustodial parents who owe child support summary enforcement of child support often results in custodial parents and noncustodial parents being in an adversarial relationship noncustodial parents often view it as an unbalanced relationship because custodial parents have access to network of federal and state resources eg the child support enforcement cse agency and the welfare agency that are not available to the noncustodial parent pending welfare reauthorization legislation hr 240 and s 667 includes incentives for states to send more of the child support collected on behalf of custodial parents to the family itself additional cse enforcement tools funding for marriage promotion programs for lowincome persons and funding for programs designed to help noncustodial fathers meet both their financial and emotional responsibilities to their children supporters of the welfare reauthorization legislation claim that its passage will result in more noncustodial parents paying child support they contend that noncustodial parents who can afford to but do not pay child support will not be able to escape their duty because of the strong enforcement apparatus and that noncustodial parents who cannot afford to pay will be offered services that may improve their financial ability to pay as well as their willingness to pay in situations in which noncustodial parents find themselves at loggerheads with custodial parents and the cse system with respect to paternity and child support some have encouraged legal services providers to play more balanced role they maintain that providing legal services to noncustodial parents could result in child support payments becoming more reliable source of income for custodial parents if noncustodial parents were provided better access to the legal system and were satisfied that they had their day in court and thereby more amenable to paying child support this report describes some of the child support issues faced by noncustodial parents and discusses areas in which legal services providers funded by the legal services corporation lsc are authorized to support poor noncustodial parents the lsc is private nonprofit federally funded corporation established by congress to provide financial support for civil legal assistance for persons unable to afford legal help in fy2004 the lsc distributed 3166 million of its 3353 million appropriation in the form of grants to 143 local legal services programs local programs provide legal assistance to individuals based on locally determined priorities that meet local community conditions and needs thus to certain extent it is necessary for noncustodial parents to advocate on their own behalf that is to make the communities in which they live aware of the problems that they face with regard to countering unjustified allegations of paternity obtaining fair child support orders meeting their child support obligations getting child support orders modified when they have change in financial circumstances seeking custody or visitation rights and reestablishing family and community ties after incarceration with only an estimated 20 of eligible clients receiving legal services when they need such services lowincome noncustodial parents must now compete to be included as clients in program that does not have the resources to serve all who are eligible for its services this report will not be updated contents introduction 1 child support issues faced by noncustodial parents 3 paternity issues 4 child support orders established by default 5 child support arrearages 5 modification of child support orders 7 issues related to custody and visitation 7 criminal nonsupport laws versus civil enforcement of child support 8 issues related to incarcerated and newly released noncustodial parents 9 legal services and noncustodial parents 10 local priorities 12 outreach 13 legal services and noncustodial parents who owe child support introduction enforcement of child support often results in custodial parents and noncustodial parents being in an adversarial relationship from the perspective of the noncustodial parent it is often seen as an unbalanced relationship because the custodial parent is backed by the child support enforcement cse agency and in many cases the welfare agency as well although the cse agency views itself as working for the state on behalf of dependent children the custodial parent in effect receives the benefits of federalstate intervention because the child is in her or his care this situation is even more pronounced in the case of lowincome custodial parents and children because they have link to public welfare agencies thus the custodial parent has access to network of federal and state resources that are not available to the noncustodial parent during the last several years members of congress and others have acknowledged that the best interests of the child are generally served when both parents are part of the equation they have commented that many lowincome noncustodial parents have low levels of education poor work histories and significant barriers to work they have debated child support issues in terms of dead broke rather than deadbeat noncustodial parents and have remarked that responsible parenthood involves both financial and emotional relationships with ones children some contend that public policies are needed to support the fathers role as nurturer disciplinarian mentor and moral instructor1 this new federalstate governmental perspective is seen in the cse agencys funding of access and visitation programs for noncustodial parents and in pending welfare reauthorization legislation hr 240 and s 667 109th congress that would provide funding for marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood programs the pending welfare reauthorization legislation mentioned above contains incentives for states to send more of the child support collected on behalf of custodial parents to the family itself additional cse enforcement tools funding for programs designed to promote marriage among lowincome persons as way to improve the economic wellbeing and development of children and funding for programs designed to help noncustodial fathers meet both their financial and emotional responsibilities to their children supporters of the welfare reauthorization legislation claim that its passage will result in more noncustodial parents paying child support they contend that noncustodial parents who can afford to pay child support but who 1 wade f horn and isabel v sawhill making room for daddy fathers marriage and welfare reform brookings institution working paper apr 26 2001 p 4 crs2 do not want to pay will not be able to escape their duty because of the strong enforcement apparatus and that noncustodial parents who cannot afford to pay will be offered services that may improve their financial ability to pay as well as their willingness to pay the reader should note that this new more forgiving attitude toward noncustodial parents has brought with it wariness among custodial parents some mothers contend that an emphasis on the importance of fathers may lead to undervaluing singleparent families maintained by mothers that services for fathers may be at the expense of services for mothers and that the pro fatherhood discourse might give fathers rights groups additional leverage in challenging child support child custody and visitation arrangements although noncustodial parents often find themselves at loggerheads with custodial parents and the cse system with respect to paternity and child support the situation is usually more complicated than deadbeat dad vs dependent mom sometimes noncustodial parent is really not the father and sometimes noncustodial parents who are trying to meet their financial obligation to their children have been burdened with child support order that is too high in these situations some maintain that legal services providers should do more to help alleviate the problem supporters of this approach maintain that providing legal services to noncustodial parents may result in child support payments becoming more reliable source of income for custodial parents because noncustodial parents would have had greater access to the legal system and be more satisfied that they had their day in court and thereby be more amenable to fulfilling their child support obligations the lsc is private nonprofit federally funded corporation that was established by congress in 1974 part of the lscs mission is to provide high quality legal assistance to those who otherwise would be unable to afford adequate legal representation and to assist in improving opportunities for such persons the lsc is funded through congressional appropriations the lsc does not provide legal services directly but rather it provides grants to independent local legal services programs selected through competitive process the primary responsibility of the lsc is to manage and oversee the congressionally appropriated federal funds that it distributes in the form of grants to local legal services providers that in turn provide civil legal assistance to lowincome clients in the 50 states the district of columbia and five us territories in fy2004 the lsc distributed 3166 million of its 3353 million appropriation in the form of grants to 143 local legal services programs the remaining funds were allocated for management and administration information technology and its office of the inspector general lsc funding accounts for about half of all funding in the united states for civil legal services for the poor in 2004 there were approximately 45 million persons who were potentially eligible for lscfunded services2 but according to lsc 2 legal services provided by lsc funds are available only in civil matters to individuals with incomes less than or equal to 125 of the federal poverty guidelines in 2004 125 of the federal poverty guidelines amounted to 11638 for family size of one 15613 for continued crs3 surveys only about 20 of those eligible for and in need of services actually received services although lowincome noncustodial parents who owe child support are among the persons eligible for lscfunded services they arent among the groups that have traditionally been helped by legal services programs and therefore may have hard time accessing services that are already in short supply child support issues faced by noncustodial parents the child support enforcement cse program title ivd of the social security act was enacted in january 1975 pl 93647 the cse program is federalstate program that promotes selfsufficiency of families in which one of the biological parents is living outside of the home by ensuring that noncustodial parents meet their financial responsibility to their children the cse program provides seven major services on behalf of children 1 parent location 2 paternity establishment 3 establishment of child support orders 4 review and modification of child support orders 5 collection of child support payments 6 distribution of child support payments and 7 establishment and enforcement of medical child support all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds while the federal government plays an important role in setting program standards and policy evaluating state performance and providing technical assistance and training states are responsible for administering the cse program directly or through local cse agencies and family or domestic courts given that the main purpose of the cse program is to act in the best interest of the child to obtain any financial support that child is due it usually is the case that the state and local government along with the custodial parent are in an adversarial relationship with the noncustodial parent in many instances the cse agency collects owed child support via income withholding and problems occur in other cases especially cases in which the parents were never married paternity and child support order must be established before the cse agency can obtain child support on behalf of the custodial parent in such cases paternity may be contested and the financial ability of the noncustodial parent to pay specific amount of child support may be questioned this section discusses some of the problems that noncustodial parents maintain that they encounter namely 1 false allegations of fatherhood 2 child support obligations that are unfair and unreasonable 3 high arrearages that are financially beyond their capability to pay 4 incarceration because of unreasonable child support demands 5 loss of the means to their livelihood eg drivers license professional license passport because they fall behind in meeting their child support 2 continued family

families and with their community after serving time in jail or prison paternity issues some noncustodial fathers and alleged fathers contend that the paternity establishment process in recent years has focused on efficiency at the expense of the fathers right to due process and his right to representation they argue that in some instances alleged fathers are not fully informed about the consequences of voluntarily acknowledging paternity and do not fully understand the implication of their statement before they are encouraged to legally acknowledge paternity some noncustodial fathers argue that they were deceived into believing that if they voluntarily acknowledged paternity any child support they paid would be helping their child they contend that this is not so if the childs mother is receiving benefits under the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant program because instead of directly benefitting their children their child support payments are used to pay the state back for cash welfare payments that the family is receiving or received in the past3 there is widespread agreement by the cse and legal services communities that the dueprocess rights of noncustodial parents should not be overlooked even if doing so could be interpreted as being in the best interest of the child advocates for noncustodial parents maintain that if there is question about childs paternity it should be addressed by blood or dna tests in some cases even if the parents were married although blood or genetic testing is the standard procedure in contested paternity cases many people view such tests as an affront to their integrity and an indication of lack of trust this situation is exacerbated in the case of an older child according to some focus group discussants for many couples once one of the partners or alleged partners indicates that paternity test is needed any future chance for cooperative parenting is greatly diminished because of lingering animosity over the father not stepping forward and meeting his financial responsibility or the mother not being honest about her fidelity or use of birth control4 federal law requires states to have procedures which create rebuttable or at the option of the state conclusive presumption of paternity upon genetic testing results indicating threshold probability that the alleged father is the actual father of the child most states have rebuttable presumption paternity threshold that ranges from 95999 this means that in some states blood test results that indicate 98 or greater probability of paternity are not rebuttable which raises the possibility 3 national womens law center and center on fathers families and public policy family ties improving paternity establishment and practices and

for additional information on issues related to child support and paternity establishment see crs report rl31467 paternity establishment child support and beyond child support orders established by default if noncustodial parent gets notice or summons about child support or paternity establishment but does not appear in court at the stipulated date and time the court can enter child support order against the noncustodial parent by default if the noncustodial parent does not show up to tell his or her side of the story the court can decide that the evidence against that person must be true thus show by the noncustodial parent may result in the establishment of paternity and the establishment of child support order effective whether or not the noncustodial parent actually has job or an income source further if the noncustodial parent is not in court to provide information about his or her jobincome the court may base the child support order on information provided by the custodial parent or the cse agency even if this information is incorrect moreover if the noncustodial parent is not in court to present his or her evidence the court or cse agency may impute the noncustodial parents income which may be based on incorrect assumptions some observers argue that the practice of using default judgments ie judgments made in the absence of the alleged father has adversely affected many putative fathers who claim they are not the father of the child in question but for whatever reason did not show up in court to deny the allegations many analysts and observers maintain that the standards governing default judgments should balance the rights of the putative father to proper notice and the opportunity to be heard before paternity is established and child support order is set against the right of the child to obtain determination of paternity and support on timely basis from father who knowingly fails to appear in court5 child support arrearages child support arrearages can be accumulated in several ways depending upon the guidelines established by the state the first and most prevalent way is through nonpayment of child support for each month that noncustodial parent fails to meet the full child support obligation the unpaid support is added to the amount the noncustodial parent owes ie this is generally referred to as pastdue payments or arrearages second way that arrearages mount occurs because in many states and localities child support orders remain payable and in effect even when the noncustodial parent is unemployed or incarcerated further in all states arrearages remain due for various time periods even after the child reaches the age of majority another way that arrearages accumulate occurs because in addition to current 5 urban institute recommendations on tanf reauthorization from the strengthening fragile families initiative statement before the us congress house ways and means subcommittee on human resources by elaine sorensen may 3 2002 crs6 support some states choose to establish retroactive support when setting new orders depending on the states policy these retroactive arrearages may extend from two to six years prior or they may be unlimited in their scope extending back all the way to the time of the childs birth arrearages can also be incurred for costs and fees particularly attorney fees court filing fees fees for blood tests associated with the determination of paternity and the costs associated with the childs birth finally some states charge interest on arrearages thereby increasing the amount owed6 arrearages are enforced and pursued usually through income tax intercepts and attachment of property to encourage parents to meet their obligations regularly and on time and to send the message that there are serious consequences for nonpayment of child support in fy2004 1303 billion in child support obligations 280 billion in current support and 1024 billion in pastdue support was owed to families receiving cse services but only 232 billion was paid 165 billion current 67 billion pastdue this meant that the cse program only collected 18 of the child support obligations for which it had responsibility if current collections are examined separately the data indicate that the cse program collected 59 of all current collections in fy2004 if collections on pastdue support ie arrearages are examined separately the data show that the cse program collected less than 7 of arrearage payments in fy2004 in other words the total amount of arrearages reported in fy2004 for all previous fiscal years was 1024 billion but only 67 billion was collected in fy2004 although only relatively small percentage of arrearage payments were collected in fy2004 about 60 of obligors continued to make payments on their child support arrearages the cse fy2003 preliminary data report states in 1999 53 of the child support cases had arrearages owed in 2003 the proportion was up to 68 we obtained collections in 60 of these cases so we know that child support professionals are working hard on them and that obligors are trying to work on their debts but we collected an average of 600 per arrearage case while the average amount of arrears per arrearage case is 9000 so even though were collecting significant amounts of arrears we dont seem to be making dent in the problem and the overall debt continues to grow7 in many cases arrearages are quite high and often deter noncustodial parents from paying any child support in fact when noncustodial parents perceive that the system is unfair or that the debt is too great to be overcome the likelihood that they will pay any support decreases for additional information on child support 6 national womens law center

httpwwwacfdhhsgovprogramscsepubs2004reports preliminary_data crs7 arrearages see crs report rl31167 child support enforcement and lowincome fathers arrearages current support and compliance modification of child support orders many noncustodial parents believe that if they fall behind in their child support payments at time when they are legitimately unable to make the payments the amount they owe can later be reduced or discounted by the court when an explanation for nonpayment is given however this is not the case if the noncustodial parent waits to explain his or her changed financial circumstances the court will not be able to retroactively reduce the back payments ie arrearages that the noncustodial parent owes8 under the cse program states are given significant latitude regarding modifications and reviews of child support orders federal law requires that states give both parents the opportunity to request review of their child support order at least once every three years and states are required to notify the parents of this right states can also request reviews for modification or shorten the time period between reviews but they are not required to review orders on regular basis9 in order to prevent child support arrearages especially for noncustodial parents who are unemployed or in jail advocates have recommended that child support modification laws be changed so that they are more sensitive to periods of incarceration unemployment or injuryillness during which the noncustodial parents ability to pay child support decreases issues related to custody and visitation there is near unanimous agreement among federal and state policymakers that denial of visitation rights should not be considered reason for stopping child support payments historically congress has treated visitation and child support as legally separate issues with only child support enforcement activities under the purview of the federal government however in recent years congress has moderated its position against using federal cse funds to promote enforcement of visitation rights many noncustodial parents argue that it is unfair to look at the child support issue only from the viewpoint of the custodial parent traditionally they argue courts have sided with mothers in awarding custody and have paid insufficient attention to enforcing visitation rights of fathers as result they say mothers have 8 section 466a9 of the social security act pl 99509 referred to as the bradley amendment prohibits the retroactive modification of child support arrearages congress passed the bradley amendment in 1986 because it maintained that allowing courts to retroactively reduce child support arrearage payments negatively impacted custodial parents and their children 9 according to section 466a10 of the social security act states must allow either parent to request review every three years states may create shorter cycle for review if they so choose but orders cannot be modified for retroactive support crs8 had the rewards and obligations connected with rearing children while fathers have sometimes had share in the rewards but have the continuing obligation to pay support to be fair they argue federal laws and procedures should be reformed not only with respect to enforcement of the child support obligation but also with respect to visitation and custody rights some advocates of increasing parental responsibility argue that it is now time for the federal government to focus more attention on the nonfinancial benefits associated with preserving the connection between noncustodial parents and their children many policymakers and analysts maintain that distinction must be made between men who are dead broke and those who are deadbeats they argue that the federal government should help dead broke noncustodial parents meet both their financial and emotional obligations to their children and vigorously enforce cse laws against deadbeat parents10 criminal nonsupport laws versus civil enforcement of child support all states have laws that enable them to bring charges of criminal nonsupport or civil or criminal contempt of court against noncustodial parents who fail to pay child support the crime of nonsupport has been on the books in most states for many years11 there are two schools of thought with regard to criminal nonsupport laws one view holds that criminal nonsupport should be used as last resort only after civil remedies fail the other school of thought maintains that nonpayment of child support is serious offense often with dire consequences for the custodial parent and child thus criminal nonsupport laws should be used whenever appropriate the use of arrests in criminal nonsupport cases and the outcome of those arrests varies widely by jurisdiction making it difficult to document the magnitude of the practice12 civil contempt charges are made when noncustodial parent does not comply with judges order to pay child support payment of the child support debt results in compliance with the order and freedom from jail although the time spent in jail for civil contempt is particularly hard to track it represents significant if not routine means by which lowincome noncustodial parents land in jail13 for noncustodial parents who miss several days of lowpay work in jobs where they can be easily replaced by an employer the consequences of even short time in 10 national conference of state legislatures broke but not deadbeat reconnecting low income fathers and children by dana reichert

nonpayment of child support the consequences of criminal record can often be very farreaching see issues related to incarcerated and newly released noncustodial parents below it also should be noted that with the enactment of the child support recovery act of 1992 pl 102521 nonsupport is now also federal crime building on the 1992 legislation pl 105187 the deadbeat parents punishment act of 1998 established two new federal criminal offenses subject to twoyear maximum prison term with respect to noncustodial parents who repeatedly fail to financially support children who reside with custodial parents in another state or who flee across state lines to avoid supporting them issues related to incarcerated and newly released noncustodial parents according to 2003 study by the center on law and social policy clasp and community legal services inc of philadelphia14 about 15 million children have parents who are currently incarcerated and more than 10 million children in the united states have parents who were imprisoned at some point in the childrens lives the study stated that approximately 400000 mothers and fathers finish serving prison or jail sentences each year and return home to try to reestablish family ties most of these exoffender parents lived with or had regular contact with their children before going to prison the study indicates that about 25 of inmates have open child support cases incarcerated noncustodial parents generally owe between 225 to 313 per month in child support and on average they go into prison owing about 10000 in child support arrearages and leave prison owing more then 23000 in arrearage payments15 more than half of these arrearages are owed to the state to repay welfare costs exoffenders reentering communities face host of problems such as employment barriers stemming from their criminal records sometimes for many years after completing their jail time or prison sentences denial of federally subsidized housing because of criminal records denial of federal grants and student loans because of conviction for possession or sale of controlled substances even if the conviction occurred when the person was minor and denial of welfare benefits if the person has criminal record also unrealistically high child support orders or arrearages may discourage exoffenders from finding regular job vulnerable to income withholding tempting them to find jobs in the underground economy and thereby lessening their chances of successfully establishing ties with their families and communities in some cases incarceration is considered voluntary unemployment which does not justify reduction of the child support order thereby resulting in high arrearages moreover in some cases dissolution of 14 center on law and social policy clasp

parents who owe child support have very few places to turn for assistance or support however one potential source of aid for noncustodial parents who owe child support is legal services as mentioned earlier the legal services corporation lsc is private nonprofit federally funded corporation established in 1974 by congress part of the lscs mission is to provide high quality legal assistance to those who otherwise would be unable to afford adequate legal representation and to assist in improving opportunities for such persons the lscfunded programs do not handle criminal cases nor do they accept feegenerating cases that private attorneys are willing to accept on contingency basis in addition in 1996 series of new limitations were placed upon activities in which lscfunded programs may engage on behalf of their clients even with nonlsc funds among them are prohibitions on class actions challenges to welfare reform collection of attorneys fees rule making lobbying litigation on

services delivery system is based on several principles local priorities national accountability competition for grants and strong publicprivate partnership local programs are independent entities governed by boards of directors drawn from the local bar and client community all legal services programs must comply with laws enacted by congress and the implementing regulations promulgated by the lsc lsc funding accounts for about half of all funding in the united states for civil legal services for the poor20 the lsc does not provide legal services directly but rather it provides grants to independent local legal services programs selected through competitive process in fy2004 the lsc distributed 3166 million of its 3353 million appropriation in the form of grants to 143 local legal services programs the remaining funds were allocated for management and administration 132 million information technology 29 million and the lsc office of the inspector general 26 million in fy2004 there were approximately 45 million persons who were potentially eligible for lscfunded services data from the lsc suggest that only about 20 of persons eligible for lscfunded services actually had access to those services when they needed them based on geographic boundaries service areas funding local priorities etc21 according to the lscs 20032004 annual report despite lscs current congressional support the unmet legal needs of americas poor remain staggering to qualify for lscfunded assistance an individuals annual income cannot exceed 11638 family of fours cannot exceed 23563 yet current federal funding is clearly inadequate to serve the civil legal needs of the more than 452 million poor americans eligible for lscfunded legal assistance millions of eligible clients are forestalled from pursuing justice every year still millions more whose incomes are just above the federal poverty threshold but who nonetheless cannot afford adequate legal representation are effectively denied access to the us civil justice system as well22 20 according to the lsc in fy2004 lsc grantees leveraged federal funds to raise 346 million annually in other government and private revenue to help support their activities in addition lscfunded programs promote pro bono service from private attorneys see httpwwwlscgovpressrpr_facthtm 21 according to the lsc the last national survey on the legal needs of low and moderate income americans was conducted by the american bar association in 1994 that study found that about 80 of the civil legal needs of poor americans are unmet several state studies were conducted after 2000 and reported similar findings as part of its justice gap initiative the lsc is collecting data from its legal services providers on the number of potential eligible clients that legal services providers turn away because of insufficient resources the lsc expects to receive data from the legal services providers in mid 2005 see legal services

providing mediation assistance staffing courthouse help desks etc during 2004 legal services attorneys closed 901067 cases family issues such as child support divorce separation and domestic violence were the substance of about 40 of cases handled by legal services offices housing issues including eviction cases homeownership problems and public housing assistance comprised about 25 of cases income maintenance issues including benefit claims for veterans and senior citizens and medicaid and social security disability claims represented another 15 of cases and consumer finance including bankruptcy and debt relief assistance and individual rights issues comprised about 20 of cases most of the cases handled by legal services providers are resolved through advice and referral only about 14 of cases were resolved in court primarily because they involved family law issues eg protective orders child support etc in which court action was required by state law local priorities as noted above the lsc does not provide legal services directly rather it funds local legal services providers which are referred to by the lsc as grantees grantees may include nonprofit organizations that have as purpose the provision of legal assistance to eligible clients private attorneys groups of private attorneys or law firms state or local governments and certain substate regional planning and coordination agencies each local legal services program is headed by its own board of directors of whom about 60 are lawyers admitted to state bar and onethird are eligible clients each local program must spend an amount equal to at least 125 of its basic grant to encourage participation by private attorneys in the delivery of legal services to lowincome clients local programs establish their own eligibility criteria which may not exceed 125 of the federal poverty guidelines local programs hire staff contract with local attorneys and develop pro bono programs for the direct delivery of legal assistance to eligible clients these local programs provide legal assistance to individuals based on locally determined priorities that meet local community conditions and needs thus to certain extent it is up to noncustodial parents to advocate on their own behalf and to make the communities in which they live aware of the problems that they face with regard to countering unjustified allegations of paternity obtaining fair child support orders meeting their child support obligations getting child supports orders modified when they have change in financial circumstances seeking custody or visitation rights and reestablishing family and community ties with only an estimated 20 of eligible recipients receiving legal services when they need such services lowincome noncustodial parents must compete to be included as customers in program that does not have the resources to serve all who are eligible for its services crs13 outreach legal assistance is generally advisable in matters as serious and complex as paternity establishment and child support the outcome of such cases may result in significant redistribution of income from the noncustodial parent to the custodial parent and
