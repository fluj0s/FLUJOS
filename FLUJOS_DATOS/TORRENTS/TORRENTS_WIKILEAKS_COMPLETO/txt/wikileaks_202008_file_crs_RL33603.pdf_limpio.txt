reauthorized the magnusonstevens fishery conservation and manage ment act pl 109479 incorporating provisions recommended by both commissions and author ized the marine debris research prevention and reduction act pl 109449 several bills encompassing broad array of crosscutting concerns such as ocean exploration ocean and coastal observing systems federal organization and administrative structure and ocean and coastal mapping were considere d but not acted on during the 109th congress similar bills have been reintroduced in the 110th congress identification of the need for comp rehensive national ocean policy can be traced back to 1966 when presid ential commission on marine science engineering and resources was establis hed called the stra tton commission in 1969 the commission provided recommendations that led to reor ganizing federal ocean programs and establishing the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa by the late 1980s number of influential voices had concluded that us ocean management remained fragmented and was characterized by confusing array of laws regulations and practices after repeated attempts the 106th congress enacted legislation to establish us commission on ocean policy pl 106256 earlier in 2000 the pew oceans commission an independent group was established by the pew charitable tr usts to conduct national dialogue on restoring and protecting living mari ne resources in us waters in june 2003 the pew commission released its final report americas living oceans charting course for sea change outlining national agenda for protecting and restoring the oceans in september 2004 the us commission published an ocean blueprint for the 21st century its final report with 212 recommendations on coordinated and comp rehensive national ocean policy on december 17 2004 the president submitted to congress the us ocean action plan his formal response to the recommenda tions of the us commission on ocean policy the us commission on ocean policy and the pew oceans commission established the joint ocean commission in itiative in early 2005 to collaborate on number of key recommendations of both reports as part of

findings and recommendations of the ocean commissions and the presidents re sponse congress may consider compre hensive bills encompassing broad array of crosscutting concerns including ocean exploration ocean and coastal observing systems federal organization and administrative structure and ocean and coastal mapping integration or they may consider addressing each concern separately congress has shown interest in ocean affairs in recent decades examining components of the federal ocean programs enacting legislation creating new ocean programs and taking steps to define na tional ocean policy the marine resources and engineering development act of 1966 pl 89454 established national council on marine resources and engineering development in the white house and initiated work by presidential bipartisan commission on marine science engineering and resources dr julius stra tton then recently retired president of the massachusetts institute of t echnology and at the time chairman of the board of the ford foundation was appoint ed commission chairman by president lyndon johnson the commission composed of 15 members was often referred to as the stratton commission in 1969 the commission completed its final report our nation and the sea plan for national action and its more than 120 formal recommendations provided what many considered to be the most comprehensive statement of federal policy for exploration and development of ocean resources the study was instrumental in defining the structure if not all the substance of what national ocean policy could or should look like furthermore new oceanoriented programs were initiated and existing ones were strengthened in the years following the commissions report through numbe r of laws enacted by congress recommendations of the stratton commissi on led directly within the following decade to forming the national sea grant college program to creating the national advisory committee on oceans and atmos
