western states are under severe pre ssure from their citizens to secure access to water in planning to meet this goal western officials have had to confront the doctrine of indian reserved wa ter rights also known as the winters doctrine this doctrine holds that when congress reserves land for an indian reservation congress also reserves water to fulfill the purpose of the reservation when this doctrine is applied to the water laws of the western states tribal rights to water are almost always senior to other cla imants therefore in order for western water officials to effectively plan for stable allocation of water on which all parties can rely they must find way to satisfy the water claims of local indian tribes the parties originally looked to the courts to resolve these issues only to find themselves in an endless cycle of litigation that rarely produced definitive rulings as result negotiated settlements whic h often require federal funding in order to be implemented have

this transition see generally daniel mccool nativ waters contemporary indian water settlements and the second treaty era university of arizona press 2002indian reserved water rights an overview introduction1 the dramatic increase of the population in the western states over the last century has brought rise in the demand for water2 consequently the drive to secure water often pits states m unicipalities and individual ndowners against each other this drive also spurs planning and innova tion as officials look for new technological means to deliver water from wherever it can be found frequently this drive to provide stable allocation of water implicates the water rights of indian tribes in planning to ensure that their citiz ens have access to water in the future western states have had to deal with the doc trine of indian reserved water rights also known as the winters doctrine this doctrine holds th at when congress reserves land for an indian reservation congress also re serves water to fulfill the purpose of the reservation when this doctrine is applied to the water laws of the western states tribal rights to water are almost always senior to other claimants because the creation of most indian reservations predates mo st other nonindian water claims therefore in order for western water officials to effectively plan for stable allocation of water on which all parties can rely they must find way to satisfy the water claims of local indian tribes satisfying these claims has proven difficult task largely because the winters doctrine offers very little guidance regarding just how much water is reserved for the tribes the effort started with litigation but as this report discusses judges have generally proven unable to fashion an ffective method for ba lancing the literally thousands of interests in water rights adj udications increasingly then these disputes have moved from the courtroom to the negotiating table and settlements have now become the norm3 congress must ratify these settle ment agreements because many require federal funding in order to be implemented winters and the reserved wa ter rights doctrine the western states determine

indian water rights literature is replete with references to the paper waterwet water distinction which is commonly used to highlig ht the difference between right to water continuedputs the water to beneficial use4 as long as the party continues to put that water to beneficial use its prio r appropriation right remains senior to all other users5 in other words first in time first in right in 1908 the supreme court added twist to this system when it announced the reserved water rights doctrine in winters v united states 6 there the court ruled that when congress set aside land for the fort belknap indian reservation congress also impliedly reserved water to help transform the tribe into pastoral and civilized people7 the court reached this conclusion not by looking to the constitution or explicit statutory language but rather by implying certain congressional intent to this day the winters doctrine retains this implication the supreme court has continued to fi nd the same congressional intent with regard to all federal reservations trib or otherwise eg national parks stating that when the federal government withdraws its land from the public domain and reserves it for federal pur pose the government by implication reserves appurtenant water then unappropriated to the extent needed to accomplish the purpose of the reservation8 the amount must satisfy both present and future needs of the reservation9 this reserved water right vests on the date that congress reserves the land10 and remains regardless of nonuse11 therefore because most indian reservations were created in the 1800s or early 1900s these reservations generally have water rights senior to those of nonindian claimants under the western prior appropriation system12 while winters established reserved water ri ght for indian reservations for most of the last century that right amount ed to nothing more than paper water13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32198crs3 13 continued versus actually

statute in determining duties owed this was because without either standa rd for quantifying that right or the technological means to take advantage of it indian tribes had little hope of realizing actual ie wet water to remedy this situation the tribes were forced to seek assistance from the united states governme nt which holds most reservation land and related natural resources in trust for the indian tribes congress has charged the interior and justice depar tments with many of its responsibilities as trustee to advance the water rights of the indian trib however the federa l government is also charged with advancing the br oader national interest in wa ter use therefore there can be conflict of interest between i ndian and nonindian interests which until relatively recently appeared to indians to weigh almost always in favor of nonindian interests and against the devel opment of tribal water projects14 while under normal fiduciary principles such conflict woul d not be tolerated the supreme court has recognized that the united states in its unique relationship with indian tribes cannot be held to the same standards as private trustee as the court put it in water rights case involving conflict in legal representation it may well appear that congress was requiring the secretary of the interior to carry water on at least two shoulders when it delegated to him both the responsibility for the supervision of the indian tribes and the commencement of reclamation projects in areas adjacent to reservation lands but congress chose to do this the government cannot follow the fastidious standards of private fiduciary who would breach his duties to his single beneficiary solely by representing potentially conflicting intere sts without the beneficiarys consent15 with the population increasing in the we st and the resulting need to secure access to stable supply of water western states have been forced to address the senior reserved water rights of the tribes against this backdrop various state local and tribal claimants to water have filled the courts for d ecades in order to settle the myriad issues left open by the supreme court in winters in the process the question of which courts possess the power to resolve these issues has been almost as contentious as the issues themselves state adjudication the mccarran amendment for most of the last

however congress passed an appropriations ride r waiving the federal governments sovereign immunity and permitting the united states to be joined in suits involving the adjudication of water rights of

courts to adjudicate indian water rights19 the immediate effect of the amendment is to give consent to jurisdiction in the state courts concurrent with jurisdiction in the federal courts over controversies involving federal rights to the use of water20 furthermore the court also held that the policy concern of judicial economy underlying the mccarran amendment warranted the dismissal of indian water rights claims filed in federal courts when there are ongoing concurre nt and comprehensive state adjudications available to hear the claims21 specifically the supreme court concluded that the mccarran amendments main purpose was to designate comprehensive state adjudications as the primary means to determine water rights claims allowing concurrent federal proceedings would thwa rt this policy goal by creating unnecessary litigation that would lead to duplicativ and possibly contradictory judgments22 as result of federal courts abstaining from hearing reserved water rights claims

consolidated actions mandated to replace individually filed lawsuits27 these adjudications have been instituted to ascertain the extent and priority of water rights among cla imants in prior appropriations states28 the level of administrative involvement in these adjudi cations varies from st ate to state but in most states factfinding is assigned to administrative bodies which is then followed by judicial consider ation and confirmation29 meanwhile the geographic scope of general stream adjudication varies as well some general stream adjudications such as the one in montana are statewide in scope others are targeted to particular river basin such as the gila river adjudication in arizona30 since the mccarran amendment requires that general stream ad judications be

water use under courts reserved rights decree but enforcement by that same offici against either the tribes or the united states would require court injunction34 consequences of the mccarran amendment the mccarran amendment allows state to take more active role in allocating resource precious to all of its citizens however the supreme court in winters left many questions regarding reserved water rights to be deter mined by other courts in the wake of the mccarran amendment state cour ts have become the primary fora to adjudicate water rights with different states sometimes providing different answers this lack of uniformity is particularly evident in these courts attempts to develop quantification standards for determining the precise am ount of water reserved by water right litigation and quantification using the winters rationale to guide them in their search for quantification standard for indian reservations cour ts have generally focused first on each reservations purpose and th determined the amount of water necessary to fulfill that purpose traditionally c ourts addressing this issue have held that the federal government intended indians to farm reserved lands which meant that the purpose of an indian reservation was agricultural35 subsequent judicial attempts to establish quantification standard in line with this agricultural purpose have resulted in several different types of standards36 prior to the mccarran amendment some federal courts followed the supreme courts lead in winters and refused to establish quantification standard37 while other courts tried r

on the physical capacity of the reservation land rather than the number of indians on the reservation39 the special master based this practicably irrigable acreage pia standard on the assumption that the purpose of an indian reservation is agricultural starting from that assump tion the special master reasoned and the court agreed that the only feasible and fair way by which reserved water for the reservation can be measured is irrigable acreage40 interestingly while the supreme court endorsed the special masters use of the pia standard in arizona the court did not technically adopt it as the court put it while we have in the main agreed with the master there are some places we have disagreed and some questions on which we have not ruled rath er than adopt the masters decree we will allow the parties or any of them if they wish to submit the form of decree to carry this opinion into effect41 because the supreme court did not formally adopt the special masters quantification approach in its opinion many question whether arizona mandates the use of the pia standard42 notwithstanding this debate the pia standard is today by far the favorite judicial method for quantifying indian reserved water rights43 and lower courts have fashioned threestep process for determin ing reservations practicably irrigable acreage44 first soil scientists determine the largest area of arable land

judicial adoption of the pia standard provides parties with some degree of certainty as to how indian water rights will be quantified by courts that standard has been subjected to criticism first nonindian appropriators ar gue that agricultural water use is highly consumptive and therefore the pia standard favors indians and is insensitive to state and private appropriators48 on the other side of the argument some assert that the pia standard is unfair to indians in that linking water rights to agriculture is anachronistic given the modern agricultural economy49 others contend that the pia standard does not take into account the realities of modernday life and the diversity of reservations geographies and purposes50 agreeing with both sides of the pia debate in some respects the arizona supreme court in its 2002 gila river ruling abandoned agriculture as the sole purpose for indian reservations and found instead that the essential purpose of an indi an reservation is to blish permanent home and abiding place51 citing various water settlements the court found its construction necessary to achieve the twin goals of indian selfdetermination and economic self sufficiency52 in quantifying water rights in line with that purpose the court held as proper reservationbyreservation analysis of among other things 1 the tribes history and culture 2 the reservations geography and natural resources including groundwater availabi lity 3 the reservations physical infrastructure human resources technology and capital 4 past water use and 5 tribes present and projected population53 while the arizona supreme courts appr oach addresses many of the criticisms leveled at the pia standard its reservationbyreservati on focus does not lend itself to specific formula and so could lead to more uncertainty for authorities trying to account for indian reserved water rights when planning large water projects of course the gila river decision has precedential value in other states and

become even more confusing when allotments are involved in an effort to assimilate i ndians into mainstream american culture congress in 1887 passed the general allotment act54 also known as the dawes act authorizing the president to allot tions of reservation lands to individual indians title would then remain in the united states in trust for 25 years after which it would pass to the individual indian allottees free from all encumbrances55 the act also authorized the secretary of the interior to distribute surplus reservation land for the purpose of nonindian ttlement after the 25year trust period was over many allottees lost their lands either through direct sales foreclosures or tax sales56 these losses combined with the secretarys sale of surplus lands to nonindians produced checkerboard pattern of tribal trus tindividual indian trustnontrust land ownership within reservations57 while many reservations escaped allotment and its consequences this checkerboard pattern of ownership on some reservations persists and presents serious complications in reserved water ri ghts disputes the supreme court ruled in 1939 that when tribal land is converted into allotments the trust allottees succeed to some portion of tribal waters needed for agriculture58 subsequent ninth circuit case colville confederated tribes v walton built on that reasoning and held that trust allottees share of tribes reserved water is equal to the percentage of the entire reservations irrigable acreage that is located on the trust allottees land59 the walton court also found that nonindian succe ssor in interest to trust allottee acquires that allotments rese rved water right but loses that right if the nonindian successor does not put the wa ter to beneficial use60 the federal cases addressing this issue have considered allotment rights onl for irrigation purposes it is not clear how these holdings relate to reservations of land for nonagricultural purposes

discussed earlier illustrates courts answer to the threshold question of purpose can have fa rreaching effects the arizona supreme courts finding of permanent homeland purpose not only led the court to new method of quantification but also allowed the court to put premium on flexibility in how tribes use their winters water as the court put it just as the us economy has evolved nothing should prevent tribes from diversifying their economies if they so choose and are reasonably able to do so the permanent homeland concept allows for this flexibility and practicality61 this is consistent with the opinion of the special master in arizona v california who stated that even though he found the reservations purpose to be agricultural that did not mean that the reserved water had to be put to agricultural use62 the gila river court specifically rejected the approach taken by the wyoming supreme court ten years earlier in the big horn adjudication63 in big horn iii the court found that because agriculture was the primary purpose for the reservation of land for the indians if the tribe wanted to use the water for some other purpose such as instream flow the tribe must do so according to state prior appropriation doctrine64 in reaching its conclusion the wyoming supreme court relied on the primarysecondary purpose test used in united states v new mexico 65 supreme court case dealing with nonindian fede ral reservation speci fically national forest the court in new mexico found that the united states in setting aside federal lands for the gila national forest reserved use of the rio mimbres river only where necessary to preserve timber and to secure favorable water flows and therefore did not have the reserved right for aesthetic recreational wildlife preservation or stock watering purposes66 as the court stated where water is necessary to fulfill the very purposes for which federal reservation wa s created it is reasonable to conclude even in the face of congress express deference to state water law in other areas that the united states intended to reserve the necessary water where water is only necessary for secondary use of the rese rvation however there arises the contrary inference that congress intended consistent with its other views that the united states would acquire water in the same manner as any other public or private appropriator67 the big horn court applied the new mexico rationale to indian reservations and greatly constrained the ability of the tribe to adjust its water use according to modern day realities

arizona supreme court in the gila river adjudication rejected the big horn approach on two grounds first the arizona supreme court said there are enough significant differences between indian and nonindian reservations to preclude applying new mexico s primarysecondary purpose test to indian water rights cases the court found that the unde rlying federal policy of indian self sufficiency necessitates an interpretation of indian reserved rights that is broader than that of nonindian reserved rights68 secondly the court said even if the new mexico test applied the permanent hom eland purpose would be primary not secondary69 the debate over what tribe can do with its winters water gets even more contentious when the issue of offreserv ation water marketin g is broached the geography of indian and nonindian ttlement that emerged from the era of westward expansion is such that today ma ny tribes control or claim large amounts of water upstream from major metropolitan areas70 in theory then certain tribes could divert water for their own uses and leave little for the downstream cities given this situation such tribes stand to make good d eal of money by agreeing not to use their water in deference to downstream interests marketing water is especially attractive to tribes that possess the rights to reservation water but lack the infrastructure and resources necessary to exploit it71 under the nonintercourse act tribes are restricted from alienating tr ust property without statutor authorization there is limited exception to the nonintercourse act however which authorizes tribes with the approval of the secretary of the interior to lease trust land for public religious educational recreational residential or business purposes including the development or utilization of natural resources in conn ection with operations under such leases72 the use of the term natural resources seems to suggest that tribes need only seek the secretarys approval to market their water even so difficult questions persist regarding the legality and policy of marketing winters water first because most tribes have not had their winters rights quantified many individuals who live dow nstream from reservations may already have developed substa ntial reliance interests on the free use of the reservations reserved waters the prospect of having to pay for water that has long been free predictably sparks vehement opposition73 secondly the threshold question in water rights cases is often what is the purpose of the reservation as the wyoming supreme court held it is very difficult to link the offreservation marketing of water to the reservations original purpose especially if that purpose is an agriculturalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32198crs12 74

move toward the arizona supreme courts permanent homeland approach water marketing might rest on stronger foundation tribal regulation of water the supreme court has held that indian tribes as limited sovereigns have the right to regulate the conduct of their members75 right that presumably extends to the regulation of members use of tribal water states must respect tribes right to order its own affairs76 and even those states that have assumed criminal and civil jurisdiction over indian tribes pursuant to public law 28077 are expressly prohibited from regulating indian trust water rights78 the real controversy with tribal regulation of water arises when tribes attempt to extend their authority to nonmembers n onmember water rights arise in two ways first as mentioned above trust allottee holds rights to portion of reservation water second and even more complicated homesteaders have rights to reservation water in the late 1800s and early 1900s some reservations we re opened up to the public and homesteaders moved in to purchase portions of reservation land79 these homesteaders hold state ppropriative water rights80 which must be reconciled with the federal reserved water rights of the tribe in montana v united states the supreme court held that tribe may only regulate the onreservation activities of nonmembers on nonindian land within the reservation if 1 the nonmembers have tered into consensual relationships eg contracts leases et c with the tribe or 2 nonm ember conduct on the reservation threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity

us 438 459 1997 quoting williams v lee 358 us 217 220 1959water codes purporting to regulate all who use reservation water sometimes including nonmembers the law governing tribal authority to enact water codes regulating nonmembers is unclear engendering great deal of confusion among tribes and private water appropriators82 the department of the interior doi was sufficiently worried about the potential for conflict inherent in such codes that in 1975 the secretary imposed moratorium83 on all doi approvals of such water codes submitted by tribes subject to the indian reorganization act ira84 the moratorium is still in effect although doi made one exception in 1985 when it appr oved the tribal wate r code included in the water rights compact between the state of montana and the assiniboine and sioux tribes of the fort peck reservation85 the status of codes enacted by tribes not subject to the ira is yet to be determined the available case law however suggests that tribal sovereignty alone would not be enough to support application of tribal water c odes to nonmembers in holly v yakima indian nation tribe enacted water code that purported to regulate all use of excess waters on fee lands with in the reservation the court held that nonmember use of excess water on such lands did not implicate the concerns of the second montana exception and so the exception does not apply86 in addition in strate v a1 contractors the supreme court seemed to limit the second montana exception to those situations where state regulation would impinge on the right of reservation indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them87 it does not appear that tribal water c odes regulating nonmembers woul d satisfy that requirement groundwater though the supreme court has never

determination of rights to groundwater is not required for mccarran amendment adjudication to meet its co mprehensiveness requirement90 the wyoming supreme court while acknowledging that the logi c that supports reservation of water to fulfill the purpose of the reservation also supports the reservation of groundwater refused to extend the winters doctrine to include groundwat er because other court had explicitly done so91 several courts however have implicitly recognized reserved groundwater right92 in 1999 the arizona supreme court took the position that the winters doctrine applies to groundwater only when other waters are inadequate to accomplish the purpose of reservation93 this analysis the court recognized essentially dissolves the distinction between surface and groundwater the significant question for the reserved rights doctrine is not whether water runs above or below the ground but whether it is necessary to accomplish the purpose of the reservation94 this issue is by means settled conclusion in the century since the supreme court pr omulgated the reserved rights doctrine the judiciary have had difficulties in their attempts to resolve the myriad issues that the court in winters left unresolved this is not surp rising given that federal state and tribal governments and tens of thousands of people have significant stakes in the outcomes many parties have concluded that issues as co mplex and important as those outlined in this report may be better re solved by settlement with each party compromising in order to achieve its most important goals as the drive for dependable water supply in the west has grow n stronger so has the desire to quickly settle tribal water claims in order that western water officials can effectively and accurately plan for
