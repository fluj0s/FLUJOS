appear to be using variety of procedures to addr ess issues raised by or related to information classified by the government as ssi the most co mmon procedure appears to be the use of ex parte in camera reviews of submitted material121 for example in gordon v fbi freedom of information act suit regard ing the administration of tsas fly and other aviation watch lists the governme nt claimed numerous ssi exemptions and resisted disclosing information to the plaintiffs122 the district court for the northern district of califor nia ordered that the governme nt produce copies of all withheld evidence for the courts review as well as ordered that the government review all withheld information to ensure that it was exempted in good faith and provide detailed affidav it explaining why the material was exempt from disclosure123 in response to the information nd affidavits received the plaintiffs argued that tsa had not provided enough tail about the withheld information and that they had not sufficiently segregated nonssi material from that which received the designation124 the court disagreed noting that it has reviewed in camera all of the redacted ssi and has determined that all of it is properly withheld125 i n addition the court also stated with respect to the segregation issue the court has reviewed each of the ssi redactions in camera and had determined that each is properly asserted126 similarly in jifry v faa which involved challenge to an faa order revoking the airmen certificates of several lien pilots on the grounds that they posed security risks the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that although ssi had been relie d upon by the government in deciding to revoke the certificates ther was due process violation because among other procedural protections the pilots were afforded an ex parte in camera judicial review of the entire administrative record127 in addition to the use of ex parte in camera review several courts have examined claimed ssi exemptions using more traditional analysis under the freedom of information act foia128 the statutes authorizing the classification of information as ssi have been held to be an exemption 3 statute thereby authorizing the withholding of inform ation sought under the foia generallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33670crs25 129 see vaughn v rosen 484 f2d 820 82628

requests the government is required to submit vaughn index which is document that desc ribes withheld or redacted documents and explains why each withheld record is exempt from disclosure129 courts that have been faced with vaughn indexes claiming protections under the ssi statute have reviewed the sufficiency of the governments explanations and descriptions with mixed results in electronic privacy information center v dhs the district court for the district of columbia held that with respect to one document the court does not have enough information to gauge wither tsa document falls under exemption 3130 the court noted that the government merely asserted that the documents contained ssi without any add itional details131 according to the court while the governme nt is not required to describe the ssi in such detail as to reveal the informa tion they must provide more adequate description in order to justify the application of the exemption to the withheld material132 as result the court ordered th government to submit supplemental vaughn index with more detailed description133 conversely in judicial watch inc v dot the plaintiffs argued that the governments vaughn index was too vague to establish that the withheld documents were covered by exemption 3134 the court noting that the government had submitted revised vaughn index along with supporting documents cited government provided affidavit indicating that tsa determined the information to be ssi because its release may reveal systematic vulnerability of the aviation system or vulnerability of aviation facilities vulnerable to attack135 based on the information contained in the revised vaughn index and supporting documents the cour t concluded that dot s satisfied its burden of establishing that the challenged docum ents were properly withheld under foia exemption 3136 based on these two reported cases it appears that the governments ability to withhold information pursuant to ssi depends largely on the adequacy of the explanations that it provides to the court through its vaughn index and supporting documentation finally there have been several reported cases that have utilized alternative procedures for dealing with information deem ed by the government to be ssi these procedures have included orde ring the parties to provide the court with recommended security procedures before
