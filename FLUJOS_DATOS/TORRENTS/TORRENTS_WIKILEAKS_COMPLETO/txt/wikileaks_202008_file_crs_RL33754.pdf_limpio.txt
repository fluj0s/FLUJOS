policy circles congress adopted the fair labor standards act flsa it quickly became the primary federal statute in the fields of minimum wage overtime pay child labor industrial work at home sweats hop control and related areas although the flsa mandates that not ss than the minimum wage be paid to most workers there are ex ceptions for example under the tip credit provisions of the act the employer is required to pay 213 per hour so long as the remaining portion of the minimum wage is accounted fo r in tips regularly received similarly youth under 20 years of age can be paid 425 per hour through the first ninety consecutive days of employment with an employer persons with disabilities can be paid wage commensurate with their pr oductivity but with minimum standard and some employees of small businesses may be entirely exempt from the federal minimum wage conversely some states have minimum wage laws that are in excess of the federal minimum wage some significantly so where there is overlapping jurisdiction the wage more near ly in the workers interests prevails early in the first session of the 110th congress the house of representatives adopted bill hr 2 to increase the federal minimum wage in steps to 725 per hour and incrementally to ex tend its coverage to the co mmonwealth of the northern mariana islands the senate finance committee began hearings on series of tax and related incentives to add to the hous epassed bill and that was done but that initiative raised complications traditionally revenue bills are first taken up by the house and therefore hr 2 remained in limbo subsequently three other bills with implications for the minimum wage were taken up by the house the house firs t passed hr 976 which provided vehicle of revenue options possibly to be joined to hr 2 but it was not acted upon in the senate this was followed by hr 1591 an emergency supplem ental appropriations bill dealing largely with funding for the conflict in the middle east but which also contained minimum wage nd tax provisions hr 1591 was adopted but was vetoed by the president new supplemental appropriations b ill hr 2206 which included minimum wage

legislation in the 110th congress has undergone series of moreorless complicated steps phase one began on january 10 2007 when the house of representatives adopted single purpose or stand alone bill hr 2 to increase the federal minimum wage in steps to 725 per hour and incrementally to extend its coverage to the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands the vote was 315 ayes to 116 nays on february 1 the senate adopted substitute minimum wage bill hr 2 with extensive tax and related incentives for business included 94 yeas 3 nays he re however nonsubstantive complication arose traditionally revenue bills have been initiated by the house and then have moved to the senate hr 2 as passed by the house of representatives was not revenue measure dealing solely with th minimum wage though revenue provisions were attached in the senate the house committee on ways and means in phase two quickly produced new bill hr 976 not minimum wage bill per but containing revenue provisions that could be added to hr 2 were that option adopted the house approved hr 976 on february 16 360 ayes to 45 nays and sent it to the senate where it was read and placed on the senate legislative calendar on march 20 in phase three supplemental appropriations bill providing funding for the conflict in the middle east with other matters was introduced in the house hr 1591 it was considered and on march 23 was pproved 218 yeas to 212 nays and subsequently passed by the senate on marc h 29 51 yeas to 47 nays hr 1591 contained among other things minimum wage and tax components with new provision altering the manner in which the wage should be applied to american samoa in addition to the cnmi proposal httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33754crs2 1 this report focuses narrowly upon the federal minimum wage other related issues are considered separately in other crs products the president had early indicated that he would veto any measure that required time table for withdrawal of us troops from iraq hr 1591 did have such time tables and the president vetoed the measure on may 1 when on may 2 the bill was presented to the house in an effort to override the presidents veto the vote was 222 yeas to 203 nays lacking the twothirds necessary for an override shortly thereafter on may 8 in phase four modified version of hr 1591 was introduced as hr 2206 the new bill like that which had been vetoed contained minimum wage and tax language and altered the wage rate for american samoa and for the cnmi hr 2206 was passed by the house 221 yeas to 205 nays on may 10 and dispatched to the senate in the senate there were now series of disagreements with respect to the meas ure and as result much reduced bill was sent back to the house on voi ce vote where it encountered new house amendments ultimately conference repor t produced yet another draft and on may 24 the bill was agreed to by both houses and was dispatched to the white house on may 25 2007 the new b ill hr 2206 was signed by the president becoming pl 11028 in its final form it included amendments to the flsa and altered the minimum wage treatment of workers in american samoa and the cnmi introduction the flsa is an umbrella statute that deals with series of labor standards these fall roughly into three categories first minimum wage section 6 of the act second overtime pay section 7 and third child labor section 12 section 3 of the act defines the concepts used thr oughout the statute and thereby limits or qualifies its wagehour nd child labor provisions1 traditionally congress has mandated broad general minimum wage coverage and then has specified select categories of workers who are not to be covered by the act section 13 provides body of exemp tions or special treatment for segments of industry andor groups of workers in these areas the secretary of labor has been granted wide interpretive powers t hough these have not been without limit the minimum wage aspects of the fl sa have undergone changes on numerous occasions in 1949 1955 1961 1966 1974 1977 1989 1996 and now 2007 see table 1 the act began in limited way encompassing labor standards essentially for industrial workers in 1938 the minimum wage was 25 cents an hour the work week was 44 hours with amendment cove rage provisions of the act were expanded while over the years the rate has been raised to 515 per hour

r 40 hours week at 725 per hour through 52 weeks yearunder federal law special treatment may be afforded to certain youth workers to tipped employees and to persons with disability the federal flsa provides wage floor as some perceive it for fairness in the workplace where state statutes also deal with these matters and deal with them in manner more favorable to workers the state standard would normally prevail going beyond the federal statute and enacting higher standards individua ls however are not allowed to bargain away provisions of the federal law of the state standards many run roughl parallel to the flsa but they need not do so and often do not even with this more or less dual cove rage not all workers are covered by wagehour sta ndards though most are coverage patterns including patterns of exemption need to be taken into account when considering the potential impact of changes in federal wagehour law because of variati ons in coverage with extensive administrative rules governing implementation and enforcement of wagehour law it may be perilous to ggest who is or is not covered by the requirements of statute w ithout careful assessment logistics of application and targeting adequacy of the minimum wage in the academic literature and political bate people often nd to speak of the minimum wage as livable wage or decent wage but it is not clear that such concepts are always interpre ted in consistent manner in statute the minimum wage is reas onably clearly defined 585 per hour and subsequently increasing to 655 and to 725 for most but not all covered workers3 however the flsa does not transl ate that dollar amount into social or human terms for example some have questioned whether 585 an hour is actually living wage the livability of the minimum wage in some measure depends upon the context in which it is earned for ex ample whether one resides in an urban or rural area it may also be depende nt upon the earners role within the family breadwinner or youth contributing to combined family income and the number of persons in family unit under current law minimum wage worker employed fulltime and fullyear 40 hours per week for 52 weeks

employer qualifying youth employee would ordinarily see his or her wage increased to 515 an hour unless he or she breaks the consecutive days rule and moves on to another em ployer or simply drops out of work the youth subminimum wage was not altered under hr 2206 6 the table is provided as reference nimum wages are not federal assistance program but rather are payment for performance th at comes directly from the employerhour could earn 8840 for the same hours of work even when performing the same duties as straight minimum wage worker5 since much minimum wage work is also parttime andor partyear estimating actual annual income for minimum wage workers can be problematic some workers earning the minimum wage find ither through their own designs school sports family responsibilities or through the absence of alternative work that their yearlong income may fall s ubstantially below an annua lized figure while some minimum wage work may provide fringe be nefit component such fringes are often not available until worker has been employed for specific period of time period that many minimum wage workers may not reach under present law the concept of minimum wage is limited to cash wage as set forth in table 3 one sees the level of income regarded as poverty threshold at various family sizes for eligibility for certain federal assistance programs the extent to which the poverty guidelines are realis tic can be and have been debated the guidelin have direct connecti on with the federal minimum wage but they are frequently cited in di scussions of minimum wage and are used by some analysts as measure of the adequacy of the wage floor6 if the estimated annual income 12168 for minimum wage worker is compared to the poverty guidelines in table 3 the income is just above the poverty line for family of one in the 48 contiguous states the district of columbia and waii and below the poverty line for families of any other size to whom should not less than the minimum wage be paid flsa minimum wage requirements have always been subject to exceptions examples include the tipped worker the youth worker the person with disabilities in some cases an exception has been made on the basis of the type of work performed for example in the early days of the act agricultural labor and even now certain small business establis hments see discussion below collateral question involves the issue of need which it would seem also involves variety of socio economic questions if the worker is engaged primarily for pin money then his or her need may be less extreme than fellow worker who supports parent or is saving for tuition at the local university here one may want to ask should compensation be base d upon the needs of the worker his productivity or simply based upon the demand for serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33754crs7 7 see crs report rl31768 the earned income tax credit eitc an overview and crs report rs21477 the earned income tax cred it eitc legislative

usrelated insular jurisdictions who should pay the minimum wage how the minimum wage worker is defined and the intent of congress in establishingmaintaining federal minimum wage are critical to consideration of the concept who should pay the minimum wage if one thinks of the minimum wage as an antipoverty measure then it is more likely to be considered as needsbased and focused on moving the worker out of poverty conversely if the minimum wage is productivity based but fails to provide income sufficient to maintain an individual or his dependents then some supplemental means may be necessary th rough which to increase the workers income the minimum wage vs the eitc in 1975 congress established the earned income tax credit eitc as amended it provides tax credit to certain lowwage workers to qualify family must reside in the united states unless absent for military duty while oriented toward persons with children some childless adults may also qualify but the program can also be complex it is not simply matter of taking job and coll ecting ones pay as would be true even with minimum wage job historically it has been subject to overclaims of benefits and on occasi on to underclaims as well7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33754crs8 7 continued christine scottproponents of the eitc argue that it ffords firms that operate on slim margin an opportunity to remain in business and to provide employment even if at low wages however the eitc is conditi onal upon the low earnings of the worker not the marginal profitability of the employer it makes distinction between businesses employers that are struggling economically and those that are doing well some view the eitc as supplement to the minimum wage predicated upon the needs of worker rather than upon his productivity others as substitute for future minimum wage increases employerbusiness acceptance of the eitc and hostility toward the minimum wage may reflect an economic reality with the eitc the taxpayer subsidizes the employers wage costs with the minimu m wage those costs fall directly upon the employer or businessperson nd indirectly upon the consumer small businesses the flsas small business exemption allows certain qualifying employers to be exempt from the flsa minimum wage requirements in general though the exemption is complex this could include firms whose annual gross volume of business done is ss than 500000 though individual employees of such firms engaged in interstate commerce may be covered individually over time there has been pressure from the small business community to expand this exemption proponents have argu ed that small firms may be adversely affected or even driven out of busine ss by having to pay their workers the minimum wage however since there is test of profitability the exemption is enjoyed by prosperous and st ruggling businesses alike general demographics of the minimum wage workforce precise data on the minimum wage workforce are difficult to develop not everyone is covered by the minimum wage some lowwage workers may be paid at or below the federal minimum wage but because of exemptions built into the statute they may not be affected by changes congress may make for example the youth subminimum wage workers or persons subject to the tip credit provisions of the act their pay may continue at whatever rate may seem justified to management and acceptable to the worker conversely some employers may choose to pay the statutory minimum because it is convenient and generally recognized basic rate even where workers are not subject to the act in addition persons employed at or below the federal minimum wage may change jobs and economic status with some frequency moving into and out of the workforcein search of higher incomes or in response to nonworkrelated factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33754crs9 8 surveys of income may collect information only with respect to workers main job 9 about 765 million workers of civ ilian noninstitutional workforce of around 150 million were paid hourly rates in 2005 in transmitting numbers of minimum wage workers the bureau of labor statistics has stated it is not possible to clearly determine whether workers surveyed in the cps c urrent population survey are actually covered by the fair labor standards act or by individual stat minimum wage laws thus some workers reported as earning an hourly wage of 515 may not in fact be covered by federal or state minimum wage laws also there are numbe r of states that have minimum wages that exceed the federal minimum wage at the same time the presence of sizable number of workers with wages below the prevailing federal minimum wage does not necessarily indicate violations of the fl sa or applicable state laws because there are numerous exclusions and exemptions to these minimum wage statutes emphasis added see characteristics of minimum wage workers 2006 bureau of labor statistics us department of labor februa ry 27 2007 footnote to table 3school pregnancy or perhaps change in marital status some workers may be multiple jobholders and as result ma be tabulated in different manner8 not all workers covered under the flsa are covered in precisely the same way thus where statistics are available we may be speaking of the lowwage worker rather than the minimum wage worker covered under the flsa who are the minimum wage workers in 2007 about 1729 million workers 16 ears of age and up who were paid hourly rates earned at or below the fe deral minimum wage of 585 per hour about 267000 were paid at the minimum rate about 1462 million were paid below the minimum9 in absolute numbers according to data provided by the bureau of labor statistics bls persons working at or below the minimum are about as likely to be adults as youth depending upon ones calcu lation see the discussion below more likely to be female than male and more likely to be white than of another race further persons working at or below the minimum wage are more likely to be working parttime than fulltime parttime workers are considerably more likely to be women than men critics of the minimum wage often point to minimum wage worker who is young pers on working for pin money and being supported by suburban middleclass family conversely proponent s of higher minimum often view the lowwage workforce as largely adult nd the head of household and thus suggestive of more serious needs statistics can be used to support either interpretation if for example using 2007 data one defines youth as someone between 16 and 19 years of age then about 216 of workers paid hourly at or below the minimum wage are youths and about 784 are adults if ones definiti on is more expansive defining youth as between 16 and 24 years of age then about 471 of persons earning at or below the minimum wage are youths and 529 are adults thus even with an expansivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33754crs10 10 bls divides the lowwage workforce into

2008definition of youth 16 to 24 years of age over half of the minimum wage workforce is 25 years of age or over among hourly workers paid at or below the general minimum rate about 684 are women and about 316 are n although the data are imprecise because of definitional questions with respect to race and ethnicity it is clear that the majority of workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage are white10 in 2007 about 562 of workers at and below the minimum wage were employed on parttime basis about 435 were fulltime so 732 of part time workers were female and 268 were males some statistical variation may result from small number of multiple jobholders lowwage workers may differ from better paid workers in other ways for example lowwage employment may tend to be less stable than more highly compensated employment with wo rkers experiencing involuntary joblessness or moving in and out of the labor force because of discouragement quitting to seek better wages and working conditions or for personal reasons11 fulltime lowwage empl oyment is not synonymous with fullyear employment estimating the annual income of minimum wage workers may be problematic since many fulltime minimum wage workers may not be employed on fullyear basis there may be periods when they are not working or not working at the minimum wage the minimum wage is cash wage fringe benefits earned by minimum wage worker are likely to be less than those of more highly paid persons widening the gap between the economic wellbeing of the minimum wage worker and others the size of the minimum wage workforce in 2007 as noted above there were roughly 1729 million workers paid at hourly rates who earned at or below the federal minimum wage of 585 per hour beginning in july 2007 they constitute about 23 of hourly paid workers from an aggregate of about 759 million hourly paid work ers this figure indicates an upward movement of onetenth of percentage point from 22 in 2006 and collectivelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33754crs11 12 the early history of the flsa was marked by relatively sparse coverage which through the 1960s and 1970s was generally broadened giving the act roughly its present form 13 as the rate proceeds upward it may be difficult to be sure whether an increase results from the federal minimum wage or from higher state standa rds without doing considerable researchrepresents the smallest percentage of hourly workers earning at or below the minimum wage in the united states in recent times12 see table 4 the numerical decline does not necessa rily indicate improved economic status for the workers it may rather ggest progressive movement up from the statutory fixed minimum wage in re sponse to inflationary pressures but without improving ones general econo mic status had the minimum wage been indexed for inflation to provide sustaine d purchasing power its highest rate was in february 1968 its current level woul d now be in excess of 950 per hour the decline in the real value of the minimum wage in policy terms would appear to have several implications if the statutory minimum wage remains at fixed rate while the general wage level rises because of inflation andor productivity improvements the number of minimum wage workers could reasonably be expected to experience further decline fewer and fewer people could be expected to be employed at the standard minimum wage even though their general economic condition may not have imp roved this would not mean that the lowwage workforce has shrunk rather some may suspect an increasingly large number of persons would be employed at wages sligh tly above the declining real value of the statutorily defined minimum13 under this scenario the federal minimum wage could be effectively repealed by attrition and in that context an argument might be made that since so few would actually be employed at rates at or belo w the statutory federal minimum the problem of the working poor could be handled thr ough other more narrowly targeted means possibly through transfers of income rather than through strictly workrelated earnings this may run counter to public policy that income from work is generally preferable to entitlements financed through taxation with the increase in the wage rate under hr 2206 there ought to be some change in the structure of wage rates

indexing varying through the years the minimum wage reached its inflationadjusted peak in 1968 and has since generally declined in real value recent crs analysis suggests that the minimum would need to be raised to slightly in excess of 950 per hour to reach its 1968 level14 during the initial debates on wage hour legislation in 19371938 it was suggested that reasonable ra for that period would have been 40 cents an hour under prolonged objections from southern industrialists the fi gure was dropped to 25 cents per hour thus congress voided regional option and southern industrialists avoided stricter standards the minimum wage set in statute remains at fixed level until the congress alters it through legislation failure of the minimum wage to maintain parity with the cost of living has been continuing cern and some have suggested that it might usefully be indexed to reflect changes in the cost of living or shifts in other economic variables this would provide more regu lar pattern of increase on the other hand some contend that there really isnt need for federal minimum wage at all indexation was discussed during the early 20th century as an approach to wage stability it was

period af ter 180 days the regular minimum would be required the progra m was experimenta l from april 1990 to april 1993 as it turned out almost one used the program and it was not extended17 during the clinton administration the minimum wage came up as floor amendment to the small business job prot ection act of 1996 ssentially tax bill but with the subminimum wage as one of its provisions the measure was passed with the subminimum wage in place pl 10418818 as enacted the bill allows an employer to pay youth under 20 year s of age subminimum wage of 425 per hour through the first 90 consecutive days of employment with an employer having set forth youth subminimum ra congress then raised the general minimum rate to 515 an hour but without linking the youth worker option to the new standard unless congre ss takes specific action to increase the youth rate and it did not do so in the 2007 legislation it will remain at 425 per hour even as the general minimum wage is raised legislatively the youth rate is separate issue from the general wage floor19 the tip credit provision minimum wage coverage was expande d during the 1960s an d 1970s to provide protection for retail and service workers some of these workers were tipped and their employers argued successfully that they the employers ought not to be responsible for paying such tipped employees full minimum wage through the years the level of the socalled tip credit has variedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33754crs15 under the 1996 flsa amendments cong ress provided tip credit of 50 of the then standard minimum wage 425 or 212 an hour so long as an employee received tip income on regular basis sufficient to reach the statutory minimum wage when combined with an employer contribution of 213 per hour the employer had further minimum wage obligation t he credit deals only with the amount not to be paid by the employer of tip ped employee the tipped employee would receive full minimum wage either through tips or where tips were insufficient in combined tips and cash then congress increased the federal minimum wage in steps from 425 to 515 per hour the tip credit increased to 302 per hour that

congress others had not been nor had the body of flsarelated pr ovisions been considered by committee as unit during the spring and summer of 1996 the joint minimum wagetax revision measure moved through congress and was signed by president clinton on august 20 1996 pl 10418820 when minimum wage legislation came up during the 106th congress in 1999 2000 it largely followed the 1996 pattern it combined tax revisions that were beneficial to the business community with changes in the flsa including an increase in the minimum wage21 by this point the two issues minimum wage increase for lowpaid workers and tax breaks for employers whether or not they employed workers paid at the minimum wage had become linked in policy terms that is that the former could not go forward it seemed without the latter linkage although tradition only since the 104th congress 1996 and used only during that one occasion has appeared to become frequent focus of the minimum wage debate during succeeding congresses we came to the table observed representative rick lazio rny with the realization that wage increase was fair but we also came to the table with desire to protect th small business people who will end up bearing the direct burden of any wage increase that we pass here today22 senator don nickles rok concluded looking ahead to the 107th congress it kind of fits frankly to do it as part of the tax package next year23 some may argue that in practice linkage is matter of fairness and equity with respect to those who are called upon to fund an increased minimum wage not

proposals to raise the minimum wage have become in practice vehicle for legislating economic benefits for employers and others in higher income brackets26 activity in the 110th congress the concept of
