estate tax phasedown period 20012009 this report provides basic explanation of how to calculate the federal estate tax liability on taxable estate of any given size it uses the schedule of marginal estate tax rates and the applicable excl usion amount as provided in the internal revenue code and the corres ponding applicable credit amount for the year of death the report does not address how to determine the value of the taxable estate except to note that deductions from the gross estate are permitted for funeral expenses costs of administering the debts and mortgages owed charitable

relief rec onciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 egtrra pronounced eggtra phased out th federal estate tax over the years 2002 2009 egtrra lowered the top marginal tate tax rate gradua lly and raised the applicable exclusion amount and conseque ntly the corresponding applicable credit amount in large increments over the pha sedown period egtrra repealed the estate tax for decedents dying in 2010 bu t the estate tax repeal and all other provisions of egtrra are schedul ed to sunset on december 31 20102 unless changed beforehand in 2011 the law will reve rt to what it would have been had egtrra never been enacted applicable exclusion amount and applicable credit amount it is common parlance to say that cer tain amount of decedents assets are free from excluded from or exempt from the estate tax however the applicable exclusion amount is not subtracted from the value of the net taxable estate before applying the schedule of tax rates as true exemption or deductionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31092crs2 3 less than half of estate tax returns filed in 1998 through 2003 were taxable for additional information see crs report rl32768 estate and gift tax r evenues several measurements by nonna notowould be instead the exclusion amount is converted into tax credit known as the applicable credit amount the credit is equal to the tax that would be due on taxable estate the size of the applicable exclusion amount for the year of death this tax credit is subtracted from the tentative tax liability on the entire taxable estate unlike deduction which is worth more to taxpayers in higher marginal tax rate brackets the applicable credit amount is worth the same dollar amount regardless of the estates top tax brackets however the credit is nonrefundable that is it cannot reduce estate tax liability below zero consequently taxable estates that are smaller than the applicable exclusion amount are not able to take full advantage of the available credit the applicable exclusion amount also serves as the tax filing threshold an estate tax return must be filed if the gross value of the estate exceeds the applicable exclusion amount for the year of death th is filing requirement holds even if the estates taxable value falls below this am ount after subtracting eligible deductions such that estate tax is owed3 table 1 presents the applicable excl usion amount and the corresponding applicable credit amount for each year from 2001 until 2011 and beyond in 2001 prior to egtrra the applicable excl usion amount was 675000 it was scheduled to rise gradually to 1 million for 2006 nd beyond under provisions of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 tra egt rra raised the applicable exclusion amount to 1 million immediately for 2002 and 2003 it raised the amount further to 15 million for 2004 and 2005 2 million for 20062008 and finally 35 million for 2009 it repeal ed the estate tax for 2010 only if the sunset provision of egtrra is not repealed or the law is not otherwise changed beforehand in 2011 estate tax law will return to what it would have been had egtrra not been enacted under the provisions of tra of 1997 that would mean an applicable exclusion amount of 1 million for the years 2011 and beyond not 675000 the applicable credit amount was calculate d by crs by using the estate tax rate schedule to determine the tentative tax on taxable estate the size of the applicable exclusion amount for the estates of d ecedents dying in 2004 or 2005 the applicable credit amount is 555800 corresponding to the tate tax on an applicable exclusion amount of 15 million for 20062008 the app licable credit amount is scheduled to rise to 780800 corresponding to the tate tax on an applicable exclusion amount of 2 million for 2009 the pplicable cred it amount is 1455800 corresponding to the estate tax on 35 million for 2011 and beyond the applicable credit amount is scheduled to return to 345800 the amount in effect for

crs marginal tax rates appendix presents the graduated schedule of federal estate and gift tax rates for each year from 2001 through 2009 as an example here we will use the rates that apply to decedent dying in 2005 shown in table a5 rising marginal tax rates apply to different portions of an estate the statutory rates range from 18 for the taxable value of estates below 10000 up to 47 for taxable value over 2 million in practice for 2005 however the lowest ma rginal estate tax rate affecting the value of deductions or increments to the is not 18 but 45 this is the rate corresponding to taxable estate values in the range over 15 million but not over 2 million the maximum marginal rate for 2005 is 47 on taxable estate values over 2 million the applicable exclusion am ount for 2005 exempts from tax the first 15 million in taxable estate per decedent the exclusion is emphasized by gray shading over the first 13 rows of table a5 these rows encompass taxable estate values from 0 to 15 million and the corresp onding statut ory marginal tax rates from 18 to 43 an explanatory row is inserted in the table to indicate where the applicable exclusion amount for 2005 of 15 million falls within the graduated rate tablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31092crs4 calculating estate tax liability the steps involved in calculating the net estate tax liability on taxable estate of any given size are laid out in the worksheet shown in tables 2 and 3 table 2 contains numerical example for an estate with taxable value of 5 million for decedent dying in 2005 table 3 is blank worksheet provided for readers to make their own calculations two basic steps are involved in calculatin g the estate tax liability the first is to calculate the tentative tax due on taxa ble estate of the size in question based on the tax rate schedule in the appropriate table in appendix for the year of death the second is to subtract from the tentativ tax the applicable credit amount for the year of the decedents death shown in the last column of table 1 calculating the tentative tax in turn includes four steps the first is finding in the tax rate table the amount of tax due at the bottom of the bracket in which the estate value falls the second is calculatin g the amount of estate in excess of the bottom of the bracket the third is multiplying that excess amount by the marginal tax rate to determined the additional tax the fourth is adding that additional tax to the tax due at the bottom of the bracket in table 2 the value of the taxable estate 5 million is entered in line 1 column to determine the tentative tax on the estate of decedent dying in 2005 look down the first column of table a5 and find the bracket that encompasses the taxable value of the estate for an tate of 5 million that is the top bracket beginning with 2 million column c of the last row of table a5 shows that the tax on 2 million is 780800 this equals the sum of the taxes due from all of the preceding brackets in the table ente r this amount in line 2 column b next calculate the amount of the in excess of 2 million the bottom of the tax rate bracket in column subtract line 2 from line 1 and enter the difference of 3 million on line 3 this 3 million is taxed at marginal rate of 47 as shown in the last row of table a5 enter 047 on line 4 multiply line 4 047 times line 3 3000000 enter the resu

the 5 million estate on line 6 next find the applicable credit amount corresponding to the year of the decedents death in the last column of table 1 for person dying in 2005 the tax credit is 55580 0 enter this amount on line 7 this corresponds to the tax that would be due on an estate of 15 million the applicable exclusion amount for 2005 subtract the applicable credit amount of 555800 on line 7 from the tentative tax of 2190800 on line 6 and enter the resulting net estate tax liability of 1635000 on line 8 the tax of 1635000 on taxable of 5 million represents an average tax rate of

combined deduction and exclusion previously available only to estates with qualified familyowned business interests under egtrra the estate and gift ta xes remain unified through 2009 the amount of lifetime gifts that claim the gift tax exclusion is subject to cumulative lifetime limit of 1 million for 2002 and thereaf ter the exclusion claimed for taxable lifetime gifts is subtracted to determine the applicable exclusion amount remaining available to persons estate at death the amount of taxable life time gifts is included in the base used to calculate the tentative estate tax including gifts affects where the estate falls in the marginal tax rate schedule however the estate is then credited for taxes previously paid on taxable lifetime gift transfers in 2010 the gift tax
