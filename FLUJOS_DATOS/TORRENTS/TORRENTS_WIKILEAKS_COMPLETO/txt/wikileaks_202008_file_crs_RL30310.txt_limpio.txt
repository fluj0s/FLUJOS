humphries energy research analyst resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report provides background and analysis on the debate over whether the millsite language 30 usc 42 in the mining law of 1872 allows only one fiveacre millsite per mining claim in practice the bureau of land management blm has allowed for as many millsites as can be justified for developing the orebody language in the blms mineral examiners handbook allows for this practice even though it has explicit statutory basis the solicitor of the department of the interior ruled in november 1997 that the millsite provision does indeed mean only one millsite per mining claim based on this interpretation the department of the interior disapproved plan of operations for the battle mountain gold companys crown jewel gold mine in the state of washington subsequently the solicitors ruling on the crown jewel mine was overturned by congress via the fy1999 emergency supplemental bill pl 10631 both the house and the senate have addressed the millsite issue in the context of the interior appropriations bill for fy2000 the senate appropriations committee agreed to an amendment to permanently prohibit placing limits on acreage or millsites based on the number of mining claims s 1292 sec 336 the house adopted an amendment to its version of the appropriation bill hr 2466 sec 332 to support the opinion of the solicitor the mining law millsite debate summary under the general mining law of 1872 the holder of mining claim has the right to claim and patent nonmineral noncontiguous lands for millsites to mill and process ore from mining claims on federal lands at issue is whether language in the statute that states location made on and after may 10 1872 of such nonadjacent land shall exceed five acres limits the claimant to maximum of five acres per mining claim an opinion by the solicitor of the department of the interior john leshy in november 1997 concluded that the mining law provides only one millsite of more than five acres per mining claim critics argue that nowhere in the statute 30 usc 42 does it state that there can be only one millsite per mining claim based on the november 1997 opinion the solicitor ruled in march 1999 that the battle mountain gold companys plan of operation could not be approved for the crown jewel mine in the state of washington because the number and acreage of millsites exceeded the five acre limit per mining claim as part of the emergency supplemental bill pl 10631 congress overturned the solicitors decision at least for the remainder of fy1999 two opposing views have been staked out within the context of the interior appropriations bill for fy2000 the senate appropriations committee approved language that would permanently prohibit limits on the number and acreage of millsites per mining claim the house passed language that supports the solicitors view some would like the issue resolved in the context of broader revisions of the general mining law of 1872 the house language supporting the solicitors opinion is considered far too restrictive by the industry according to the national mining association nma many operations would not survive the nma contends that modern mining operations typically require much larger tracts of land for waste disposal miners also believe that onetoone claim to millsite ratio would make it necessary to go outside the federal domain to obtain sufficient area to locate milling facilities an alliance of environmental groups known as the okanogan highlands alliance has opposed the crown jewel mine and contends that overall tougher environmental provisions are needed in the mining law specifically the alliance has expressed concern over how the excess acreage for waste disposal would affect water quality the alliance argues that the mine waste would have significant impact on the headwaters of several creeks that flow into the kettle and columbia rivers solicitor leshy had stated that the millsite provision is hopelessly anachronistic or ambiguous provision of the general mining law because of congresss inability to confront headon the need for new laws better suited for modern conditions contents background 1 solicitors interpretation and decision 1 the crown jewel mine 3 legislation 4

the general mining law of 1872 grants free access to individuals and corporations to prospect for minerals on federal public domain lands and allows prospectors upon discovery to stake claim on land believed to contain valuable mineral once deposit is determined to be economically recoverable and at least 500 worth of development has taken place the claim holder may obtain patent or title to surface and mineral rights the minerals within properly located claim can be developed even without patent to support the development of mining claim the claimant has the right to use and patent nonmineral noncontiguous lands for the purposes of setting up ancillary facilities or millsites to mill and process ore more specifically the mining law states that where nonmineral land not contiguous to the vein or lode is used or occupied by the proprietor of such vein or lode for mining or milling purposes such nonadjacent surface ground may be embraced and included in an application for patent for such vein or lode and the same may be patented therewith but location made on and after may 10 1872 of such nonadjacent land shall exceed 5 acres 30 usc 42 in 1960 this law was amended pl 86390 74 stat 7 to apply to placer claim holders the patent fees for millsites are the same as the fees for lode and placer mineral claims 250 per acre for placer claims or 5 per acre for lode claims1 over the years the millsites have also been used to dispose of waste rock there are two types of millsites dependent and independent the current millsite debate revolves around dependent millsites associated with lode or placer deposit for more details on the general mining law of 1872 see crs issue brief 89130 mining law of 1872 time for reform solicitors interpretation and decision at issue is whether the fiveacrepermillsite language in the statute limits claimant to maximum of 5 acres per mining claim onetoone millsite to mining claim ratio after review of patent applications the solicitor of the department of the interior in november 7 1997 opinion concluded that onetoone ratio is the correct interpretation solicitor john leshy states my office has closely examined these questions the mining law of 1872 provides that only one millsite of more than five acres may be patented in association with each mining claimhowever multiple millsites may be patented with lode or placer claim if the total area covered 1 placer deposit is an alluvial deposit of sand or gravel containing valuable minerals derived from rocks or veins lode or vein deposit is of valuable mineral consisting of quartz or other rock in place with definite boundaries source dictionary of mining mineral and related terms bureau of mines 1968 crs2 by these millsite claims does not exceed five acres the solicitor further asserts that because the statute does not support issuing patents for millsite claims totaling more than five acres per placer or lode claim the department should reject those portions of millsite patent applications that exceed this acreage limitation the ruling could invalidate number of millsite claims and call into question operating plans for other mines if it were determined that millsite claims exceeded the fiveacrelimit per mining claim however the solicitors ruling does not affect those plans of operations on blm land that have already been approved2 the solicitor noted that the plain meaning of the statute its legislative history and past departmental rulings support his decision although some departmental rulings have indicated that only one millsite per claim could be allowed other rulings have held that more than one millsite may be patented with lode claim provided that the aggregate land is more than five acres jb hoggin 2 ld 755 the secretary ruled in 1891 that the mining law evidently intends to give to each operator of lode claim tract of land not exceeding five acres in extent for the purposes of conducting mining milling operations thereon mint lode and millsite 12 ld 624 the department has never held however that claimant may patent more than five acres of land for millsite in connection with one mining claim according to the 1997 ruling however at least in recent years the bureau of land managements blm3 mineral examiners handbook4 has contained language that appears to contradict the solicitors conclusion and which the solicitor has characterized as ad hoc changes that did not result from formal changes to the bureaus or the departments rules and regulations and were not subject to the solicitors office review5 it states that each millsite is limited to maximum of five acres in size and must be located on nonmineral lands any number of millsites may be located but each must be used in connection with the mining or milling operation h 38901 also in every case there must be proof that the land claimed as millsite is not mineral in character 43 cfr 386414 the blm manual has similar language millsite cannot exceed five acres in size there is limit to the number of millsites that can be held by single claimant6 neither the handbook nor the manual are binding on the department critics of the solicitors opinion argue that the statute 30 usc 42 does not state that there can only be one millsite per mining claim opponents of the ruling dispute many of the cases cited by the solicitor to support his decision one of the 2 us department of the interior memorandum to the blm from the solicitor john leshy limitations on patenting millsites under the mining law of 1872

purpose of promoting mining limitations are not put upon the number of locations which may be acquired by purchase nor upon the number which may be included in patent7 attorneys representing the industrys view place many of the historical court decisions and interior department positions in the context of the central issue at the time which in most cases was whether the mine operator was using the land for milling purposes or whether the amount of land in question was needed for the mine operation and not whether it violated onetoone millsiteto mine claim ratio if the correct interpretation of the law is onetoone ratio the department could not lawfully allow patenting of additional lands however congress might wish to consider the issues in order to address the practical problems that might have resulted from agency practices the crown jewel mine based on the nov 7 1997 decision the solicitor ruled on march 26 1999 that the battle mountain gold bmg companys plan of operation for the crown jewel gold mine in washington state could not be approved the denial of the operating plan cited noncompliance with the general mining law of 1872 specifically 15 claims were located for mining but over 500 acres had been located for millsites when applying the onetoone rule bmg would be entitled to only as much as 75 acres for millsites thus number of millsites were deemed invalid the 1999 decision reversed an earlier record of decision by blm and the forest service fs and denied the companys plan of operations bmg based in houston tx began the permitting process for the crown jewel gold mine in 1992 after expenses of about 80 million and an environmental impact statement positive record of decision was made by the blm and the fs in january 1997 at this point 50 permits had been granted including water quality certification from the state department of ecology and the company had posted 50 million in environmental securities total of 70 county state and federal permits are needed for operation closure and reclamation the crown jewel mine is located on forest service land near chesaw washington okanogan county see figure 1 on page 4 the forest service has responsibility for surface management and the blm has responsibility for mineral management the mine is expected to yield 145 million ounces of gold over an 85 year life about 97 million tons of nonorebearing rock will be removed in the process and disposed of in nearby wasterock disposal areas the gold will be processed using heapleach sodium cyanide solution technique to separate the gold from the ore the tailings slurry containing residual amounts of cyanide would be routed to tailings disposal facility for neutralization on adjacent federal lands the company intends to use the inco inco nickel co cyanide destruction process 7 statement of r timothy mccrum esq crowell moring llp oversight hearings subcommittee on energy and mineral resources august 3 1999 crs4 figure 1 location of the crown jewel mine approved by the state of washington the company has 15 mining claims and 100 millsite claims according to bmg without the necessary millsites development of the mine as it is presently conceived could not take place if the interior departments decision is upheld then the crown jewel mine would have to review other options for locating the desired number of millsites in excess of the 5 acres per claim such options include land exchanges leases or government buyout which could require congressional action legislation the denial of the plan of operations for the crown jewel mine was overturned in congress as part of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for fy1999 pl 10631 section 3006 this law removed the millsite limitations for the crown jewel mine notwithstanding the opinion of the interior solicitor more specifically the law states that in accordance with millsite provisions of the blm handbook for mineral examiners the statute shall not limit the number or acreage of millsites crs5 based on the ratio between the number or acreage of millsites and the number or acreage of associated lode or placer claims with respect to the crown jewel project for any fiscal year the department of agriculture and the department of the interior shall approve the plan of operations and reinstate the record of decision for the crown jewel mine further it states that patent applications and plans of operations submitted prior to this law not be denied based on the nov 7 1997 opinion thereby giving the solicitors opinion only prospective application additionally both the house and senate have addressed the millsite issue taking opposing views in the context of the fy2000 appropriations for the doi the senate appropriations committee agreed to an amendment to permanently prohibit placing limits on acreage or millsites based on the number of mining claims s 1292 sec 336 this proposal is based on the blm handbook for minerals examiners and the blm manual supporters of this view maintain that nowhere in the statute is there expressly stated fixed number of millsites per claim and that current practice allows for millsites to exceed onetoone ratio the senate defeated floor amendment on july 27 1999 that sought to delete the millsite language reported by the appropriations committee dois reaction to this amendment was to call for the millsite limitation issue to be discussed in the context of broader mining law reforms the house on the other hand adopted an amendment to its version of the appropriation bill hr 2466 sec 332 that supported the opinion of the interior solicitor on the millsite issue the language bars funds appropriated by this act from being used to process applications for approval of patents plans or operations or amendments to plans that conflict with the opinion of the solicitor following the completion of the senate floor action it appears likely that the issue will be addressed at conference on the appropriation bill in related matter the house resources subcommittee on energy and mineral resources held hearings on august 3 1999 to discuss among other issues the possible impact of the solicitors millsite opinion on the mining industry issues and analysis industry concerns the house language backing the interior solicitors opinion is considered far too restrictive by the industry according to the national mining association nma many operations would not survive especially if grandfathered patent applicants which can still receive patents under the current patent moratorium are not permitted8 the department of the interior reports that seventeen patent applications that have received their firsthalf final certificate to be processed for patent approval have been subsequently rejected or modified because 8 the patent moratorium allows those patent applications that have received their firsthalf final certificates to be processed for patent approval the firsthalf final certificate is given to patent applicants that are awaiting the mineral examiners verification of the validity of the claim for final approval crs6 of the november 1997 opinion and another twenty application have excess millsites 9 another 27 out of total of 338 pending plans of operations are reported to have excess acreage the industry argues that to uphold onetoone millsitetoclaim ratio would not be in keeping with common practice by the blm and the mining industry it is recognized throughout the mining and regulatory community that five acre millsite is inadequate for most modern commercial mining operations mining operations typically require much larger tracts of land for waste disposal particularly open pit gold mining operations using heap leach technology which allows lower grades of ore to be mined this process results in larger amounts of rock to be dug and larger disposal ponds needed to contain the waste miners also believe that enforcing onetoone claim to millsite ratio would make it necessary to go outside the federal domain to obtain sufficient area to locate milling facilities major question facing both industry and government is are other public or private lands available and suitable in an earlier article written by him solicitor john leshy stated that five acre millsite is likely to be insufficient for most modern mining operations thus the miners only remedy is to acquire the needed land by exchange or purchase often the only land available is federal land which the government is not required to sell10 solicitor leshy also stated that the millsite provision is hopelessly anachronistic or ambiguous provision of the mining law because of congresss inability to confront headon the need for new laws better suited to modern conditions11 many believe that the solution to the millsite and other issues is to amend the entire mining law environmental concerns an alliance of environmental groups known as the okanogan highlands alliance has opposed the crown jewel mine and contends that tougher environmental provisions are needed in the mining law specifically there is concern over how the excess acreage for waste disposal purposes would affect the environment especially as to water quality according to the washington department of ecology the proposed project would directly affect 376 acres of wetlands and eight springs and seeps indirect impacts would occur on about 15 acres of wetlands and nine springs and seeps discharges of leachate from the waste rock to the groundwater are expected to exceed the states groundwater and surface water 9 report to congress detailing by state all past present and pending mining operations including all grandfathered mineral patent applications and plans of operations that could be impacted by the solicitors opinion of november 7 1997 prepared by the bureau of land management august 11 1999 10 under the federal land policy and management act flpma pl 94579 90 stat 2756 tract of public land or interests therein may be disposed of by exchange by the secretary under this act and further in section 302a the secretary shall manage the public lands under principles of multiple use and sustained yield b and regulate through easements permits leases licenses rules or other instruments as the secretary deems appropriate for the use occupancy and development of public lands 11 leshy john d the mining law study in perpetual motion resources for the future 1987 p 181 crs7 standards however the department accepted mitigation plan from bmg and issued water right permit for the project coalition of environmental groups has filed suit to halt the implementation of this untested plan the alliance argues that the mine waste would have significant impact on the headwaters of several creeks that flow into the kettle and columbia rivers and bmgs water use would violate the senior rights of downstream users 12 broader mining law reforms the millsite debate may place the general mining law of 1872 under more scrutiny this congress this is partly because the debate raises many broad policy issues for instance to grandfather all the patent applicants under patent moratorium provisions that have received their firsthalf final certificate would appear to defeat the administrations policy of limiting the number of patents issued the millsite ruling would assist the administrations efforts to slow down the patent process even further by invalidating number of mining claims however to settle the millsite issue based on the current legislative proposals could either allow the mining industry to use and patent as much public land as it needed for ancillary facilities associated with mining operation s 1292 or on the other hand hr 2466 possibly shut down many mining operations both parties have developed versions of mining law reform they would prefer to advance13 the industry wants mining law bill that would continue to allow patenting of federal lands and generally minimize the impact of any royalty the environmentalists are opposed to open pit heap leach mining using cyanide to extract gold and would prefer comprehensive reform that includes environmental provisions 12 the battle mountain gold company houston tx the crown jewel mine brief overview 7899 and washington state gold mine under fire from conservationists okanogan highlands
