spending by 11 billion in fy2007 62 cut and 77 billion over 10 years further action depends on whether the fy2007 budget resolution will contain reconc iliation instructions for the agriculture

insurance the administrations budget request contains legislative proposals affecting the crop insurance program that it says would save 140 million annually beginning in fy2008 these proposals were included in the adminis trations request last year but were not considered by congress they include 1 requirement that farmers purchase crop insurance as prerequisite for receiving farm commodity payments 2 two to five percentage point reduction in th portion of the premium that is paid by the government with larger reductions at lowe r levels of coverage 3 requirement that producers pay 25 of
