individual income tax rates and other elements of the tax system 1988 through 2009 various concepts of tax rates and distinctions among them statutory individual income tax rates also referred to as statutory marginal tax rates are the rates of tax prescribed by law that are applicable to the last marginal increment of taxable income for many policymakers and taxpayers the level of statutory marginal tax rates is one of the most conspicuous features of the tax system it is important to distinguish between real or effective and statutory rates while they sound confusingly similar each designates very different economic concept statutory rates are simply the tax rates written into law for specified tiers of taxable income real marginal tax rates are the rates that actually apply to the last marginal increment of income real and statutory marginal tax rates may diverge considerably for some taxpayers but in many cases they do co incide and in many others they are interconnected1 for example some taxpayers facing 10 statutory rate were subject to real marginal rate in excess of 31 at the same time most taxpayers face effective marginal rates of 15 percent or less2 often coinciding or nearly coinciding with the statutory rate some of the elements of the tax system that give rise to the difference between the real and statutory rates include the earned income tax credit eitc phaseins and phaseouts3 the alternative minimum tax amt4 the phaseouts of personal exemptions and deductions5 and other provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34498crs2 6 for an example of such analysis s ee s d holt and j l romich 2007 marginal tax rates facing low and moderateincome wo rkers who participate in meanstested transfer programs national tax journal vol 60 2 june 2007 p 253economists believe that taxpayers change their behavior in response to effective real not statutory marginal tax rates it means that when deciding say whether to work more taxpayers consider by how much their real aftertax income would actually change as result of this deci sion the concept may be extended beyond individual income tax to an overall tax or even overall fiscal system which includes other federal and subfede ral taxes and payments6 this broader analysis however goes beyond the scope of this report in contrast average tax rates describe the total tax burden but do not directly affect individuals economic decisionmaking average tax rates express total tax liability as percentage of income unlikemarginal variables they do not reflect how taxpayers economic position change in response to his or her actions major legislation affecting the statutory rates over the past decades there have been several major changes in federal individual statutory marginal income ta x rates the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 pl 99514 is starting point from which the modern tax structure evolved tra86 among other things created tax rate structure that consisted of just two statutory individual income tax rates 15 and 28 however tra86 also legislated 5 surcharge on the taxable income of certain upperincome households which effectively created third marginal tax rate of 33 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra90 pl 101508 eliminated the 5percent surcharge and created marginal tax rate structure consisting of three statutory marginal tax rates of 15 28 and 31 however obra90 also contained provision limiting the amount of itemized deductions that upperincome households could claim and pr ovision modifying the phaseout of the tax benefits of pe rsonal exemptions for upperincom households these provisions increased effective marginal tax rates over the statutory marginal tax rates for affected taxpayers the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra93 pl 10366 added two new marginal income tax brackets at 36 and 396 rates at the upper end of the income scale it also delayed indexa tion of the two new tax brackets for one year in addition obra93 made permanent th limitation on itemized deductions and the phaseout of the personal exemption the economic growth and tax relie f reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 created new 10 marginal inco tax bracket it also reduced the top four marginal tax rates to 25 28 33 and 35 with the changes phasedin over the period 2001 through 2006 additional provisi ons of the act affected tax brackets and limitations on personal exemptions and deductions for higher income taxpayers the jobs and growth tax relief r econciliation act of 2003 jgtrra plhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34498crs3 7 for

years see tax policy center tax facts individual income tax brackets 19452008 excel file at httptaxpolicycenterorgtaxfactsc ontentexcelindividual_ratesxls10827 and the working families tax re lief act of 2004 wftra pl 108311 accelerated and extended the tax rate reduc tions originally enacted under egtrra7 under current law however most of these changes are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010 the following sections of this report describe each of these major acts in more detail tax reform act of 1986 among its many changes the tax re form act of 1986 tra86 pl 99514 instituted rather simple marginal tax rate structure for tax years after 1987 it consisted of two statutory tax rates 15 and 28 table 3 shows the elements of the 1988 tax structure these rates applie d to capital income as well as to labor income by comparison in 1986 there had been 14 nonzero marginal tax brackets and the top statutory marginal tax rate reached 508 although the tra86 specified that ther were only two statutory individual marginal income tax rates it also adopted 5 surcharge on the taxable income of certain upperincome households this surc harge effectively created third marginal tax rate of 33 28 st atutory marginal tax rate plus 5 surcharge because the surcharge was first phased in and then phased out as incomes increased marginal tax rates rose to 33 but then fell back to 28 producing what came to be known as the tax rate bubble the surcharge was adopted so that the tra86 would not change the distribution of the income tax burden relative to its distribution under pre1986 tax law and woul d meet the revenue targets the surcharge allowed for characterization of the tra86 as having only two statutory marginal tax rates while meeting these other goals the surcharge was designed to eliminate the tax benefits of the 15 tax bracket and the tax benefits of th personal exemptions for upperincome households for joint returns in 1988 the phaseout of the 15 tax rate started when taxable income exceeded 71900 and ended when taxable income reached 149250 and the phase out of the exemptions followed from that poi nt on for single returns the phaseout of the 15 tax bracket occurred over the taxable income range of 47050 to 97620 for heads of households the phase out occurred over the taxable income range of 67200 to 134930 the phaseout of the exemptions followed the phase out of the 15 tax bracket for all filing statuses but the range of income over which it occurred depended on the number of ex emptions claimed by taxpayer to demonstrate how the 5 surcharge wo rked to phase out the tax benefits of the 15 tax bracket consider the follo wing example based on joint returns forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34498crs4 1988 the difference between taxing the first 29750 of taxable income at 28 instead of 15 was 386750 obtaine d as 29750 multiplied by 13 the difference between 28 and 15 five pe rcent of the difference between the upper and lower phaseout limits was also 386750 149250 less 71900 multiplied by 5 hence assessing the 5 surc harge on taxable income between 78400 and 162770 was equivalent to havi ng taxed the first 32450 of taxable income at 28 rather than 15 5 surcharge was also used to phase out the tax benefits of the personal exemption for upperincome households in 1988 each personal exemption was worth 1950 and produced tax savings for household in the 28 marginal tax rate bracket of 546 1950 times 28 to r ecapture this tax savings 5 surcharge was assessed against 10920 of taxable income for each personal exemption claimed 5 surcharge agains t this amount of taxable income increased tax liability by 546 10920 times 5 which exactly offset the tax savings from the personal exemption the phaseout of personal exemptions started immediately after the phaseout of the 15 tax bracket and the phaseout of each exemption occurred sequentially this meant that the taxable income range over which the 5 surcharge offset personal exemptions depended on the number of personal exemptions claimed on the tax return for example on joint return claiming two personal exemptions the 5 surcharge would apply to taxabl income between 149250 and 171090 149250 plus two times 10920 on joint return with four personal exemptions the 5 surcharge would apply to taxabl income between 149250 and 192930 149250 plus four times 10920 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra90 pl 101508 created threetiered statutory marginal income tax rate structure with rates of 15 28 and 31 effective in tax year s beginning in 1991 as shown in table 5 obra90 eliminated the tax bubble created under tra86 but replaced it with limitation on itemized deductions and new approach to phasing out the tax benefits of the personal exemption for upperincome households obra90 reintroduced taxrate differential on capital gains income obra90 contained provision which limited the tax on capital gains income to maximum of 28 this provision was effective starting in tax year 1991 under tra86 capital gains had been treated as ordinary income and taxed at regular rates of up to 33 the obra90 limitation on itemized deductions worked as follows for tax years starting in 1991 otherwise allowable deductions were reduced by 3 of the amount by which taxpayers adjusted gross income agi exceeded 100000 or 50000 in the case of married couples filing parate returns for example in 1991 if taxpayers agi was 110000 then his otherwise allowabl itemized deductions would be reduced by 300 110000 ss 100000 times 3 this provision effectively raised the marginal income tax rate of those taxpayers affected by approximately one pe rcentage point dollar of income in excess of 100000 washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34498crs5 taxed as if it were 103 since in addition to the tax on an extra dollar of income the taxpayer lost tax deductions by giving up 003 of itemized deductions this limitation was scheduled to expi re after tax year 1995 under obra90 but was later extended allowabl deductions for medical expenses casualty and theft losses and investment intere st were not subject to this limitation for tax years after 1991 the 100000 threshold was indexed for inflation the phaseout of the tax be nefits of the personal exemption worked as follows each personal exemption was phased out by factor of 2 for each 2500 or fraction thereof by which taxpayers agi exceeded given threshold amount in 1991 the threshold amount for joint return was 150000 for single return the threshold was 100000 and for heads of households the threshold was 125000 for example in 1991 joint household whose agi was 183000 would lose 28 of their total personal exemptions cl aimed the agi amount in excess of the threshold in this instance would be 33000 183000 agi less 150000 threshold limit the 33000 excess divided by 2500 w ould produce factor of 132 which when rounded up would equal 14 this figure is multiplied by 2 to arrive at the final disallowance amount of 28 hence if the family had claimed two personal exemptions which at 2150 each would to tal 4300 they would only be allowed to deduct 3096 4300 total personal ex emptions less the 1204 disallowance which is 28 of the total for tax years after 1991 these income threshold am ounts were i ndexed for inflation the personal exemptions phase out provision was also scheduled to expire after tax year 1995 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 the omnibus budget reconciliation ac t of 1993 obra93 pl 10366 made several changes in the individual marginal income tax rate structure first it added two new marginal tax rates 36 nd 396 at the upper end of the income spectrum the 396 marginal tax rate bracket was created by imposing 10 surtax on highincome taxpayers 39636 36 which is 10 of 36 although obra93 was enacted in august of 1993 the increase in the top marginal tax rates was made effective retroactively to january 1 1993 affected taxpayers however were not assessed penalties for underpay ment of 1993 taxes resulting from the tax rate increase taxpayers were also allowed to pay any additional 1993 taxes in th ree equal installments over twoyear period second obra93 delayed indexation of the new top marginal income tax brackets for one year hence the nomin dollar tax brackets for the 36 and 396 marginal tax rates remained at the same level for both tax years 1993 and 1994 finally obra93 made permanent both the itemized deduction limitation and the phaseout of the tax bene fits from personal exemptionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34498crs6 9 for more information see crs report rs21171 the rate reduction tax credit the tax rebate in the economic growth and tax relief

period of time but subsequent 2003 and 2004 legislation desc ribed in the next sec tion overrode the schedule originally set by egtrra table 1 shows the time line of changes related to the marginal tax rate structure enacted under egtrra and subseque nt bills discussed below first the 2001 act created new 10 brack et it applied beginning in tax year 2002 to the first 12000 of taxable income for married couples filing jointly the first 10000 of taxable income for heads of households and the first 6000 of taxable income for single individuals for tax year 2001 the act created rate reduction tax credit mimicking the effects of the 10 tax rate bracket for most taxpayers9 in tax years 20032007 these provisions of egtrra were superseded by subsequent legislation in 2008 egtrra set the 10 marg inal tax rate bracket at 7000 and 14000 for single and married taxpayer s respectively starting with tax year 2009 these bracket amounts are sche duled to be indexed for inflation second the 2001 act gradually reduced the top four marginal income tax rates under prior income tax law the top four marginal tax rates we re 28 31 36 and 396 when fully phased in the 2001 act reduced the top four marginal income tax rates to 25 28 33 and 35 under egtrra the reductions were scheduled to take place in 2001 through 2006 but subsequent gislation accelerated the egtrra phasein schedule third egtrra also repealed the limitation on itemized deductions and personal exemptions for highincome taxpayers the repeal was scheduled to be phased in between 2006 and 2009 the limitati on was completely repealed for 2010 but it would reappear again in 2011 once the egtrras tax cuts expire fourth some of the acts measures designed to reduce the marriage penalty affected the rate bracket structure the act increased the width of the 15 tax bracket for married couples filing joint re turns to twice the width of the 15 tax bracket for single returns under egt rra this provision was scheduled for phase in over fouryear time period startin g in 2005 but subsequent legislation accelerated this time line under egtrra the end point of the 15 tax bracket for joint returns was scheduled to be 180 of the end point of the 15 tax bracket for single returns in 2005 187 in 2006 193 in 2007 and 200 in 2008 and subsequent years10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34498crs7 10 continued extension of the indi vidual income tax cuts enacted in 2001 through 2007 by maxim shvedovfinally the 2001 act increased the standard deduction for joint returns to twice the size of the standard deduction for sing returns the change was scheduled to be phased in over fiveyear period 2005 to 2009 but it was accelerated by the subsequent bills as well this had an effect as far as tax rate brackets were concerned of raising the lower threshol d of the lowest tax bracket for married taxpayers filing joint returns jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 and the working families tax relief act of 2004 among

familie s table f5 race and hispanic origin of householder families by median and mean income 1947 to 2005 web page at httpwwwcensusgovhheswwwincomehistincf05htmleffects of inflation on income tax liabilities during periods of inflation progressive tax structure designated on nominal dollar basis produces automatic tax increases and unintended changes in the distribution of the tax burden it occurs because nominal incomes rise faster than the real incomes leading to heavier tax burden imposed on taxpayers compared to what lawmakers intended at the time of their policy considerations the federal individual income tax system in the united states is progressive that is as incomes rise income tax liabilities as share of income also rise in addition the income tax is calculated on th basis of current dollar amounts absent periodic indexation of the tax system elements larger share of taxpayers would be subject to higher tax liabilities simply because their nominal income increased regardless of how their real income had changed the effects of inflation on income tax liabilities could be substantial even in periods of low inflation such as the last two decades still according to the bureau of labor statistics 1000 in 1989 is wo rth about 1707 or almost 71 more in 200811 yeartoyear changes might appear negligible but over period of several years it compounds to make substantial difference consider hypothetical example of what lack of indexation would have implied for taxpayer if the 1989 tax structure applied without indexation in 2008 for illustration consider fourperson family with adjusted gross income agi of 35000 in 1989 rounded up 1989 family median income of 34213 according to the census12 if we assume that the family used the standard deduction then its taxable income would have been 21800 35000 less standard deduction of 5200 and four personal exemptions at 2000 ap iece and the tax liability 3270 this translates into an aftertax income of 31730 35000 less 3270 or an average tax rate of 93 3270 divided by 35000 income now consider what would have happe ned in 2008 if this familys nominal income just kept up with inflation the agi would have been approximately 60000 if the tax structure were not inde xed for inflation the familys taxable income would have been 46800 the ta x liability would have increased to approximately 9081 in current 2008 dolla rs or 5319 in constant 1989 dollars 9081 adjusted for cumulative inflation of about 71 this would represent tax liability increase of 63 in real terms the familys aftertax income would be 50919 in current 2008 dollars or 29826 in constant 1989 dollars 50919 adjusted for the cumulative inflation of bout 71 decrease of 6 its average tax rate would have in creased from 93 to

research network 14 james c young summary of 2007 infla tion adjustments impacting individuals tax notes oct 15 2007 p 246this example illustrates how this familys real aftertax income declined by 6 because of the socalled bracket creep its income tax burden increased by 63 in real terms between 1989 and 2008 this effect would be even more pronounced in the periods of high inflation under an indexed tax system the family would have experienced change in their real aftertax income for instance under an indexed system the value of the standard deduction for joint return would have increased from 5200 in 1989 to 8877 in 2008 the personal exemption would have increased from 2000 to 3414 under these circumstances the fa milys 2008 taxable income would have been 37465 60000 income less standard deduction and personal exemptions tax brackets would have adjusted as well based on this taxable income and the adjusted brackets their income tax lia bility would have been 5620 in current 2008 dollars or 3291 in c onstant 1989 dollars about the same as in 1989 the difference is due to rounding in short the nominal amounts might be different but real values would have stayed the same for this family congress enacted income tax indexation as part of an overall package of statutory marginal tax rate reductions c ontained in the economic recovery tax act of l981 the congress believed that automatic ta x increases resulting from the effects of inflation were unfair to taxpayers since their tax burden as percentage of income could increase during intervals between tax reduction legislation with an adverse effect on incentives to work and invest in addition the federal government was provided with an automatic increase in its aggregate revenue which in turn created pressure for further spending13 there was very little debate about this aspect of the bill the act specified which elements of the tax system were subj ect to indexation over the years as the tax system changed additional elements entered the list the list of the indexed elements of the tax system has been gradually expanding over the years for example one of the most notable changes occurred with the passage of the tra86 which extended i ndexation to some of the newly created elements of the tax system such as the dditional standard deduc tions for the elderly and the blind the eitc and others mo re recently egtrra applied indexing to the eitc phaseout amounts in 2008 table 2 lists major indexed tax items nd provides the year of the first adjustment14 for some provisions the technicalities are too complex to be listed in table format for ex ample as mentioned above indexi ng of some elements of the eitc started in 2008 while others have been indexed since the late 1980shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34498crs11 15 in 2008 the amount of the threshold was set by special provision of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 but this provision is

source james c young summary of 2007 inflation adjustments impacting individuals indexing might make the tax system somewhat more technically complex but this is minor complication the yeart oyear changes in dollar amounts are usually small so taxpayers hardly ever face unexpected changes that might materially affect them on the revenue side indexing results in lower government receipts some elements of the tax system are not adjusted for inflation or are only partially adjusted for example most of the amounts related to the child tax credit are not adjusted for inflation including the amount of the credit itself or phaseout thresholds for higherincome taxpayers the earned income floor used in calculating the credits refundable amount is adjusted for inflation however15 in recent years problem caused by the lack of indexation of the alternative minimum tax amt parameters has garnered considerable attention of the policymakers and the public because of the fastgrowing number of taxpayers that could be affected by the amt the amt is an alternative income tax system originally intended to affect only highincome taxpayers amts parameters are nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34498crs12 16 us congress joint committee on taxation present law and background relating to the individual alter native minimum tax jcx3807 june 25 2007 pp 11 17 17 for more information please see crs report rs21817 the alternative minimum tax amt income entry points and take back effects by steven maguireadjusted for inflation with the passage of time as nominal incomes of taxpayers rose across the board the amt affected larger number of taxpayers at broader range of income levels it is estimated that absent congressional action the number of taxpayers subject to the amt will increase from over 1 million in 2001 to about 26 million in 2008 and almost 36 million in 201716 in recent years congress has adjusted amt parameters to avoid this in series of oneyear adjustments but at this point it is not clear how this ongoing issue will be resolved in the long term17 while the amt is currently the most notable problem caused by the lack of indexation the amt exemptions are not th only parameters in the tax system not adjusted for inflation therefore it is c onceivable that lack of indexation may pose new complications in other areas of the tax system in the future the mechanics of indexation most provisions are indexed using the technical calculation described below the methodology is the same although speci fic parameters may vary by provision in some instances the calculation met hodology differs somewhat in one way or another such examples include the eitc or transportation bene fits the variations are insignificant from an economic standpoi nt as long as they do not result in systematic deviations fro m the rate of inflation the adjustment for any given tax year is based on the percentage amount by which the average consumer price index fo r all urban consumers cpiu for the 12 month period ending on august 31 of the preceding year exceeds the average cpiu during specified twelve month base pe riod the base period differs depending upon the tax component under c onsideration as listed in table 2 with the exception of the eitc and some other instances inflation adjustments are currently rounded down to the neares t multiple of 50 although rounding down affects the accuracy of any given years inflation adjustment the effect is not cumulative since each years adjustment is calculated to reflect the entire amount of inflation that has occurred between the adjustment year and the base period for example the adjustment factor for the standard deductions in 2008 was calculated as follows the average cp iu for the base period september 1987 through august 1988 was 11662 the average cpiu for the period september 2006 through august 2007 was 20487 given these amounts the inflation adjustment factor for 2008 was 176 2048711662httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34498crs13 this inflation adjustment factor wa s then applied to 2000 the base year value of the exemption in 1989 resulting in 3513 rounding this number down to the nearest multiple of 50 yields the final value of the exemption in 2008 3500 tax rate schedules for 1988 through 2009 the following tables present the personal exemption amounts
