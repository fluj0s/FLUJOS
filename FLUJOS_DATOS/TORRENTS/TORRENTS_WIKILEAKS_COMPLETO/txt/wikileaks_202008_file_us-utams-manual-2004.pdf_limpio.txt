etc care should be taken to avoid high noise areas suchas near roads streams or noisy equipment vegetation shouldnot be touching the tripod or array arms and should be farenough away so that branches will not hit the array structure inmoderate wind potential for false alarms sensor station sitesmust be within 2km of the base station location for adequatecommunications when using the yagi antenna in conjunction withthe radio box or within 500 meters when using the rubber duckyantenna the baseline distance between two acoustic arraysshould be approximately 500 meters or more the larger thebaseline the more accurate the range solution via triangulationwill be the range accuracy will naturally degrade for longerrange detections andor smaller baselines the arrays should beas far apart as possible while maintaining radio contact betweenthe sensor stations and the base station for normal operationwith four sensor stations do not select locations in straight lineif only two sensor stations are deployed select locations for the arrays such that the baseline is perpendicular to the most likelydirection of incoming mortar fire this is important because therange errors from triangulation can be very large when an eventis detected outside the two arrays close to the line formed byextending the baseline through and outside the arrays in someof these cases the lobs will not intersect and range solutionwill not be available in other cases the lobs will intersect atmany points and the accuracy of the range solution will bedegraded however in all of these cases the bearing

acoustic arrays in order to produce an accurate gps location of mortar ev ent five alignment procedures survey team visual reference arraytoarray gps aiming point and compass aiming point aredescribed below the five procedures are different and will produce various levels of system accuracy the order of appearance of the alignment procedures in this manual is the order of best to least accurate when setting up system different alignment proce dures can be used for the individual arrays of the system setup of the acoustic sensor arrays requires careful alignment of the arra and the precision of the tools used to align the arrays will determine the accuracy of the system while the map position of each sensor station is automatically obtained by its inherent gps receiver and transmitted via radio to the base station the operator must manually determine the azimuth orientation of each array and enter this data into the base stat ion lap top computer the align arrow engraved on the array baseplate defines the orientation direction of the array it is important to note that the arrays do nothave to be pointed towards north also the arrays can be but do nothave to be pointed all in the same direction when using the survey team procedure after the operator has deployed the sensor stations the survey team then meas ures the location and orientation of each array when using the visual reference procedure the arrays are pointed towards one or in divid ual objects for which overhead imagery is available on the map display of the base station laptop computer when using the arra yto array procedure each array is pointed towards another array for which lineofsight is available when using the gps or compassaiming point procedures the arrays are pointed towards any operatorselected distant object if magnetic compass is used to meas ure the azimuth orientation of the arrays these measurements must be corrected for the local declination angle before being tered into the base
