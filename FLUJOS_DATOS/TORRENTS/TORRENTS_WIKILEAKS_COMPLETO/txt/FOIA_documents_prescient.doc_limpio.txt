an estbastb thematic programme proposal palaeoclimatic research and earth system modelling for enhanced climatic and environmental prediction prescient we propose joint fiveyear earth scienceatmospheric science thematic programme of research designed to enable more rigorous testing of the capabilities and reliability of gcms with specific focus on increasing the sophistication and versatility of the earth system model being developed at the uk meteorological office hadley centre for climate prediction and research hc informed social and economic planning demands genuine and realistically defined predictive capability for climatic and environmental change accurate prediction requires an understanding of both natural and anthropogenic mechanisms of change our only realistic approach to developing such an integrated and quantitative capability is through the use of advanced general circulation models gcms which attempt to simulate the operation of the whole earth system major advances in gcm development are currently underway and uk research in this area is at the forefront of this development it is now evident however that these models require thorough testing beyond that achievable by comparison with the short instrumentalbased observational record palaeoclimate data can extend the instrumental record provide evidence on the nature of past mean climates climate variability and extreme events during periods of different climate forcing and provide evidence of the likelihood and possible mechanisms of extremely rapid switches between different modes of climate operation the programme we propose will assemble palaeodata and develop methodological framework for their application to validating the next generation of global climate models with the direct involvement and joint coordination of the hc and the universitys global atmospheric modelling programme ugamp it will combine the strengths of hc and ugamp with those scientists pioneering new and more robust methods of reconstructing past climatic changes including the assembly of data with higher temporal and spatial resolution than hitherto the time is ripe to combine the needs of the modelling community viz palaeodata sets of sufficient robustness to test the sensitivity and validity of the new generation of gcms with the needs of the palaeoclimate community viz better understanding of the modes and mechanisms of the global climate system the partnership that will be fostered within this programme will enable the latest experimental model runs to be made available to wide palaeoclimate community it will enable thorough testing of the natural variability of the model additional sensitivity experiments using forcings provided by the palaeo community will evaluate specific subcomponents of the model this work will greatly enhance the validation and development of the hadley centre climate model far beyond what would be achieved at hc alone during this period bringing together the uk earth science atmospheric science and climate modelling communities in the way we propose with the clear aim of validating and enhancing one of the worlds most advanced climate models is entirely new it corresponds fully with current nerc scientific priorities and with the recently declared aims of major international science programmes it is clearly interdisciplinary with the potential to involve many researchers including those categorised under the marine polar and terrestrial and freshwater boards however most importantly it will produce tangible scientific benefits by identifying model shortcomings and guiding future model developments it will keep uk modelling at the cutting edge of the science during period of very rapid evolution this programme will provide major impetus in the search for fuller and integrated knowledge of preindustrial climate variability and its causes and provide much improved basis for assessing the reliability of model predictions of anthropogenic climate change in this way the programme will benefit many areas of industrial ecological and agricultural management and planning the general scientific context the reality of climate change on many timescales is widely appreciated however the need to quantify the contributions of different natural and anthropogenic forcings to recent climate change and their roles in future climate are issues that have now also gained virtually universal recognition it is self evident that there are enormous environmental economic societal and hence political implications for gaining practical understanding of the factors that govern the mean states and the variability of the worlds present and future climates achieving correct and timely attribution of human induced climate change and providing realistic estimates of its impacts and the likely rates of induced changes represent major and urgent scientific challenges gcms offer the only prospect of understanding the mechanisms by which past and future climate changes are driven by anthropogenic and natural forcings to meet these challenges requires the development of numerical climate models that incorporate all of the major components of the earthclimate system and that successfully reproduce their interrelationships on relevant space and time scales experiments with such models must also involve the specification of the major nonanthropogenic forcings and demonstrate the capability of the models to reproduce the full extent of natural climate variability uk expertise in global climate modelling particularly by the hc and ugamp stands today at the forefront of gcm science in recent years both groups have started working with the same climate model and this model is evolving into comprehensive earth system model already incorporating an atmosphereocean component that has been run for the equivalent of hundreds of years without the need for artificial flux corrections ugamp has recently added the ability to simulate accurately the growth and decay of land ice new components representing the carbon cycle are currently undergoing testing and other major developments such as the inclusion of explicit atmospheric chemistry are envisaged in the very near future to date only atmospheric versions of the model have been tested against palaeodata the numerous new processes included in recent years have not been tested in any other climate regime other than the present it is essential that rigorous testing of the new model is performed this testing should include testing the mean climate sensitivity of the model and its variability the restricted length and limited spatial coverage of the historical instrumental climate archive are not sufficient to allow accurate estimation of the magnitude patterns and rates of climate changes that occurred prior to the industrial era and against which the controlrun output of this model must be compared additionally the directly observed histories of different potential climate forcing agents both internal eg ocean variability or external eg solar irradiance to the earth system do not provide adequate model input for exploring the recent role of natural climate variability it is only through the analysis of proxy indicators that we can extend the record of climate and climate forcings over earlier centuries and millennia uk scientists are also among the world leaders in the collection and interpretation of palaeoenvironmental especially palaeoclimatic evidence their expertise covers many physical and biological processes operating on timescales ranging from less than year to many millennia however while this knowledge as whole can be said to represent significant interdisciplinarity the palaeoenvironmental community remains diverse and largely uncoordinated one nerc has in the past supported two important programmes that helped organise sections of the palaeo community ie palaeoclimate of the last glacialinterglacial cycle and the tigger initiative though interaction with gcm modellers was involved there have been very few examples of collaborative research between members of this community and global climate modellers strategic initiative at uk national level specifically intended to direct and integrate their joint efforts has ever been implemented we are now proposing just such an initiative in the form of this thematic programme of research we consider that its timing and the great mutual benefit that would accrue to the palaeo and modelling communities as well as to the wider science community and ultimately the government and the public at large represent strong case in favour of its support the specific uk gcm and palaeoenvironmental context the background to current gcm research many coupled atmosphereocean general circulation models required fluxes ie the addition of heat and water to the ocean component of the coupled model to keep the model stable those fluxcorrections were constant but nonphysical the third generation hc coupled climate model hadcm3 is significant advance over its predecessors having eliminated the need for these ocean fluxcorrections it has increased 125 by 125 degrees oceanic resolution and much improved simulation of ocean currents its atmospheric component includes stateoftheart radiation code which allows explicit representation of the major greenhouse gases and aerosols new land surface scheme moses accounts for the effects of soil water phase changes and the effect of co2 concentrations on transpiration the model includes sulphurcycle submodel which converts prescribed emissions into aerosol concentrations which influence the earths radiation budget both directly and indirectly through their influence on cloud properties the model is portable can be run on variety of machines and is now being used by ugamp other work involves replacing formerly prescribed elements by interactive components in particular new variant of this model will incorporate models of the ocean and land carbon cycle while another contains ocean biology and can simulate ocean chemical uptake of co2 an interactive vegetation model resolves the terrestrial biosphere into different functional types that spread and compete while their associated land surface parameters are correspondingly modified providing climatevegetation feedbacks as well as those associated with co2 all of this illustrates the accelerating pace of model development but it emphasises the requirement for additional and new work to validate the model and its constituent parts by the end of 1999 the hc expects to have completed 1000year simulation with constant forcings and whole suite of simulations with differing external forcings both natural volcanic and solar forced and anthropogenic for the period 1850 to 2000 some of the anthropogenic simulations will be continued to 2100 to allow investigation of future climate change the natural forcings used are however highly uncertain results from these experiments will be made available on casebycase basis furthermore set of coupled climatecarbon cycle simulations will be carried out for the period 1850 to 2100 these simulations will be complemented with others carried out under this proposal to test simulated climate variability in specific regions and for example in carbon budgets or biogeochemical processes testing the ability of the model to reproduce past states of climate and to simulate slower processes eg the migration and carbon uptake of forests changes in the cryosphere will also be especially useful for validating models with palaeoclimate data it is important to develop new methods for performing detailed quantitative comparisons exciting possibilities include the incorporation of 18o into the model and the possibility of including carbon isotopes land vegetation can be directly compared to model simulations rather than having to rely on inverse methods only hydrological models can also be exploited to add quantitative aspect to lake level data evidence from palaeoclimate data and from simple climate theory suggests that the climate system has thresholds the most commonly quoted example is in operation of the thermohaline circulation but there are other examples such as vegetation change in the sahel such threshold mechanisms are extremely difficult to model correctly because small inaccuracies in the simulation may result in an incorrect transition the palaeoclimate data can help validate the models response to potential threshold mechanisms such work is of great importance as central aspect of the climate convention is to define safe level for future increases of greenhouse gases to define such safe level will require detailed and accurate knowledge of the existence of and mechanisms that underlie such thresholds the background and potential of current palaeoenvironmental research uk scientists have long been prominent in certain areas of palaeoecology and palaeoclimatology but they have largely been concerned with processes operating prior to the current interglacial period and at millennial and longer timescales most notably in areas such as palaeooceanography and palynology however even in these areas attention has recently shifted more towards higher resolution and holocene studies in recent years the uk has made rapid and important developments in the exploration of new highresolution proxies and in the geographical and interpretational scope of other more established ones continued development and coordinated interpretation of these data hold great promise for establishing general picture of climate variability on short timescales for much of the holocene and earlier extensive new networks of treering width and density data now provide detailed patterns of highlatitude summer temperature changes over recent centuries and at several specific locations in scandinavia russia and europe they provide continuous timeseries recording extreme temperature and precipitation variability throughout much of the holocene exciting developments in the analytical techniques dating control and the recognition of annual or subannual resolution in speleothems shows great promise for reconstructing annual temperatures and ground water change rigorous work in the analysis and climatic interpretation of corals is extending our understanding of the relationships between climate change and enso variability and temperature and precipitation change in the tropics uk scientists have and will make an important direct contribution in antarctic studies and provide access to modelling community that is expert at incorporating palaeotracers eg 18o and dust into gcms many uk scientists can contribute expertise on the analysis of ocean sediments cores recovered under the neapacc programme are currently demonstrating that by carefully planned coring good quality highresolution holocene records are recoverable in relation to this thematic programme the more important innovative advances are likely to come from highdepositionrate cores on continental margins providing interaction with workers investigating rates of past and likely future coastal erosion the ocean drilling programme has recently constituted working group to develop programme for drilling in shallow water there remains much potential for building on the notable recent developments in the analysis of lake sediments and raised bogs with special emphasis on the scope to develop intraannual and annual records from laminated sediments in regions largely uncontaminated by direct human influence number of eu funded projects involving highresolution studies of lakes on range of timescales are currently underway as is work to develop transfer functions for lake sediment fossil assemblages eg chironomidtemperature diatomsalinity there is also the rapid development of techniques for measuring compound specific stable isotopes c and from lipids and the development of methods for measuring 18o from diatom silica that will enable 18o measurements from noncarbonate rich sediments characteristic of polar and mountain regions in addition to these direct palaeoecological areas of research there are many researchers concerned with important associated topics such as those working with dating techniques potentially applicable to different disciplines such as work characterising different volcanic tephras and cataloguing their occurrence those developing process models or empirical models linking highresolution climate and delayedresponse palaeoevidence and those concerned with the methodology of integrating and characterising diverse palaeoevidence on regional and larger spatial scales and calculating uncertainties in the resulting records through the routine archiving of palaeodata at the world data centrea for paleoclimatology workers in all of the above disciplines will be able to apply their expertise to worldwide data in summary uk palaeo researchers are international leaders in wide range of diverse disciplines and specialities however those working in different ecosystems such as the marine lake or terrestrial environments have up until now tended to interact weakly if at all there has been little crossdisciplinary comparison of statistical methods or coordinated comparisons of interpreted evidence certainly the programme we propose would present major opportunity for more effective interaction across these traditional subdiscipline boundaries and the availability of the hadley centre climate model would provide an important focus for integrating reconciling and interpreting evidence from the different palaeo sources this programme would for the first time concentrate efforts aimed at presenting palaeodata in manner suitable for model validation the programme will also provide vital means by which these same modellers can learn directly from the palaeo community about the strengths and weaknesses of these data for this task research programme general scientific aims the overall aim is the development of scientific basis for testing and improving the individual and linked processes that make up the hc climate earth system model we envisage this being done be comparing palaeoclimaterelated data with the results of model simulations the palaeodata will represent range of timescales and periods but with major emphasis on decadal to century variability during the past few millennia hence we aim to provide muchimproved understanding of the models ability to simulate natural climate variability provide insight into the reliability of its natural and anthropogenicallyperturbed climates and suggest where future model development might be best concentrated the programme will emphasise investigations into 4 aspects of the analysis of palaeo observed and simulated data 1 climate variability work under this aspect will include measuring the statistical variations of different weather parameters or meteorological systems that go to make up climate regime including the characteristics of extreme events this encompasses timescales from annual to multidecadal with an emphasis on the last 2000 years with necessary requirement for firm dating control and high resolution ideally seasonal or annual currently detection and attribution studies use model simulations to estimate natural climatic variability palaeo data would allow comparison of these estimates with the variability of the natural system in order to validate these critical assumptions there is also the exciting possibility of using palaeodata directly in detection and attribution studies this aspect corresponds directly with igcp pages stream 1 research and represents major contribution to the goals deccen and acc components of the world climate research clivar program as well as making an important contribution to the research activities at the hc 2 climate sensitivity this is not defined here as only the integrated model temperature response to given increase in global mean radiative forcing we include the investigation of biological or physical processes which contribute to simulated climate changes in specific periods validated through comparison with palaeo reconstructions this could involve for example the local or largescale vegetation patterns or cryospheric responses to changes in appropriate external forcings this is likely to be most appropriate to studies of specified longer period regimes eg the vegetation changes in the midholocene or the cryospheric and ocean circulation changes at the last glacial maximum 3 carbon cycle the key periods for testing and validation of the climatecarbon cycle model will be the last glacial maximum lgm and the glacialinterglacial transition the lgm represents climate and carbon cycle states which are distinctly different from the present day whilst glacial inception provides information on earth system dynamics and rates of change validation of the model in these periods will require high quality palaeo reconstructions of the forcing factors eg from aerosols and of the climate primarily temperature and precipitation validation of the carbon cycle simulation itself can be based on the atmospheric co2 concentrations recorded in the ice cores but would obviously benefit from any palaeo reconstructions of carbon sources and sinks eg ocean versus land uptake or changes in the frequency of forest fires and also from information on the tightly coupled cycles of other biogeochemical elements eg nitrogen and sulphur 4 rapid and nonlinear climate change models predict rapid changes in global mean temperature during the 21st century comparison of the effects of rapid climate change in past climates could act as surrogate for what may happen during the next century and help to validate some aspects of the model response such as changes in vegetation some models predict as response to global warming large changes in the north atlantic thermohaline circulation and changes in the elniño some of these changes may be of threshold nature ie there is sudden and irreversible transition use of palaeodata to see if such changes have occurred in the past and reconstruct the climate regimes in which they occurred backed up by modelling studies would be of direct benefit the minimum temporal resolution of such reconstructions will be decadal to century results from such studies could be used to inform scientific knowledge of what constitutes dangerous climate change as specified in the framework convention on climate change these four aspects all link into the key science areas identified by nerc under the global change heading natural climate variability including the understanding of past climates as an aid to predicting future climates 1 2 3 and 4 interactions and feedbacks between the components of the climate system 14 the impact of globalchange on biogeochemical cycles 23 and whole ecosystem responses to climate change 2 we identify the following more detailed objectives establish the detailed history of climate forcings eg solar volcanic greenhouse gases atmospheric dust land use changes define the range of climate variability within given regimes eg early or mid holocene last 2000 years establish how different environmental systems respond to this variability during these periods eg thermohaline circulation vegetation changes carbon cycle explore the links and feedbacks between these systems for specific climate and forcing regimes compare the model climate variability with that reconstructed for different regimes on regional and larger spatial scales given appropriate forcings explore whether the model can simulate periods of rapid change compare the magnitude and timing of model responses to specified forcings with those reconstructed in past periods develop methodology and compare the magnitude and rates of predicted future climate and physical and ecosystem responses to those that occurred in past periods within the above themes it will be necessary to coordinate and amalgamate research projects in order to maximise the potential synergy of this undertaking several examples where this might be profitable include the production of highresolution records and contemporary and correlatable records for different environments and geographical areas these will include biological and physical evidence that may be interpreted in terms of climate forcings climate change and variability or in terms of important associated physical or biological processes such as evidence of carbon budgets or biogeochemical processes the construction of palaeodata fields and transects for chosen time periods with special emphasis on model compatibility the assembly of different contemporary detailed sets of model boundary conditions to facilitate model simulations including experiments with isolated submodel processes and interactions the simulation of modelled data equivalent to specific palaeodata eg isotopic compositions in various archives vegetation patterns during specified climate regimes model experiments with specified boundary conditions and forcings to explore the realism roles and interactions of important regional climate systems eg enso nao thermohaline circulation or submodel processes eg climate variability influences on the cryosphere climate and vegetation interactions etc at the outset we envisage stringent criteria for judging the selection priority and support levels for individual submissions concern with mode of climatic andor environmental variability of immediate concern to the detection or prediction of anthropogenic change focus on regions of major relevance to important climatic processes or their sensitivity to change the proposed archives are shown to have the dating and temporal resolution necessary to answer the specific climate questions outlined in other words each proposal should test hypothesis jointly formulated by modellers and climatologists as opposed to merely filling in gridsquares in space and time why thematic programme and why now it is only through the mechanism of an extended thematic programme that we can establish the formal structure needed to coordinate and carry through the research programme we outline involving such large and diverse group of researchers the unprecedented direct involvement of the hadley centre and ugamp on crossdisciplinary and jointnercboard coordinating committee will provide the necessary directional guidance and help define the most desirable joint research projects the programme must provide the means for data and model distribution and ensure genuine interaction between palaeoscientists and modellers it will result in much greater progress in testing the current realisation of the hc climate model and in suggesting future improvements than would arise out of the occasional and uncoordinated initiatives devised by ad hoc associations of individual palaeo and hc scientists this proposal is timely because of the very rapid pace of recent developments in uk and international palaeoscience and the increase in the availability of data relating to holocene climate forcings and high resolution climate variability the time span of the programme corresponds with period during which the hc will undertake major programme of model development during which they will run many important experiments the hc climate model is now the main supported model of ugamp and they help maintain and develop its use by the uk academic community the hc climate model can now feasibly be run or be accessed at multiple locations such as in edinburgh or at ecmwf and the recent addition to these facilities by the procurement of cray t3e at manchester adds another timely aspect to the project in addition sub components of the full model can be run on work stations allowing wide range of researchers to have access to the model it is also already used by several nerc institutes major reason for implementing this programme now is that we stand effectively at the start of several new nerc research board plans and at the start of the highly important wcrp clivar programme and this thematic programme will make big contributions to them relevance to uk and international research priorities the thematic programme will make major contribution to declared uk and international science priorities its aims are consistent with the priorities of all of nercs science and technology boards it would lie at the heart of the nerc strategy for earth science which lists the nature and predictability of climatic and environmental change as primary user need and specifically identifies the need to forecast global and local changes in climate and the environment whether caused naturally or through human activity as prerequisite for the formulation of public policy and industrial and commercial planning moreover high resolution palaeoclimatology and models of climate variability is singled out by estb as priority theme with designated key ingredient stated as identification of key processes of change and their incorporation in time dependent models synthesis of paleoclimatic data for the testing and improvement of climatic models similarly the atmospheric science board identifies the priority issue of climate change due to natural processes and to human activities it recognises the hadley centre model as an example of the central importance of climate model development for useful prediction of climate and under the theme of natural climate change it includes the objective to improve our ability to detect and predict seasonal to decadal scale and longer climate change including palaeoclimate in the context of natural climate variability the priorities of the marine and the terrestrial and freshwater boards also list interactions with climate change and global change and its impacts respectively the proposal is strongly supported by the uk meteorological office and the hadley centre furthermore it also has the endorsement of the uk department of the environment transport and the regions on the international stage the proposal is supported by the igbp pages scientific steering committee the programme aims are fully consistent with the pages implementation plan and are particularly relevant to its pmip images and hihol projects the last of these is new project that will provide stateoftheart synthesis of long highresolution palaeoclimate information for the holocene to be published in 2001 perhaps most significantly the proposed thematic programme sits perfectly within the recently published implementation plan of the wcrp clivar study of climate variability and predictability due to run for 15 years this has 3 main components goals study of seasonaltointerannual climate variability and predictability of the global oceanatmosphereland system deccen study of decadaltocentennial climate variability and predictability and acc modelling and detection of anthropogenic climate change the thematic proposal is fully consistent with each of these clivars ultimate goals of improving the predictive capabilities of gcms and the detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate change reinforce the essential tasks of facilitating the use of palaeoclimate data to test gcms deliverables the major deliverables will be 1 more confidence in the veracity of predictions of 21st century climate change 2 major improvement in our ability to disentangle natural and anthropogenic climate change 3 more confidence in current claims of detection and attribution of human induced climate change through better knowledge and understanding of natural climate variability other deliverables will be methodology for the validation of climate models using palaeodata better constraintvalidation of the subprocess operation and climate output of the most recent hc models an empirical basis for improving the pragmatic definitions of extreme event recurrences under different climate boundary conditions and assessing future recurrence probabilities with practical application in engineering building design agriculture coastal protection etc more coordinated and interactive body of earth and climate model scientists and an increased number of young interdisciplinary researchers with experience of assessing and using palaeodata in climate modelling context training the programme will offer major opportunities for crossdisciplinary cooperation and skill enhancement the range of data to be examined and the dialogue that must be generated between the modelling and palaeodata communities in order that the programmes objectives can be realised will require tasksharing and interfacing across several disciplinary boundaries the uk has huge palaeocommunity but the majority have expertise in modelling nor in generating output in an appropriate format for use by the modelling community there will also need to be carefully constrained approach to the networking and archiving of existing datasets both within the uk and between the uk and international data centres this will give the opportunity to train personnel in the communication and planning skills involved but also those needed to bridge the gap between palaeoclimate researchmodelling and planningpolicy formulation resources and co funding arrangements we propose fiveyear programme with total financial requirement of 8000000 this includes specific annual estimated allocations of approximately 60k pa for direct computing costs approximately 950k pa for direct research staff costs at pdra level spread over model palaeo data collectioninterpretation and palaeomodel data integrationcomparison 400k pa fieldwork equipment travel subsistence ship costs etc 200k pa for coordination scientific interaction and dissemination of results coordinating committee expenses major meetingsworkshops data archive and dissemination organisation of web sites and publications the programme will be organised and resources allocated with respect to three open calls for research proposals the first following major open meeting and publication of the research plan and objectives the second and third calls coming 18 months and 36 months after the first steering committee comprised of palaeoscientists and hc and ugamp representatives will organise and adjudicate over research applications according to the criteria described above the hc have expressed willingness to apply directly to detr for funds to support the work we propose on testing natural variability see 1 of general scientific aims in the research programme section there is potential leverage of the requested resources through researchers involvement in the forthcoming ec framework 5 environment and climate programme and through coordinated collaboration with current ongoing and possible future initiatives such as participation in pages images and odp programmes
