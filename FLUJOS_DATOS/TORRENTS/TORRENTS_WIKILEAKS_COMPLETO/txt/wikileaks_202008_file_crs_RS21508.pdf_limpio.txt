and industry division summary congress has acted to create two special funds to hold the revenue of certain spectrum auctions for speci fic purposes these funds represent departure from existing practice which requires that auction proceeds be credited directly to the treasury as income the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 title iii required the auctioning of li censes for spectrum currently us ed by tv broadcasters for analog transmissions it established the digital television transition and public safety fund to receive this auction revenue and use some of the proceeds for the transition to digital television public safe ty communications and other programs the commercial spectrum enhancement act pl 108494 title ii established spectrum relocation fund to hold the proceeds of certain spec trum auctions for the specific purpose of reimbursing federal entities for the costs of moving to new frequency assignments the spectrum being vacated by federal users has been sold for commercial use passage of the spectrum enhancement act set pr ecedent in national policy for spectrum management by linking spectrum auction proceeds to specific funding programs among bills related to special funds that were introduced during the 110th congress are the spectrum relocation improveme nt act of 2008 hr 7207 inslee the responder act of 2008 s 3465 wicker and the public safety interoperability implementation act hr 3116 stupak background radio frequency spectrum allocation policy within the united states is coordinated primarily through the federal communica tions commission fcc for private use including state and local public safety wireless communications and the national telecommunications and information admin istration ntia for federal use spectrum management goals include balancing diverse concerns such as technical quality economic benefit fair ness access security and global competitiveness many economic models for providing the highest and best use for spectrum exist and have been tried both in the united states and worldwide spectrum for what is widely described ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21508crs2 1 spectrum is segmented into bands of

the congressional budget office has estimated that auction proceed s for fiscal years 20072011 will total 28 billion3 spectrum management and auction proceeds current broadcast and wireless communica tions technology requires the assignment of specific frequencies to prevent interference among transmissions preventing interference while fostering spectrum policies that promote public benefits and economic growth have been key bulwarks of spectru m policy and management for the fcc since its creation using auctions as marketdriven approach to spectrum allocation is fairly recent innovation the communications act of 1934 as modified primarily by the balanced budget act of 1997 governs spect rum allocation and au ction requirements in the united states it directs the fcc to hold auctions and to deposit the proceeds in the general fund of the treasury spectrum po licy that designates auction proceeds for specific uses is depart ure from this requirement whenever spectrum reallocation is desirable or necessary because of changes in technology spectrum value or other factors some mechanism such as trust fund might be considered component of sp ectrum management nd policy in order to compensate organizations that cannot recover costs through pricing on the assumption that spectrum reallocation is an integral part of spectrum management and recognizing that relocation costs can climb to billions of dollars in some sectors the need to create reimbursement programs could be considered pa rt of spectrum policy spectrum relocation fund the purpose of the spectrum relocation f und is to create mechanism whereby federal agencies can recover the costs of m oving from one spectrum band to another the interest in relocating federal users and accelerating the process by assuring reimbursement for the costs of moving centers on valuable spectrum relative to auction prices for comparable spectrum in the united states and other countries now used by federal agencies especially the depa rtment of defense in particular spectrum in bands within the 17101850 mhz range is sought by wireless telecommunications companies to facilitate the implementation of nextgener ation wireless technologies including highspeed mobile services 3g after much study the ntia and the fcc aided by an intragovernment 3g planni ng group announced plans that would transfer spectrum in the 17101755

identified for new legislation that would permit affected federal agencies to recover costs directly from these auction pro ceeds to meet this need in mid2002 the department of commerce proposed the crea tion of spectrum relocation fund this fund could provide means to make it possible for federal agencies to recover relocation costs directly from auction proceeds when they are required to vacate spectrum slated for commercial auction in ffect successful commercial bidders cover the costs of relocation to accomplish the ntia and fcc goals required modification of the communications act of 1934 to permit the agen cies direct access to auction funds this was accomplished with the passage of the commercial spectrum enhancement act title ii of pl 108494 in 2004 among key provisions of the act were requi rements that the auctions must recoup at least 110 of the projected costs4 and that unused funds would revert to the treasury after eight years5 specific frequencies mentione d included not only the 17101755 mhz band but also other federally used frequencies scheduled for reallocation and possible auction6 the communications act of 1934 was th erefore amended to create spectrum relocation fund within the treasury to hold auction proceeds as designated7 the fund is administered by the office of management and budget8 following procedures required by the act the fcc scheduled
