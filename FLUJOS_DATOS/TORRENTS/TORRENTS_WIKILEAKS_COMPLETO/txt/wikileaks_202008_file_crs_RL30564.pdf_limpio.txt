appointments process the president and the senate share the power to appoint the principal officers of the united states5 the constitution article ii section 2 empowers the president to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate appoint the principal officers of the united states three distinct stages mark the appointments process nomination confirmation and appointment in the nomination or first stage the president selects the nominee and sends the nomination to the senate for positions located within state us attorney us marshal and us district judge the president by custom normally nominates an individual recommended by the senator or senators from that state if they are from the same party as the president if neither senator is from the same party the president normally defers to the recommendations of party leaders from the state occasionally the president solicits recommendations from senators from the opposition party when they hold key senate positions before making nomination whether at the state or national level the president must consider how it will fare in the confirmation processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30564crs3 6g calvin mackenzie the politics of presidential appointments new york the free press 1981 pp 97189 7us constitution article ii section 2 clause 3a nomination to position does not give the nominee legal authority to assume the duties and responsibilities of the position that authority comes only after the nominee is confirmed and appointed while awaiting confirmation nominee often is hired as consultant and may act only in an advisory capacity in the confirmation or second stage the senate alone determin whether to approve or disapprove nomination how the senate acts on nomination depends largely on the importance of the position involved the nominees views and existing political circumstances generally the senate is particularly concerned with the nominees views and how he or she is likely to affect public policy6 how closely the nominees personal and professional qualities are examined will normally depend on the importance of the position the nominees possible or likely influence on public policy and the possible or likely effect on constituent interests although the senate confirms most nominations president can safely assume that all of his nominees will be approved routinely rarely however does rejection occur on the senate floor nearly all rejections occur in committee either by committee vote or committee inaction rejections in committee occur for variety of reasons including opposition to the nomination an inadequate amount of time for consideration of the nomination or factors that may have nothing to do with the merits of the nomination the first two stages of the appointment process may be summarized by the observation that while the president proposes the senate disposes in the third or final stage the confirmed nominee is given commission signed by the president with the seal of the united states affixed thereto and is sworn into office at that point he or she has full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the office recess appointments the appointment process also enables the president to make an appointment without the need for it to be confirmed by the senate when that body is in recess either during session intrasession recess appointment or between sessions intersession recess appointment recess appointments expire at the end of the next session of congress7 the president generally submits nomination for regular appointment following recess appointment presidents have occasionally used the recess appointment power to circumvent the confirmation process in response congress has placed certain restrictions on the presidents authority to make recess appointment under 5 usc 5503a if the position to which the president makes recess appointment fell vacant while the senate was in session the appointee may not be paid from the treasury until he or she is confirmed by the senate the salary prohibition does not apply 1 if the vacancy arose within 30 days before the end of the session 2 if nomination for the office other than the nomination of someone given recess appointmen t during thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30564crs4 8pl 105277 division c sec 151 112 stat 2681611 5 usc 33543359dpreceding recess was pending when the senate recessed or 3 if nomination was rejected within 30 days before the end of the session and another individual is given the recess appointment recess appointee falling under any one of these three exceptions must be nominated not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next session of the senate for this reason when recess appointment is made the president generally submits new nomination for the nominee even when an old nomination is pending temporary appointments congress has also provided limited statutory authority for the temporary filling of vacant positions requiring senate confirmation under the federal vacancies reform act of 19988 an advice and consent position in an executive agency that becomes vacant may be filled temporarily in one of three ways 1 the first assistant to such position automatically assumes the functions and duties of the office 2 the president directs an officer in any agency who has been confirmed by the senate to perform those tasks or 3 the president selects any officer or employee of the subject agency who is at least at the gs15 level and who has been with the agency for at least 90 of the preceding 365 days the temporary appointment is for 210 days but the time restriction is suspended if first or second nomination for the position is pending in addition during presidential transition the 210day restriction period does not begin to run until either 90 days after the president assumes office or 90 days after the vacancy occurs whichever is later the act does not apply to positions on multiheaded regulatory boards and commissions and to certain other specific positions which may be filled temporarily under other statutory provisions alphabetical listing of nominees and appointees table 3 lists in
