domestic and foreign reinsurers the insurers of insurance companies absorbed massive losses from the 911 attacks they were also unable to price for future such risks since they did not have historical data on similar attacks and relevant models for such losses did not exist unable to underwrite such risks they withdrew from the market3 once the reinsurers stopped offering coverage for terrorism risk insurers withdrew or tried to withdraw from the market4 terrorism risk insuran ce was soon not available or extremely expensive which hurt the real tate transportation c onstruction energy and

on november 26 2002 and it became effective upon his signature as pl 107297 congressional goals and trias substance congresss stated goals in enacting tria were to 1 establish temporary federal program of shared public and private compensation for insured losses to allow the private market to stabilize 2 protect consumers by addressing market disruptions transparently and by ensuring the availa bility and affo rdability of propertycasualty insurance for terrorism risks and 3 preserve state regulation of insurance15 the easiest way to understand tria is to examine how th act addresses each of these goals to allow time for the private market to stabilize tria established shortterm program for the federal government to share insured commercial propertycasualty losses with the private insurance market the sharing extends from enactment through december 31 200516 insured losses would be shared in four ways first the federal government shares in any insurers losses only if the aggregate insured losses from an act of terrorism exceed 5 million17 second each insurer is responsible for paying out certain amount in claims known as its deductible before it can call upon federal assistance its deductible is di rectly proportionate to its size18 third the federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21444crs4 18 continued each insurers direct earned premium and in 2005 15 ibid sec 1027 p

federal government20 congress charged the secretary of the treasury with certifying an act of terrorism21 and with administering the program22 congress protected consumers by nullifying all commercial terrorism exclusions in force on the date of trias enactment23 tria also requires all propertycasualty insurers as condition of receiving federal assistance for terrorism losses to make terrorism insurance available prospectively to their commercial policyholders in disclosure required to be made by february 24 200324 this make available requirement is to be in effect until the nd of 2004 with the secretary of the treasury having the authority to extend it until the end of 2005 the proffe red coverage may not differ materially from the rms amounts and other cove rage limitations applicable to coverage for other types of losses25 the disclosure must be clear and conspicuous and it must reveal both the premium charged for terrorism insurance and the federal share of compensation26 tria in effect gave policyhol ders coverage for terrorism risk immediately without charge for the peri od until the policyholder accepted or declined the coverage tria required insurers to offer27 the policyholder is not however required to purchase the coverage if the policyholder declines the insurance its insurer may reinstate an exclusi on for terrorism losses28 tria did not limit what insurers could charge for terrorism risk insurance though it did give state regulators the authority to curtail excessive inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates29httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21444crs5 30

state regulation of insurance30 section 106 of the act does so expressly with some exceptions one exception is the definition of an act of terrorism trias definition applies notwithstanding any definition in state law31 second exception is trias limited preemp tion of state rate and form filing requirements32 tria preempts all prior appr ovals through december 31 2003 though it does allow any state to invalidate an excessive or discriminatory rate33 and any state with prior approval authority to review policy forms after their use34 this means that states retain considerable authority over rates and terms for terrorism coverage third exception to state regulation of insurance is trias requirement that all workers compensation coverage include not only coverage for terrorism risk but also for war risk35 finally tria also accomplishes this third goal of preserving state regulation of insurance by directing the treasury secretary to consult with the national association of insurance commissioners naic36 on several implementati on issues these include treatment of captive insurers37 studies required by the act38 and access to information about rates39 other important tria provisions as enacted hr 3210 followed the senate provisions on liability reform section 107 of tria requires any legal action for pr operty damage personal injury and death resulting from any

satisfaction of judgments from blocked assets of terrorists terrorist organizations and state sponsors of terrorism for purposes of this title the definition of an act of terrorism is broader than

circumstances when action is necessary to prevent correct or mitigate serious harm to the economy or the stab ility of the financial system of the united states 45 congress directed the secret ary of the treasury to conduct an expedited study of whether the program should be extended to providers of group life insurance and depending on the results of the study to apply the prog ram appropriately46 it also directed the secretary to study the potential effects of acts of terrorism on the availability of life insurance and other lines of insu rance coverage including personal lines47 congress directed the secretary to report the results of the latter study by late august 200348 final study is due from the secretary to congress by june 30 2005 on the effectiveness of the
