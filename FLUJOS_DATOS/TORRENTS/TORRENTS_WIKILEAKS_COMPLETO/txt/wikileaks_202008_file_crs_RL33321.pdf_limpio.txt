vested in various administrative agencies to compel testimony or the production of documents or both in aid of the agencies performance of their duties administrative subpoenas are not traditional tool of criminal law investigation but neither are they unknown several statutes at least arguably authorize the use of administrative subpoenas primarily or exclusively for use in criminal investigation in cases involving health care fraud child abuse secret service protection controlled substance cases and inspector general investigations as constitutional matter the fourth amendment only demands that administrative subpoenas be reasonable standard that requires that 1 they satisfy the terms of the authorizing statute 2 the documents requested are relevant to the investigation 3 the information sought is not already in the governments possession and 4 enforcing the subpoena will not constitute an abuse of the courts process although more extensive proposals were offered in the 108 th congress the law enforcement related administrative subpoena proposals in the 109th congress appear in s 600 relating to the secretary of states responsibilities to protect us foreign

subpoena authority is the power vested in various administrative agencies to compel testimony or the production of documents or both in aid of the agencies performance of their duties during the 108th congress the president urged congress to expand and reenforce statutory authority to use administrative subpoenas in criminal and legislation was introduced for that purpose1 modest proposals have been offered during the 109th congress2 proponents of the expanded use administrative subpoenas emphasize their effectiveness as an investigative tool and question the logic of their availability in drug and health care fraud cases but not in terrorism cases3 critics suggest that it is little more than constitutionally suspect trophy power easily abused and of little legitimate use4 more precisely it might be said in favor of the use of administrative subpoenas in criminal investigations that they provide timehonored courtapproved means for agencies to acquire information in order to make well informed decisions5 should be available for terrorism investigations6 do not ordinarily require probable cause and consequently can be used from the beginning of an inquiry to gather information7 1 congress should change the law and give law enforcement officials the same tools they have to fight terror they have to fight other crime heres some examples administrative subpoenas which enable law enforcement officials to obtain certain records quickly are critical to many investigations theyre used in wide range of criminal and civil matters including health care fraud and child abuse cases ye t incredibly enough in terrorism cases where speed is often of the essence officials lack the authority to use administrative subpoenas if we can use these subpoenas to catch crooked doctors the congress should allow law enforcement officials to use them to catch terrorists president george w bush progress report on the global war on terrorism sept 10 2003 available at

than the target of an inquiry8 often can encourage the cooperation of third parties by providing immunity for cooperation similar to that available in judicial context9 often can make third parties subject to nondisclosure requirements thereby reducing the possibility that the target of an investigation will flee destroy evidence or intimidate witnesses or the risks to national security10 can be made judicially enforceable both to ensure compliance and to safeguard against abuse11 are less intrusive than search warrants material is gathered and delivered by the individual rather than seized by the government there is ordinarily an interval between the time of service of the subpoena and the time for compliance allowing parties to consult an attorney12 can be more easily and quickly used than grand jury subpoenas but are otherwise similar13 and are now available for investigations relating to some crimes and there is obvious reason why they should not be available for other equally serious criminal investigations14 on the other hand it might be said that in the context of criminal or foreign intelligence investigation that administrative subpoenas are more likely to lead to unjustified intrusions of privacy15 in terrorism cases seem to replicate and expand existing national security letter authority without an explanation as to why additional authority is needed16 lack the judicial safeguards that accompany the issuance of search warrant probable cause and issuance by neutral magistrate among other things17 continued 7 oklahoma press publishing co v walling 327 us

grand jury subpoena in that they ordinarily are not subject to motion to quash or to the necessary participation of an assistant united states attorney18 are distinguishable from grand jury subpoenas by the simple fact that the extensive powers available to the grand jury are justified in part by the fact that the grand jury is not the government but buffer against the abuse of governmental authority19 can be extremely expensive and disruptive for the person or entity to whom they are addressed long before the thresholds of overbreadth or oppression the point at which subpoena will not be enforced are reached20 are subject to easy abuse when they are issued against third parties who may have little interest in contesting their legitimacy21 are subject to easy abuse when they are issued against third parties who are granted immunity from civil liability for the disclosures22 are subject to easy abuse when they are issued against third parties who are subject to permanent gag orders precluding disclosure to targets who might otherwise contest the abuse23 and are sought for their speed24 an environment in which mistakes often breed25 g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 administrative subpoenas are not traditional tool of criminal law investigation but neither are they unknown administrative subpoenas and criminal law overlap in at least four areas first under some administrative regimes it is crime to fail to comply with an agency subpoena or with court order secured to enforce it second most administrative schemes are subject to criminal prohibitions for programrelated misconduct of one kind or another such as bribery or false statements or for flagrant recalcitrance of those subject to regulatory direction in this mix agency subpoenas usually produce the grist for the administrative mill but occasionally unearth evidence that forms the basis for referral to the department of justice for criminal prosecution third in an increasing number of situations administrative subpoenas may be used for purposes of conducting criminal investigation finally particularly in the context of subpoenas used for criminal investigative purposes involving intellig ence matters disclosure of the existence of subpoena may be criminal offense 18 eg senate hearings i prepared statement of former united

have power to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all books papers tariffs contracts agreements and documents relating to any matter under investigation and to that

for denial of license or permit or some similar adverse administrative decision in the matter to which the issuance of the subpoena was originally related in most instances however administrative agencies ultimately rely upon the courts to enforce their subpoenas generally the statute that grants the subpoena power will spell out the procedure for its enforcement37 objections to the enforcement of administrative subpoenas must be derived from one of three sources constitutional provision an understanding on the part of congress or the general standards governing judicial enforcement of administrative subpoenas sec v jerry t obrien inc 467 us 735 74142 1984 constitutional challenges arise most often under the fourth amendments condemnation of unreasonable searches and seizures38 the fifth amendments privilege against selfincrimination39 or the claim that in criminal context the administrative subpoena process is an intrusion into the power of the grand jury and the concomitant right to grand jury indictment40 in an early examination of the questions the supreme court held that the fourth amendment did not preclude enforcement of an administrative subpoena issued by the wage and hour administration notwithstanding the want of probable cause oklahoma press pubco v walling 327 us 186 1946 in the eyes of the court the short answer to the fourth amendment objections is that the records in these cases present question of actual search and seizure but raise only the question whether orders of the court for the production of specified reco rds have been validly made and sufficient showing appears to justifying setting them aside officer or other person has sought to enter petitioners premises against their will to search them or to seize or examine their books records or papers without their assent otherwise than pursuant to orders of court authorized by law and made after adequate opportunity to present objections which in were made nor has any objection been taken to the breadth of the subpoenas or to any other specific defect which might invalidate them 327 us at 1975 neither the fourth amendment nor the unclaimed fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination were thought to pose any substantial obstacle to subpoena enforcement continued usc 1681 et seq and the family educational rights and privacy act 20 usc 1232g 37 eg 7 usc 15

the cases the fair distillation in so far as they apply merely to the production of corporate records and papers in response to subpoena or order authorized by law and safeguarded by judicial sanction seems to be that the fifth amendment affords protection by virtue of the self incrimination provision whether for the corporation or for its officers and the fourth if applicable at the most guards against abuse only by way of too much indefiniteness or breadth in the things required to be particularly described if also the inquiry is one the demanding agency is authorized by law to make and the materials specified are relevant the gist of the protection is in the requirement expressed in terms that the disclosure sought shall not be unreasonable 327 us at 208 congress had not expressly confined the wage and hour administrations subpoena power to instances where probable cause for inquiry existed moreover far from taking offense at any perceived intrusion upon the prerogatives of the grand jury proximity was thought to commend rather than condemn the procedure the court considered the administration akin to the grand jury whose searches endrather than beginwith the discovery of probable cause 327 us at 215 the result therefore sustains the administrators position that his investigative function in searching out violations with view to securing enforcement of the act is essentially the same as the grand jurys and is governed by the same limitations these are that he shall not act arbitrarily or in excess of his statutory authority but this does not mean that his inquiry must be limited by forecasts of the probable result of the investigation few years later dicta in united states v morton salt co 338 us 632 65253 1950 echoed the same messagethe fourth amendment does not demand great deal of administrative subpoenas addressed to corporate entities governmental investigation into corporate matters may be of such sweeping nature and so unrelated to the matter properly under inquiry as to exceed the investigatory power but it is sufficient if the inquiry is within the authority of agency the demand is not too indefinite and the information sought is reasonably relevant the gist of the protection is in the requirement expressed in terms that the disclosure sought shall not be unreasonable 41 of course fourth amendment reasonableness is only an issue where there is justifiable expectation of privacy and fifth amendment selfincrimination only where an individual is compelled to speak as the court made clear an individual can claim neither fourth nor fifth amendment privileges to bar subpoena for documents held by bank or other third party nor to right to notice of the subpoenas demand 42 41 in morton salt co the government had sought an injunction to enforce compliance with federal trade commission cease and desist order and the company had interposed fourth amendment objection the opinion may be colored by the courts view at the time of the limited fourth amendment rights available to corporate entities while they may and should have protection from unlawful demands made in the name of public investigation corporations can claim equality with individuals in the enjoyment of right to privacy they are endowed with public attributes they have collective impact upon society from which they derive the privilege of acting as artificial entities the federal government allows them the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce favors from government often carry with them an enhanced measure of regulation even if one were to regard the request for information in this case as caused by nothing more than official curiosity nevertheless law enforcing agencies have legitimate right to satisfy themselves that corporate behavior is consistent with the law and public interest 327 us at 652 42 sec v jerry t obrien inc 467 us at 74243 person inculpated by materials sought by subpoena issued to third party cannot seek

may require what the constitution does not nevertheless when asked if the internal revenue service irs must have probable cause before issuing summons for the production of documents the court intoned the standard often repeated in response to an administrative subpoena challenge reading the statutes as we do the commissioner need not meet any standard of probable cause to obtain enforcement of his summons he must show 1 that the investigation will be conducted pursuant to legitimate purpose 2 that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose 3 that the information sought is not already within the commissioners possession and 4 that the administrative steps required by the code have been followed this does not mean that under circumstances may the court inquire into the underlying reason for the examination it is th courts process which is invoked to enforce the administrative summons and court may not permit its process to be abused united states v powell 379 us 48 578 1964 43 the lower

to allow target to prevent an unconstitutional search or seizure of his papers 43 in the irs context the courts process was not necessarily abused when employed to enforce an administrative summons

debate find support in the law that surrounds the grand jury proponents of the use of administrative subpoenas in criminal cases point out that the courts have often analogized the administrative inquiry and subpoena power to the inquiries and powers of the grand jury opponents contend the grand jurys powers depend upon its unique and independent constitutional status foundation the

attorneys who through the use of subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum arrange for the presentation of evidence before it unlike the search warrant there is threshold of probable cause or similar level of suspicion that must be crossed before the grand jury subpoena can be issued the grand jury can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated or even because it wants assurance that it is not it need not identify the offender it suspects or even the precise nature of the offense it is investigating united states v williams 504 us at 48 its proceedings are conducted in secret and

power upon which the grand jury relies however is the process of the court and may be enforced only through the good offices of the court and the court will refuse to lend its assistance when the compulsion the grand jury seeks would override rights accorded by the constitution or even testimonial privileges recognized at common law united states v williams 504 us at 48 subpoena is generally considered less intrusive than warrant the warrant authorizes an officer to enter search for and seize forcibly if necessary at reasonable time of the officers choosing that property to which the officer understands the warrant refers the subpoena duces tecum instructs the individual to gather up the items described at his relative convenience and bring them before the tribunal at some designated time in the future the validity of warrant may only be contested after the fact motion to quash subpoena can ordinarily be filed and heard before compliance is required there are at least two relatively uncommon exceptions to this general scheme of disparity first subpoena may order forthwith compliance demanding immediate appearance and delivery 45 45 forthwith subpoena is subpoena directing the person to whom it is addressed to appear immediately either to testify or bring subpoenaed items with him eg united states v triumph capital group inc 211 frd 31 dconn 2002 in re grand

provision is just as general as its controlled substance counterpart each inspector general in carrying out the provisions this act is authorized to require by subpoena the production of all information necessary in the performance of the functions assigned by this act 5 uscappiii 6a4 its legislative history supplies somewhat clearer evidence of an investigative tool intended for use in both administrative and criminal investigations subpoena power is absolutely essential to the discharge of the inspector and auditor generals functions there are literally thousands of institutions in the country which are somehow involved in the receipt of funds from federal programs without the power necessary to conduct comprehensive audit of these entities the inspector and auditor general could have serious impact on the way federal funds are expended the committee does not believe that the inspector and auditor general will have to resort very often to the use of subpoenas there are substantial incentives for institutions that are involved with the federal government to comply with requests by an inspector and auditor general in any case however knowing that the inspector and auditor general has recourse to subpoena power should encourage prompt and thorough cooperation with his audits and investigations the committee intends of course that the inspector and auditor general will use this subpoena power in the performance of is statutory functions the use of subpoena power to obtain information for another agency component which does not have such power would clearly be improper the committee recognizes that there is substantial ongoing dispute about the propriety of socalled third party subpoenas ie subpoenaing records of an individual which are in the hands of an institution such as bank since us v miller 425 us 435 1976 individuals have been regarded as having protectable right of property with respect to their bank records law enforcement agency can obtain such records from bank without any showing of cause to neutral magistrate or any notice to the individual involved the committee notes that progress has been made on legislation concerning financial privacy which would require notice to be given to an individual whose bank records are being obtained by law enforcement agency hopefully this progress will lead to legislation of general applicability to all law enforcement authorities including inspector and auditor generals srept 951071 at 34 1978footnote 7 of the committee report in brackets 48 united states v phibbs 999 f2d 1053

unlike its companions there can be little doubt that 18 usc 3486 is intended for use primarily in connection with criminal investigations section 3486 is an amalgam of three relative recent statutory provisionsone the original dealing w ith health care fraud one with child abuse offenses and one with threats against the president and others who fall under secret service protection the health care fraud provision comes from the health insurance portability and accountability act 110 stat 2018 1996 where it caused little comment during consideration of the act 54 the child abuse subpoenas on the other hand generated some illuminating commentary enacted as part of the protection of children from sexual predators act 112 stat2984985 1998 and originally codified as 18 usc 3486a the subpoena provision represented compromise the house version authorized the general subpoena power for use in the investigation of five federal child abuse offenses 55 the version that ultimately passed however encompassed wider range of federal child abuse statutes but only permitted subpoenas for the records of internet and telephone communications providers senator leahy the ranking member of the senate judiciary committee explained this portion of the compromise during debate on the bill the house bill would have given the attorney general sweeping administrative authority to subpoena records and witnesses for investigations involving crimes against children this proposed authority to issue administrative subpoenas would have given federal agents the power to compel disclosures without any oversight by judge prosecutor or grand jury and without any of the grand jury secrecy requirements we appreciate that such secrecy requirements may pose obstacles to full and efficient cooperation of

health care fraud and child abuse cases were merged into the language of general authority now found in section 3486 and section 3486a disappeared 114 stat 2717 2000 in the process the demise of the compromise was scarcely mentioned 57 but its legacy may live on in the form of the greater detail found in the revamped section 3486 section 3486 is both more explicit and more explicitly protective than either of its controlled substance or ig statutory counterparts in addition to judicial enforcement provision58 it specifically authorizes motions to quash 18 usc 3486a5 and ex parte

less than 24 hours after service of the subpoena it is unclear whether administrative subpoenas in health care cases are exempted from the general rule or the exception administrative subpoenas in health care cases are not authorized to require production as soon as possible or administrative subpoenas in health care cases may require immediate production without regard to the 24 hour limitation that applies in child abuse and presidential protection cases the safer assumption is probably that the authority is unavailable in health care in vestigations since the authority is extr aordinary and the need for prompt action seems likely to arise more often in child abuse and presidential protection cases

investigations limits further dissemination of the information secured 18 usc 3486e although the authority of section 3486 has been used fairly extensively62 reported case law has been relatively sparse and limited to health care investigation subpoenas the first of these simply held that the subject of record subpoenaed from third party custodian has standing to move that the administrative subpoena be quashed63 the others addressed constitutional challenges and with one relatively narrow exception agreed that the subpoenas in question complied with the demands of the fourth amendment they cite oklahoma press powell and morton salt for the view that administrative subpoenas under section 3486 need not satisfy probable cause standard64 the fourth amendment only demands that the subpoena be reasonable standard that requires that 1 it satisfies the terms of its authorizing statute 2 the documents requested were relevant to the dojs investigation 3 the information sought is not

use of administrative subpoenas during criminal investigation section 3486 is the most detailed neither of the others has nondisclosure feature nor restriction on further dissemination neither has an explicit safe harbor provision nor an express procedure for motion to quash all three however provide for judicial enforcement reenforced by the contempt power of the court only the controlled

federal crime of terrorism is any of over 40 violent federal crimes when committed in manner calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion or to retaliate against government conduct 18 usc2332bg5 the house bill would have granted authority for both testimonial subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum the grant in the senate bill much like 18 usc 3486 was to be limited to materials and custodial testimony authenticating the material subpoenaed 71 the position represented something of middle ground between the controlled substance provision in 21 usc 876 which authorizes testimonial subpoenas generally and the inspector general provision in 5 uscappiii 6 which authorizes only subpoenas duces tecum the bills were otherwise substantively identical both would have established nondisclosure requirement upon the attorney generals certification that national security might otherwise be imperiled72 this differs substantially from the approach taken in 18 usc 3486 the only section of the three criminal administrative subpoena sections that has nondisclosure component section 3486 permits the court rather than the attorney general to issue the nondisclosure order upon showing that disclosure would result in flight destruction of evidence witness intimidation or the risk of bodily injury rather than the attorney generals national security determination 18 usc 3486a673 moreover the orders under section 3486 are only good for 90 days unless the court renews them at 90 day intervals upon showing that the exigent circumstances which justified their original issuance continue to exist rather than an indefinite and potentially permanent tenure at the discretion of the attorney general id finally the bills would have permitted officials to disclose related matters to the media or congress but do not afford witnesses similar privilege without the approval of the attorney general74 witness for the department of justice

quickly as possible administrative subpoenas are one tool that will enable investigators to avoid costly delays an administrative subpoena is an order from government official to third party instructing the recipient to produce certain in formation because the subpoena is issued directly by an agency official it can be issued as quickly as the development of an investigation requires administrative subpoenas are wellestablished investigative tool currently available in wide range of civil and criminal investigations 2002 study by the office of legal policy identified approximately 335 administrative subpoena authorities existing in current law these authorities allow the use of administrative subpoenas in investigations of wide variety of federal offenses such as healthcare fraud sexual abuse of children threats against the president and others under secret service protection and false claims against the united states administrative subpoenas are not however currently available to the fbi for use in terrorism investigations this disparity in the law is illogical especially considering the particular need for quick action in terrorism investigations and the potential catastrophic consequences of terrorist attack in terrorism cases where speed is often of the essence officials lack the authority to use administrative subpoenas if we can use these subpoenas to catch crooked doctors the congress should allow law enforcement officials to use them in catching terrorists although grand jury subpoenas are sufficient tool in many investigations there are circumstances in which an administrative subpoena would save precious minutes or hours in terrorism investigation for example the ability to use an administrative subpoena will eliminate delays caused by factors such as the unavailability of an assistant united states attorney to immediately issue grandjury subpoena especially in rural areas the time it takes to contact an assistant united states ttorney in the context of timesensitive investigation the lack of grand jury sitting at the moment the documents are needed under federal law the return date for grand jury subpoena must be day the grand jury is sitting or the absence of an empaneled grand jury in the judicial district where the investigation is taking place rare circumstance that would prevent grand jury subpoena form being issued at all senate hearings i prepared statement of united states principal deputy assistant attorney general rachel brand see also senate hearings ii prepared statement of barry sabin chief of the counterterrorism section of the criminal division united states department of justice not all of the congressional witnesses spoke as highly of the proposals at least one voiced concerns about its potential for abuse over the years congress has been reluctant to expand the powers of criminal law enforcement agents to interfere with the liber ty and privacy rights of american citizens through administrative subpoenas used exclusively to conduct criminal investigations while congress has authorized administrative subpoenas in variety of civiland some criminalcontexts the use of such subpoenas for criminal investigations raises host of constitutional and policy issues not present in civil administrative matters to my knowledge congress has never authorized the creation of potentially secret executive branch police proceeding of the type contemplat ed by these proposals the benefit to law enforcement of granting this power must be carefully balanced against the potential loss of liberty involved with limited exceptions absent judicial process such as search warrant grand jury subpoena or trial subpoena american citizens have always had the right to decline to answer questions put to them by the police or to deliver their documents without search warrant
