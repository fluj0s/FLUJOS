homeland security financial accountability act history and recent developments summary prior to the enactment of the department of homeland security dhs financial accountability act pl 108330 the dhs was the only federal cabinet department not included under the chief financial officers cfo act of 1990 dhs had cfo but the position was not subject to senate confirmation in the 108th congress s 1567 to bring dhs under the cfo act passed the senate on november 21 2003 and related bill hr 4259 was approved by the house on july 20 2004 supporters of the dhs financial accountability act contended that the cfo act and related laws should apply consistently across the executive branch and that the unequal status initially accorded the cfo in dhs denigrated the cfo position and the importance of financial management in dhs proponents also argued that the cfo position with its fiduciary responsibilities carries with it special needs for accountability which senate confirmation reinforces on the other hand at the beginning of the 108th congress the bush administration continued to oppose bringing the dhs cfo under the cfo act on grounds of special managerial principles for the new dhs and subsequently from the rationale of reducing the number of positions subject to senate confirmation by the summer of 2004 however the administrations opposition to the legislation appeared to have lessened on september 29 2004 under unanimous consent in the senate hr 4259 was discharged from the governmental affairs committee and the bill was then passed the department of homeland security financial accountability act was signed into law on october 16 2004 pl 108330 as enacted hr 4259 brings the cfo in dhs directly under the cfo act as amended the new law also serves to bring dhs under the government management reform act of 1994 and the federal financial management improvement act of 1996 and makes the cfo in dhs statutory member of the chief financial officers council there is dual reporting framework for the cfo in dhs to the head of the department as in all the other cfo act agencies and concurrently to the under secretary for management the prior arrangement for the cfo in dhs the measure requires an audit of internal controls over financial reporting in dhs after fy2005 hr 4259 as enacted creates an office of program analysis and evaluation within dhs requires dhs to prepare future years program and security strategy report for congress and requires joint study by the cfo council and the presidents council on integrity and efficiency pcie of the costs and benefits of having all cfo agencies obtain audit opinions of their internal controls finally the new law requires that specified dhs authorizing committees receive notification 15 days in advance of

financial officers cfo act of 19901 sought to improve financial management practices by establishing new leadership structure for federal financial management2 the framework created by the law included two new positions within the office of management and budget and 23 chief financial officers cfo and deputy cfos in major executive departments and agencies3 of the 23 cfo positions 16 were filled by presidential appointees as confirmed by the senate cfo positions subject to confirmation included those in the 14 cabinetlevel departments excluding the department of homeland security or dhs the environmental protection agency and the national aeronautics and space administration the remaining seven cfo positions for the agency for international development general services administration national science foundation nuclear regulatory commission office of personnel management small business administration and social security administration along with all 23 deputy cfo positions were career positions filled by agency head appointment the homeland security act of 2002 provided for cfo position in the new department4 unlike the appointment procedure for cfos in other cabinetlevel departments however the cfo in the department of homeland security was appointed by the president but not subject to senate confirmation with respect to specific duties and responsibilities of the cfo for dhs section 103e performance of specific functions stated subject to the provisions of this act every officer of the department the cfo included shall perform the

when the social security administration was established as an independent agency pursuant to the social security independence and program improvements act of 1994 108 stat 1467 an additional cfo position was created bringing the total to 24 when the department of homeland security was created the federal emergency management agency fema was merged into it along with femas cfo position

prescribed by the secretary5 the law made reference to the cfo act or to chapter 9 of title 31 in addition unlike all the other cfos who report directly to the agency head the cfo for dhs might report to the secretary or to another official of the department as the secretary may direct 6 although the act establishing dhs did not place the new cfo position under chapter 9 of title 31 the issue was addressed in both chambers during consideration of the legislation in the 107th congress in the senate the initial measure to create dhs s 2452 in the 107th congress as approved by the governmental affairs committee in may 2002 did not include requirement that the new department be subject to the cfo act likewise in june 2002 when another bill to create dhs hr 5005 in the 107th congress was introduced in the house the requirement was absent as debate concerning specific provisions in the measures continued into the summer there were efforts to establish linkage to the cfo act for the proposed cfo position in dhs the senate governmental affairs committee adopted substitute amendment to s 2452 on july 25 2002 offered by thenchairman joseph lieberman that would have made the department of homeland security subject to the cfo act also in july 2002 representative stephen horn offered similar amendment during the house government reforms consideration of hr 5005 which the committee approved7 hr 5005 as passed by the house on july 25 2002 contained in section 911 conforming and technical amendments to chapter 9 of 31 usc to add dhs to the list of agencies covered by the cfo act initial developments in the 108th congress on march 1 2003 the department of homeland security became the 15th department in the federal government when 22 separate agencies were merged into the new entity some of the agencies transferred to dhs came with known serious financial management problems for example four of the major agencies transferred the immigration and naturalization service transportation security administration customs service and federal emergency management agency had total of 18 material weaknesses in internal control reported by auditors for fy20028 following establishment of dhs awareness grew of the linkages between the cfo act and other laws enacted as amendments to it since the cfo in dhs was not formally under the cfo act dhs was not covered

cfo in dhs was not statutory member of the council in summer 2003 legislation was introduced with bipartisan support relating to the status of the cfo in dhs on july 24 representative todd platts chair of the subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management introduced hr 2886 the department of homeland security financial accountability act cosponsors included the vice chair and ranking member of the subcommittee and the chair and ranking member of the committee on government reform in introducing the bill representative platts noted that provisions in hr 2886 would put the cfo in dhs on the same footing as the cfos at the rest of the cabinetlevel departments by ensuring that the departments cfo is presidential appointee subject to senate confirmation that the cfo reports directly to the secretary and that the cfo is part of the statutorily created cfo council9 companion bill s 1567 was introduced by senator peter fitzgerald chair of the subcommittee on financial management the budget and international security on august 1 2003 with the subcommittees ranking member as cosponsor senator fitzgerald noted that while dhs secretary tom ridge had testified that the department would make every effort to adhere to provisions of the cfo act as amended passage of s 1567 will ensure that future secretaries and future administrations also will comply with the cfo act10 senate action on october 22 2003 the governmental affairs committee met to consider s 1567 and adopted by voice vote an amendment in the nature of substitute and then ordered the amended bill to be reported to the full senate11 the bill was reported on november 20 2003 and passed the senate by unanimous consent the following day12 9 rep todd platts introducing the department of

security financial accountability act vote in the senate continued crs4 written report was filed on november 25 200313 in discussing s 1567 the report stated application of the cfo act to the department of homeland security is essential to ensure that the newest and one of the largest cabinetlevel departments in the federal government adheres to the same financial management reporting requirements and standards that other agencies must follow and that were developed over more than decade in addition to the cfo requirements the senate bill would have required dhs to produce audit opinions on internal controls for financial reporting this goes beyond current guidance in omb bulletin 0102 for agencies simply to obtain testing and report on internal controls according to the report such requirement for an audit opinion will provide assurances that the departments internal controls are effective in deterring fraudulent financial reporting protecting assets and providing an early warning of significant control weaknesses14 subsequent house action in 2003 the legislative history of hr 2886 in the house was more complex since the bill was jointly referred and two committees became involved the committee on government reform and the select committee on homeland security on september 10 2003 the subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management held hearing on developing sound business practices at the department of homeland security testimony was received from omb gao and dhs15 on september 24 2003 the subcommittee voted to report hr 2886 to the full committee after adopting an amendment in the nature of substitute offered by subcommittee chair platts unanimously by voice vote the platts substitute modified dates in the original bill by delaying the requirement for dhs to obtain an audit opinion on its internal controls until fy2005 and moving up the preparation and audit of dhss first financial statements to fy2003 by removing an extension waiver provision the third change in the substitute version entailed new requirement that the cfo council and the presidents council on integrity and efficiency undertake joint study assessing potential costs and benefits if all of the cfo agencies were required to obtain audit opinions of their internal controls on october 8 2003 the select committee on homeland security held hearing on review of homeland securitys financial accountability and performance evaluation process to examine waste fraud and abuse and received testimony from dhs omb and private sector witnesses16 on october 30 2003 the select committee voted to report hr 2886 favorably after agreeing to substitute amendment offered by chairman cox both actions were taken unanimously by 12 continued

reporting requirement for dhs secretary to submit to congress an annual comprehensive report on us homeland security strategy creation of new office of program analysis and evaluation within dhs to link financial management and budgeting with program analysis and evaluation and modeled on the system currently utilized by the department of defense notice of appropriations reprogramming actions to include the house select committee on homeland security and the senate committee on government affairs17 arrangement whereby the cfo in dhs would report to the secretary regarding financial management matters and to the under secretary for management regarding other responsibilities of the cfo the select committee filed written report to accompany hr 2886 on november 12 2003 with respect to background and need for the legislation the report stated in part hr 2886 is needed to ensure that the newlycreated department of homeland security dhs implements and adheres to number of sound financial management planning and budgeting practices18 17 reprogramming entails the shifting of funds from one purpose to another within an appropriations account during the implementation phase of the federal budget process unlike transfer of funds which involves shifting of budgetary resources from one appropriations account to another reprogramming does not require statutory authorization in an effort to facilitate congressional oversight of reprogramming actions appropriations subcommittees and sometimes authorizing committees as well may establish rules and procedures for reprogramming typically such guidelines involve formal agency notification to stipulated congressional committees prior to implementing the reprogramming and are included in committee reports accompanying appropriations bills less commonly reprogramming procedures may be incorporated in statutory language as is the case for dhs the department of homeland security appropriations act 2004 requires that the house and senate appropriations committees be notified 15 days in advance of certain reprogramming actions pl 10890 sec 503 117 stat 115253 one of the provisions added to hr 2886 during markup by the select committee on homeland security would extend the requirement of notification to include the select committee along with the senate governmental affairs committee hr 4259 added the house government reform committee to the list 18 us congress house select committee on homeland security department of homeland security financial accountability act report to accompany hr 2886 108th cong 1st sess continued crs6 meanwhile on november 6 2003 the government reform committee voted to report hr 2886 as amended favorably the voice vote was unanimous at markup the full committee considered the version of the bill as marked up at the government efficiency subcommittee absent the additional changes resulting from markup by the select committee19 house action in 2004 on may 4 2004 representative platts introduced hr 4259 bill representing revised version of the dhs financial accountability act to supersede hr 2886 the new bill characterized as consensus measure was cosponsored by the vice chair and ranking member of the subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management and by the chairs and ranking members of the government reform committee and select committee on homeland security administrative concerns apparently prompted this action since both government reform and homeland security reported hr 2886 favorably in the fall of 2003 but with differing amendments it was just cleaner to introduce new bill committee staff member explained20 on may 6 2004 the government reform committee reported hr 4259 favorably by voice vote21 the ranking democrat on the full committee representative henry waxman characterized the legislation as the product of serious productive conversation that includes compromises from all sides22 hr 4259 was also referred to the select committee on homeland security but on may 19 2004 the chair waived further consideration of the bill by the select committee23 the four major additions to hr 2886 as reported by the select committee were retained in the new measure on july 20 2004 hr 4259 passed the house under suspension of the rules24 representative platts commended dhs for its efforts in being fiscally responsible

necessary according to representative platts in order to ensure dhs compliance with provisions in the cfo act as amended in the future25 representative towns the ranking member of the government efficiency subcommittee likewise urged passage of hr 4259 noting in concluding his remarks this is necessary step forward if we are to develop an efficient and effective agency that is ready to achieve its purposes of protecting our citizens infrastructure and borders26 hr 4259 subsequently enacted as pl 108330 sought to amend chapter 9 of 31 usc to bring dhs under the cfo act and subsequent amendments such as ffmia the cfo for dhs would be appointed by the president subject to senate confirmation and would serve as member of the cfo council hr 4259 would require dhs to obtain annual audit opinions on its internal controls over financial reporting after fy200527 the report from the government reform committee accompanying hr 4259 noted the importance of the requirement for an opinion level audit of dhs internal controls currently audit guidance from omb requires report on internal controls in conjunction with annual financial audits having an auditor issue an opinion on the internal controls report would help uncover inherent weaknesses and address problems as business practices are being established before they become ingrained strong internal controls are essential to sound management28 an important modification in hr 4259 from s 1567 and the earlier house bill as reported by the government reform committee in 2003 was dual reporting structure for the dhs cfo who would report both to the dhs secretary akin to other cabinetlevel cfos and concurrently to the under secretary for management the arrangement for the cfo in dhs prior to enactment of pl 108330 hr 4259 also would create an office of program analysis and evaluation within dhs and would require dhs to prepare future years program and security strategy report for congress further the housepassed bill would require the chief financial officers council and the pcie jointly to conduct study of the costs and benefits of having all cfo agencies obtain audit opinions of their internal controls finally hr 4259 would require that the house government reform committee the senate governmental affairs committee and the homeland security select committee receive notification 15 days in advance of transfer and reprogramming actions29 25 rep todd platts ibid p h6073 26 rep edolphus towns ibid h6074 27 currently cfo act agencies undergo annual audits of their financial statements but are not required to have formal audit opinions of their internal controls 28 hrept 108533 part 1 p 2 29 previous language originating in the markup by the select committee which extended the requirement for reprogramming notification to two of the authorizing committees did not include the house government reform committee crs8 other considerations the senate version of the dhs financial accountability act s 1567 passed the senate on november 21 2003 and related bill hr 4259 was approved by the house on july 20 2004 the legislation appeared to enjoy considerable support as noted in testimony by gao the goals of the cfo act and related financial reform legislation such as ffmia are to provide congress and agency management with reliable financial information for managing and making daytoday decisions and to improve financial management systems and controls to properly safeguard the governments assets dhs should not be the only cabinetlevel department not covered by what is the cornerstone for pursuing and achieving the requisite financial management systems and capabilities in the federal government30 supporters also contended that the cfo act and related laws should apply consistently across the executive branch and that the unequal status previously accorded the cfo in dhs denigrated the cfo position and the importance of financial management in dhs the cfo position with its fiduciary responsibilities carried with it special needs for accountability which senate confirmation reinforces proponents argued on the other hand the bush administration had opposed bringing the dhs cfo under the cfo act on grounds of special managerial principles for the new dhs and subsequently from the rationale of reducing the number of positions subject to senate confirmation as an omb official testified in september 2003 regarding application of the cfo act to dhs it is ombs position that the substantive provisions of the cfo act should apply to the new department of homeland security however the cfo act specifies an organization structure direct reporting of the cfo to the agency head that is inconsistent with the structure congress endorsed when it passed the homeland security act of 2002 the homeland security act enacted the presidents proposal to consolidate management responsibilities at the new department under the under secretary for management requiring the cfo at dhs to report directly to the secretary of homeland security would dilute this principle the administration is also working with congress to reduce the number of officials subject to confirmation by the senate and therefore opposes making the cfo subject to confirmation by the senate31 andrew maner currently serving as cfo for dhs along with his predecessor bruce carnes had maintained that however wellintentioned the legislation it was unnecessary in testimony before house subcommittee in march 2004 mr maner stated 30 gao031134t p 2 31 statement of linda m springer before the subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management sept 10 2003 available at httphousegovuploadedfiles springer_testimony0910pdf crs9 like many others i appreciate and applaud the objectives of hr 2886 that said i do believe that much of what is contemplated in the legislation may not be critical or necessary to dhs at this juncture this legislation will not alter the way in which i perform my job nor will it provide any tools reporting structures or other authorities that i do not have today32 concern was also voiced about the potential cost of conducting audits of internal controls in dhs as well as creating new office of program analysis and evaluation and imposing additional planning and reporting requirements on dhs on july 8 2004 the senate subcommittee on financial management the budget and international security held hearing focusing on the federal governments consolidated financial statements and on financial management at the departments of defense and homeland security in his opening statement chairman fitzgerald referred to the legislation to bring the cfo position in dhs under the 1990 statute noting we look forward to hearing from our witnesses on their views regarding the importance of applying the cfo act to dhs33 testimony from dhs cfo andrew maner at the senate subcommittee hearing in july arguably might be construed as indicative of lessening of the administrations opposition to the legislation unlike prior statements from administration officials which suggested that the dhs financial accountability act was unnecessary and undesirable in july mr maner stated as cfo of dhs i commend all relevant efforts by the executive and legislative branches including those of the chairman senator fitzgerald and mr akaka ranking minority member of the subcommittee with s 1567 to make our controls tighter and to provide financial managers better tools to complete our mission more efficiently and effectively34 further mr maners july testimony did not reiterate the administrations previous objections to bringing dhs directly under the cfo act especially with regard to the framework for senate confirmation and administrative placement of the cfo one might surmise that the absence of such commentary in july reflected tacit acceptance of the dual reporting arrangement for the cfo in dhs as developed in the house35 mr maner cited one remaining objectionable provision in s 1567 32 statement of andrew b maner before house subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management march 10 2004 available at httphousegovuploadedfiles maner_testimonypdf 33 statement of sen peter fitzgerald before the senate subcommittee on financial management the budget and international security july

during consideration of hr 2886 by the house select committee on homeland security as an apparent attempt to craft compromise provision acceptable to the administration conversation between the author continued crs10 the requirement for an opinion audit of dhss internal controls beginning in fy2005 stating in part such an audit could be costly in dollars and staff time and may not bring the level of benefits to the agency that it might be intended to provide36 therefore he recommended postponing the effective date of the audit of internal controls until at least fy2006 as provided in the house

house hr 4259 would have brought the cfo in dhs directly under the cfo act as amended this would also have brought dhs under the government management reform act of 1994 and the federal financial management improvement act of 1996 and would have made the cfo in dhs statutory member of the chief financial officers council the housepassed version however provided dual reporting framework for the cfo in dhs to the head of the department as in all the other cfo act agencies and concurrently to the under secretary for management the initial arrangement for the cfo in dhs both measures would have required an audit of internal controls over financial reporting in dhs although the timing in the two bills differed beginning with fy2005 in s 1567 and after fy2005 in hr 4259 the house bill also contained additional provisions not found in the senate version hr 4259 also would have created an office of program analysis and evaluation within dhs would have required dhs to prepare future years program and security strategy report for congress and would have required joint study by the cfo council and the presidents council on integrity and efficiency pcie of the costs and benefits of having all cfo agencies obtain audit opinions of their internal controls for financial reporting finally hr 4259 would have required that the dhs authorizing committees the senate committee on governmental affairs the house committee on government reform and the house select committee on homeland security receive notification 15 days in advance of transfer and reprogramming actions final enactment the dhs financial accountability act passed the senate under unanimous consent and the house under suspension of the rules reflecting substantial bipartisan support for the measure however s 1567 and hr 4259 contained some differences and the constitution requires that both chambers pass bill in identical form before presentment to the president when legislation has passed the house and senate in differing versions one mechanism for resolving differences is the conference committee38 this approach seemed unlikely with respect to s 1567 and hr 4259 because of time constraints for the remainder of the 108th congress another possibility was for the house and senate to reach agreement via exchange of amendments between the houses39 time constraints also worked against use of this technique an alternative approach used previously to enact financial management legislation toward the end of congress entails incorporating bill language acceptable to both the house and senate as an amendment to an essential 38 see crs report 98696 gov resolving legislative differences in congress conference committees and amendments between the houses by elizabeth rybicki and stanley bach 39 ibid pp 78 crs12 appropriations measure40 for example bill to create special cfo position in the executive office of the president was enacted in 1999 as part of the treasury and general government appropriations act for fy200041 likewise the federal financial management improvement act of 1996 containing noteworthy amendments to the cfo act of 1990 was enacted as part of the omnibus consolidated appropriations act for fy199742 in line with such past practice senator fitzgerald submitted an amendment samdt 359243 incorporating the provisions of hr 4259 intended to be proposed by him during senate consideration of the dhs fy2005 appropriations bill44 however the amendment was not offered before senate passage of hr 4567 following vote to substitute the provisions of s 2537 on september 14 200445 instead simpler procedure was employed to resolve differences in the versions of the dhs financial accountability act as passed by the house and senate whereby either chamber may approve the bill as passed by the other body on september 29 2004 the senate committee on governmental affairs was discharged from further consideration of hr 4259 and the bill was then passed by unanimous consent46 president george w bush signed the bill into law on october 18 200447 as enacted hr 4259 brings the cfo in dhs directly under the cfo act as amended the new law also serves to bring dhs under the government management reform act of 1994 and the federal financial management improvement act of 1996 and makes the cfo in dhs statutory member of the 40 procedural rules in the house and senate exist to promote separate consideration of bills providing annual appropriations from those containing substantive legislative provisions departure from the procedural separation may occur
