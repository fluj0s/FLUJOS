growth and competitiveness special consideration has been given to small high tech firms for several reasons including some data that indicate such companies tend to be highly innovative play significant role in technological advancement and contribute to the high standard of living in the united states such was the rationale behind legislation creating the small business innovation research sbir program an effort to increase that portion of the federal research and development rd budget provided to small enterprises for work associated with the mission responsibilities of government departments and agencies believing that small companies were underrepresented in government rd activities pl 97219 as amended established agency sbir programs to guarantee this sector portion of the governments research and development budget to compensate for what was viewed as federal contracting preference for large corporations crs2 current law requires that every federal department with an extramural rd budget of 100 million or more establish and operate sbir program1 set percentage of that agencys extramural research and development budget2 originally at 125 now at

agencies that administer sbir grants of the bill provides for the creation and 50000000 or more must establish maintenance of data bases collecting sbir advisory board comprised of relevant information on the sbir and sttr agency employees private sector programs for use by both the government representatives veteran small business and the public sector owners and others to make recommendations on programmatic topics an annual report is to be required crs5 issues for consideration perhaps the most contentious issue in the reauthorization is that of the level of small business ownership by venture capital companies and eligibility under the sbir and sttr programs the original legislation establishing the sbir program required that small firms must be at least 51 owned by an individual or individuals venture capital investment was permitted and encouraged but limited to 49 ownership interest the intent of providing federal grant money as explained in the house science and technology committee report hrept 97349 part iv to accompany the house bill that became the basis for the legislation was to provide seed capital to small high technology firms at the early high risk stage of initial concept development funds provided would compensate for what has been described as lack of investment capital for small businesses funds provided under the sbir program would be used to cover early development costs for small firms providing early risk capital which is necessary for the procurement of followup support from the private sector httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22865 however the issue of venture capital ownership has come to the attention of congress as the nature of venture capital investment and rd performance has changed since the legislation was initially enacted in 1982 recently questions were raised as to whether small companies with majority ownership by venture capital companies met the eligibility requirements of the sbir program according to an april 2006 report by the government accountability office gao06565 in 2001 an sba administrative law judge issued decision clarifying that the terms individuals and citizens in the sbir criteria meant only natural persons not entities such as corporations then in 2003 the same sba administrative law judge issued decision stating that venture capital firms could not be considered individuals for the purpose of satisfying the ownership criteria for the program both hr 5819 and s 3362 alter the eligibility requirements regarding majority venture capital ownership of small firms in the sbir and sttr program proponents of this change maintain that particularly in the biotechnology sector the most innovative companies are not able to use these programs because they do not meet this ownership criteria they argue that because of the high cost of biotechnology rd large venture capital investments are often necessity for many of these firms by excluding such companies from the sbir and sttr programs advocates maintain that the pool of applicants for participation in the effort specifically at the national institutes of health is decreasing with detrimental effects to the health and strength of the us economy opponents of altering the eligibility requirements argue that the program is designed to provide financial assistance where venture capital is not available these experts assert that the programs objective is to bring new concepts to the point where private sector investment is feasible however they claim that the changes in the bill associated with venture capital majority ownership take federal support away from actual small businesses and place government funds into the hands of investors while favoring the biotechnology and venture capital sectors under the housepassed bill the setaside for the sbir and sttr programs remains at its current level however the senate bill increases the amount of the setaside for the crs6 sbir program by 01 each year until it reaches 35 in 2019 with the exception of the setaside for the national institutes of health which remains at 25 and limits on use of dod and doe funding increases to activities that further the technology readiness levels of technologies being developed under phase ii awards the setaside for the sttr program also is increased from 03 to 04 for 2010 through 2011 to 05 for 2012 through 2013 and to 06 from 2014 on both bills increase the amount of individual sbir and sttr phase i and phase ii awards that may be made raising the upward limit of the permitted awards appears to reflect recognition that the performance of research and development has become increasingly expensive over the 25 years since passage of the original legislation however this may result in fewer awards available to small firms through these two programs particularly under hr 5819 which does not increase the amount of the set aside in addition to permitting larger individual awards the bills provide more congressional direction to the participating agencies as to topics for inclusion in program solicitations and to the characteristics to be considered during the selection process hr httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22865 5819 includes preferences for rd in energy rare diseases transportation and nanotechnology companies in rural areas and those located in areas that have lost major industry are to be given special consideration as are small firms owned by veterans those that are expected to make contribution to energy efficiency and those that have their primary business operations in the united states s 3362 encourages awards in rd associated with cures for rare diseases and nanotechnology the existing phased approach of the sbir program is altered by the provisions of the reauthorization bills and may provide more flexibility for applicants and grantees award recipients may switch between the sbir and sttr programs and among programs at different agencies under hr 5819 the sequential nature of the current program where only companies that successfully completed phase i could apply for phase ii would longer be the case as applicants would be able to apply for phase ii awards without going through the initial phase i process in addition both bills would increase outreach to small firms and include other efforts to encourage and expand participation in the sbir and sttr programs as congress considers the possible reauthorization of the sbir and sttr programs and any possible changes in program operation these and other issues may be explored
