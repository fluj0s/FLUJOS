trade policy in new era francis t miko specialist in international relations 77670 robert l goldich specialis t in national defense 77633 in 2003 the 108th congress is expected to face early challenges in foreign defense and trade policy as the global campaign against terrorism continues and possible war with iraq looms congress must complete action on the fy2003 appropriations bills and begin cons ideration of the budget for fy2004 congressional actions are likely to reflect the reality that the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states her eafter referred to as 911 have in some fundamental ways changed america and th way it looks at the world for many 911 destroyed the illusion that the united st ates is invulnerable to attack from determined enemy the administration and congress are shifting us policy and resources accordingly the new priorities appear to include the following first in order to diminish us vulnerabilities to attack that were exposed by 911 whole new structure for homeland security is being built second the united states and coalition of countries are continuing worldwide campaign to stroy qaeda and other terrorist organizations that target us citizens and facilities while the initial phase of removing the taliban government and stroying qaeda bases in afghanistan was successful the effort to defeat the rrorists is by means finished the intelligence community believes that qaeda is regrouping in pakistan and elsewhere many key leaders have not been captured or killed and the organization is believed to be capable of mounting new threats third the united states is intensifying its efforts to remove what the administration and many in congress consider the related threat of weapons of mass destruction wmd in the hands of rogue governments the concern is th at they might be tempted to use such weapons against the united states and its allies or to supply them to terrorist organizations the us showdown with iraq is the main focus at present but president bush has identified north korea and iran as well as iraq as forming an axis of evil in october 2002 north korean leaders ad mitted that they have an ongoing nuclear weapons program in viola tion of international agreements since then they appear to be reactivating nuclear installations shut down under 1994 agreement and have expelled international atomic energy agency inspectors threatening fullscale international crisis while the world rallied in support of us actions after 911 the administration and congress must also contend with the fact that many countries are becominghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs2 increasingly wary and even alarmed bout how unconstrained us military power might be used and the direction of us po licy some concern has been present ever since the united states became the sole superpower in less predictable world in contrast to the ussoviet balance of power which existed for half century however worries seem to have been height ened by the perceived us shift of focus from the war against qaeda to iraq and the axis of eviland by the us assertion of doctrine of preemption other countries still seek and welcome u s leadership on global issues but they increasingly complain that the united states is deciding and acting on its own and pursuing narrow selfinterests they see the administration as consulting partners only after decisions are made when their assistance is needed and without taking their views into account such complain ts are even voiced by close us llies in europe and asia who wonder whether th us is downgrading longstanding alliances as it pursues shortterm coalitions of the willing international grievances about us unilateralism incl ude litany of complaints about specific us policies such as its opposition to the international cr iminal court rejecti on of environmental agreements like the kyoto protocol and its withdrawal from the antiballistic missile treaty some urge the administration to seriously address allied differences on these issues others see us positions as correct and view some of the protestations as hypocr itical and selfcentered congress faces other new issues and challenges that are in some ways related as it deliberates and votes on accepting seven new members into nato the 108th congress may reexamine the role that us alliances play in the new circumstancesthere is concern among some observers that if usallied differences continue to mount they could begin to erode the foundati ons of relations since the end of the cold war there are fewer clear and present dangers that absolutely necessitate formal alliances increasingly voices can be heard in the united states europe japan south korea and elsewhere that question th need for them some in other countries are beginning to see close association w ith us policy as making them more vulnerable to terrorist or wmd threats on the us side some goitalone advocates see allies primarily as an impediment to us freedom of action while not contributing much to us strength especially given that the gap in their military capabilities and spending has continued to widen at present these seem to be minority views others would probably still argue that us policy should continue to define us interests in terms of broader shared allied interests there is concern that the current us preponderance if not used in multilateral way might be difficult to sustain and could even hasten the emergence of competing power centers or coalitions many would argue that strong alliances are still among the greatest us assets and sources of longterm us political economic and military strength congress faces issues concerning continuing us assistance and engagement in afghanistan bosnia kosovo and other recent conflict areas and may also need to prepare for possible longterm and costly military presence in iraq this again raises for congress the controversial question of nationbuilding and the appropriate us role in postconflict p eacekeeping and reconstruction efforts many argue for leaving such efforts principally to other countries at present the united states is drawing down its forces in the balkans however some experts argue thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs3 it would not serve us interests or the pros pects for stability in these countries if the us were to withdraw completely congress will likely review us foreign aid priorities after 911 and take up the presidents large new foreign aid initia tive the millennium challenge account which would substantially increase foreign assistance to developing countries with record of good performance in key areas the initiative may derive at least in part out of recognition that poverty makes count ries breeding grounds for terrorism and other ills such as the spread of hivaids and other infectious diseases it is believed to be root cause of strife and instability in many parts of the world at the same time other challenges remain on the congressional agenda these include oversight of us foreign policy to ward regions and countries of the world including rising powers such as china nd major countries undergoing significant transition such as russia congress is likely to continue to focus considerable attention and resources to fighting hiv aids and other communicable diseases especially in africa and asia transnational problems such as international crime drugs environmental problems and hum an rights concerns remain important congressional concerns the global economy has profoundly change d international relations and the ability of governments to control developments even within national borders international developments impact on th domestic policy as never before the benefits of globalization are considered far reaching spurring world productivity economic growth and access to informa tion along with the benefits come significant new challenges that may require further congressional attention globalization brings economic dislocations in some areas financial uncertainties threaten different regions in the trad area the 108th congress will likely face decisions on approving one or more free trade agreements and monitoring the negotiations on others which the bush ad ministration has initia ted or proposed the negotiations include bilateral regional and multilateral trade liberalizing agreements many believe that strong us leadership in multilateral framework will be necessary to find cooperative solutions to world problems others remain suspicious of international organizations and reluctant to enter into agreements that they believe would cede degree of us sovereignty to them the 108th congress will confront underlying ambiguity controversy and uncertainty regarding the proper directions and priorities for us defense policy when it opens in early 2003a huge change from the degree of underlying consensus which marked the opening of the 107th congress in early 2001 before the attacks of 911 us strategic prio rities and military contingenc planning were centered almost exclusively around preparation for possible hostilities with threatening nation states since 911 the department of defense dod has been waging war of episodic intensity against active terrorist and terroristrelated fo rces throughout the world since early 2002 it has been preparin g for war against iraq if diplomatic efforts fail to eliminate any weapons of mass destructi on it may possess at the same time secretary of defense rumsfeld has been vigorously propounding the underlying assumptions of the technologydriven revolution inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs4 military affairs rma and accordingly emphasizing lightness mobility technological sophistication and hardware over firepower sustainability size of the force and quantity of weapons and units he has done this over varying degrees of doubt and opposition from within and without the military services and their senior uniformed leadership the congress and nongovernmental commentators and analysts on defense issues the administration appears to have decided to fight major war with iraq if necessary continue the rmadriven modernization of the armed forces and maintain the existing level of effort in the war against terrorism centered in and around afghanistanwithout greatly enlargin g the size of the active duty armed forces the administration appears to have tacitly decided so far to prosecute the current antiterrorism operations and possibly the imminent ones against iraq within the constraints of existing active and rese rve military for ce structure weapons and equipment inventory and pers onnel strengths it is not clear how long this level of military effort can be sustained without re quiring substantially larger active duty force and much greater levels of proc urement spending so as to avoid gross unreadiness in those forces not actually deployed to parts of the world where hostilities are taking place in the background are issues of defense strategy and resour ce allocation which the terrorism war and related matters have temporarily crowded off of literal and virtual front pages it was going to be difficult enough to finance what the administration regarded as minimally n ecessary increases in peacetime defense spending out of then predicted budget rpluses when hostilities cease or greatly diminish in intensity how will crucial modernization and readiness programs be funded now that deficits are back ar national missile defense nmd systems technically feasible and if so are they important enough to command major part of constrained defense budget at the expe nse of conventional weapons research and development and procurement how should the united states size its conventional forces in an era where the previous benc hmarks of 2 ½ wars 1 ½ wars two nearlysimultaneous major theater wars m tws andor winning one mtw and holding in another all ppear to be sterile remnan ts of the pre911 era finally the administrations stated willin gness to exercise our right of self defense by acting preemptively against terrorism and against either transnational terrorists or nationstates that appear to be preparing to attack the united states with wmd may have military as well as political implications are us military forces which are almost 40 smaller than they were at the height of the cold war in the late 1980s capable of executing strategy wh ich could demand more longrange power projection capability intelligence collection and evaluation assets and special operations forces than the present force structure in short the 108th congress will be confronting defense issues in an atmosphere of uncertainty that has not existed since the collapse of the soviet union and the warsaw pact dozen years agohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs5 the war on terrorism international terrorism rensselaer lee consultant in international affairs 77748 francis t miko specialist in international relations 77670 the events of september 11 2001 underscore d the significance of international terrorism as firstorder threat to us national security and to us interests at home and abroad since september 11 important steps have been taken by congress and by the bush administration to confront th at threat inevitably however questions of costs and priorities arise in the conduc t of us counterterrorism policy and congress will be calle d upon to ddress these issues both in the budgetary process and in specific legislation fundamental and vital issu concerns the allocation of resources between the homeland security and national security as pects of policy it may be asked for example how much emphasis should be pl aced on forward defense striking at qaeda and its affiliates in distant lands shutting down foreig n sanctuaries and training camps cutting terrorists financial lifelines and protecting insecure stockpiles of nuclear materi als and weapons and how much on protecting the us homeland from terrorist attacks in broad or ganizational terms th is relates to funding of new department of homeland securitys activities versus those of the foreign operations of the defense state energy and treasury department s the fbi and the cia second major issue concerns th general scope of the administrations counterterror effort question is whethe r the effort here should target terrorist groups widely including groups with local agendas that do not necessarily single out americans for attack or whether it should focus on qaeda which many observers see as the most immediate foreign threat to us security related question concerns the potential effects of military intervention in iraq would war in iraq create backlash in the islamic world fuel terrorism or divert significant attention and resources from the international fight against qaeda as some administration critics suggest or is it n ecessary step to prevent iraq from developing weapons of mass destruction that could fa ll into the hands of terrorists congressional oversight can play significant role in evaluating the effectiveness of different policy tools employed in combating international terrorism as well as their potential diplomatic or political consequences for example in given situations covert action to infiltrate and disrupt terrori st leaderships might produce better results and less collateral damage than military strikes against suspected terrorist concentrations addr essing possible changes to constraints or guidelines that affect activities such as recr uitment of informants thus could become legislative priority it has been argued that applications of certain measures such as ones calculated to disrupt terrorist financing are perceived as broadly antiislamic and project negative us image abroad hence ways of minimizing such external costs may be explored an increased focus on n ationbuilding strategies to address the economic and political prec onditions of terrorism also might be considered in crafting an overall counterte rrorism policy whether the different instruments selected are mutually coherent and whether in certain situations the risks of usinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs6 them exceed the expected rewards are important

ensure that qaeda or other terrorist groups are not able to conduc t terrorist attacks in the united states or against us interests abroad on the scal of the september 11 2001 attacks there is widespread agreement that the usled war in afghanistan has significantly weakened qaeda by denying it central base but there are differing opinions within and outside the administration over whether qaeda could still conduct another catastrophic attack two terrorist attacks in october 2002 one against an oil tanker off the coast of yemen and anothe r in bali indonesia that killed nearly 200 both of which were allege dly conducted by qaeda supporters or affiliates have raised us concerns that qaed could be regrouping and gearing up for new major attacks investigators are attempting to determine whether attacks on november 28 2002 against an israeliowne d hotel 18 killed and an israeli passenger aircraft in kenya unsucce ssful were the work of qaeda an audiotaped threat by qaed founder osama bin laden released in november 2002 and believed by us offi cials to be authentic has apparently confirmed that he is still alive cia director george tenet told congress on october 17 2002 that the recent attacks and th reats indicate an qaeda threat environment comparable to that which existed prior to the attacks of september 11 2001 at the same time the administration has confirmed some recent major arrests of alleged qaeda operatives includi ng the capture in november 2002 of qaedas key organizer for the persian gulf region additional arrests on this scale over time may weaken qaeda to the point where it is longer significant threat us officials say that th effort against qaeda is worldwide and multifaceted involving diplomatic and fina ncial as well as military ac tions much of the current us effort is intended to capture qaeda leadership and operatives worldwide although us military efforts within af ghanistan are now focused primarily on shoring up the fledgling government of afgh anistan and preventing that countrys re emergence as base for terrorist groups further options could include greater use of armed unmanned us aircraft such as the predator that was used to strike senior qaeda operative in yemen in early n ovember 2002 press reports suggest that us intelligence is stepping up activities in the tribal areas of western pakistan in an

the us campaign against qaeda and other terrorist move ments several hearings ve already been held since the september 11 attacks in cluding those on the warning signs apparently available to intelligence and law enforcement prior to the september 11 attacks congress will also likely review administration attempts to shore up the antiterrorism coalition and might provide benefits to key

on terrorism places signifi cant demands on intelligence agencies national collection systems designed to provi data about foreig n missile silos and large military installations may not be the best platforms for acquiring information on the identities and plottings of terrorists groups new approaches may be needed there will undoubtedly be rene wed emphasis on human intelligence and the need for officers with varied language skills and awareness of different cultures the statutes and regulations that govern the collection analysis and dissemination of information by intelligence and law enforcement agen cies were not written to support the counterterrorist efforts that are now seen by many as necessary some changes have been made since september 11 2001 nd congress may seek to enact further modifications there will also be complex issues regarding the appropriate balance between security and civil liberties as intelligence and law enforcement agencies work more closely together

supporters and their arms caches the roughly 8000 us troops and 4000 troops of the international security assistance force isa f still encounter sporadic firefights and shelling from dissident afghan forces the major decision confronting administration officials and congressional oversight committees is what role the us military should play and to what extent it should become involved in the reconstruction of afghanistan most obser vers agree that international troops must remain in afghanistan for the foreseeable future and that the us military should play leading role the central governme nt remains weak and warlords of dubious allegiances dominate the countryside th bush administration had hoped to turn over the reconstructive period to interna tional peacekeepers and civilian agencies however the isaf will not operate outside of the capital kabul and it has been left to us forces to intercede and mediate inte rnecine afghan disputes in policy shift department of

stabilize outlying areas and facilitate reconstruction projects details of the size and scope of these operations have not been released though official estimates of how long us forces will remain in afghanistan have been made it would appear that the challenges of reconstruction in afghanistan are even more difficult than those confronted in the balkans where us troops have been stationed for

and are assisting in the search for alqaeda operatives in the northern tribal areas of the country though relatively inexpensive these activities do place heavy burden upon the limited personnel

affairs 70425 the 108th congress will face funding and oversight issues concerning transitional and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan even as us and allied forces continue the hunt for qaeda forces and taliban leaders us and international efforts in afghanistan focus on three areas first enhancing security using the international security assistance force isaf and the future afghan national army and police force second developing political framework for governance and reintegration in the international community and third creating an economic reconstruction strategy the most serious challenge in afghanistan today is the lack of security due partly to the fact that former commanders maintain control over their own areas and continue fighting with their rivals recent initiative by the pentagon would expand the role of the us military in afgh anistan to support local security and reconstruction this marks departure fro m relying entirely on the development of an afghan national army or expansion of the isaf for security and engages us forces beyond military action to oust the taliban and qaeda although us soldiers have been involved in num ber of small

afghanistan current devel opments and us policy by kenneth katzman possible war with iraq introduction kenneth katzman specialist in middle eastern affairs 77612 the bush administration has identified the regime of saddam hussein in iraq as grave potential threat to the united states the administration asserts that iraq is in defiance of 16 security council resolutions that among other requirements mandate that iraq fully declare and eliminate its weapons of mass destruction wmd programs president bush has stated that iraq must fully cooperate with new disarmament ffort or the united states will lead coalition to disarm iraq presumably through major usled military offensive the statements by president bush coupl ed with reports of slow but steady us military buildup in the persian gulf clearly indicate that war against iraq is likely if iraq does not fully cooperate w ith new disarmament effort that effort is being conducted unde r the mandate of security council resolution 1441 dopted unanimously on november 8 2002 the resolution requires complete declaration by iraq of all its wmd and gives weapons inspectors new authorities to conduct surprise unfettered inspections ev erywhere in iraq the inspections began november 27 2002 nd the inspection organization unmovic monitoring verification and inspec tion commission has sa id it would report to the security council by january 27 2003 on its findings as required by the resolution many observers believe that the security council will be split in its evaluation of the new inspections regime the united states and britain are likely to point to any hint of iraqi noncooperati on as evidence of iraqs intention to hide wmd capabilities their past positions in council debates on iraq suggest that france russia and china are likely to have less concern bout individual iraqi violations as long as iraq for the most part is cooperating with the new inspectionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs12 the outcome of such council deliberations could determine whether or not the united nations authorizes military action against iraq to enforce its inspection mandates the bush administrations decision to c onfront iraq under umbrella has led the administration to mute its prior declarations that the goal of us policy is to change iraqs regime but us officials say regime change remains official us policy and the ultimate us goal whethe r or not saddam husse in cooperates with the new inspections effort press re ports in october 2002 said that the administration is recruiting an iraqi oppos ition force by using drawdown authorities and monies provided in the iraq li beration act pl 105338 october 31 1998 such force could support us attack or work on its own to destabilize saddam hussein whether or not there is war against iraq on october 16 2002 president bush signed into law hjres 114 pl 107 243 authorizing the president to use us armed forces to protect us national security and enforce applicable reso lutions on iraq cong ress has held several hearings on the possibility of us war against iraq and is expected to hold further hearings on the progress of inspecti ons and the continuing threat from iraq congress might take an active role in any international debate on iraqi compliance as it did in hjres 114 and 1998 joint resolution sjres 54 pl 105235 august 14 1998 which stated that iraq wa s in material breach of its obligations under applicable resolutions military options steve bowman specialist in national defense 77613 the department of defense has officia lly released information concerning war planning or preparations against ira q there have been however significant news leaks which provide some insights news reports have indicated that the military options under discussion vary signif icantly in their assumptions regarding iraq military capabilities today the useful ness of iraqi opposition groups the attitude of other governments in the region and the us military resources that would be required possible heavy option would invol ve 250000 or more troops and would combine an air offensive with up to four us armored and mechanized divisions this option is greatly dependent upon the c ooperation of other nations in the region for substantial staging areasairbases nd could require months to deploy the necessary forces possible lite option would entail extensive use of special operations forces in cooperation with indigenous iraqi opposition forces coupled with an air offensive to destroy husseins most reliable republican guard units command control centers and wmd capabilities this approach assumes that the regular iraqi army will prove unreliable and may even join opposition forces once it is clear that defeat is imminent with both heavy and lite options reportedly having been set aside for variety of reas ons news reports indi cate that the plan of choice appears to be blend of the tw involving perhaps 80000 us troops this option appears to focus not on the size of the us force but rather upon the diversity of units attacking and very close coordi nation of air and ground attacks indigenous forces would not necessarily play larg role though some effort likely would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs13 made through central intelligence agency teams and special operations units to gain their cooperation particular fforts may be made to isol ate and neutralize key iraqi leadership regardless of the option chosen there are concerns that war with iraq will stretch us military resources given other commitments including afghanistan and the worldwide war on terrorism sp ecial operations forces and other high demand assets may be especially overtaxed unless there are shifts in the international political scene it does not appear that us military action against ir aq will feature coalition similar to that formed for desert storm in 1991 and this could constrain significantly the options open to us planners the persian gulf states coopera tion would be particul arly vital given the extensive air force facilities and prepositioned equipment there as would the cooperation of turkey along iraqs northern borders iraqi armed forces are significantly degraded from their 1991 levels however the possibility of strong republican guar d resistance in urban areas and iraqs possible use of chemical andor biologi cal weapons in theater or strategically present particularly difficult challenges to us planners ultimately the psychological reaction of the iraqi leader ship armed forces and civilian population will be

or negatively us interests in the middle east if the united states is forced to fight slow and largely urban war with heavy iraqi civilian casualties and lengthy period of lawlessness and instability arab regimes such as egypt jordan and saudi ar abia could face moderate to severe levels of civil unrest these regimes might choose to restrict media coverage of the war and its aftermath ban public

incite hostility toward the united states by drawing parallels between us occupation of iraq and the israeli military occupation in parts of the west bank and gaza strip refugee flows from iraq could add to regional instability if however the united states is able to force regime change in iraq without war or through short war with minimal civilian casualties the image of the united states as

installations at yongbyon that were shut down under the usnorth korean nuclear agreed framework of 1994 creates major arms c ontrol and foreign policy problem for the united states north koreas major motive appears to be to escalate pressure on the bush administration to ne gotiate over pyongyangs proposed nonaggression pact andor new nuclear agreement that woul d provide new us benefits to north korea however reopening the yongbyon facilities opens up possible north korean intent or option to stage br eak out of its nuclear program in 2003 and openly produce nuclear weapons the 1994 agreed framework obligated rth korea to suspend the operations of its nuclear facilities nd allow the secure storage of 8000 nuclear fuel rods removed from nuclear reactor in may 1994 the united states in turn organized an international consortium the korean peninsula energy development organization kedo which was to construct two light water nuclear reactors lwrs inside north korea and provide north korea w ith 500000 tons of heavy oil annually until the construction of the first lwr was completed before north korea received nuclear components for the lwrs it was to come into full compliance with its 1992 safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency iaea except for the special status given to the yongbyon facilities by the agreed framework the agreed framework specified that north korea would abide by the iaea safeguards agreement with regard to any other nucl ear activities and abide by the 1991 north koreasouth korea denuclearization agreement which specifically prohibited any north korean nuclear program based on uran ium enrichment there reportedly is secret minute to the agreed framework pr ess reports have said that this secret minute prohibits north korea from constructing any new nuclear facilities the bush administration speeded up the construction of the lwrs which had fallen well behind the completi on target date of 2003 but it also pressed north korea to begin three to four year process of complying with its obligations to the iaea or face suspension of the lwr project after the september 11 2001 terrorist attack the administration i ssued demands that north korea dismantle its weapons of mass destruction stop pro liferating weapons to the ddle east and south asia and withdraw its heavy troop concentra tions from the korean demilitarized zone these demands stressed unilate ral north korean actions to meet us concerns and contained specific offers of reciprocal us actions president bushs declaration of north korea as member of an axis of evil began series of demands to north korea suggesting penalties if it did not meet us concerns the administration sent assistant secretary of state james kelly to north korea in early october 2002 for the first substantive usnorth korea negotiation since december 2000 kelly presented the north koreans with us evidence that north korea was conducting secret nucl ear weapons program based on uranium enrichment us intelligence evidence of the secret program had built up since 1998 the north koreans surprised the administration by admitting to the program and asserting that they had the right to possess nuclear weapons the kelly visithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs17 prompted the administration to formulate policy of containment and isolation if north korea did not end the secret progra m the policy consisted of 1 refusal to negotiate any new nuclear agreement with north korea until north korea ended the secret nuclear program and came into compliance with the past agreements which it was violating 2 an unwillingness to engage in any other type of sustained dialogue with north korea 3 assembling an international coalition to pressure north korea the most important member s being south korea china japan and russia 4 imposing an initial penalty on north korea by suspending the shipments of heavy fuel oil to north korea and warning of total termination of the agreed framework and 5 warnings of futu re international economic sanctions the intensity of north koreas count ermove in reopening the yongbyon facilities again took administration offici als by surprise by their own admission north korea announced through its offici media and letter of december 27 2002 to the iaea that it would restart its nuclear reactor and plutonium reprocessing plant that were in operation until 1994 and resume construc tion of two larger reactors the most dangerous followup north korean move would be to move the 8000 stored fuel rods into the plutonium reproce ssing plant for the production of nuclear weaponsgrade plutonium according to timates by nuclear ex perts and reportedly by us intelligence agencies if north korea began to reprocess the fuel rods it would take about four mont hs to produce weapons grad plutonium and another one or two months to produce four to six ato mic bombs such action by north korea nuclear breakout would put considerab pressure on the bu sh administrations initial policy responses to the re opening of the yongbyon facilities the administrations reaction to the reopening of yongbyon has been to repeatedly disavow any military option such as bombing yongbyon and state that it is open to diplomatic contact with north koreabut not negotiation of new agreement the administration reportedl is considering seeking cooperation from an international coalition in instituting economic sanctions against north korea possibly through the security council and interdicting north korean shipments of weapons to middle east and south asia n countries such strategy would aim at north koreas greatest vulnerability its already deteriorating economy the option of economic sanctions however is encountering growing resistance from china russia and south korea they support the general us position on north koreas nuclear policies but they have cr iticized the idea of economic sanctions and have called on the united states to engage in dialogue with north korea the south korean position has come about as result of growing south korean public criticism of the 37000 us troops stationed in south korea and the

iraq iran north korea india and pakistan in additi on to nonproliferation regimes and treaties bilateral agreements and export controls the possibility of preemptively eliminating wmd capabilities has gained currency in the bush administration and elsewhere in the context of iraq and the broader war on terrorism since september 11 2001 increased conc erns about nexus between wmd and terrorism has helped dr ive strategy and tactics fo r the war on terrorism key issues for the 108th congress will include does the threat of wmd use push us toward preemption b if so does po licy of preemption increase the wmd threat to us and allied forces c does the th reat of preemption undermine the existing regime of treaties and agreements or does it strengthen those regimes closer to home preparations to defend against possible wmd attack for example an initiative to v accinate critical workers against sma llpox will continue to present budgetary health infrastructure and homel and security concerns congress will continue to be involved in assessing andor funding prog rams to enhance detection of wmdrelated materials at home and possibly abroad key activity of congress is expected to be the oversight of funding and programs designed to cut off terrorist access to wmd and wmdrelated materials at the source securing materials at sites around the globe particularly where terrorism and wmd capabilities intersect fi rst on the list of potential suppliers are russia and former soviet republics since 1991 the united states has provided assistance to these states in securing and eliminating nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction through the nunnluga r cooperative threat reduction ctr program among the issues that congress may address when it re views this program in the coming year are the total level of funding for nonproliferation assistance to russia priority for specific projects russias financial co mmitment and cooperationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs19 in implementing these programs and possible ctrtype assistance to nations outside the former soviet bloc the russian debt swap for nonproliferation act which created new funding stream for nonprolifera tion programs in russia will be an area of oversight interest the 108th congress will likely face issues re lated to proliferation of wmd capabilities from russia china and north korea in particular sales of missiles and missile technologies from these states par ticularly to such clients as iran and pakistan will likely be closely watched as well as destabilizing missile deployments like shortrange chinese missiles facing taiwan if the agreed framework with north korea fails north korea may resume missile testing other developments of potential interest include the recently sign ed international code of conduct against ballistic missile prolifera tion which seeks to complement the existing missile technology control regime through wi der membership and incentives for nonproliferation and potential sales of arrow or other missile defense systems to volatile regions like south asia concern about secondary prolif eration that is states of proliferation concern that produce wmd for sale to other countries could spark interest in new measures to capture the activities of those states outside nonproliferati on regimes recent reports of pakistans provision of enrich mentrelated technology to north korea will raise questions on the one hand pakistan s assistance in the war on terrorism is considered by some to be important enough to offset nonproliferation concerns about its own nuclear weapons but assistance to nation which the administration has characterized as part of an axis of evil may be viewed in different light the bush administration if it waives the re quirement to place sanctions on pakistan under the symington amendment to the fore ign assistance act now section 101 of the arms export control act will need to inform congress of that waiver north korea presents proliferation challe nges across the board in particular north koreas admission in october 2002 of clandestine uranium enrichment program caused the bush administration to suspend heavy oil shipments to north korea key us obligation under the ag reed framework beginning in december 2002 administration officials indicated that the united states intended to terminate the agreed framework at that time nort h koreas actions to reactivate its nuclear facilities in late december 2002 has further exacerbated the situation the 107th congress continued to provide funding for implementation of the agreement but the new congress may review this funding pecially when it takes up the foreign operations appropriati ons legislation for fy2003 th administration continues to press north korea to take steps toward nding missile deployme nts and sales and its chemical and biologi cal weapons programs finally the 107th congress authorized president bush to use military force against iraq in part to enforce iraqs compliance with resolutions to eliminate its wmd programs given the seven previ ous years of inspections with ambiguous results 19911998 the 108th congress may find itself in an early debate over the conclusiveness of the inspecti on results further if war appears to be inevitable congress will be keenly interested in

year congress may be asked to consid er supplemental appr opriations to cover the costs of these conflicts the administration may also ask for an unallocated contingency fund to cover unplanned costs of military operations in the future number of other defense policy issues will also be on the agenda one issue which may carry over from last year is whether to permit concurrent receipt of military

defense jobs defense acquisition reform and military base closures which are planned for 2005 missile defense is perennial matter of debate in congress and congress may also debate whether to permit

budget resolution and later in action on annual defense authorization and appropriations bills budgetary issues stephen daggett specialist in national defense 77642 amy belasco consultant in national defense 77627 last year the administration requested the largest oneyear increase in defense spending since the early years of the reagan administration congress approved most of the request with the exception of 10 billion that the administration wanted as an unallocated contingency fund for costs of counterterrorism operations in the end the fy2003 budget for nati onal defense is almost 38 billion above the originally enacted fy2002 level congre ss also approved more than 16 billion in supplemental appropriations for fy2002 the administration is projecting continued though much more modest increases over the next few years the large increase in spending has not been enough to meet all the demands however funding for weapons acquisition s been particular matter of debate last year the congressional defense committees expressed concern that the navy requested only five new ships in the fy 2003 request since 8 to 10 new vessels are required on average each year to maintain fleet of 300 ships the budget for weapons procurement has been projected to grow from about 72 billion in fy2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs47 to almost 100 billion by fy2007 but with several new weapons expected to be in production by the end of the decade funding for weapons modernization remains very tight this has prompted debate s within dod and cong ress about priorities among some proposed high prof ile service acquisition plans big constraint on funding for weapons acquis ition is that other parts of the budget have grown very rapidly cong ress provided 48 percent pay raise for uniformed military personnel in the fy2000 defense budget and since then it has approved several measures that have driven up personnel costs dramatically increases include annual pay raises inte nded to close the gap between military pay raises over the past 20 years and measure of pay raises in the civilian sector pay table reform that provided much larger raises to personnel in the middle ranks to improve retention increased housing llowances and subs tantially expanded retirement benefits including dodguaran teed health care to 65andolder military retirees meanwhile funding for

cleanup and compliance has continued to grow at pace of two to three percent per year above inflation per active duty troop taken together increased personnel and om costs take up about twothirds of the projected increase in defense spending between fy2000 and fy2007 several elements add further to the budget debate senior administration officials have placed ve ry heavy emphasis on defens transformation which puts priority on funding for some new initia tives some members of congress would like to see substantial increase in active duty endstrength to cope with ongoing high demands on

few or several such transformations in recent history the bush administration and other supporters believe that technological developments make another such transformation possible and necessary if us

fy2004 defense budget submission will be the first to fully reflect its defense transformation priorities the department of defense has established an office of fo rce transformation and the services have drafted road maps for implementing transformation in coming years congress has an interest in defense transformation because the process can bring about significant changes in defense prog rams and budgets among other things transformation can lead to reduced sp ending on currentgeneration socalled legacy weapons and supporting capabilitie s and increased spending on next generation

congress role is to assess the need for defense transformation examine the various ways in which us military forces might be transformed and act on the administrations proposals for defense tran

transformation necessary if so is th administrations plan adequate what alternatives have been offered does the administrations plan adequately balance transformation against competing prior ities such as nearterm readiness and procurement of legacy equipment is there sufficient consensus regarding the meaning of defense transformation is th term transformation being misused as an allpurpose tool to justify or condemn certain programs in what ways might defense transformation make it easier or harder for congress to conduct oversight of dod programs congress has several options on defense transformation it can decide to agree or disagree with its necessity it can appr ove modify or reject the administrations funding requests for specific defense pr ograms on the grounds of whether the

modernizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs50 programs that will contend for fundi ng in fy2004 the air forces top modernization priority is the fa22 raptor designed to defeat enemy aircraft and according to some groundbased air defenses as well at issue is the aircrafts cost schedule the number to be procured and whether co mbination of other manned and unmanned aircraft might more ch eaply do the same job 45 billion congressional cost cap on fa22 production means that cost and schedule overruns may have to be mitigated by cutting the planned purchase of 295 aircraft the joint strike

two different existing army helicopter models in november 2002 the program wa s restructured for sixth time cutting the number of aircraft in half from 1213 to 650 helicopters and reducing the

overseas military commitments have been growing steadily over the past decade the major forces that the united states has maintained in europe and east asia since the end of world war ii have been followed by slow but steady increase in forces deployed to the persian gulf region following the persian gulf war of 19901991 deployment s to the balkans beginning in 1993 macedonia and rapid dispatch of exped itionary forces to central asia and its environs within days of september 11 2001 for antiterrorism operations in addition the last few months have seen th buildup of the sizable force needed for potential major theater war with iraq all this has happened while us active duty and reserve military manpower st rength has declined by over 40 from the cold war levels of the late 1980s to meet the requirements of the antiterrorism operations almost 130000 reservists some of them facing two years of active duty have been mobilized and the services have implemented socalled stoploss programs which forbid certain personnel to leave active duty voluntarily some speculate that war with iraq could require another 250000 reservis ts vernon loeb military fo rces ordered to gulf washington post december 28 2002 a1 the collective effect of all of these overseas deployments has been to increase the frequency with which many military personnel must perform overseas tours often without families to increase the frequency with which reservists face callup and to increase the workload of those military personnel stationed in th united states as they try to fill the gaps left by deployed units and personnel or as they prepare for future deployments some particular occupati onal specialties or types of units including some found predominantly in the reserves are much more affected by these conditions than others at present the potentially negative impact of these factors on military recruiting and retention appear to have been offset by the surge in patriotic sentiment after the terrorist attacks on the world tr ade center and the pentagon the sluggish economy and the enhanced milita ry pay and benefits enacted by congress since the late 1990s however the increased scale of us military operations worldwide has raised concerns that there is match between military manpower and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs52 manpower requirements of cu rrent operations which could create recruiting and retention problems in the not too distant future several proposals have been advanced to ensure that the military services have enough personnel of sufficient quality to meet the requirements of overseas commands one has been to increase activ duty strength across the board the conference report on the fy2003 national fense authorization act pl 107314 stated that active duty end strengths should be increased substantially the administration and dod have so far been opposed to this mostly on budgetary grounds dod has been pressuring the milita ry services to reduce the number of reservists they have on active duty to save money dod does however plan to increase the proportion of high demand units within the active duty force and decrease their proportion in the reserves if major war with iraq does take place however it is difficult to see how the services can avoid large additional reserve mobilization or substantially larger active duty force for several years to come in order to garrison and recons truct defeated iraq nother proposal for reducing manpower pressures is to reduce the num ber of us personne l participating in peacekeeping and stability

statute creating dhs specifically retains the posse comitatus act the department of defense with its active duty and reserve forces and the ability to federalize national guard units upon presidential direction has the largest and most diversified pers onnel assets in the federa l government as was demonstrated in the months after the ptember 2001 terrorist attacks they can be used in variety of security roles t hough not without detracting from other mission capabilities the role of the national guard in homeland security has become topic of particular discussion some believe that the nati onal guard is tailormade for coping with local and community contingencies given its traditional role as the militia of the individual states its nationwide presence and its size nearly half million people this has led to calls for greatly expanding its role in homeland security others argue that the guard already has important missions as federal military reserve force which cannot be si gnificantly reduced they also arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs55 concerned that if the guard were perceived to be an organization with primarily local and domestic missions rather than havi ng both domestic and foreign warfighting tasks its ability to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of qualified soldiers could suffer additionally the department of defense remains the greatest federal repository of resources for responding to chemi cal biological radi ological or nuclear cbrn incident it is anticipated that civilian authorities will eventually develop better capabilities to deal

procedures in general and about receiving adequate informati on to carry out its congressional oversight responsibilities in partic ular dod is implementing an approach for developing new weapon systems called evoluti onary acquisition with spiral development the corehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs56 idea of evolutionary acquisition is to deve lop incremental or block versions of weapon each with certain amount of us eful military capability that over time form series ultimately leading to the desired final capability each block includes phase for conceiving developing produc ing and sustaining weapon system perhaps the most important phase is th second phase development which uses spiral development an iterative pro cess for developing weapon systems capabilities within block by encouraging the developer tester and user to interact with one another so as to refine the syst ems operational require ments the result is process which contains more uncertainty than its predecessor for example in the initial program description nd defined benchmarks of proposed weapons system this uncertainty has been reflected in dod s lack of clarity in reporting to congress on these systems in the congressional overs ight and appropriati ons process which has not changed congress included number of provisions in the fy2003 defense authorization act pl107314 which mandate reports documenting dod s use of evolutionary acquisition and spiral development for ma jor acquisition programs other provisions required that dod weapons sting remain independent to ensure accountability in weapons development while members of congress gene rally support initiatives to create more efficient acquisition process many worry that the new procedures take too much discipline and structure out of th traditional acquisition process and could potentially lead to technical difficulties and cost overruns expensive weapon programs such as the ballistic missile defense ddx surface combatant and

finance 74997 in the 108th congress there will be continued efforts to rewrite and reauthorize the export adminis tration act of 1979 eaa the eaa provides the statutory authority for export controls on sensitive dua luse goods and technologies items that have both civilian and military applications including those items that can contribute to the proliferation of nucl ear biological and chemical weaponry efforts to renew the act have been co mplicated by continued tension between national security and commercial concerns some observers contend that current export controls hurt us business by subjecting technology exports to what they consider cumbersome and ineffective licen sing process that co sts sales and loses markets to overseas competitors others maintain that current controls are not strong enough to prevent the spread of dualuse technologies to adve rsaries or potential proliferators and that eaa legi slation as introduced in the 107th congress would further weaken this system congressi onal interest in eaa reform has been heightened by questions about the efficacy of export controls in the fight against terrorism and by revelations about the unauthorized transfer of sensitive items to nations restricted by current regulations including china the eaa which originally expired in 1989 periodically has been reauthorized for short periods of time with the last incremental extension expiring in august 2001 at other times the export licensing sy stem created under the authority of eaa has been continued by the invocation of authorities under the international emergency economic powers act ieepa in the 107th congress two competing versions of eaa emerged the senate vers ion s 149 was passe d by the senate on september 6 2001 both th house international relations committee and the house armed services committee substantially amended the house version hr 2581 which as introduced was substantially similar to s 149 to different degrees the house versions conferre d additional authority on the department of defense to block license applications and decontrol d ecisions tightened the criteria for decontrol of certain items and manda ted the denial of licenses for certain exports the administration supported s 149 and oppos ed the competing house versions negotiations between the administration sena and house participants to reconcile differences between the versions of the legi slation continued for the remainder of the session without success because the subs tance of this debate has not been predominantly partisan in nature the change in party composition of the 108th congress is not expected to alter the dy namics of the debate the sponsor of the senate version of eaa in the 107th congress senator michael enzi has indicated that he will reintroduce version of eaa in the 108th congress and other members may also offer export control legislati on in addition to the reauthorization legislation the 108th congress may tackle

108th congress inherits seve ral disputes where the wto has ruled that us laws violate world trade obligations barring abolition or significant modification of the statutes in question the european union and other trading partners could decide to retaliate on us exports this year or next the largest threat involves wto ruling that us export tax benefit the extraterritorial income exclusion eti and its predecessor the foreign sales corporation fsc is an illegal subsidy pursuant to the case and the inability of the united states to repeal the subsidy or find wto compatible substitute the wto in august 2002 granted the eu the right to impose 100 tariffs on 4 billion of us exports to europe some fear th at decision by the eu to retaliate on such large volume of trade the largest sa nction in the history of the wto could ignite transatlantic trade war and deal devastating blow to the ongoing round of global trade negotiations the threat of foreign retaliation against us exports is also possibility in several other cases in which the united stat has been on the losing side of wto dispute panel rulings these include cases involving the antidumping act of 1916 which provides private right of action and criminal penalties against dumping copyright dispute where the us was found to violate royalty rights of eu musicians and trademark dispute involving cuban rum critics including number of members of congress have charged that some of these wto dispute settlement rulings unfairly infringe on us sovereignty by undermining domestic trade re medy laws bush administration trade officials have expressed concerns that some panel rulings legislate ne w obligations and go too far in determining how wto members should comply with adverse panel rulings in response some members reportedly ar considering introduc ing legislation to establish commission of former judges to review wto decisions with view to determining whether the wto is exceedin g its authority others may support changes in the dispute settlement process that could be propos ed and negotiated in the doha development agendahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs68 supporters of the wto dispute resoluti on process argue that the united states was the chief proponent of creating str onger and more binding dispute settlement process they also claim that the system works in keeping markets open to us exports and that us complaints only arise when the system chips away at some of the vestiges of us protection were the united states or other leading wto members to ignore wto findings they argue that the dispute resolution process could be severely weakened legislation was introduced in the 107th congress to settle number of these disputes but none of the bills was brought to the floor on the eti dispute house ways and means committee chairman bill thomas introduced legislation hr 5095 that would repeal the eti and replace it with series of tax benefits that would primarily help companies with ove rseas operations many companies that produce and export primarily from the united stat are not in favor of this approach by contrast senate finance committee leaders are promoting negotiated solution to the dispute perhaps within the cont ext of the doha round of negotiations eu trade officials have repeatedly stated that they only want the united states to amend or repeal the eti in wtoconsistent manner three different bills were introduced to repeal the 1916 antidumping statute but were not acted on while two of th bills would have terminated pending litigation the third would ve grandfathered existing court cases all of which involve eu or japanese companies th united states was to have originally complied by mid2001 but r eceived extensions from the eu and japan the most recent lasting until the adjournment of the past session of congress the eu recently warned that it would resume retaliation procedures in the wto if the us failed to repeal the law in way that would end all existing court cases in the eus successful challenge of us music licensing legislation the united states agreed to pay arbitrated compensation of 33 million to the eu though the eu still seeks change in us law congress authorized 50 million in the trade act of 2002 for fund for the payment of settlements in wto disputes but has not appropriated the funds another wto panel found earlier this year that the united states violated its wto obligations in enacting the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of 2000 also known as the byrd amendmen t which requires the distribution of antidumping and countervailing duties to petitioners and inte rested parties in underlying cases and recommended that the ited states repeal the statute while the united states has appealed the panels findings wto appellate decision upholding the panel may raise legislative i ssues for the united states were the eu to prevail in the dispute the united states would likely need to indicate its compliance plans to the wto in the first half of 2003 the 108th congress may reconsider legislation to bring the united states into compliance with recommendations and rulings formulated by the dispute settlement body dsb of the wto consideration is likely to be given to the eti export subsidy case which is the longest st anding example of noncompliance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31688crs69
