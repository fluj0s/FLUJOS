manufactured by colt defense llc hartford ct army officials are said to be satisfied with th m16 family of weapons suggesting that the m 16 is simply too expensive to replace with anything less than significant leap in technology1 the armys leap ahead program to replace the m16 family of weapons the objective individual combat wea pon oicw program began in 1994 and one weapon evaluated in that program heckler kochs xm8 assault rifle was considered by some as the m16sm4s replacement as late as 2005 the xm8 was reportedly close to being officially approved as the armys new assault rifle but

iraq and afghanistan and who d engaged in firefight using variety of small arms some of the m4speci fic observations were as follows over 50 of soldiers using the m 4 and m16 reported that they never experienced stoppage malfunction while in theater to include during training firing of the weapons p 2 frequency of disassemble d cleaning had effect on the occurrences of stoppages variations in lubricati on practices such as the type of lubrication used and the amount of lubrication applied also had little effect on stoppages using dry lubricant decreased reports for stoppages only for m4 users p 3 of soldiers surveyed who used the m4 89 reported being satisfied with their weapon p 11 of m4 users 20 recommended larg er bullet for the m4 to increase lethality p 30 regarding m16s and m4smany so ldiers and experts in theater commented on the limited ability to effectively stop targets saying that those personnel targets who were s hot multiple times we re still able to continue fighting p 29 although m4 critics cite this report as evidence of unsuitability of the m4 it might also be interpreted as favorable repor t on the m4s overall re liability and acceptance by soldiers the larger bullet recommendation for lethality purposes may in fact be valid recommendation based on observations from iraq and afghanistan but the bigger bullet debate has been source of contention for many small arms experts ever since the army adopted the 556 mm m16 during viet nam in lieu of the 762 mm m14 riflehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22888crs3 6 for additional information on us special

based in ft meade md as an army special missions unit consisting of carefully selected military department of the army civilians and contractors who observe and collect information about the evolving asymmetric operating envir onment by providing advisors to deployed and deploying forces in support in the global war on terrorism15 the army reportedly initially approved awg acquisition and us of hk416s in lieu of m4s but then reversed this decision stating the awg also advises units on training tactics and procedures in this capacity the use of th standard issue m4 is required in support of this mission set the decision was made to transition to the m4 and the awg is now turning in its hk rifles16 report maintains that awg fought to keep its several hundred 416s arguing that they outperform the armys m4 and require far less maintenance because the hk416 operates in similar fashion to the m4 and has comparable performance characteristics it is likely that training tactics and procedures vary greatly between the two weapons ther eby causing some to question the motives behind the armys decision to recall the awgs hk416s m4 reliability testing 2002 marine corps systems

226 stoppages hk416 233 stoppages and the m4 882 stoppages20 on december 17 2007 when the army briefed congress and the press the army reportedly claimed that the m4 suffered only 296 stoppages during the test explaining that the stoppage discrepancy from the original 882 m4 stoppages reporte d could have been due to the application of the army test and evaluation centers posttest reliability availability and maintainability ram scoring conference21 this process attributes failures to such factors as operator error or part failure and as an example if evaluators linked 10 stoppages to broken part on weapon they could eliminate nine of the stoppages and count only one failure for reporting purposes it is not known whether the army also applied the ram process to the other three weapons in the test but it might be assumed that if the other three weapons were given equal trea tment those weapons stoppages w ould also likely be decreased in manner similar to the m4 recent congressional action the administration requested 1511 million in fy2009 for the procurement of 88964 m4 carbines to be produced by colt of hartford ct at 1200 per weapon not including combat optics

testing although many feel that recent tests studies and surveys call into question the armys decision to continue to procure and employ the m4 carbine it can also be argued that the m4 is generally wellregarded by the soldiers who use it in combat and its lethality may be more function of the round used as opposed to the actual weapon itself one potential option for gaining greater insight into this issue might be to outfit selected army infantry companies about 120 soldiers in both iraq and afghanistan with xm8s hk416s and fnh scars for yearlong comparative study with an infant ry company

recently sted its land warrior integrated modular combat system in iraq with an infantry battalion in actual combat ussocom implications of replacing m4s it can be argued that ussocoms decision to adopt the fnh scar has implications for the army in one sense the scar is the firs t modular small arms system adopted by the military the scarl and scarh will replace the follo wing weapons m4a1 mk18 close quarter carbine mk11 sniper security rifle mk 12 special purpose rifle and the m14 rifle24 there is also 90 parts commonality between the scarl and scarh including common upper receiver and stock and trigger housing and an enhanced grenade launcher can be attached to either model25 while the scar might not meet all of the conventional armys requirements its adaptability in terms of missions close quarters combat to long range sniper operations being able to rapidly convert from 556 mm to 762 mm weapon and the ability to accommodate vari ety of modifications such as grenade launchers and special optics might be factors worth considering as the modular armyplans future small arms programs open competition for an m4 replacement some small arms analysts have detected growing frustration among arms makers that the army is wedded to single company26 congress has also asked the army and dod to study and report on the feasibility and advisability of conducting an open compe tition for carbinetype weapons and to develop longterm competitive strategy for small arms if such an effort is undertaken by the army and the other servi ces some might argue that lessons learned from past army small arms initiatives such as the objective individual combat weapon oicw program and more recently ussoco ms special operations combat assault rifle scar program would facilitate ch competition and procurement the scar program involved 10month full and open competition resulting in nine manufacturers submitting 12 w eapons for consideration27 the program was described as operatorenvisioned opera tortested and operator chos enwith navy army and marine special operators being extens ively involved in design and testing28 supporters of competition maintain that number of existing carbine manufacturers are available and that precedent for joint development and testing is already established from their perspective new army initiative would benefit both in terms of reduced procurement time and developmental costs
