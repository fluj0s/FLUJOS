in the total world figures official us estimates are that some 2 to 4 million people are trafficked annually however there are even higher estimates ranging from 4 to 27 million for total numbers of forced or bonded laborers as many as 17500 people are believed to be trafficked to the united states each year human trafficking is now leading source of profits for organized crime syndicates

forced labor or sexual exploitation is both an international and domestic crime and major human rights violation in 2006 the federal bureau of investigations fbi estimated that human trafficking generates approximately 95 billion annually for organized crime1 human trafficking is of great concern to the united states and the international community antitrafficking in persons antitip efforts have accelerated in the united states since the enactment of the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of 2000 pl 106 386 and internationally since the passage of the protocol to prevent suppress and punish trafficking in persons adopted in 2000 congress is continuously reevaluating the efficacity of us antitrafficking laws and programs and since 2000 has passed several antitrafficking statutes for discussion of these statutes see appendix this report focuses on human trafficking both internationally and within the united states the report begins with an overview of human traffi cking including discussion of the definition of human trafficking the scope of the problem globally and an examination of the victims it follows with an analysis of global antitrafficking efforts by the united states and the international community the report then focuses on trafficking into and within the united states examining relief for trafficking victims in the ited states and discussing us law enforcement efforts to combat domestic trafficking the report concludes with an overview of antitrafficking legislation in the 110 th congress and an analysis of policy issues related to human trafficking g6g142g143g146g151g146g157g146g152g151g156g561 severe forms of trafficking in persons have been defined in us law as sex trafficking in which commercial sex act is induced by force fraud or coercion or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age or the recruitment harboring transportation provision or obtaining of person for labor or services through the use of force fraud or coercion for the purpose of subjection to invo luntary servitude peonage debt bondage or slavery 2 the united nations defines human trafficking as the recruitment transportation transfer harboring or receipt of persons by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion of abduction of fraud or deception of the abuse of power or of position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation exploitation includes at minimum the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation forced labor or services slavery servitude or the removal of organs 3 others have put forward slightly different definitions4 in the case of minors there is general agreement in the united 1 this figure was cited in the us department of state trafficking in persons report 2006 june 5 2006

2006 p 50 4 some us officials politicians religious groups and ngovernmental organizations have campaigned to broaden the definition of trafficking to include all forms of pr ostitution whether forced or voluntary on grounds that prostitution is never truly vol untary and that traffickers will simply force their victims to claim to be acting voluntarily however others have rejected this broadened definition arguing that it would impede the capacity of the international community to achieve consensus and act decisively against major traffickers

2000 the united nations drafted two protocols known as the palermo protocols to address trafficking in persons and human smuggling5 trafficking in persons is often confused with alien or human smuggling alien smuggling involves the provision of service generally procurement or transport to people who knowingly consent to that service in order to gain illegal entry into foreign country it ends with the arrival of the migrant at their destination the trafficking protocol considers people who have been traffi cked who are assumed to be primarily women and children as victims who are entitled to protection and broad range of social services from governments in contrast the smuggling protocol considers people who have been smuggled as willing participants in criminal activity who should be given humane treatment and full protection of their rights while being returned to their country of origin 6 some observers contend that smuggling is crime against the state and that smuggled migrants should be immediately deported while trafficking is crime against person whose victims deserve to be given government assistance and protection7 the department of justice asserts that the existence of force fraud or coercion is what distinguishes trafficking from human smuggling8 under us immigration law trafficked alien is victim while an alien who consents to be smuggled may be subject to criminal prosecution and deportation others maintain that there are few clearcut distinctions between trafficking and smuggling cases and that many people who are considered smuggled should actu ally be viewed as trafficking victims some argue that as immigration and border restrictions have tightened smuggling costs have increased and migration routes have become more dangerous putting migrants at high risk of trafficking in some cases smugglers have sold undocumented migrants into situations of forced labor or prostitution in order to recover their costs 9

trafficked annually the overwhelming majority of those trafficked are women and children the international labor organization ilo estimates that there are some 123 million victims of forced labor at any given time of those some 24 million people have been trafficked11 it should be noted that the accuracy of these and other estimates have been questioned the us government accountability office gao released report in 2006 casting doubt on the methodology and reliability of official us government figures it concluded that the us government has not yet established an effective mechanism for estimating the number of victims or for conducting ongoing analysis of trafficking related data that resides within various government agencies 12 figures provided by other international organizations are unlikely to be any more accurate generally the trafficking flows from less developed countries to industrialized nations including the united states or toward neighboring countries with marginally higher standards of living for example south africa is major destination country for men women and children trafficked from neighboring african countries the largest number of victims trafficked internationally are believed to come from asia many women and children trafficked to work in the commercial sex industry ie prostitution also originate from the former soviet union and southeastern europe in recent years latin america and the caribbean and africa have also become major source regions most victims are sent to asia the middle east particularly the oilrich gulf states western europe and north america these global trends are constantly changing however for example recent press reports indicate that combination of newfound energy wealth and lax anti tip law enforcement efforts has transformed russia azerbaijan and kazakhstan into major trafficking destinations 13 throughout the world sex trafficking victims have traditionally ended up in large cities vacation and tourist areas or near military bases where the demand for sex workers is highest but more recently are also ending up in smaller cities and even rural areas in addition to the sex industry victims are trafficked to work in seasonal agriculture manufacturing particularly the garment industry construction and domestic service

to be many in general the criminal business feeds on poverty despair war crisis and ignorance the globalization of the world economy has increased th movement of people across borders legally and illegally especially from poorer to wealthier countries international organized crime has taken advantage of the freer flow of people money goods and services to extend its own international reach other contributing factors include the following the continuing subordination of women in many societies as reflected in economic educational and work opportunity disparities between men and women 14

following the collapse of communism in the former soviet union and eastern europe as well as the wars in the former ugoslavia the lack of opportunity and the eagerness for better life abroad have made many women and girls especially vulnerable to entrapment by traffickers with the weakening of law enforcement in post communist societies criminal organizations have grown and established themselves in the lucrative business of trafficking the high demand worldwide for women and children to work as sex workers sweatshop labor and domestic servants15 the increasing restrictions on legal immigration to many destination countries including the united states and western europehas caused many migrants to turn to alien smugglers and even human traffickers despite the associated risks involved16 the tendency to treat trafficking victims as criminals has made many victims reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement when police raid brothels women are sometimes detained and punished in some countries they are swiftly deported few steps have been taken to provide tip victims with support healthcare and access to justice many tip victims are reluctant to testify against the traffickers or those who hold them fearing retribution since most governments do not offer adequate protection for witnesses17 the inadequacy of laws and law enforcement in some origin transit and destination countries hampers efforts to fight trafficking penalties for trafficking humans for sexual exploitation are often relatively minor compared with those for other criminal activities like drug and gun trafficking the disinterest and in some cases even complicity of governments is another major problem according to state department officials 18 some lawenforcement agencies and governments ignore the plight of trafficking victims and downplay the scope of the trafficking problem in some cases police and other governmental authorities accept bribes and collude with traffickers by selling fake documentation etc many countries still have specific laws aimed at trafficking in persons

these international groups increasingly interact with local networks to pr ovide transportation safe houses local contacts and documentation they are often aided by corrupt police and migration officials traffickers acquire their victims in number of ways20 sometimes women are kidnaped outright in one country and taken forcibly to another in other cases victims are lured with phony job offers traffickers entice victims to migrate voluntarily with false promises of wellpaying jobs in foreign countries as au pairs models dancers domestic workers etc traffickers advertise these jobs as well as marriage opportunities abroad in local newspapers and on the internet russian crime gangs reportedly use marriage agency databases and matchmaking parties to find victims in some cases traffickers approach women or their families directly with offers of lucrative jobs elsewhere after providing transportation and false documents to get victims to their destination they subsequently charge exorbitant fees for those services often creating lifetime debt bondage traffickers have increasingly begun to rely on recruitment technique known as happy trafficking victims who have worked off their debts are released on the condition that they send someone back to replace them this technique enables traffickers to avoid detection by using former victims to do their bidding 21 while there is single victim stereotype majority of trafficked women are under the age of 25 with many in their mid to late teens in latin america for example research indicates that children tend to be trafficked within their own countries while women between the ages of 18 and 30 are often trafficked internationally sometimes with the consent of their husbands or other family members 22 the fear of infection with hiv and aids among customers has driven traffickers to recruit younger women and girls erroneously perceived by customers to be too young to have been infected studies from around the world have suggested numb er of factors that in addition to gender may make certain individuals more vulnerable to trafficking than others poverty and lack of educational and job opportunities in many countries may put children especially girls from families with multiple children at risk race ethnicity and being of low social caste may also increase an individuals vulnerability refugees internally displaced persons and those who are stateless ie lacking identity documents may also be particularly vulnerable to trafficking 23 trafficking victims are often subjected to cruel mental and physical abuse in order to keep them in servitude including beating rape starvation forced drug use confinement and seclusion once victims are brought into destination countries their passports are often confiscated victims are forced to have sex often unprotected with large numbers of partners and to work unsustainably long hours many victims suffer mental breakdowns and are exposed to sexually transmitted diseases including hivaids recent study conducted in six countries in south 19 phil williams trafficking in women the role of transnational organized crime in trafficking in humans cameron

106386 as amended for list of authorizations for all overseas and domestic antitrafficking activities see table b1 in appendix b since many us government agencies do not have line item in their budget requests for trafficking programs andor tip related operations it is often difficult to calculate exact levels of funding that have been appropriated by congress to each agency for trafficking

appropriations and the fact that large portion of tip programs are supp orted by economic support funds which are appropriated to remain available for two years the state department calculates tip

admissible to the united states or obtain waiver of inadmissibility waiver of inadmissibility is also available for health related grounds public charge grounds or criminal grounds if the activities rendering the alien inadmissible were caused by or were incident to the aliens victimization52 waivers are not automatically granted and there is appeal if the inadmissibility waiver is denied this waiver is especially important for those involved in sexual trafficking since prostitution is one of the grounds of inadmissibility specified in the immigration and nationality act ina 53 additionally aliens who are present without being admitted or paroled54 into the united states are inadmissible and would need to obtain waiver to be eligible for t status for example an alien who paid smuggler to

additionally the spouse children or parents of an alien under age 21 in order to avoid extreme hardship may be given derivative t status which is not counted against the numerical limit55 individuals who are eligible for t status may be granted work authorization56 t status is valid for four years and may be extended if 48 this is interpreted in the regulations to apply to those aliens who 1 are present because they are being held in some sort of severe form of trafficking situation 2 were recently liberated from severe form of trafficking or 3 were subject to severe form of trafficking in

secretary of dhs consider whether the country to which the alien would be removed can adequately address the aliens security and mental and physical health needs in addition hr 3887 and s 3061 would amend the requirements for the t visa so that an alien would be eligible if she was present in the united states after being allowed entry to aid in the prosecution of traffickers the bills would also

minimum standards mandated by tvpa and superficial country assessments have compromised their credibility 104 some argue that it is difficult to determine what standards make country eligible for tier 1 they assert that the tier 2 and tier 2 watch list have become catchall categories that include countries which should really be placed on tier 3 according to the gao in addition to lack of clarity in the tier ranking process the tip reports incomplete narratives reduce the reports utility the state department while acknowledging the need to continue to increase the comprehensiv eness of the report believes that keeping the report concise is paramount 105 103 gao july 2006 p 3 gao06825 104 chuang 2006 105 gao july 2006 p 3 gao06825

international trafficking and that both carrots and sticks may be needed to influence the policies of other governments including financial and technical assistance as well as the threat of sanctions some assert that unilateral sanctions when designed in accordance with international norms can incite countries to internalize those norms106 sanctions seem to be most effective when they are clearly defined and evenly applied criteria which some say us trafficking sanctions have not yet met107 for example since 2003 governments in latin america except cuba and venezuela have been subject to partial or full sanctions for failing to meet the minimum standards of tvpa some argue that sanctions will probably only be applied to countries already subject to other sanctionssuch as burma cuba or north koreaand that threatening other countries with sanctions may actually encourage them to become less open to working with the united states others argue that while that may be true in few cases most countries depend on good political and economic relations with the united states nd fear the public humiliation that comes with tier 3 designation as much as actual sanctions

include problems such as forced labor sex slavery and domestic servitude although the us government funds programs to combat all types of trafficking in persons some observers believe that the government focuses too much on sex slavery as opposed to nonsexual labor exploitation they argue that too large percentage of the us antitrafficking budget has been directed to ngos focused on rescuing women and children from the commercial sex industry however inventories of us antitrafficking programs since 2004 appear to counter these claims as they show us support for wide variety of ngos that strive to protect victims and prosecute traffickers engaged in all types of human trafficking 108 tip reports since 2005 have placed an added emphasis on evaluating country efforts to combat trafficking for forced labor

in the united states have sought to broaden the definition of trafficking in persons to include all forms of prostitution but many countries have thus far rejected those attempts proponents of this broader definition of trafficking in persons argue that prostitution is not sex work it is violence against women that exists because men are given social moral and legal permission to buy women on demand 109 opponents including many european and latin american countries have legal and regulated prostitution and argue that this broadened definition would impede the capacity of the international community to achieve consensus and work together to combat trafficking 106 sarah h cleveland norm internationalization and us economic sanctions yale journal of international law 2001 1 31 107 chuang

and trafficking in persons are inextricably linked us officials argue that where prostitution is legalized or tolerated there is greater demand for human trafficking victims and nearly always an increase in the number of women and children trafficked into commercial sex slavery the trafficking victims protection reauthorization act of 2003 pl 108193 restricts antitrafficking funds to groups that oppose prostitution critics have argued that this policy excludes the people who are most able to report and combat abuses within the sex industry prostitutes themselves and may hinder the success of wellestablished antitip programs they believe that giving prostitutes some measure of legitimacy short of legalization reduces the risk that they will be exposed to the dangers of trafficking 110

most of the trafficking victims advocacy community and groups working to end trafficking are supportive of the t status nonetheless these groups have raised concerns about aspects of the application process that may impede victims from applying for t status or create difficulties for the victims to meet the standards of t status some advocacy groups have questioned whether the t status protects the victims or is primarily tool for law enforcement nonetheless there was opposition to the creation of the t status opponents of the t status contend that the new status rewards criminal behavior immigrant benefits are scarce and some argued that there are more meritorious people w ho deserve the benefits such as those who have been waiting to come into the country though legal methods some argue that there is need to protect the victims but that they are being given more access to public benefits than are relatives of united states citizens additionally others ex pressed concern about the possibility of abuse of t status for example some aliens who had know ingly and willfully violated the law may claim that they were coerced after they were arrested by dhs as discussed above between fy2002 and june 14 2007 dhs approved 929 applications for t1 status while it is estimated that at least 14500 aliens are trafficked into the united states each year the comparatively small number of t visas issued relative to the estimates of trafficking into the united states raises some questions is the number of noncitizen trafficking victims in the united states overestimated is the united states government doing poor job locating and identifying victims 111 g21g157g155g146g151g144g142g151g140g162g561g152g143g561g22g561g6g142g157g142g155g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561 the

t status the t classification provides an immigration mechanism for cooperating victims to remain mporarily in the united states to assist in investigations and prosecutions and provide humanitarian protection to the victims some are concerned that the emphasis on aiding law enforcement is more important than aiding the victims and note that controversial aspect of the continued presence provision is that federal agents may supersede victims wishes and require the victim to remain in the united states if the victims departure is deemed prejudicial to the interests of the united states 115 others argue however that the only mechanism for ending trafficking is by encouraging the victims cooperation in the prosecution and investigation

are few safe housing options for victims of trafficking shelters in many areas are full or inaccessible and domestic violence shelters are illequipped to meet the safety needs of trafficking victims 116 other advocacy groups such as the collation to abolish slavery and trafficking castcontend that forcing victims to aid in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers may endanger the victims families who remain in the home country especially when the trafficker is deported back to the country they argue that there needs to be some mechanism to either ensure the victims families safety in their home country or reunite the families with the victims in the united states117 dianne post an attorney for the arizona coalition against domestic violence argues that the tvpa may create problems for victims because victims can not receive services and benefits until they apply for t status and if they do not speak english they can not fill out the application without help often they will need

1990s it has been addressed as priority by congress as well as the clinton and bush administrations as part of former president clintons announced international crime control strategy an interagency working group was set up to address international crime implications of trafficking on march 11 1998 president clinton issued directive establishing us governmentwide antitrafficking strategy of 1 prevention 2 protection and support for victims and 3 prosecution of traffickers 119 the strategy as announced had strong domestic and international policy components in the area of prevention the administration outlined the need for programs to increase economic opportunities for potential victims and dissemination of information in other countries to increase public awareness of trafficking dangers and funding for more research on trafficking in terms of victim protection and assistance the administration argued for legislation to provide shelter and support services to victims who are in the country unlawfully and therefore presently ineligible for assistance it pressed for the creation of humanitarian nonimmigrant visa classification to allow victims to receive temporary resident status so they could receive assistance and help to prosecute traffickers also support was sought for developing countries to protect and reintegrate trafficking victims once they were returned as far as prosecution and enforcement the administration pressed for laws to more effectively go after traffickers and increase the penalties they can face in addition restitution for trafficked victims was sought in part by creating the possibility of bringing private civil lawsuits against traffickers the department of justice doj called for laws that would expand the definition of involuntary servitude criminalize broader range of actions constituting involuntary servitude and increase the penalties for placing people in involuntary servitude justice department spokesmen also urged that prosecutors be give the capability to go after those who profit from trafficking not just those directly involved in trafficking 120 they also called for amending immigration statutes to punish traffickers who entrap victims by taking their passports and identification from them on the domestic side workers exploitation task force chaired by the department of justices civil rights division and the solicitors office in the department of labor was charged with investigating and prosecuting cases of exploitation and trafficking in addition the department of justice reviewed existing us criminal laws and their enforcement to see if they adequately dealt with the crime of trafficking 119 for discussion of this directive see department of state office of the historian history of the

domestically us antitrafficking activities are authorized by the trafficking victims protection act tvpa of 2000 pl 106386 as amended table b1 lists trafficking authorization for fy2006fy2011 figures for fy2008fy2011 are estima tes based on the levels proposed in hr 3887 and s 3061 those authorizations are for tip operations including law enforcement investigations and tip programs since many us government agencies do not have line item in their budget requests for trafficking programs andor tiprelated operations it is often difficult to calculate the exact level of funding that congress appropriated for trafficking activities programs and operationslaw enforcement activities by agency despite the challenges the office of management and budget tracks estimated tip appropriations levels by gathering agency estimations of tiprelated spending for each fiscal year see table b2 for tip authorizations versus appropriations for fy2001fy2007 according to omb funding for tv pa programs comes from appropriations to number of us departments and agencies including the department of state economic support fund migration and refugee assistance international narcotics control and law enforcement incle assistance the department of justice victims of trafficking grants criminal and civil rights programs and the federal bureau of investigations the department of labor bureau of international labor affairs the department of health and human services and the department of homeland security immigration and customs enforcement in fy2007 aggregate appropriations for international antitrafficking activities amounted to an estimated 633 million down from 664 million in fy2006 the bulk of that funding supported antitip programs in foreign countries that are administered by the department of state the us agency for international development and the department of labor domestic antitip activities include both services to victims as well as law enforcement operations investigations into human trafficking are complex and as result often require significant resources according to omb in fy2006 congress appropriated 1135 for domestic antitip activities an increase of 386 million over the fy2005 appropriations level of 749 million approximately 176 20 million of the fy2006 appropriations were used for trafficking victims services while the majority of the appropriated monies funded the antitip efforts of domestic law enforcement agencies including the federal bureau of investigations 475 million and immigration and customs enforcement 119 million due to the methodological difficulties involved in calculating tip appropriations and the fact that large portion of tip programs are supp orted by economic support funds which are appropriated to remain available for two years the state department calculates tip obligations by agency per fiscal year according to gtip this generates the best estimate of the amount of funding spent on tip programs by agency for each fiscal year in fy2007 the us government obligated an estimated 794 million in antitrafficking assistance to foreign governments up from 740 million in fy2006 international antitip program totals are compared to roughly 229 million obligated in fy2007 and 286 million obligated in fy2006 for domestic antitip programs they do not include the costs of tip operations or law
