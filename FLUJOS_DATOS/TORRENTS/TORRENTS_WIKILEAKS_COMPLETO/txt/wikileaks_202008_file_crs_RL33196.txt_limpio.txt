division congressional research service the library of congress the earthquake in south asia humanitarian assistance and relief operations summary on october 8 2005 powerful earthquake struck northern pakistan and india killing at least 74000 people and injuring over 70000 more the earthquake damaged the homes of millions of people forcing more than 28 million to search for alternative means of shelter the full extent of the destruction is now being revealed as government authorities and relief organizations are able to access some of the remote locations the united states government usg has pledged 510 million toward the relief effort almost all of it to assisting pakistan which remains key us ally in the war against terror because of the heavy usg military and development presence in neighboring afghanistan the logistics of bringing resources into pakistan have been relatively straightforward the usg government of pakistan and nato among others operated daily relief flights to ferry supplies personnel and victims to and from the region the earthquake struck region that lies along the southern reaches of the himalayan mountains while delivering humanitarian assistance and gaining full access was critical one of the main humanitarian priorities early on was ensuring that the estimated three million people who lost their homes had adequate protection from winter weather and diseases extensive preparation and coordinated relief efforts helped greatly to mitigate against the impact of winter aid agencies continue to provide much needed assistance and are now planning for the transition from relief to reconstruction which is scheduled to take place in april november public poll suggests that the usgs aid effort has improved ordinary pakistanis opinions of the united states although apparent us missile attacks on pakistani territory in december 2005 and january 2006 and anger over the february publication in european newspapers of cartoons deemed offensive to muslims reinvigorated antiwestern and antiamerican sentiments among some segments of the pakistani populace some experts have raised concerns that the economic burden of the disaster could contribute toward longterm instability in an area perceived to be of critical importance to the united states in the war on terror it remains to be seen what progress is made in the recovery and reconstruction phase and what impact this may have on public opinion immediately following the disaster legislative activity included the introduction of several resolutions expressing sympathy for those affected by the earthquake pledging american support for the victims and lauding the relief efforts of us personnel additional funds were not added to the regular fy2006 foreign operations spending measure for earthquake relief but the fy2006 supplemental request proposes 1263 million for pakistan earthquake relief the housepassed bill fully funds the request for pakistan earthquake

background introduction powerful earthquake of magnitude 76 on the richter scale struck northern pakistan at 850 am local time on october 8 2005 its epicenter was near the city of muzaffarabad 65 miles north northeast of islamabad pakistan and near the frontier with india the earthquake was felt as far away as new delhi india and kabul afghanistan1 the vast majority of the deaths over 73000 occurred in pakistan most of them in the pakistanicontrolled portions of the disputed territory of kashmir the fatality count in india stands at 1309 afghanistan registered four deaths2 the former princely state of jammu and kashmir as it is called in india or azad free jammu and kashmir as it is known in pakistan has been source of contention between india and pakistan since the two countries gained their independence from great britain in 19473 although the earthquake has led to certain amount of rapprochement between new delhi and islamabad including the 1 united states geological survey

sections of this report comparisons to past disasters the full extent of the damage caused by the earthquake in south asia continues to unfold but more indepth assessments now provide clearer indicators of the overall disaster although its toll in human lives appears to be less than third of that of the december 2004 indian ocean tsunami current reports indicate that damage to pakistans economy and infrastructure has been substantial table 1 presents list of the ten deadliest natural disasters of the past century based principally on the emergency events database emdat maintained by the world health organizations who centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters cred although cred makes efforts to ensure the reliability of its data it must be cautioned that obtaining precise and accurate information about natural disasters many of which occurred decades ago and in areas where political and environmental conditions made data collection difficult is not possible thus casualty figures stemming from for instance the series of deadly floods in china that took place halfcentury ago must all be taken as very rough approximations even the figures for the recent tsunami vary to some degree from source to source and must be considered estimates on the whole however the emdat because of its explicit definitions and uniform criteria for event inclusion provides the best means of comparing data across different disasters4 table 1 deadliest natural disasters since 1900 estimated date location event fatalities july 1931 china huang he river flood 37 million

most significant of which have claimed as many as twenty million victims the events are excluded because of the difficulty in pinpointing their locations and timing and more importantly the extent to which they were exacerbated or created by humans it would be difficult to argue for instance that the recent north korean famines which have likely claimed several hundred thousand lives over several years are entirely natural in their origin usgs lists official death toll at 255000 some reports indicate toll as high as 655000 b the usgs lists death toll from earthquake and tsunami at 283106 c month unknown although its nearly 73000 fatalities rank it as truly major calamity the recent earthquake in south asia was not among the ten deadliest natural disasters of the last century5 relief update6 overview relief to recovery it is expected that the relief operation will come to an end in april roughly six months after the october 8 2005 earthquake at which point the recovery and reconstruction phase will officially be launched the system in coordination with the gop and others centrally involved in the relief effort has developed the action plan from relief to recovery the action plan which will propose stronger coordination mechanism and concrete project proposals to support pakistan in its recovery efforts the plan is scheduled to be released at the sixmonth point on april 8 the recovery stage is expected to cover one year7 as 5 the december 2004 tsunami however was the tsunami was unique in both the extent of its damage and the number of countries it affected unlike other disasters which have been relatively more localized the tsunami struck thousands of miles of populous coastline in nearly dozen countries affecting millions of people also the deaths of thousands of tourists from the industrialized world vacationing in southern thailand and sri lanka mostly europeans but also many americans and japanese may have given the indian ocean tsunami higher profile than the more recent south asian earthquake indeed there has been some concern that donors who contributed to the tsunami relief effort may be less enthusiastic about assisting victims of the second major south asian natural disaster to strike in less than year the pakistan federal relief commission frc also provides comparison of the two natural disasters and specifically focuses on the number of people impacted terrain and access of the areas affected number of helicopters provided in the relief effort and number of pledges realized as commitments 6 tom coipuram information research specialist contributed to the update of this section 7 the united nations special envoy for the south asia earthquake former us president george hw bush met in march with key representatives at the

end nato completed its mission on february 1 2006 and the phased withdrawal of us forces will end on march 31 overall the relief effort is seen as success so far moreover the fears of second wave of deaths massive population movements malnutrition and disease were not realized8 government agencies and humanitarian organizations have identified number of critical needs to be addressed during the remainder of the relief operation these include maintaining relief operations improving camp sanitation and preparing for the return of internally displaced persons idps9 it is anticipated that cooperation between the gop provincial and local governments and the aid community will continue in the transition to recovery operation numbers at glance in addition to the 74651 deaths recorded so far over 69000 injuries have been reported in pakistan and 6622 in india the federal relief commission frc in pakistan adds another 58897 as other injured the international organization for migration iom estimates more than 28 million people were displaced as result of the earthquake and most require alternative shelter10 all of the figures could change as government authorities and humanitarian organizations continue to survey remote areas and reconcile their information the onset of winter made access to these areas even more difficult11 table 2 summarizes the number of people affected by

presented major challenges in the relief operation and delayed or prevented access to many of the earthquake victims12 three weeks after the earthquake the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs unocha estimated that 30 of the affected areas of northern pakistan were still inaccessible to relief workers leaving as many as 200000 people unable to receive assistance in the days after the earthquake landslides blocked many key road links then winter conditions presented potentially formidable challenge although the recently declared that the battle to assist and sustain the millions of homeless survivors had gone well due to the mild winter extensive preparation and massive international aid13 according to deputy humanitarian aid coordinator jamie mcgoldrick it was very kind weather the number of helicopters we had at our disposal also helped and people didnt come down from the mountains and overburden the towns14 throughout the relief operation there has been continuing reliance on aircraft to ferry in supplies and transport the wounded the world food program wfp reports that although the weather has improved roads are still blocked the snow line has receded significantly since its maximum on the 19th of january 2006 and significant further snowfall is forecast at this moment however heavy rains continued to hamper relief efforts in some areas and have caused fatal landslides for the local population and staff15 melting snow is only adding to the problem 12 in the months following the earthquake there have been more than 2000 seismic aftershocks 13 mcguirk rod airlifts save 3 million pakistan quake survivors ap march 9 2006 14 ibid 15 wfp emergency report 11 march 11 2006 httpwwwwfporgenglishmoduleid78key679586 crs6 road closures delay food dispatches and idp returns mcgoldrick also said that road accessibility will remain major challenge and it is expected that there will be continued need for minimum of five or six helicopters until at least september16 unocha reports that landslides and falling rock are expected through the july monsoon season and it will likely take months to repair and open roads17 for example in muzaffarabad rain has impeded wfp and other logistics and cargo services in neelum and jhelum valleys entrances are temporarily closed until further estimation of the damage is assessed18 in february and early march strikes and demonstrations in pakistan temporarily disrupted relief activities however the security situation has stabilized in the earthquake affected areas by late march the situation was reported to be relatively calm and relief operations are back to normal coordination with so many international and domestic actors and agencies on the ground one of the most important issues is coordination of relief activity reportedly 70 local ngos 69 international ngos and organizations and 23 agencies have been providing relief assistance as will be discussed in further detail later in the report several sources indicated that the gop was slow to organize its own response to the earthquake and to coordinate the host of international actors involved in the relief effort according to assessments of the usaid disaster assessment and response team dart the gops performance steadily improved and information was more effectively centralized at the macrolevel by the frc the gops performance at the regional level has varied from location to location and has depended on local capacity and the assistance provided by international relief agencies19 humanitarian relief sectors the primary locus of international coordination remains unocha which has established four regional coordination centers in muzaffarabad mansehra bagh and batagram20 the major humanitarian actors initially divided the relief effort sectorally into ten relief sectors or clusters with different organization taking the lead for each sector as follows emergency shelter

that there is deadline26 emergency shelter with an estimated three million left homeless by the earthquake in the foothills of the himalayas provision of emergency shelter before the onset of winter was among the most pressing priorities facing humanitarian workers unocha reported that many residents of highland areas preferred to stay on their land through the winter rather than descend to emergency camps in the valleys in response the pakistani military and the humanitarian community have been seeking to rebuild as many shelters as possible in these areas27 according to news sources

come not only from the government and military but also from nongovernmental groups including militant organizations as well as individual pakistanis acting on their own the gop created federal relief commission frc on october 10 2006 to coordinate relief efforts president musharraf established the earthquake reconstruction and rehabilitation authority erra on october 12 to oversee reconstruction

building design and food security agriculture and livestock activities efforts are being made to include the gop in recovery planning and implementation and representatives are involved in the humanitarian cluster meetings43 while the gop has received credit from several sources for its efforts it has also been criticized for responding too slowly to the disaster several media reports discussed below have contrasted this delayed reaction with the swift work of several islamist political parties and militants which were reported on several occasions to be the first to provide relief to victims there has also been criticism of the militarys control over relief coordination and the degree to which there may be duplication on relief and reconstruction efforts for its part the government of india goi has announced that it does not need outside assistance in dealing with the aftermath of the earthquake this stance has been the subject of some criticism as domestic aid has at times been slow to reach victims pakistan the gop reportedly has estimated that it will cost pakistan 5 billion to recover from the earthquake the world bank places the figure at 52 billion44

arteries except the laswa bypass and had restored 70 of lost electrical power 75 of the water supply and 96 of telecommunications an earlier report stated that the gop had cleared 1015 of the

criticism of government response president pervez musharraf and his government have been criticized by some for not responding more swiftly to the earthquake it has been reported that the pakistani army did not begin bringing supplies into affected areas until october 12 four days after the earthquake struck and even then according to some sources the army appeared thin on the ground49 ayaz amir columnist for the influential and generally perceived as pro government pakistani newspaper dawn stated from hazara to azad kashmir voices arising from the deepest recesses of the heart will tell you how grateful they are to the people of pakistan who came unbidden in their hour of need i heard this in balakot amidst the ruins and i heard this in muzaffarabad but as god is my witness in all this wide arc of disaster not one word not single one did i hear in praise of the government or the army50 pakistans opposition parties also criticized president musharraf and the army for slow response and alleged mismanagement of the relief operation they launched motion shortly after the earthquake calling on the government to give full accounting of the relief efforts to pakistans parliament the government has failed to organize the crisis management their motion stated the matter is very serious and needs to be discussed on the floor of the house some opposition members have accused general musharraf of using the crisis to aggrandize his own power everything from the relief to the foreign donations is being controlled by the army and it is not accountable to anyone said sherry rehman member of parliament from the opposition pakistan peoples party51 in response to such charges president musharraf has asserted that the government and the military have done good if not very good job52 he compared the pakistani response to that of the us government in the wake of hurricane katrina in this type of calamity country can have 100 percent success even the united states cannot do it53 musharraf also criticized the international community for its double standard by comparing the earthquake to the katrina response in another way i know that the contributions to katrina were much

oversight of earthquake relief the government appears not to have responded in detail to the charges by the pakistani opposition that it is cutting parliament out of the relief effort continued disagreement means that some see the situation as unfortunate in the backdrop of national tragedy humanitarian issue is being used to twist the ruling partys arm and running the risk that prolonged negotiations may well be outpaced by progress on the ground55 it is also worth noting that president musharraf has decided to postpone planned purchase of f16 fighters from the united states in order to concentrate on earthquake relief efforts the deal is still on hold but expected in 2006 the opposition pakistan peoples party ppp has demanded that the government defer 1 billion weapons deal with sweden56 militant groups provide aid while the gop was criticized by some observers for slow reaction it was stated by many sources that some militant groups acted very quickly to provide aid to victims jamaatuldawa an islamic extremist group with alleged ties to alqaida has been playing an active role in relief operations in muzaffarabad where it is reportedly operating field hospital that performs twenty surgeries day jamaatuldawa is an affiliate of lashkare taiba usdesignated foreign terrorist organization57 the gulf times reports that banned pakistani militant groups have not only played an active role in providing immediate aid after the earthquake but are also soliciting and collecting funds for further relief efforts58 the islamic militant group hizbul mujahideen which has condemned recent violence against civilians in kashmir is also active in the relief effort59 many of those receiving assistance appear to see the involvement of militant groups as positive development some experts acknowledge these groups have played an important role in the relief effort and hope that by seeing the benefits of relief work they will relinquish violence for more peaceful mainstream political ambitions others fear that the involvement of these groups only empowers them provision of relief does not mean they have given up their ideology and may only 55 parliamentary oversight of

the road to disaster the independent november 10 2005 crs15 increase their presence in the affected areas in the long run this could infringe on democracy and tolerance60 the same washington post reporter who observed very few army vehicles on the roads four days after the earthquake noticed that road he was on was crowded with private relief convoys many belonging to the social service arm of jamaate islami pakistans largest and bestorganized islamic party61 which reportedly has ties to the palestinian militant group hamas62 although there is some evidence that the united states is receiving positive feedback in pakistan for its role in assisting relief efforts see below some have speculated that the high visibility of islamist groups may bode badly for both president musharraf and the united states musharraf already seen as western stooge by islamist groups has been criticized for the pace of the operations that many worry is going to affect the popularity of an already unpopular united states and public opinion about musharraf63 to some extent the efforts by islamist groups to aid victims may be seen as part of larger outpouring of support by ordinary pakistanis who may have found sense of unity in the crisis that many felt has been lacking in the past pakistan has long been country divided by ethnicity class and even to some extent religion recent survey conducted by the pew research global attitudes project found that of six muslim countries surveyed pakistanis are far more likely to see themselves as muslims first 79 than they are as national citizens first 764 according to husain haqqani an expert on pakistan at the carnegie endowment pakistans disparate elements have been held together for many years with selfconsciously constructed official ideology characterized by the belief that pakistans success depends on an islamic nationalism confrontation with india and external alliances with the west65 these bonds have worked with varying success over the years as pakistani opinions about the west and its relationship to islam have changed it is against this backdrop some experts believe that the outpouring of support from 60

navtej sarna the foreign ministry spokesman when there are offers by friendly countries and anything is needed these offers are considered the goi has responded to the earthquake by moving thousands of tents blankets tarpaulins and woollen garments as well as tons of medicine water and food to the affected area68 as noted above the earthquake caused far less damage in india than it did in pakistan there is sense however that the indian official response has at least as much to do with political posturing as it does with perceived needs on the ground the decision to go it alone has attracted some criticism amidst complaints that crucial supplies such as tents are failing to reach victims69 us humanitarian assistance shortly after the earthquake the united states pledged 50

disasters is speculative undertaking authority definitions and categories of services are not necessarily equivalent across events each agency has its own budget with its own criteria accounting detail and regional specificity the fact that an urgent response to humanitarian crises is often required only compounds the problem budgets may reflect regional support certain area specific countries or combination thereof over time and with changing events even if we accept that usg aid is comparable across disasters the disasters themselves are not equivalent the areas in which they occur differ dramatically in terrain underlying economic conditions and governmental capacity it thus makes little sense to compare for example the amount of usg aid delivered per casualty even the decision to look at fatalities as the measure of disasters severity can be questioned in part because of the difficulty of obtaining accurate figures in assessing the amount of aid provided to disasters it may make more sense to look at the economic damage each has caused measured in this way the seven greatest international natural disasters of the last ten years are 1 the 1995 earthquake in kobe japan 95 billion in damage 2 the 1998 flood in china 30 billion 3 the 2004 earthquake in niigata japan 24 billion 4 the 1997 wildfires in indonesia 17 billion 5 the 1995 flood in north korea 15 billion 6 the 1995 earthquake in taiwan 141 billion and 7 the 1996 flooding in china 126 billion the united states if included in this list would garner spot for hurricane katrina which caused 25 billion in damage81 once again however such comparison may conceal more than it reveals major factor affecting the economic severity of natural disaster is clearly the economic prosperity of the area in which it occurs the kobe earthquake was expensive because japan was so well off furthermore obtaining reliable and consistent figures for the cost of recovering from natural disaster is notoriously difficult estimates range tremendously depending upon the criteria used for instance replacement cost vs auction cost vs assessed value of damaged property and the organization doing the estimate comparing usg and international aid is even more difficult because of the often dramatically different forms the assistance takes inkind contributions vs cash for instance finally it is not always evident whether figures represent pledges of support or more specific obligations 81 estimates are once again from emdat op cit crs22 the us emergency response mechanism the united states is generally leader and major contributor to relief efforts in humanitarian disasters82 in 2004 the united states contributed more than 24 billion to disaster relief worldwide83 in the case of both the south asian earthquake and the indian ocean earthquake and tsunami some say that the response will require major longterm effort beyond the relief and recovery operation currently underway84 the president has broad authority to provide emergency assistance for foreign disasters and the united states government provides disaster assistance through several united states agencies the very nature of humanitarian disasters the need to respond quickly in order to save lives and provide relief has resulted in an rather unrestricted definition of what this type of assistance consists of at both policy and an operational level while humanitarian assistance is assumed to provide for urgent food shelter and medical needs the agencies within the us government providing this support typically expand or contract the definition in response to circumstances funds may be used for us agencies to deliver the services required or to provide grants to international organizations ios international governmental and nongovernmental organizations ngos as well as private or religious voluntary organizations pvos usaid is the us agency charged with coordinating us government and private sector assistance it also coordinates with international organizations the governments of countries suffering disasters and other governments the office of foreign disaster assistance ofda in usaids bureau

equipment in response to disaster86 generally ofda provides emergency from thirty to ninety days after disaster the same is true for department of defense humanitarian assistance after the initial emergency is over assistance is provided through other channels such as the regular country development programs of usaid the state department also administers programs for humanitarian relief with

basic needs to community services international assistance in addition to the united states great many international actors are also providing relief to the earthquakeaffected region either through financial contributions to the pakistani government or aid organizations or by directly providing relief supplies and emergency personnel reportedly 70 local ngos 69 international ngos and organizations and 23 agencies provided relief assistance obtaining an exact uptodate record of all international contributions is not possible in part because some assistance is not reported to

with each other and define partners traditionally prm funds unhcr and other multilateral actors while usaid creates bilateral arrangements with ngos this is not hard and fast rule however and both organizations exercise degree of latitude in their response to crises crs24 coordinating agencies and in part because of the delay in their recording89 the vast majority of the funding is going to

funds pledged for relief and reconstruction at the november donors conference in islamabad stands at 69 billion to pakistan to assist in relief and recovery efforts exceeding the gops goal of 52 billion major contributors include the asian development bank 1 billion the islamic development bank 501 million and the european union 270 million90 it is not clear how much has been received to date flash appeal on october 11 2005 unocha released multiagency appeal for 312 million in urgent humanitarian assistance to earthquakeaffected areas of pakistan the appeal was revised to 550 million at donors meeting on october 26 despite the higherthanexpected pledge totals announced at the november 19 meeting in islamabad the flash appeal was initially underfunded as of midfebruary 2006 the total amount pledged towards the flash appeal was 371 million91 breakdown of the appeal by receiving organization is provided in appendix b according to the united nations the usg has so far contributed approximately 288 million toward the appeal see table 3 the disparity between overall funding of the relief effort and contributions toward the appeal is due to several factors many countries including the usg are providing assistance in the form of direct contributions of items such as blankets food and tents or through the operation of relief flights and logistics support much of this assistance is coordinated directly with the gop or the pakistani military in addition to direct bilateral assistance good deal of funding has been provided to ngos operating outside of the appeal while the flash appeal focuses on early recovery efforts in the initial six months after the earthquake the majority of funding pledged by the donor community is towards longerterm reconstruction efforts and will be addressed in the action plan there will not be new appeal as such to fund the activities under the 89 for the latest pledge numbers see reliefwebs site httpwwwreliefwebintrwdbcnsf

pakistan nato flew over 169 relief flights from these two bases providing nearly 3500 tons of relief supplies including blankets stoves tents and food nato also deployed specialist troops engineers and medical units from the nato response force teams began to arrive on october 2994 nato helicopters lifted more than 1700 tons of relief supplies in country and evacuated more than 7600 people medical teams treated more than 8000 patients engineers cleared roads built shelters and schools and set up medical centers in total the operation involved approximately 1000 engineers and supporting

use of resources95 issues for congress us image in pakistan effects on war against terror there has been some discussion in the media about the effects of the us relief effort on pakistani perceptions of the united states and more specifically the us government this issue is seen as important because president musharrafs government is key us ally in the global war on terror many highranking members of qaeda and the taliban are believed to remain in the rugged regions of northwest pakistan and the ability of the united states to locate and capture them likely depends on pakistans cooperation at the same time musharrafs relationship with the united states is not supported by large portion of the pakistani population widelycited survey taken by the pew center before the earthquake found that 23 of the pakistani public had favorable view of the united states while 51 had favorable impression of osama bin laden96 more recent systematic public polling of pakistani opinion on this issue by terror free tomorrows survey conducted between november 1428 2005 showed significant shift in public opinion favorable views of the united states jumped to 46 and support for osama bin laden dropped to 33 those conducting the poll believe the shift is direct result of the provision of us humanitarian assistance to earthquake victims97 some argue that sustaining relief and reconstruction assistance may prove to be important in creating support for the united states while at the same time undermining support for global terrorists the degree to which the united states receives positive press for its contributions to the earthquake relief effort may also make it easier for musharraf to support us antiterror activity in the region however apparent us missile attacks on pakistani territory in december 2005 and january 2006 and anger over the february publication in european newspapers of cartoons deemed offensive to muslims reinvigorated antiwestern and anti american sentiments among some segments of the pakistani populace violent public protests in february appeared to have strong antiamerican and anti 95 for further information see nato lessons learned in

free tomorrow poll dramatic change of public opinion in the muslim world crs27 musharraf components and many analysts believe that islamist leaders are manipulating public sentiments to forward their own political goals further disappointment with the united states arose in march with widespread perception among pakistanis that president bushs visit to the region made stark their countrys subordinate position to india with regard to us policy making98 late in 2005 several reporters presented anecdotal evidence suggesting that the united states is reaping something of public relations dividend because of its involvement it was reported that us relief efforts in pakistan had been quite visible on pakistani television news broadcasts and thus reached fairly broad cross section of the population99 reporters encounters with pakistanis living and working in affected areas also support this several individuals made point of telling the journalist that they were grateful for western aid100 academics and commentators as well reported perceptible change in pakistani attitudes toward the united states101 there were some positive reports in pakistani media as well although they are perhaps thinner than in the american press the nation for instance printed an opinion piece praising the united states for its efforts in saving pakistani lives and excoriating critics of the united states102 this latter sentiment however appeared to indicate that sizable number of pakistanis remained critical of the united states indeed pakistani officials and political analysts cautioned that any change in perceptions might be limited to moderate urban pakistanis and unlikely to sway the countrys small core of militants who support qaeda103 as noted earlier some commentators have speculated that the pace of pakistans response could by implication affect public opinion about the united states which is widely seen as supporting the rule of generalcumpresident pervez musharraf the greatest criticism of us involvement appears to come from the pakistani political opposition especially from islamist parties one of whose leaders has said that pakistan does not need any foreign including american and nato support104 similar complaints about nato were expressed by the leader of the opposition party pakistan muslim leaguen who worried about the presence of foreign soldiers on

october 29 2005 it was not clear whether rehman was speaking on behalf of the entire opposition or only his own coalition of six islamic parties crs28 or any other country105 in response to such concerns pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz has gone on record saying that nato poses security threat they are here to help us even if they are in uniform it should not be cause of concern106 other experts focus on objections to president musharrafs decision to authorize natos relief mission without consultation or approval by the parliament this may have led opposition groups to disagree with natos involvement even if they might otherwise have supported it107 burdensharing and donor fatigue although the united states is the worlds largest provider of foreign assistance in absolute terms it is often one of the lowest contributors when measured as percentage of its economic capacity according to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the united states provided 016 of its gross national income gni in 2004 for overseas disaster assistance oda by comparison the average of major donors is 025 the percentages for other major donors are as follows japan 019 the united kingdom 036 france 042 and germany 028 in previous disasters pledges made by governments have not always resulted in actual contributions the earthquake of december 2003 in bam iran is but one example raised by the united nations concerning the billions of dollars pledged to help the victims of the tsunami disaster there is skepticism whether all these pledges will be honored it also cannot be assumed that the funds committed to relief actually represent new contributions since the money may previously have been allocated elsewhere it will take time for more complete picture to reveal how the actual costs of the tsunami disaster will be shared among international donors108 in the case of the october south asia earthquake amir abdulla wfp regional director for the middle east central asia and eastern europe commented early on that it is extremely worrying that the international community which was so generous after the indian ocean tsunami has so far failed to come up with an adequate response to this crisis after slow start as of midfebruary the united nations had received twothirds of its flash appeal of 550 million109 some experts are concerned about funding priorities and resources for other disaster areas and real possibility of international donor fatigue finding balance between burdensharing on the one hand and donor fatigue on the other often results

in september key donor countries pledged 150 million for an emergency fund to allow the united nations to respond more quickly to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies the central emergency response fund cerf is seen by proponents as way to enable the united nations to respond more efficiently effectively and consistently to humanitarian crises worldwide competing aid and budget priorities110 amid efforts to tackle rising budget deficits by among other measures slowing or reducing discretionary spending finding the resources to sustain us aid pledges may be difficult after the tsunami disaster some members of congress publicly expressed concern that funding for tsunami relief and reconstruction which depleted most worldwide disaster contingency accounts could jeopardize resources for subsequent international disasters or for other aid priorities from which tsunami emergency aid had been transferred111 these accounts were fully restored through supplemental appropriations at the time others noted the substantial size of american private donations for tsunami victims and argued that because of other budget pressures the united states did not need to transfer additional aid the point remains however that when disasters require immediate emergency relief the administration may fund pledges by depleting most worldwide disaster accounts in order to respond to future humanitarian crises however these resources would need to be replenished or it could curtail us capacity to respond to other emergencies from relief to recovery the cost of rebuilding the earthquakes effect on pakistans economy remains to be seen the majority of the countrys industry is located in the south well away from the earthquake zone for this reason some observers believe that the disaster will not have serious impact on the pakistani economys impressive growth rate the world bank for instance has slightly revised its prediction for pakistans fy2006 growth in gross domestic product gdp from 65 to 61112 nevertheless the costs of rebuilding the damaged infrastructure in the north as well as caring for the millions of affected pakistanis are expected to seriously strain the pakistan governments capacity some observers have cautioned against overly optimistic projections113 transparency some members of congress have also raised concerns about transparency of donor contributions allocation of monies and monitoring of projects by the united nations the united nations has said it will improve its financial tracking and reporting system and pricewaterhouse coopers is reportedly assisting 110 prepared by larry nowels foreign affairs specialist 111 elizabeth becker new funds needed for relief bush aides say new york times january 4

damage and needs assessment november 12 2005 islamabad pakistan p 12 113 global economic prospects business recorder pakistan november 23 2005 crs30 in that effort in responding to international disasters many contributions are also made directly to international organizations and nongovernmental organizations which could raise the same questions about transparency requirements moreover while earmarks and time limits may ensure greater accountability they can also add pressure for organizations to spend contributed funds sometimes leading to unnecessary spending waste and duplicated efforts restrictions on funds also often do not allow flexibility to adapt projects to better meet the changing needs on the ground114 assessing performance as noted above the united nations flash appeal for earthquake relief and reconstruction remains seriously underfunded by contrast an international donors conference in islamabad garnered more pledges than expected to certain extent this reflects some donors preference for providing bilateral rather than multilateral funding according to some reports however the initial response of some united nations agencies to the earthquake was confused and inadequate prompting donors to commit their resources to other agencies more recent reporting indicated that many agencies greatly improved their performance and that the overall relief operation was success the usaid dart has been critical of some agencies for an inadequate initial response to the earthquake some of the criticism has been structural it is not clear dart members say that the united nations cluster approach see above is the most effective method of disaster management problem may stem from the sometimes competing demands placed on the cluster leaders liaising with the host government and gathering and disseminating data as well as responding to immediate needs and coordinating relief activity there has been some question about the ability of individual agencies to fulfill all of these functions with limited staffing under emergency conditions115 the cluster system is being discussed at the united nations some of the darts criticism however reflected more specific concern that several agencies were inadequate in their response to the earthquake prompting usaid in some cases to look to ngos instead of the system to carry out relief activities according to the dart some agencies were slow to realize the severity of the disaster and to allocate sufficient human and financial resources to the relief effort the dart singled out unhcr the wfp unjlc and iom not part of the system but close collaborator for particular criticism the following paragraph summarizes some of the darts reporting early on in the relief operation unhcr has been thin on the ground and remains uncertain about its mandate as head of the camp management cluster dart members reported visiting camps with visible unhcr presence the wfp which has performed adequately in its role as head of the logistics cluster has done worse job in the food cluster the 114 edward clay lessons for life the guardian review january 12 2005 115 authors interview with members of usaid dart november 22 2005 crs31 agencys staff were slow to gather information on ngo activities leading at times to duplication of aid delivery efforts the unjlc charged with coordinating transportation was also slow to ramp up its operations leading again to duplication of aid deliveries finally iom has failed to provide effective leadership of the shelter cluster like unhcr its staff have appeared unsure of its mandate and have adopted facilitative rather than leadership role116 the dart team spoke more favorably of unicef and the who both of which despite rocky starts quickly built up capacity and assumed leadership of their respective clusters both agencies were singled out for effective coordination and implementation117 the dart itself points out that some of its concerns cannot be attributed to underperformance to begin with the dart notes that the bestperforming agencies are also the betterfunded ones and states that better funding of the other agencies might positively affect their performance beyond this some concerns have reflected the constraints of the united nations particular operational mandate rather than failure on its part unlike some ngos which may operate more informally the united nations must carefully coordinate all of its activities with the pakistani government thus to the extent that the gops initial response to the earthquake was slow and confused this may have affected performance as well118 sources familiar with operations including members of the dart later reported that the united nations performance improved markedly demonstrated in part by the success of relief efforts over the winter there does not appear to have been much public criticism of the united nations response in the media the darts concerns have largely aired within the usg perhaps for this reason the united nations has not issued any public response to such charges privately however unhcr officials have acknowledged some missteps especially in the early days of the relief effort they were slow to mobilize some assets and reorganize their staff in the field they have pointed out however that most organizations operating in pakistan faced difficulties at that time the gops initial disorganization had ripple effect through the humanitarian community despite such difficulties unhcr officials note that they immediately opened up their warehouses releasing thousands of tents and other supplies to the gop119 unhcr also reminds visitors to its website that its mandate is to care for refugees and other victims of manmade disasters its involvement in the earthquake relief operation is function of its logistical and operational capabilities in pakistan not its legal or organizational mandate120 unhcr as well as many of 116 six weeks after pakistans
