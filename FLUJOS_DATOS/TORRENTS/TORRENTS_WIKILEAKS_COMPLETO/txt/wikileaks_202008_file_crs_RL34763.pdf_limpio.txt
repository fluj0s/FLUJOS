poses three key national security threats an increased potential for major attacks against the united states itself growing threat to pakistani stability and hindrance of us efforts to stabilize afghanistan this report will be updated as events warrant uspakistan relationship marked by periods of both cooperation and discord was transformed by the september 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states and the ensuing enlistment of pakistan as key ally in usled counterterr orism efforts top us officials have praised pakistan for its ongoing cooperation although longheld doubts exist about islamabads commitment to some core us interests pakistan is identified as base for terrorist groups and their supporters operating in kashmir india and afghanistan since 2003 pakistans army has conducted unprecedented and largely ineffectual counterterrorism operations in the countrys federally administered tribal areas fa ta bor dering afghanistan where qaeda operatives and protaliban insurgents are said to enjoy safe haven militant groups have only grown stronger and more aggressive in 2008 islamabads new civilianled government vows to combat militancy in the fa ta through combination of military force negotiation with reconcilable elements and economic development the pakistani military has in late 2008 undertaken major operations aimed at neutralizing armed extremism in the bajaur agency and the government is equipping local tribal militias in several fa ta agencies with the hope that these can supplement efforts to bring the region under more effective state writ the upsurge of militant activity on the pakistan side of the border is harming the usled stabilization mission in afghanistan by all accounts us commanders in afghanistan attribute much of the deterioration in security conditions in the south and east over the past year to increased militant infiltration from pakistan us policymakers are putting in place series of steps to try to address the deficiencies of the afghan government and other causes of support for afghan taliban militants but they are also undertaking substantial new security measures to stop the infiltration key according to us commanders is to reduce militant infiltration into afghanistan from pakistan to do so us general david mckiernan the overall commander in afghanistan is redefining the afghan battlefield to include the pakistan border regions and us forces are becoming somewhat more aggressive in trying to disrupt from the afghan side of the border militant operational preparations and encampments on the pakistani side of the border at the same time gen mckiernan and other us commanders are trying to rebuild stalled afghanistanpakistanusnato military coordination process building intelligence and information sharing centers and attempting to build greater trust among the senior ranks of the pakistani military

throughout the post 2001 period becoming especially prevalent in 2007 and 2008 the numerous militant groups operating in pakistan many of which have in the past displayed mutual animosity may be increasing their levels of coordination and planning moreover new generation of militants is comprised of battlehardened jihadis with fewer allegiances to religious and tribal leaders and customs deputy secretary of state negroponte warned in late 2008 that the united states and our allies face nearterm challenges from pakistans reluctance and inability to roll back terrorist sanctuaries in the tribal region one western press report called pakistans federally administered tribal areas fa ta the most ungoverned combustible region in the world and an unrelenting surge in islamistrelated violence in pakistan has some observers fearing total collapse of the pakistani state 1 this untenable state of affairs is compounded by pakistans deteriorating economic conditions2 in 2008 the influence of islamist militants appears to have grown unchecked in large parts of pakistan beyond the fa ta bringing insecurity even to the north west frontier province nwfp capital of peshawar which reportedly is in danger of being overrun by protaliban militants in late 2008 militants in the region have attempted to assassinate the us consul general in peshawar and undertook the targeted killing of an american aid worker there other socalled settled areas of pakistan beyond the tribal regions have come under attack from protaliban militants indeed the talibanization of western pakistan appears to be ongoing and may now threaten the territorial integrity of the pakistani state g22g145g155g142g138g157g561g3g156g156g142g156g156g150g142g151g157g561 the instability in western pakistan

for 2007 said that qaeda remained the greatest terrorist threat to the united states and its partners in 2007 the two most notable qaeda leaders at large and believed in pakistan are osama bin laden and his close ally ayman alzawahri they have apparently been there since december 2001 when us special operations forces and cia officers reportedly narrowed osama bin ladens location to the tora bora mountains in afghanistans nangarhar province 30 miles west of the khyber pass but the afghan militia fighters who were the bulk of the fighting force did not prevent his escape associated with qaeda leaders in this region ar affiliated groups and their leaders such as the islamic movement of uzbekistan imu and its leader tahir yuldashev chechen islamist radicals are also reportedly part of the qaeda militant contingent and us commanders say some have been captured in 2008 on the afghanistan battlefield purported usled strike reportedly missed za wahri by few hours in the village of damadola pakistan in january 2006 suggesting that the united states and pakistan have some intelligence on his movements 5 strike in late january 2008 in an area near damadola killed abu laith libi reported senior qaeda figure who purportedly masterminded among other operations the bombing at bagram air base in february 2007 when vice president cheney was visiting in august 2008 an airstrike was confirmed to have killed qaeda chemical weapons expert abu khabab almasri prior to 2007 the united states had praised the government of thenpresident pervez musharraf for pakistani accomplishments against qaeda including the arrest of over 700 qaeda figures some of them senior since the september 11 attacks 6 after the attacks pakistan provided the united states with access to pakistani airspace some ports and some airfields for operation enduring freedom others say musharraf acted agai nst qaeda only when it threatened him directly for example after the december 2003 assassination attempts against him by that organization the us shifted toward more critical position following new york times report february 19 2007 that qaeda had reestablished some small qaeda terrorist training

to the pentagon the existence of militant sanctuaries inside pakistans fata represents the greatest challenge to longterm security within afghanistan the commander of us and nato forces in afghanistan general david mckiernan and his aides assert that pakistans western tribal regions provide the main pool for recruiting insurgents who fight in afghanistan and that infiltration from afghanistan has caused 30 increase in number of militant attacks in eastern afghanistan over the past year another senior us military officer estimated that militant infiltration from pakistan now accounts for about

of the security deterioration has its roots in the inability of the kabul government to effectively extend its writ in its corruption and in the lack of sufficient afghan and western military forces to defeat the taliban insurgents this view is supported by some independent analyses9 pakistani leaders insist that afghan stability is vital pakistani interest they ask interested partners to enhance their own efforts to control the border region by undertaking an expansion of military deployments and checkposts on the afghan side of the border by engaging more robust intelligence sharing and by continuing to supply the counterinsurgency equipment requested by pakistan islamabad touts the expected effectiveness of sophisticated technologies such as biometric scanners in reducing illicit crossborder movements but analysts are pessimistic that such measures can prevent all militant infiltration 10

budget of up to 45 million devoted to perpetuating regional militancy most of this amount is thought to be raised through narcotics trafficking although protaliban militants also sustain themselves by demanding fees and taxes from profitable regional businesses such as marble quarries the apparent impunity with which mehsud is able to act has caused serious alarm in washington where officials worry that his power and influence are only growing14 in addition to the ttp several other islamist militant groups are active in the region these include the tehreekenafazeshariatemohammadi tnsm of radical

motivated taliban fighters intimidation tactics and the targeted killings of progovernment tribal leaders continue to take toll and islamabads military and political support for the tribal efforts is

perspectives of islamabads strategic planners throughout pakistani existence pakistani leaders have long sought access to central asia and strategic depth with regard to india through friendly relations with neighboring afghanistan to the west such policy contributed to presidentgeneral zia ulhaqs support for afghan mujahideen freedom fighters who were battling soviet invaders during the 1980s and to islamabads later support for the afghan taliban regime from 1996 to 2001 25 british colonialists had purposely divided the ethnic pashtun tribes inhabiting the mountainous northweste rn reaches of their south asian empire with the 1893 durand line this porous 1600mile border is not accepted by afghan leaders who have at times fanned pashtun nationalism to the dismay of pakistanis26
