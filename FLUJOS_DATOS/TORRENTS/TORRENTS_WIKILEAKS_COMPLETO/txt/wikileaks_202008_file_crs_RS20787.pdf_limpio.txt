affairs defense and trade division summary the us army continues an ambitious program intended to transform itself into strategically responsive force dominant in all types of ground opera tions as planned its future force will eventually meld all ongoing initiatives into force based on high tech future combat system fcs its cu rrent force is beginning to provide new combat capability based on currenttechnology armored vehicles for the midintensity combat operations that seem prevalent in todays world its current legacy force of existing systems is being modernized and maintained to ensure effective light and heavy force capabilities until the future force is realiz ed this short report briefly describes the program and discusses issues of feasibility viability and affordability of potential interest to congress it w ill be updated as events warrant background modernization is not new issue or objective for us military forces but it has taken on new urgency because of the postcold war downsizing and procurement reductions the new global envi ronment and unexpected require ments and the promise of revolution in military affairs rma suggested by rapid developments in computers communications and guidance systems the last notable surge in modernization culminated during the reagan buildup of the 1980s weapons and doctrines developed and fielde d in that era made fundament contributions to united states successes in the cold war the gulf war and kosovo for the army such weapons included the m1 abrams tank m2 bradley armored fighting vehicle apache attack helicopter blackhawk utility helicopter and patriot air defense system during postcold war downsizing the army greatly decreased purchase of new equipment and largely deferred developmen t of next generation of weapons with notable exceptions being rd for how itzer the crusader and reconnaissancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20787crs2 1 both have now been cancelled see crs report rs21218 and crs

problems such as friendly fire casualtie s major initiative was launched in the 1990s to create army for ce xxi based on the digitization of the battlefield now dubbed networkcentric warfare modern computers and communications systems would connect all wea pons systems and give us soldiers and commanders advantages in situational awareness and speed of decisions2 one heavy mechanized division at fort hood tx was so equipped in 2001 and was battle tested in iraq in 2003 other units were at least par tially equipped and trai ned with this capability before commitment in iraq even before desert storm the battlefield was changing as the army was called upon to respond to numerous lengthy operations short of war rather than occasionally to defeat large army nearterm readiness became problem as fe wer troops were asked to cover more missions and operation and maintenance om funds were diverted from fixing aging equipment and facilities to pa for unbudgeted deployments such as bosnia funds eventually replaced in part by em ergency supplemental ppropriations the problem of rapidly projecting heavy forces had been highlighted beginning with the long buildup required for desert shielddesert storm in 199091 in 1999 it was suggested that an army task force inserted into albania for potential action in kosovo was too heavy for rapid air insertion and the unimp roved roads and bridges found there the army determined that new capability was needed in addition to mobile light forces and heavy lethal forces medium lethal force army transformation3 in october 1999 the army announced its prior ity program to transform into force that could better meet future requirements to be both rapidly deployable and lethal the first step was nearterm fielding of new unit first called the interim brigade combat team but now called the stryker brigade combat team sbct based on wheeled armored vehicle much lighter than the standard m2 bradley for the longterm the army is developing future combat system fcs based on new technolog ies that would equip very mobile formations with lethality and survivability equal or greater than that of present heavy units until the fcs is fielded the army believes it must also continue to maintain and upgrade legacy weapons sy stems eg m1 m2 etc and equipment in units that can meet any potential foe across the spectrum of conflict these legacy interim and objective forces would eventu ally meld into the transformed objective force of the future in summer of 2003 th new army chief of staff emphasized that the army was at war and

future combat system fcs that could as one capability assume the role currently he ld by the abrams tank it is intended to be as transportable and mobile as the stryker with lethality and crew survivability equivalent to or greater than that of todays tanks the fcs may however bear little or resemblance to todays tanks and could feature advanced t echnologies such as robotics and electric guns and facilitate new operational doctrines the fcs currently encompasses some 18 subsystems and the network to tie them together boeing company and science applications international corp were selected as the lead system integrator as of september 2002 the army had budgeted 20 billion to develop fcs future force units will also incorporate ongoing devel opments in information technology

initiatives at the same time congress showed caution by pressing requirement to compare the wheeled lav iii with s imilar tracked vehicles already in inventory the army believe s its evaluation demonstrated that buying stryker was more desirable than converting the m113a3 apc7 whether the 108th congress will continue to support army transformation as high pr iority will depend on its evaluation of issues such as those discussed below desirability all services have felt pressures to transform or at least adapt to current circumstances and experiences with the postcold war world these include opportunities and challenges from rush of technological advances unexpected numbers and types of missions particularly peacekeep ing and urban warfare requirements new threats from potential enemies with nuclear che mical or biological weapons and for the army criticism that it was not nimble nough during 1999 allied operations in kosovo the broadest longterm question is whether current transformation plans will yield the military force capabilities the united stat requires 20 years from now should they include power projection army capable of fighting equally well across the full spectrum of ground combat or should other services or entities assume some parts of that mission will army plans overstress dod airlift assets or would more reliance on fast sealift yield greater flexibility and economies internally has the army sought the right approach to transformation with its emphasis on mediumweight formations does the armys plan strike the right balance in allocating resources between modernizing the current legacy force and developing and fielding the future force for the short term it is projected that some amount of modernization for current forces is needed to prevent further aging and degradation the average age of the m1 tank fleet is now 119 years and an timated 117 years for support vehicles8 many of these vehicles may not be able to remain in service beyond 2030 without some form of service life extension deciding the proper llocation of resources is made more complexhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20787crs5 9 see charts presented by ronald orourke to

aggregate portrayal of its fleet capitalization status and implicati ons of various funding strategies feasibility the army plan for transformation is considered aggressive but by using largely offtheshelf materi the interim stryker force is fairly low risk for meeting technology objectives after an initial slip of 16 months contractors protest and initial hesitation by the incoming bush administrati on deliveries of strykers are now supporting the fielding of 6 sbcts to be completed by may 201010 plans for the future force involve higher risk in both technology and time it is possible that integration of all the specific fcs technologies into leapahead system will experience some problems the goal of fielding the first unit of this system of 18 systems by 2010 is very ambitious11 previous systemdevelopment fforts of this kind have often encountered technical problems schedule problems or both the need for the comanche helicopter for example was identified in 1979 and it had not yet entered production when cancelled in 2004 the original target date proposed for fcs 2023 may be more realistic but it also raised concerns regarding dura tion of development congress will likely influence the priority and speed with which the fcs becomes reality affordability some question the armys ability to finance its transformation plan particularly given an inability in recent year s to finance many procurement programs at desired rates can the army adequately finance all three elements of its plan at once while also providing adequate funds for n ecessary nontransformati on priorities such as readiness and pay and benefits the lifecycl cost for equipping 6 brigades with lav iiis has been estimated by program officials at 9 billion through

stations could change inside the army december 23 2002 p1an issue that will confront congress is whether to fund army transformation and modernization efforts at levels proposed by the bush administration or higher or lower if congress ascribes higher priority to army transformation will necessary funds be provided by adding to overall dod appropr iations subtracting from dod programs in other services or reducing deployments during the fy2003 budget cycle dod expr essed its intent to cut acquisition programs that do not meet its definition of t ransformational in favor of those that do its prime example was the armys crusader howitzer program dod cut crusader and allocated the savings to seve ral other advanced fire s upport systems in development congress reluctantly endorsed the action with the proviso that crusader expertise be rolled into the fcs program as part of its appropriations re sponsib ilities the 108th congress may choose to enforce dods implied pro mise to support adequately fire support throughout the fcs development program14 wheels or tracks and how many stryker brigades an early issue to confront the army was whether the interim force should use tracked or wheeled armored vehicles or some combination15 traditionally the us army has favored tracks for its combat vehicles with their low ground pr essure and greater tr action they generally perform better off roads on difficult terrain wheels generally perform better on roads in terms of speed agility and quiet ness after reviewing proposals the army selected the wheeled lav iii from general motors and named it stryker cr itics of the decision including some current and former members of congress continue to argue for reversal or curtailment of the stryker decision16 the army defends its case strongly and dod has not intervened the question of whether the fcs will be based on wheels tracks or combination remains open dod has however raised questions about the ultimate number and stationing of sbcts in the past it requested the army consider stationing one of the six units in europe and thhe first one is now on station in europe more recently it suggested that units five and six not be funde d unless they could be spira l developed into much more transformational formations it appears however that funding for all 6 sbcts will now be requested the combination of these ev ents and considerati ons could however open prior decisions to station sbcts in hawaii and alaska to debate and thus create political complications17 the 108th congress may play an important role in resolving the ultimate disposition of the proposed sbct force
