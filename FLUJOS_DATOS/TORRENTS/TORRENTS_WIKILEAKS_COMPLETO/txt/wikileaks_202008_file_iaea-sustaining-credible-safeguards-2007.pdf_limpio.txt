board of governors gov200759 date 24 october 2007 restricted distribution original english for official use only item 5 of the provisional agenda gov200760 safeguards analytical laboratory sustaining credible safeguards report by the director general summary the agencys ability to provide independent and timely analysis of safeguards samples one of the cornerstones of the safeguards regime is at risk because of ageing technical infrastructure and analytical equipment at the safeguards analytical laboratory security at the facility does not meet system standards while the severe lack of space available to perform multiple operations involving nuclear and radioactive materials undermines agency safety requirements number of important human resource concerns also need to be addressed options for strengthening the agencys anal ytical capabilities for addressing the current deficiencies and alleviating the safety and security concerns have been evaluated and are presented in this report recommended action it is recommended that the board take note of the need to strengthen the agencys independent analytical capability for safeguards in particular sensitive particle analysis techniques take note of the additional funding re quirements as detailed in paragraph 30 encourage member states to cont ribute extrabudgetary support and take note of the fact that supplementary regular budget appropriations may be required should sufficient extrabudgetary contributions not be received gov200759 page 1 safeguards analytical laboratory sustaining credible safeguards report by the director general background 1 this report draws attention to problems that resu lt from the ageing of the safeguards analytical laboratory sal outlines options to mitigate risks to the sustainability of operations and presents initial estimates of funding needed to address th problems options are also presented for strengthening the agencys analytical capabilities 2 in november 2006 workshop of technical expe rts from member states and the secretariat was convened at seibersdorf austria to discuss scenarios to ensure the sustainability of operations at sal the participants recognized that urgent acti on was needed and recommended that costbenefit analysis be undertaken of various options to upgrade the infrastructure of sal 3 sal consists of two main parts the nuclear laboratory and the clean laboratory the nuclear laboratory is located in rented space on the premises of the austrian research centres at seibersdorf it performs destructive analysis of both nuclear material samples and radioactive environmental samples the clean laboratory located in dedicated building within the agencyowned laboratory premises at seibersdorf screens nonradioactiv environmental samples and performs bulk and particle analysis on approximately 20 of them the remaining 80 of environmental samples are sent to the agencys network of analytical laboratories nwal for measurement 4 sal is crucial component of the nwal established by the agency to support its overall safeguards verification effort generally the nwal works well for analysis of environmental samples but virtually all nuclear material samples are being analysed at sal due to reduced availability of network laboratories for such analyses efforts to identify and qualify new network laboratories are under way especially for nuclear material analysis to serve as backup for sal 5 particle analysis of environmental samples is one of the cornerstones of the current safeguards verification system allowing the possibility to tect undeclared activities however the agency lacks the equipment and expertise to independent ly validate through its own measurements the results of the analyses carried out by the nwal 6 the agency expects the overall demand for analytical services to remain stable in the foreseeable future with moderate fluctuations at current capacity sal can process around 800 nuclear material samples and 500 environmental samples per year but it is considered prudent to plan for additional peak loads 7 given sals central role in the implementation of safeguards the consequences of protracted shutdown caused for example by failure of cr itical component of the ventilation system at the laboratory need to be addressed gov200759 page 2 b statement of problem b1 infrastructure 8 the nuclear laboratory facility was built in the mid1970s and many key components of its technical infrastructure are not designed to meet current programmatic needs and agency security and safety requirements there is an increasing risk of failure of these components including the central ventilation system that assures the safe containment of radioactive substances failure of this system would jeopardize the work of the laboratory ther is severe lack of space and multiple operations have to be carried out in limited area thus in creasing the risks to the safe handling of nuclear and radioactive materials in addition perimeter security does not meet current agency and system standards which is serious concern 9 the nuclear laboratory has always been compliant with the relevant safety regulations agreed between the agency and austria and this complian ce has been verified by regular safety inspections by austrian authorities however although much effort has been invested to upgrade safety and security at the nuclear laboratory it is not fully compliant with the current agency safety requirements and security guidelines and it cannot be made compliant without significant investment b2 equipment 10 significant part of sals equipment has aged to an extent which puts reliable service at risk examples of equipment items that are more than 12 years old are thermal ionization mass spectrometer coulometer and kedge densitomete r having combined estim ated replacement cost of 15 million the agency therefore needs to replace and upgrade key equipment to allow sal to continue to fulfil its mission 11 maintaining and enhancing the credibility of agency safeguards requires strong inhouse capability to perform analyses in costeffective accurate confidential and timely manner particle analysis of environmental samples by secondary ion mass spectrometry sims provides rapid measurement to detect possible indications of und eclared activities the agencys 28year old sims instrument which performs particle analysis at normal sensitivity levels breaks down frequently and needs to be replaced urgently in addition as noted above the agency must strengthen its analytical capabilities in order to be able to independently validate with its own measurements all analyses performed in the nwal specifically the fissiontrackthermal ionization mass spectrometry method this is continuing concern b3 budgetary constraints 12 this situation is due to the lack of funds to invest in infrastructure and equipment as consequence of budgetary constraints significant financial requirements of this sort cannot be met under current regular budget levels c options c1 upgrading the infrastructure 13 in view of the current condition of sal its infrastructure urgently needs to be upgraded however properly addressing infrastructure concer ns will require significant capital investment gov200759 page 3 14 two main options for upgrading the infrastructure have been considered1 renovation of the existing nuclear laboratory facility combined with construction of additi onal laboratory space eg for new sims facility or construction of new laboratory complex accommodating all space requirements 15 renovation would involve first decommissioning the nuclear laboratory followed by its complete renewal at its current location an add itional facility would also need to be constructed elsewhere to address the current lack of space th renovation process would be expected to take as much as two years and the following points need to be borne in mind 2 under the current lease agreement of the nuclear laboratory facility the agency would not be required to pay the cost of decommissioning upon termination of the lease however if the nuclear laboratory remained at the same location its renovation would involve substantial onetime decommissioning cost to the agency approximately 3 million since there is insufficient capacity in the nwal to analyse all nuclear material samples if the nuclear laboratory was closed for renovation the agency would need to try to make other arrangements which would be both problematic and costly and even with such renovation it would not be possible to upgrade the security of the present facility to ensure compliance with current requirements1 16 building new laboratory complex within sec ure area of the agencys laboratories at seibersdorf would provide for the most comprehe nsive solution by addressing all security and safety issues as well as meeting the additional space requirements there would be decommissioning costs for the agency and closure of the nuclear boratory during the construction period would not be required 17 provisional estimates indicate that the cost of the two options for the nuclear laboratory ie renovation versus replacemen t would be similar however comparative assessment clearly favours the building of new laboratory complex as the mo st costeffective strategy which adequately addresses all safety security and space issues c2 equipment 18 as mentioned in paragraph 11 above the agency needs to validate with its own measurements the results of particle analysis of environmenta l samples provided by the nwal the most accurate and sensitive analyses can best be accomplished by an ultrahigh sensitivity secondary ion mass spectrometer uhssims therefore the acquisi tion of stateoftheart uhssims with the associated infrastructure and expert staff is at the t op of the secretariats priorities however the new uhssims will need dedicated laboratory space not av ailable within the current infrastructure the utilization of this technique will therefore only be possible if the appropriate infrastructure upgrade discussed above takes place and additional ppropriate human resources are available 19 implementation of the uhssims technique will t only allow particle measurements of higher sensitivity and greater accuracy but will also hance the agencys independent capabilities in fingerprinting material in combination with st ateoftheart scanning electron microscope it will specifically support identification of plutonium particles and provide associated agedating information based on the measurement of specific isot opes it will also help by determining the ratios

provisional estimates with an uncertainty of 1525 gov200759 page 4 of the minor uranium isotopes to greater precision such inhouse particle analysis capability is especially important for deriving i ndependent safeguards conclusions 20 because the uhssims will take at least three ears to reach full operation after the order is placed it will be necessary to ensure reliable r outine sims measurement capability for base load measurements by replacing the obsolete 28yearold standard sims as soon as possible with the latest standard model with the goal of making it operationa l within one year given the heavy reliance that is placed on particle analysis and the need for some redundancy in measurement capability the secretariats assessment is that it would be prudent to acquire both types of sims however the highest priority is the purchase of the uhssims c3 network of analytical laboratories 21 the network for analysis of environmental samples in addition to sal consists of thirteen active laboratories in seven member states generally it works well however the nwal lacks sufficient capacity for sensitive environmental sample analys is which leads to considerable delays the secretariat will therefore continue to seek to identify qualified laboratories in member states that can provide this specialized service 22 currently the network for nuclear material analys is in addition to sal consists of one fully active laboratory which has limited capacity for ag ency samples therefore consideration needs to be given to adding qualified laboratories to the nwal capable of receiving and analysing nuclear material samples two candidate laboratories are presently undergoing qualification procedures 23 the secretariat will continue to encourage memb er states to nominate and support potential new laboratories for nuclear material or environmental sample analysis and stands ready to assist these candidate laboratories in qualifying for participation in the nwal c4 human resources 24 the responsibilities of sal have expanded over to accommodate the more sophisticated analytical needs of the agency s safeguards activities an important aspect of increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of sal will be broade ning and maintaining the expertise experience and technical knowledge of its analysts and other key staff for example implementation of uhssims capability will necessitate the recruitment of additiona l highly specialized scientific and technical staff d implementation schedule 25 the various measures indicated in this report cover wide time scale matter of urgency is the immediate replacement of the obsolete standard sims with new instrument the procurement and installation of the uhssims requiring the construction of new laboratory space is the highest priority with th goal of the instrument being fully operational as soon as possible the first priority of the infrastructure upgrade should be to address the needs of the uhs sims facility phase 1 by 20082009 in parallel planning for reconstruction of the nuclear laboratory phase 2 should be initiated as soon as possible contingent on the availability of funds with the goal of having the new facility operational later than 2011 gov200759 page 5 financial implications 26 in order to prepare for the infrastructure upgrade detailed planning needs to be carried out such detailed design and planning effort is estimated to cost approximately 1 million the subsequent major capital investment of approximately 25 m illion is foreseen within the 20102011 budget cycle various possibilities of covering the cost of the capital investment will be considered 27 funding is also needed for the acquisition nd installation of standard sims costing approximately 16 million for the instrume nt and 04 million for installation 28 the acquisition of uhssims costs approximately 35 million plus associated staffing and laboratory infrastructure costs annual operating cost s are foreseen to be approximately 06 million the phased approach to the infrastructure upgrade would take into account the laboratory facilities for the uhssims as phase 1 of the construction effort 29 recurrent need to replace other aged equipment at sal see paragraph 10 through structured programme is estimated at 1 million annually 30 the following table summarizes the capital investment requirements3 and associated timeframes action timeframe 2008 2009 2010 detailed planning of phase 1 and phase 2 of the new sal 10 million uhssims purchase 35 million uhssims infrastructure phase 1 35
