congress both by larry nikschthe north korean economy leverage and policy analysis major points and recent developments the economy of the dprk north korea is one of the few policy levers that countries can use to induce pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program the economy of the dprk is in dire straits with considerable share of its population on the edge of starvation and in need of outside food aid in 2008 pyongyang is placing more emphasis on feeding its people this likely is one reason that north korea has been more cooperative in disclosi ng and ending its nuclear weapons program china and south korean investment s and trade with the dprk are helping the country to secure n eeded imports of energy food and machinery for factories north koreas trade deficit is being financed primarily through foreign aid investments and remittances from overseas workers as well as through various illicit activities other than recent financial sancti ons economic sanctions appear to have had little effect on the py ongyang regime because china russia south korea and other na tions have traded and provided assistance to the dprk and the kim jongil regime seems willing to allow starvation rather than ope n the country to outsiders fall of the kim jongil regime seems unlikely at this time although pressures apparently are building in some quarters in north korea to look beyond the aging leader kim economic reforms adjustments in the dprk are gradually being implemented but the pace is slow and reversals of reform measures are frequent february 2007 sixparty agreemen

shipments of humanitarian aid to north korea shiplo ad of food and another of heavy fuel oil arrived in north korea shortly after th announcement by president bush of the above actions in 2008 the confluence of several forces is complicating the economic situation faced by pyongyang the first is the global food shortage and concomitant high prices combined with poor crop outlook for farms and halting recovery in industries within north korea the second is the hardening of attitudes by the new south korean president lee myung bak who has declared an end to unrequited south korean economic assistance to the north and reciprocal criticism of the south by pyongyang these negative factors are offset somewhat by progress being made in north koreas relations with japan over the problem of abductees japanese citizens kidnapped by the dprk that may lead to normalization of rela tions and large payment by japan of reparations to the dprk for japans occupation of the korean peninsula and also by investments in north korean industrial production by china in the northern region and by south korea primarily in the kaesong industrial complex these inves tments have created new exports for

population unde rgoes severe privation in the ongoing sixparty talks on the dprks nuclear weapons ec onomic assistance has been the primary incentive for pyongyangs leaders to proceed with commitments relating to the closure of its nuclear weapons program despite resistance from domestic interests particularly the military north koreas leaders seem to perceive themselves as being in policy dilemma they see the united states as hostile power and perceive themselves as possible target of us military action they have pushed to become nuclear power despite warnings not to do so even from china their major ally yet north koreas nuclear weapon devel opment has become rallying point for national pride and what they see as deterrent agai nst hostile action yet january 2008 joint newspaper editorial by the communist party military and youth militia stated that at present other task is more urgent or more important than solving the peoples food problem and eating problem6 in january 2008 kim jongil reportedly stated the most important and urgent issue for us now is to bring about turnabout in the building of the economy and in the lives of the people7 pyongyang currently faces the archetypical economic tradeoff between guns and butter but in their case the question is whether to retain the guns nuclear weapons or give them up in order to obtain butter food imports in negotiating with the dprk the united states has five major policy levers international political pressu re economic assistance ec onomic sanctions diplomatic isolation and the threat of preemptive

hunger for millions newpress release july 30 2008us interest in the moribund north korea economy goes beyond the leverage that economic assistance provides in negotiations over pyongyangs nuclear weapons the economy provides the fina ncial and i ndustrial res ources for pyongyang to support its military and nuclear weapons program it constitutes an important push factor for re fugees seeking to flee the c ountry it creates pressure for the country to engage in illicit trade when the economy is performing poorly it diverts international food aid that could be used sewhere and creates instability that raises the risk of desperate acti on by pyongyang dismal economic conditions may foster forces of discontent in the dprk that potentially could turn against the ruling regime of kim jongil especially if knowledge of the luxurious lifestyle of regime leaders and the higher standard of living in south korea spreads or if the poor economic performance hurts even pyongyangs elite despite over decade of hardship however most dissatisfaction or opposition to the regime seems to be muted this crs report notes that the worst of north koreas economic crisis reached in the mid1990s seems to have passed but the economy is still struggling and heavily dependent on foreign assistance to stave off starvation among sizable proportion of its people in 2008 survey the world food programme wfp found that food availability accessibility and utilization ve deteriorated sharply since 2007 close to three quarters of the households have reduced their food intake and that more malnourishe d and ill children are being admitted to hospitals and institutions the conclusion was that millions of people in the dprk are experiencing hunger not s een in almost decade9 severe floods in 2007 worsened situation that had been improving so far deliveries of food aid pyongyangs reforms and increasing trade with south korea and china have enabled the country to bridge to some extent its shortf all between food production and basic human needs trade sanctions along with us financial sancti ons may have had some effect judging by the complaints coming out of pyongyang and progress in the six party talks us trade sanctions alone however tend to have little impact because the united states already has virtually trade with the dprk the country can turn to other nations for needed imports and sanctions do not halt humanitarian aid shipments the sixparty agreement of february 13 2007 included an economic incentive of heavy fuel oil and humanitarian food aid as well as the prospect of the normalization of diplom atic relations between the dprk and the united states and japan in exchange for north koreas freezing and allowing inspections of the activity at its yongbyon

devastation visible in pyongyang korea is like land time forgot and crisis with us isnt helping the austin american statesman may 3 2003 p a17overview of the dprk economy the north korean economy is one of th worlds most isolated and bleak10 it was completely bypassed by the asian economic miracles of the past three decades that brought modern economic growth and industrialization to south korea taiwan singapore and hong kong as well as rapi d growth and trade liberalization to china thailand malaysia nd other asian nations the s talinist north korean economy can be characterized by state owners hip of means of production centralized economic planning command and monitoring of political ttitudes and an emphasis on military development the economic system is designed to be selfreliant and closed the irony of the situation is that the longer the economy tr ies to remain self sufficient the poorer its performance and the more dependent the country becomes on the outside world just to survive during the 1990s major portions of th north korean population survived primarily through transfers of food and other economic ssistance from abroad the worst of the food crisis has passed but shortages are still there and the country depends on staples from china south ko rea and when allowed from the world food program to stave off mass starvation11 during the 1990s the inefficiencies of north koreas centrally planned economy especially its promotion of stat eowned heavy industries along with high military spending about 1525 of gdp joined with drought and floods to push the economy into crisis in addition th collapse of the soviet bloc meant the loss of russian aid export markets and cheap oil trade with the former soviet union dropped from as much as 358 billi on in 1999 and has recovered to only 230 million mostly petroleum by 200512 this added to disastrous domestic economic conditions in north korea13 food has been so scarce that north korean youth are shorter than those in other east asian nations14 since 1998 the military reportedly has had to lower its minimum height requirement in order to garner sufficient new recruits life expectancy has been contracting with the help of the wfp which had been feeding more than quarter of north koreas 23 million people chronic malnourishment among children reportedly fell from 62 in 1998 to about 37 in 2004 about

long marc h in chinese revolutionary history in january 2006 pyongyang ordered the wfp to stop food deliveries to the dprk but limited food assistance about 75000 tons annua lly was resumed after an agreement in may 200617 over the winter of 20072008 the abnormally dry and cold weather reportedly has seriously affected the grow th of autumn wheat and barley when combined with severe flooding during the summer of 2007 the wfp predicted the dprk will be short about 14 million tons of food in 200818 an extensive analysis of the famine in the 1990s concludes that the ultimate and deepest roots of north koreas food pr oblems must be found in the very nature of the north korean economic and political system19 since 2002 pyongyang has allowed some reforms that may ease the economic pressures over the long term in sense these reforms legitimized what was already occurring following the collapse of the centrally planned economy20 the kim regime refuses to call the economic measures reforms but as will be discussed later in this report that in essence is what they are north korea prefers to characterize the reforms as utilitarian socialism this includes the introducti on domestically of market economy elements called the july 1 2001 measures and in the international arena the pursuit of normalization of re lations with countries that have traditionally been hostile

2006 was an estimated 256 billion compared with 888 billion for south korea global insight an econometric consulting firm estimated north korea s gdp in 2006 at 229 billion 239 billion in 200723 remarkable fact is that in th postkorean war and into the mid1970s living standards were higher in north korea than in either south korea or china now north korea is far behind its rapidly growing neighbors as shown in figure 1 growth in estimated real gross domestic product gdp in the dprk was dropped into the negativ for most of the 1990s before beginning to recover in 1999 in 2004 to 2006 growth has been continuing at about 2 up slightly from earlier years in 2006 th economy shrank by 11 and continued to decline in 2007 by an estimated 23 in essence the economy appears to have recovered moderately af ter the 1990s but has contracted again over 20062007 it should be noted that various schol ars and government officials produce variety of estimates of north korean growth rates and gdp some estimates show gradual recovery but others argue that real per capita gdp has been stagnant or even declining over the past decade one probl em is that estimates of inflation are difficult to obtain and are inherently unrelia ble the reason is that households in different sectors of the economy may pay di fferent prices for the same commodities particularly staples that have been distributed throug h official channels to some but must be purchased in markets by others rice for example may be sold in an official market for one price sold in an irregular market for nother or distributed as ration to certain households basically fo r free another problem is that officials who report data often are under pressure to meet certain targets unlike in the west where data may be sugar coated to make them more palatable in the dprk the underlying statistics often ar rubberized they may be stretched or compressed according to official expectations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32493crs9 24 global insight subscription econometric forecasting service north korea updated july 23 2008another problem with north korean data is that there is huge difference between the official exchange rate and the free market rate this problem is avoided in ppp estimates that compare purchasing power and adjust for exchange rate differences in estimates of gdp expressed in dollars however the exchange rate is used to convert north korean won to us dollars according to global insight the official exchange rate in north kor ea has been 2 per dollar while the free market rate has ranged between 200 to3000 won per dollar24 what can be said for certain is that sizable part of the dprk population lives on the edge of existence in few count ries today does small decline in gdp or summer flooding cause massive starvation nd growth stunting as it does in the dprk also despite the threat of impris onment for crossing the border into china and being repatriated to north korea large number of refugees still attempt to flee the economic and political conditions in the country in this land of scarcity consumer necessities have been rationed and used to reward party loyalists under pyongyangs economic reforms this system appears to be phasing out but in the fall of 2005 north korea backtracked on some of its economic reforms by forbidding private sales of grains and reinstituting centralized food rationing system pyongyang also re portedly closed its food markets but then opened consolidated markets that carried food and other items source

titute for far eastern studies north korea brief september 21 2007 cited in napsnet september 212007the combination of weak economy unable to provide basic food and necessities and ruling regime intent on maintaining its power has created economic divisions within society north korea reportedly officially classifies its citizens into three ranks and fiftyone categories based on their ideological orientation however in actuality the economy has created five cla sses of people the official categories are used to allocate rations for daily necessities jobs and housing25 the facto categories have resulted from the intrusion of market forces and trading on the official class divisions the top class consists of the elite who claim the first rewards from society they are the party cadres who are leaders in the military and bureaucracy and who enjoy privileges far above the reach of the average household while starvation haunts the provinces many of the priv ileged class live in pyongyang where provincial north koreans cannot enter w ithout special permission some drive foreign cars acquire importe d home appliances reside in apartments on lower floor so they do not have to climb too many stairs when the electricity is out and buy imported food medicines and toiletries at special hard currency stores26 the elite have strong vested interest in maintaining the current economic system despite its problems their incomes originate from the treasury from foreign investors mostly south korean remittances from ethnic koreans in japan although these have been curtailed and the countrys shadowy trad in everything from missile technology to fake banknotes and narcotics27 after the elites surrounding kim jong il the second group comprises business traders with access to foreign capital and international transactions the third consists of organized thugs who make their money through public trading and markets the fourth class is composed of urbanite s and others who scra pe by on government rations while the fifth class is farmers w ho support their way of life through farming private plots and selling goods in markets28 despite hushed grumbling about economic deprivation for ced food deliveries to the central government rationing system with insufficient stocks to deliver and new prohibitions on markets that are diffi cult to understand and rationalize dissent in north korea remains stifled support fo r the ruling regime appears strong even among the lower classes of people alt hough this support is often enforced by severe squashing of even the slightest hint of dissent even suspicious comments in casual conversations may be reported to the authorities the country is far from developing middle class with independe nt economic means

isolation from the world economy that they call juche or selfreliance juche goes beyond economics as it has been used since the 1950s to perpetuate power by the central government and to build an aura of th supernatural around th eir supreme leaders kim both father and son30 although the regime does not emphasize the connection the current system of dynastic succession with paramount father figure also harkens back to confucianism and the powerful dynastic tradition that united the korean peninsula for hundreds of years the economic practice of juche has minimized international trade relations discouraged foreign direct investment nd fostered what it considers to be core industries mostly heavy manufacturing while promoting such heavy industry for most of the postkorean war peri od pyongyang has emphasized the parallel development of military strength current head of state kim jongil often referred to as dear leader has given highest priority to the military th is places the army ahead of the working class for the first time in the history of north koreas socalled revolutionary movement31 under kim ilsung kim jongils father the juche ideology placed equal emphasis on political i ndependence selfdefense and economic selfsupport capabilities kim jongil however insists that north korea can be country strong in ideology and economy only when its military is strong32 the country therefore has been developing its i ndustries within the context of militaryindustrial complex with strong links between heavy industry and munitions production some of north koreas munitions industries manufact uring dual use products are virtually indistinguishable from those supplying civilians33 in 1998 at the 10th supreme people s assembly the militarys national defense

used to signify the privileged status the korean peoples army holds and to stress the ascendant position of the military relative to the power of the korean workers party the traditional center of the dprks decision making34 of course the ultimate decision maker in pyongyang is the dear leader kim jongil in 2006 pyongyangs defense budget wa s an estimated 23 billion to maintain its 11 million member military35 south korea estimated the norths military expenditures at 5 billion in 2003 in 2005 north korea stated that the defense budget was 159 of its total annual budget36 but others had put the figure at 272 in 2003 even defense budget of 23 b illion however implies an expenditure of 2090 per member of the military woefully small amount this implies that the tug of war between guns and butter within the north korean regime must be quite intense given the scarcity of resources throug hout the country even though the military does operate businesses that bring in additional revenues the heavy weight of the military in pyongyangs decision making may help explain what to outsiders seem to be inexplicable actions by the north korean government for example almost immediately after negotiators had issued the september 19 2005 sixparty statement in which north korea ostensibly committed itself to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs pyongyang began backtracking and within two months announced boycott of future sixparty talks37 it also may help explain north koreas carrying out its first nuclear test on october 9 2006 despite being warned not to do so by the united states china and other nations recent progress in the sixparty talks under which north korea shut down its yongbyon nuclear reactor as required in phase i of the february 13 2007 agreement arguably repr esents defeat for the military but the slow progress in phase ii to date could indicate strong resistance by military interests to cutting more deeply into north koreas nuclear

over the economy and the onset of more use of the market mechanism to make economic decisions particularly production nd consumer purchases although the government has dubbed th reforms an economic adjustment policy50 the actions appear to be desp erate attempt to revive the moribund economy the reforms also dovetail with rth koreas military first policy as kim jongil has given first priority to

increased autonomy of enterprises authorization of the establishment of markets and other trading centers and limited opening of the economy to foreign investment prices still remain under cen

operating in open markets this has raised fears by the dprk regime of encroachment by capitalism into their socialist economic system on august 26 2007 kim jongil announced that markets have become anti socialist westernstyle markets this has led to steady stream of government edicts restricting market activity across the country at first authorities prohib ited women under the age of 40 from

international monetary fund the dprk had at least some trade with 80 of the 182 countries or customs territories that report their trade data to the fund77 for pyongyang the foreign economic sector plays an important role in that it allows the country to import food technology and other mercha ndise that it is unable to produce in sufficient quantities at home since north korea does not export enough to pay for its imports it generates deficit in reporte d merchandise trade that must be financed by other means pyongyang has to find sources of foreign exchange other than from its overtly traded exports to pay for the imports experts point out that the dprk has used its military threat to extort aid and other transfers from the united states japan south korea and the humanitarian agencies this along with various illicit activities has helped pyongyang to finance surfeit of imports detailed data on the countrys exte rnal economic relations suffer from reliability problems similar to those associ ated with the domestic economy the foreign economic data on actual commercial transactions however tend to be more accurate since they also are reported by trading partner countries and are compiled by the international monetary fund and united nations indi vidual c ountries for example report on their imports from and exports to north korea these mirror statistics however differ from north ko reas actual annual numbers because of differences in data gathering methods coverage timing and reporting countries also may misreport trade with the republic of korea as trade with the democratic peoples republic of korea detailed and reliable data on trade in military equipment and illegal drugs also are notoriously difficult to obtain and to verifyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32493crs25 south korea also compiles statistics on trade with north korea that differ from its data reported to the united nations south korea considers trade with the

pyongyang reportedly has imported aquaculture technology to incr ease production of cultivated fish and agricultural equipment to increase output of grains and livestock it also has imported equipment

the japanese economy nd rising tensions between japan and north korea these remittances have reportedly been declining 2003 japanese newspaper report placed the amount at between 200 million and 600

financial channels that required reports to the japanese government91 working estimate would be approximately 100 million per year in such remittances anecdotal evidence indicates that considerable amounts of currency from japan are simply carried by individuals on ships and not reported more than 1000 north korean fre ight vessels had been traveling between north korea and japan each year japan however has tightened inspections of north korean ships and curtailed operations of ferry boats traveling between the two countries92 in summary the dprks net total receipts plus remittances aid and investments from south korea and special food and fuel assistance in connection with negotiations over pyongyangs nuclear program constitute most of the overt resource inflows that north korea receives each year over and above its export earnings these amount to perhaps 700 million on net per year north korea must finance the remainder of its trade ficit about 800 million by other means it

russia is critical to north korean security since russia shares border with the dprk and ru ssian cooperation would be necessary to enforce any security guaran tee as fuel aid from abroad has

general strategy toward what it considers the critically im portant asiapacific region russias strategic course includes calculating and pragmatic approach toward north korea and the korean peninsula in general moscow has ga ined unique and exclusive communications capabilities with pyongyang based on the development of trust between the leadership of the two states at the highest political levels135 this observer also points out that the perspective of russia on the north korea nuclear issue does not fully coincide with that of the united states while moscow has insisted on denuclearized korean pe ninsula and the irreversible dismantlement of north koreas nuclear weapons and nucl ear development programs it also firmly supports the peaceful resolution of the issue russia is participant in the sixparty talks moscow apparently has concluded that the kim jongil regime does not face impending collapse and therefore outside pressure and economic sanctions intended to bring about regime change work only to increase tensions and the probability of military confrontation russia also does not favor korean peninsula unified by military force with american help this would put us forces on the russiakorean border rather russia supports unified korea that would maintain friendly relations with all countries including russi and opposes foreign interference in the unification process136 as is the case with china russia also is concerned that economic hardships in the dprk push refugees across the border into russian territory moscow also supported security council resolutions in 2006 that condemned north koreas missile and nuclear tests this has cooled the rela tionship to some extent the dprks trade with russian lags behind what it has been in the past in 2007

military means to accomplish us goals and protect us national interests this report examines the economic side of this triad of strategic policy instruments but also reviews the diplomatic and military aspects of us policy in order to provide policy context us interests goals and strategy the dprk threatens several us national interests it threatens us security through its development and potential proliferation of nuclear weapons as well as other weapons of mass destru ction north koreas missile delivery systems currently can reach south korea and japan and it is reportedly developing missile taepo dong 2 that can reach the continental united states138 its conventional forces are concentrated along the demilitarized zone within striking distance of south korean population centers and us forces nort h koreas dictatorial communist and oppressive regime headed by kim jongil r uns counter to us values of freedom liberty human rights democracy and economic choice the national security strategy of th united states touches on north korea mainly through the following broadly stated goals 1 to prevent enemies from threatening the united states allies and friends with weapons of mass destruction 2 to strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and to work to prevent attacks against the united states or friendly countries 3 to work with others to defuse regional conflicts 4 to ignite new er of global economic growth through free markets and trade and 5 to cham pion aspirations for human dignity139 as applied to the dprk the immediate us goals include 1 to halt or eliminate north koreas development of nuclear or other wea pons of mass destruction 2 to preventhalt prolif eration of weapons of mass destruction particularly to terrorist groups 3 to curtail illegal and stionable activities by north korea to include illicit sales of missiles140 dealing in illegal drugs and counterfeiting of currency 3 to reduce th threat of war on the korean peninsula 4 to ensure that north korea does not participate in international terrorist activity 5 to induce economic political and societal change in th country that could bringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32493crs52 about favorable changes in the kim regime in governance in the standard of living of its people and in attitudes toward the united states and 6 to enhance the security of south korea and ja pan with respect to the dprk conventional wisdom with respect to north korea includes the following assumptions 1 without stringent monitoring mechanisms pyongyang probably will cheat on any agreement 2 north korea regularly engages in illicit activity and may take actions opposed to normally accep ted international law or standards of national behavior 3 econo mic privation in north korea mainly affects the population outside of the political and military elite particularly in the countryside 4 popular sentiment opposing the current regime although repor tedly on the rise appears weak or suppressed sufficiently fo r kim jongil to remain in power for an indefinite period of time 5 us military attack on north korea would result in an immediate counterattack on seoul and othe r targets in south korea using existing conventional weaponry that would cause extensive damage and 6 any north korean use of nuclear bombs on the united states or its allies would trigger retaliation that likely would destroy pyongyang its military installations and other targets other factors to be considered include the following 1 south korea has been pursuing policy of rapproachment and ev entual normalization of relations with north korea although it maintains consid erable distrust and hostility toward the country 2 among the countries with intere st in north korea china appears to have the most influence and economic and politi cal interaction alt hough ties with russia still are strong and south korea has been major source of economic assistance and trade 3 japan would likely provide large monetary settlement to pyongyang in return for its years of occupation should peace settlement be reached 4 the border between china and north korea is porous par ticularly in the winter when the rivers are frozen and electricity so scarce that few lights operate at night 5 centrally planned communist economies that have been operating for several decades create distortions and consumer di ssatisfaction that enable rapid transition to market economy once those economies are liberalized 6 economic reform and the opening of trade and investment in north korea would likely induce large increases in production and economic wellbeing but most dprk productio n facilities are so lacking in new machinery and equipment that major investments would be needed to raise them to world standards and 7 the level of distrust between the united states and the dprk is deep and longstanding given us interests and goals it appears that us strategy may include the following 1 convincing the pyongyang regime that devel oping nuclear weapons decreases not increases its security 2 creating tension within the regime over the allocation of resources between nuclear and conventional wea pons and between the military and civilian economies 3 weaken ing the hold by pyongyang on the daily lives of its citizens and s upport of kim jongil by fost ering alternative centers of power facilitating the transition to ma rket economy and increasing information flows into the country 4 depriving the central government of revenues derived from illicit activities and 5 eliciting greater coopera tion from china and russia to induce them to apply more pressure on pyongyang to make suitable concessions and carry through on commitments deriving from the sixparty talkshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32493crs53 an economic strategy would be to ge nerate interests in and dependency on international trade investment and greater interaction with the outside world that could weaken the hold by pyongyang on the daily lives of citizens and bring the country more into the globalized world such economic liberalization also could reduce pressures on north korea to engage in illicit trade in order to cover its trade deficit and diminish the need for pyongyang to saber rattle in order to divert attention from its domestic problems major us policy options given the above interests goals assumptions and strategies with respect to the dprk include the following continue current policies of negotiations with the promise of lifting sanctions as dprk denucleariza tion progresses under the sixparty process intensify negative pressures on the dprk tighten economic and financial sanctions restrict trade between north korea and countries such as china japan south ko rea and europe and discourage foreign investment in the dprk increase engagement to include positive incentives for reform over the long term loosen sanctions encourage reforms facilitate foreign investment promote trade and allow north korea to join the international monetary f und and asian development bank combine policy options into package of incentives current us policy current us policy with respect to the dprk includes 1 diplomatic engagement through the sixparty talks and related bilatera l meetings 2 non proliferation efforts including the prolifer ation security initiative 3 international efforts to counter trafficking by north korea in illegal drugs counterfeit currency or other contraband 4 maintenance of us military forces in south korea japan and elsewhere in the pacific as credible deterrent against north korean aggression 5 economic sanctions and di plomatic isolation and 6 keeping north korea from joining international financial institutions as the bush administration nears cl ose it has shown new willingness to negotiate directly with the dprk although it maintains the umbrella of the sixparty talks the february 13 2007 sixparty ag reement includes provision that north korea is to freeze its nuclear installations at yongbyon and invite back the international atomic energy agency to monitor the freeze north korea also is to discuss with the other six parties list of all its nuclear programs including plutonium extracted from used fuel rods from the five megawatt reactor which north korea claims to have reprocessed into nuclear w eaponsgrade plutonium in exchange south korea is to provide fi nancing for 50000 tons of heavy oil to be shipped to the north the dprk and the united states also are to start talks aimed at resolving bilateral issues and moving toward full

latest developments by mary beth nikitinon the basis of settlement of outstanding issues of concern which japan interprets as requiring settlement of the issue of north koreas kidnapping of japanese citizens the february 2007 agreement represented clear change in strategy by the united states and other parties to the talks for the first time the banco delta asia action was linked by the united states to th sixparty talks and nuclear issues in essence the united states agreed to see that the banco delta issue was settled before pyongyang would have to take action to invite international atomic energy agency inspectors back into the country and to s hut down its nuclear plant for the dprk this meant that the 25 million in frozen funds from banco delta accounts would be released first this was done the agreem ent also implied that strategy of regime change appeared to be off the table the question now is whether the dprk will live up to its commitments under the agreement and what leverage the united states china and other participants have to ensure pyongyangs compliance as result of the february 2007 sixpa rty agreement the united states has begun providing fuel and food aid and s held out the prospect of eventual normalization of re lations with the dprk in response to specific disclosure and other actions by pyongyang in regard to its nuclear program141 on june 26 2008 president bush announced the lifting of th application of the trading with the enemy act twea with respect to the dprk and notified c ongress of his intent to rescind north koreas designati on as

the earliest date august 11 2008 for the st ate sponsor of terro rism recision has passed the secretary of state reportedly is waiting for more complete verification on the part of the dprk before proceeding what is evident from the experience of the past seven years is that pyongyangs stalling and the united states refusal to negotiate bilaterally even under the umbrella of the sixparty talks provided time for pyongyang to continue to pursue its nuclear program given north korea s nuclear test in 2006 it is now obvious that the dprk actually had created nuclear device and may still have as

also enables it to gain international prestige to exercise degree of hegemony over south korea and to extract economic assistance from other countries pyongyang is unlikely to abandon this nucl ear

preemptive strikes and the usled invasion of iraq145 s m l s consider pyongyangs nuclear program to be bargaining chip to be traded for economic assistance and to gain international recognition what also can be said about us polic is the renewed w illingness to negotiate bilaterally under the sixpa rty process the banco lta asia action poor economic conditions and crop harvests in the dprk nd pressures by china south korea and japan have brought some appa rent progress in situation with north korea precisely what pyongyangs intentions are is still murky but it is clear that the dprk is now placing higher priority on food s upply and economics in policymaking after north koreas 2006 nuclear test moreover it became evident that even china opposed the path pyongyang was taking following the nuclear test the united states took the issue to the united nations the resulting security council resolution 1718 october 14 2006 called on north korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs and imposed several sanctions the resolution imposed an arms embargo on north korea banned trade in materials related to ballistic missiles or w eapons of mass destruction and barred exports of luxury goods to the dprk it also froze funds and other financial asse ts owned by people connected with north koreas unconventi onal weapons progra m and banned travel by such people china and russia suppor ted this resolution japan responded by curtailing imports from and travel to north korea banned north korean ships from entering its ports and prohibited exports of 24 luxury products to the dprk it

caused the sanctions to be imposed initially since north koreas other trading partners have more liberal trade with north korea it is mainly american companies and traders that are impacted by the
