divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31337japanus cooperation on ballistic missile defense issues and prospects summary the issue of missile defense cooperation with japan intersects with several issues of direct concern to congress ranging from support for developing capability to protect us regional forces asiapacific allies and taiwan from chinese short and mediumrange missiles to countering possible future threat to us territory from longrange missiles developed by north korea japans current participation in the us ballistic missile defense bmd program dates from august 1999 when the japanese government agreed to conduct cooperative research on four components of the interceptor missile being developed for the then us navy theaterwide ntw antimissile systema seabased upper tier exoatmospheric capability against short and mediumrange missiles up to 3500 kilometers in the spring of 2001 the administration changed the context of the cooperative research effort when it reorganized and redirected the us missile defense program to emphasize the employment of specific technologies across the entire spectrum of missile defense challenges but especially to gain limited nearterm capability to defeat missile attacks on us territory by rogue states the pentagon redesignated the ntw program as the seabased midcourse system with goal of developing capability for attacking missiles of all ranges in the initial or middle phases of their flight path this change added to an already complex list of japanese policy concerns by putting japan in the position of possibly cooperating in the developmen t of technology that could become part of an american national missile defense capability step that many japanese see as transgressing constitutional ban on collective defense thus far the administrations program change has not deterred japan from cooperative research on missile defense but the policy shift has unsettled japanese leaders and created additional political obstacles to bilateral bmd cooperation the new us approach has been criticized in the japanese press and the diet parliament both because of the potential violation of the implied ban on collective defense contained in article 9 of japans usimposed peace constitution and also because the bush initiative requires the united states to withdraw from the us russian antiballistic missile abm treaty which tokyo has long regarded as an important element of strategic stability an integrated usjapan bmd capability aimed at protecting third countries would raise the same constitutional issues japan has not made decision regardin g the acquisition of missile defense capability japanese policymakers and defense firms generally are enthusiastic about missile defense cooperation but the political parties the media and the general public are split over the issue proponents view bmd cooperation as means to counter perceived north korean missile threat and perhaps chinese threat as well other japanese are fearful of aggravating relations with china or triggering an asian missile race even groups in japan favoring bmd cooperation are concerned about the large costs associated with the stillunprov technology the popular koizumi administration seems inclined to finesse the constitutional issue if possible japanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31337future stance

cooperation on ballistic missile defense issues and prospects issue overview japans august 1999 agreement to engage in ballistic missile defense cooperation with the united states has the potential for contributing materially to the ability of the us navy to field an asian regional defense against intermediaterange ballistic missiles goal that has long received strong support from congress although japan has committed to research and development rd cooperation on four elements of navy interceptor missile tokyo has not made decision to acquire missile defense capability it is even less clear how far japan might be prepared to move in the direction of an integrated regional missile defense cooperation arrangement the extent of japans future participation in missile defense will be governed by number of considerations including its threat perceptions overall national defense strategy regional relationships constitutional constraints domestic political impact technical feasibility and cost the relative importance of these factors cannot be established with any precision any one or combination of them could have make or break effect on japanese decisionmaking to date these considerations have had mixed and sometimes contradictory effect on japanese policy focus and scope of this report this report documents and analyzes japanese perspectives on ballistic missile defense and on participation in the us missile defense rd program with particular attention to current trends in japanese security thinking major actors in the policymaking process and political and

missile tests in the direction of taiwan following chinas firing of ballistic missiles in the vicinity of taiwan during taiwan strait confrontation in early 1996 congress acted to support the development and deployment of missile defense system explicitly oriented towards asia and the western pacific section 1533 of the fy1999 national defense authorization act pl 105261 signed into law on october 17 1998 required the secretary of defense to carry out study of the architecture requirements for the establishment and operation of theater ballistic missile defense system in the asiapaci fic region that would have the capability to protect key regional allies of the united states and to submit report to congress not later than january 1 1999 the report was to describe any us missile defense system either currently deployed or being developed that could be transferred to key allies of the united states in the asiapacific region to provide for their selfdefense against limited ballistic missile attacks it was to be submitted in both classified and unclassified versions congress clarified the term key regional allies in the conference report hrept 105736 identifying these as japan south korea and taiwan1 the department of defense dod delivered 15page unclassified version of the congressionally mandated theater missile defense tmd report in may 1999 the report focused on five ballistic missile defense systems currently under development for us forces and described options for the defense of south korea japan and taiwan against an attack by fewer than five missiles of under 3500 km 2170 range the report assumed that the missiles would not employ special measures to evade destruction such as the use of decoys or altered trajectories the unclassified version of the dod report addressed hypothetical architectures for each countrys situation but did not attempt to suggest or describe any regionwide system architecture nor did it address the most challenging types of threats 2 changing context of congressional support for missile defense in the 107th congress congress continued to show support for developing and deploying theater level missile defense

resolved to support appropriate and effective theater missile defense programs to help prevent attacks on forward deployed united states forces from occurring again nearly identical resolution s 19

on the part of number of members of congress at the determination of the clinton administration to avoid testing or deploying missile defense systems that would violate the abm treaty although neither bill went beyond referral to the armed services committee the proposed legislation implicitly supported the decision of the bush administration to radically revamp the us bmd program with the goal of applying various abm technologies across range of missions including the early deployment of capability to defend us territory against limited attacks by intercont inentalrange ballistic missiles that might be launched by rogue states bmd nmd and tmd what is the difference the united states military uses the term ballistic missile defense bmd as generic designation for systems designed to defend

changes related to us nmd and tmd programs in series of policy statements beginning with speech by the president at the national defense university on may 1 2001 the bush administration indicated an intention to enlarge and redirect current bmd programs in way that tends to erase the clear distinction between tmd and nmd the reasoning behind this decision appears to be at least twofold first the relevant technologies are applicable across the whole range of bmd threats second and relatedly certain programs currently in development for lower tier threats are deemed to have the potential if suitably enhanced of serving as stopgap nearterm nmd capability in the absence of full scope nmd system this reasoning applies particularly to the former navy theater wide ntw program which has been the focus of usjapan tmd cooperation one possible seabased option would build upon the technologies being developed in the former ntw program to develop system that could be deployed on the navys aegis cruisers stationed off the us pacific coast with the mission of intercepting icbms in midcourse outside the atmosphere another concept is to deploy seabased system in the sea of japan with capability to intercept north korean intercontinental missiles in their assent or boost phase when they are most vulnerable5 more technologically ambitious concept under active consideration involves deploying aircraft with laser systems capable of destroying missiles in their boost phase this report discusses and analyses the administr ations approach to missile defense and its implications for usjapan cooperation on missile defense but the reports point of departure is the traditional delineation of types of antimissile systems based on the characteristics of the specific ballistic missile threats that they seek to counter in other words the main ballistic missile threat to us forward deployed forces in the asiapacific region and to japan south korea and taiwan is from short and mediumrange or theater range ballistic missiles continuing technological distinctions another reason not to lose sight of the nmdtmd distinction is that from technological perspective the challenges involved in attacking icbms and theater range missiles remain markedly different even though some of the technology being developed in the ntw program would be relevant to the defense against strategic missiles the design characteristics for standard sm3 intercepto r missile being developed for the ntw are deficient in speed and range for the task of intercepting an icbm this is especially the case if the interceptor missile is launched from position that requires it to chase down an icbm from behind6 hence if the unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31337crs5 altitude of about 1000

phase it may have to develop more capable interceptor missile than is currently being developed to defend us ships bases and port facilities against shortand mediumrange ballistic missiles in addition to having higher velocity and longer range the job of intercepting and destroying an icbm may require different kinetic kill vehicle kkv the cannistershaped projectile that smashes into the missile warhead it also may need an upgraded sensor how challenging this requirement would be is matter of some dispute critics of the clinton administrations approach to tmd argued that the designed velocity of the interceptor missile had been artificially kept below 5 kmsecond in order to comply with 1972 antiballistic missile abm treaty with the former soviet union they asserted that with relatively minor technical changes the planned velocity of interceptor missile could and should be upgraded to better deal both with medium range missile threats as well as icbms7 others including some supporters of an early national or global defense capability based on the ntwsmd technology are convinced that intercepting an icbm will require larger and faster missile than can be achieved by upgrading the navys standard missile8 as for other proposed contingency bmd systems aimed at defending us territory against strategic missiles the relevance of the current technology cooperation between the united states and japan is unclear some analysts argue that in theory attacking missiles close to the point of launch as in the proposed boost phase interceptor would require different sensors than those being designed for the smd in action on the fy2002 defense authorization bill both the house and senate armed services committees reduced the defense departments request for boost phase interceptor testing on grounds that the concept design had not been completed the senate report noted that boostphase technology is extremely challenging 9 reportedly the department of defense

organization bmdo now the missile defense agency on the ballistic missile defensecancellation of the navys lowertier missile defense program until the end of 2001 the us navy had been developing two missile defense systems for shipboard deployment both were intended to defend against short and mediumrange ballistic missiles but at different points in their flight path the navy area defense nad system was to be the navys lower tier bmd program providing localarea defense against ballistic missiles by intercepting them within the atmosphere the nad was roughly analogous to the armys patriot3 pac3 also lower tier system to protect military forces against high value targets from shortand mediumballistic missiles such as the ubiquitous scuds and their variants the nad was cancelled by the pentagon in december 2001 because of poor performance of components and related unit cost increased which exceeded limits established by congress the defense department declined to use it authority to certify the program for continued funding12 cancellation of the nad leaves the navy for the moment anyway without any program under development to provide lower tier defense against ballistic missiles and none against cruise missiles13 the second navy missile defense program now called seabase d midcourse defense smd which has been the object of usjapan cooperation remains intact and may be accelerated there are however several uncertainties about the future of this system one is technological the basic building block of the smd is the same standard missile that was to be employed by the nad but with much higher performance characteristics than the cancelled lower tier system also the former ntw had been described as the least mature of the various systems under development by the pentagon by one expert14 another uncertainty arises from the determination of the pentagons ballistic missile defense office bmdo redesignated the missile defense agency mda in january 2002 to acquire an early seabased nmd capability and the eagerness of the navy to provide the platform for an nmd capability these changes raise some questions about organizational lines of control between the mda and the navy and mission priorities navy plans had called for the ntw system to enter service around fy2010 as of february 2002 the pentagon anticipates that the seabased midcourse system could achieve initial capability for short and intermediaterange seabased missile defense by about 2006 with an icbm capability to come several years later15 in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31337crs7 program

1988 the united states and japan had agreed to terms of technology transfer and work sharing on new aircraft to be designed using the basic airframe of the us f16 fighter built by general dynamics following objections from the commerce department and members of congress that the agreement might help japan erode us civil aerospace leadership the first bush administration conducted an interagency review and then negotiated clarifications from theevolution of japanese interest in ballistic missile defense cooperation japanese interest in us missile defense programs dates from the mid1980s when the department of defense solicited participation by allied countries in the reagan administrations strategic defense initiative sdi partly in order to bolster congressional support for the program japan declined to participate but did partly relax its postworld war ii arms export ban to open the way for sharing military and dual use technology with the united states subsequently japan shared technology with the united states for several weapons systems including portable surfaceair missile sam systems naval ship construction ducted rocket engine and the controversial fsx nextgeneration fighter program the fsx collaboration which involved transfer of technology used in the usafs f16 fighter produced by what was then general dynamics proved searing experience for the japanese it is widely accepted among students of usjapan alliance relations that the japanese government backed by domestic industry and influential diet members strongly preferred to develop an indigenous fighter aircraft to replace its ageing fleet of f1 fighters but decided reluctantly that the maintenance of smooth alliance relations required yielding to pressure from the reagan administration for codevelop ment among other considerations for the nakasone government in tokyo the reagan administration had imposed stiff sanctions on semiconductor imports as result of japans failure to meet the terms of trade agreement and members of congress were strongly criticizing japan and the toshiba corporation for the sale of some sensitive us metal milling technology to the then soviet union16 japan had barely signed the memorandum of understanding on the fsx co production deal when it was whipsawed by high profile us policy debate involving industry and labor interests members of congress the us commerce department and others over the wisdom of technology cooperation with the united states main high tech competitor opponents of the fsx cooperation deal were concerned that japan might use ussupplied technology to erode the us lead in aerospace production one of the few areas of us high technology dominance that had not been conquered by japanese industry in early february 1989 the newly inaugurated george h w bush administration yielded to these pressures and initiated policy review that eventually required japan to renegotiate the terms of technology transfer in the

of the fsx joint development program the fsx collaboration proved highly frustrating both to japan and to the department of defense and us defense contractors because technology transfer issues had become entangled in the political reaction to the large usjapan trade deficit whatever the merits of the objections of us critics the experience created an aversion in japan to joint development and production agreements with the united states and bolstered the case of proponents of national selfsuffic iency in defense production the frustrating fsx experience as will be seen could play

cooperation on development of the fsx fighter japanese and us industries initiated major missile defense system study under the sdi initiative entitled western pacific basin architecture study westpac the japanese government kept its role to the minimum in this fouryear study to avoid sensitive political issues such as the weaponization of space and nuclear weapons related research associated with the so called star wars program of the reagan administration additionally some sources say that the japanese government was wary of us interest in japanese technology and concerned that the united states might try to pressure japan to purchase missile defense capability off the shelf as means of partially redressing the large usjapan trade deficit18 subsequent to the completion of the westpac study in october 1994 the united states and japan embarked on bilateral study on bmd to better understand the ballistic missile threat to japan and to study alternative architectures for japanese

japanese society where public discussions of military issues generally had been avoided since the end of the world war ii in december 1998 about four months after north korea launched taepo dongi ballistic missile that passed over japanese territory the japanese government made an internal decision to engage with the united states in cooperative research and development of ballistic missile

uncertainty in japan about the benefits and constitutionality of participating in joint missile defense technology research in particular the japanese government has serious qualms about the

collective self defense under international law but disallows the exercise of that right see fuller discussion of this issue below to date these changes in the us program have created consternation but have not affected tokyos interest in cooperation for the time being japanese officials have avoided addressing the collective defense issue arising out of the changed us missile defense strategy and have concentrated on protecting japans option to acquire bmd capability towards that end japan has continued to budget funds for bmd cooperation in line with an existing five year plan and also committed funds to acquire the technology that could support bmd capability on the two new aegis destroyers that are under construction22 significance of japanese cooperation on bmd japan inevitably will play key role in the ability of the united states to deploy bmd system in asia either to protect us forces or to shield american allies and friends the exact nature of japans role however is highly dependent on still unpredictable political and national security policy factors under different scenarios japans role could greatly enhance the effectiveness of an american missile defense

missile defense architecture since seabased capability against mediumrange missiles if deployed in the japanese islands could put defensive umbrella over japan south korea and taiwan the sea of japan would be an ideal location for the deploym ent of boostphase intercept capability to guard against missile launches from north korea while capability deployed in or near the southern japanese islands such as the us navy base at sasebo on kyushu would be well positioned to intercept missiles launched from coastal china in addition to its favorable geographic location japans sophisticated

japans relations with the united states and the peoples republic of china which opposes many aspects of usjapan defense cooperation the issues of whether japan will acquire missile defense capability and the extent to which such capability would be integrated with that of the us navy have assumed major national policy significance for tokyo because of the stakes japanese views on the development

control and the constitution two aspects of the bush administrations new bmd strategy could have significant implications for future japanese missile defense cooperation abm treaty one aspect is the fact that seabased system designed to attack icbms violates the 1972 abm treaty reality graphically acknowledged by the bush administrations decision to exercise the us right to withdraw from the treaty japan was not party to the treaty but has regarded the agreement as fundamental pillar of nuclear stability the abandonment of the treaty by the united states troubled japan but ironically also removed one barrier to participation ban on collective defense second any use of japanese technology for an american nmd system would violate both japans postworld war ii antinuclear policy which forbids participation in us nuclear strategy and longstanding legal interpretation that article 9 of the japanese constitution forbids participation in collective selfdefense under this interpretation formulated by the cabinet affairs legal office in 1981 it is acknowledged that japan has such right under international law but cannot exercise it because the constitution provides that the exercise of the right of selfdefense must be limited to the minimum level necessary to defend japanese territory the usjapan security treaty is deemed constitutional under this interpretation because japans responsibilities relate only to the defense of japan itself japan is not obligated under the usjapan defense treaty to participate in the defense of the united states or us forces let alone participate in security cooperation involving third countries34 thus under present and foreseeable circumstances only system that is designed for the defense of japanese territory and is not in violation of the abm treaty would appear to be able to pass political and constitutional muster japanese officials political leaders and opinion makers have universally expressed concern about the new

not to distinguish between nmd and tmd it was fact that there was clear difference in technologies between long and short range missiles in any event the official said japans research cooperation would continue37 political parties38 the stance of japans political parties on missile defense cooperation underscores the depth of feeling against missile defense cooperation especially at present when koizumis liberal democratic party ldp depends on two coalition allies to sustain its legislative program throughout most of the postworld war ii era the longruling ldp was the only political party in japan that supported strong military capability and the alliance with the united states the party fractured in july 1993 and currently lacks majority in the upper house of the diet parliament and only bare majority in the lower house see figure 4 the koizumiled ldp retains power by virtue of coalition with the new komeito and the tiny new conservative party an ldp splinter group several bielection victories in october 2001 allowed the ldp to regain majority in the 480seat lower house but the party still lacks majority in the upper house which is less powerful but still necessary to pass legislation consequently it remains dependant on its two coalition partners to be assured that legislation will pass stance of the ldp and its coalition allies the missile defense issue is sensitive one for the ldpled coalition government the ldp itself generally remains broadly supportive of the usjapan alliance but an ideologically nationalist wing increasingly has expressed the

splitting the ldp in 1993 and later splitting the successor nonldp coalition but his wellarticulated defense and foreign policy positions command considerable respect his position which seems colored by his own political agenda is that the line against collective defense should be addressed directly via constitutional change rather than by formal or facto reinterpretation beginning with the north korean taepo dong launch in august 1998 and continuing since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states number of political parties have begun to reexamine their defense policy positions several have agreed on the necessity for some measures to strengthen alliance cooperation and japans own defense capabilities but not necessarily to the extent of acquiring bmd capability the new komeito for instance reportedly has acknowledged the possible deterrent value of bmdrelated technology cooperation with the united states39 ambiguous stance of the opposition democratic party the leading opposition party the minshuto has kept its missile defense policy ambiguous as it consists of both former members of the ldp and the japan socialist party jsp the minshuto is careful not to create an internal rift over the tmd issue the attitude of the minshuto could be the most uncertain factor in japans decision on the deployment of missile defense system parties on the left the strongest opponents of missile defense cooperation include the japan communist party and the japan social democratic party jsdp formerly the japan socialist party jsp japans major opposition party

burdensharing by tokyo conflicting concerns about china although normally unspoken in public the potential ballistic missile threat from china appears to be both fundamental reason for japans desire to acquire bmd capability and the main source of its cautious approach to the participation in the us plan some believe that possession of bmd capability could devalue the role of theater ballistic missiles in regional conflict and counter or even deter the further development and modernization of chinese missiles others in japan have registered concerns that the bmd program may destabilize the mainlands relations with taiwan as well as japan and trigger regional arms race china has been adamantly opposed to the inclusion of taiwan in the area covered by usjapan defense cooperation

taepo dong missiles pyongyang has failed to respond to bush administration statements of intent to hold unconditional discussions on missile and other issues also since the september 11 attacks china

play larger military role much of this concern stems from japans failure to overcome lingering resentment of its colonial role and aggression in world war ii continued friction in japansouth korea relations japan seemed to make breakthrough in its relations with south korea in october 1998 during an october 1998 visit to tokyo by south korean president kim dae jung when the late prime minister keizo obuchis gave japans first written apology for its past aggression since that time however number of incidents have kept japansouth korean relations on edge including visit to the yasukuni war memorial by prime minister junichiro koizumi in august 2002 as beneficiary of us presence in the region south korea may eventually condone the introduction of usjapan bmd capability that would shield us bases in japan against north korean missile threat to date however south korean leaders and media commentators have continued to express suspicion of japans interest in missile defense south koreas own preferred response to north koreas ballistic missile capability has been to develop missiles capable of attacking north korean missile sites rather than supporting the deployment of bmd system since 1979 this strategy has been constrained by commitment to the united states that south korea would not deploy missiles of more than 180 kilometers 112 miles range enough to attack north korean targets near the demilitarized zone dmz but not enough to reach pyongyang in mid2000 however reportedly after five years of negotiations the clinton administration agreed to allow south korea to develop missiles with ranges up to 300 kilometers 186 miles and corresponding payloads of up to 500 kilograms the us state department formally announced the policy change in midjanuary 200154 reportedly the united states also agreed that south korea could conduct research on missiles with up to 500 kilometers range55 thus far south korea appears not to have acted on the agreement because of president kim dae jungs sunshine policy that seeks northsouth engagement56 nonetheless because of continuing criticism of japan by both north and south korea and the aspirations of koreans for reunification the apparent desire of seoulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31337crs24 to develop an offensive ballistic missile capability is another source of japanese uneasiness concerns about perception s of japans southeast asian neighbors japan is also aware of negative ramifications that deployment of bmd system could have on its diplomatic profile in asia especially among its association of southeast asian nations asean neighbors as past victims of japanese world war ii aggression many of the countries of southeast asia still harbor fears of japanese remilitarization hence many if not most countries in southeast asia view the usjapan alliance in favorable light for it signifies continuing us engagement in regional security and deters japan from reemerging as an independent military power in this respect joint deployment of bmd system would tend to be less worrisome to most southeast asian countries than would japans acquisition of an independent capability but some japanese policymakers are concern ed that even this would be unduly provocative and would partly negate tokyos effort to improve its relations in the context of facto rivalry with china for influence in an area japan once viewed as its backyard legal and constitutional constraints foreign japanwatchers and the japanese themselves have given great attention to the constitutional issue especially the question of whether the constitution can be reinterpreted to allow for collective defense arrangements or whether the seriousness of the question requires constitutional revision number of study groups within the diet have considered the issue but without coming to any clear conclusions generally however large majority of the japanese officials and the public have taken the position that reinterpreting the constitution to allow for collective defense is step too far prime minister koizumi himself has argued for more flexible interpretation but this appears to be minority view even within his own party many among the japanese public are less concerned about collective defense per than with the concomitant expansion of the roles of the japanese military from this perspective

koizumis forced retreat on this issue may accurately reflect what is politically possible for the foreseeable future ban on the use of outer space for military purposes some in japan oppose

for killing injuring or destruction for now this issue seems to be resolved in favor of bmd the japanese government declared in december 1999 that the japanese involvement in the ntw program is in accordance with the upper house resolution on the peaceful use of outer space58 since north koreas august 1998 taepo dong missile launch public opinion generally has been supportive of the deployment of an independent national reconnaissance system59 but the employment of spacebased sensors raises questions about the militarization of space which japan has pledged to avoid ban on arms exports japanese critics also argue that participation in the us bmd program violates longstanding ban on arms exports the japanese government also has asserted that military technology transfer deriving from the joint research would stay within the preexisting lawful framework of military technology transfer to the united states60 however exports of military hardware and components are viewed by some as going beyond current policy consequently some ldp members with defense industry ties reportedly have called for change in japans current ban on arms exports to make sure that japanese contractors can

totaled 767 billion about 71 billion at then prevailing exchange rates and that the entire budget was less than 40 billion the jda likely will face extremely difficult choices in deciding between bmd and other weapons system modernization programs japanese officials say that the current fiveyear defense outline that began with fy2001 has sufficient funding for currently planned procurement programs only because the fiveyear plan traditionally does not allow for major revisions japanese officials indicate that procurement decision could not take place until about fy200664 decision by

both in comparative and absolute terms practically speaking in view of other acute spending priorities and budgetary constraints associated with its mountain of bad loans unfunded liabilities of hundreds of quasigovernmental corporations and pension funds rising and unprecedented levels of unemployment and falling tax revenues japan cannot opt for acquisition of bmd capability without jettisoning the informal 1 of gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31337crs27 65 these figures are based on the 19962001 fiveyear bilateral special measures agreement report on allied contributions to the common defense report to the us congress by the secretary of defense march 1999 p ii7 66 kiyotaka shibasaki and justin mccurry us reaffirms military base reduction plan the daily yomiuri in english july 24 2000 p 1limitation on defense spending to do so however would likely generate significant criticism from both japans neighbors and large section of the japanese public decision not to deploy bmd system would likely have its own set of costs for usjapan security relations because bmd system deployed in japan could help protect us troops stationed in japan as well as japanese lives and assets many in the congress and the executive branch and among the us public tend to see japans participation in bmd as fully warranted exercise in alliance burdensharing currently japans burdensharing in the form of hostnation support of us forces amounts to 4 to 5 billion annually taking into account direct support foregone revenues and inkind contributions65 however the hostnation support hns also is in decline during presidential visit to japan in july 2000 president clinton and prime minister mori agreed that japan would reduce by 30 million its annual hostnation support of us troops stationed in japan66 this cut is largely symbolic but the simple fact that it was deemed politically necessary by the japanese government underscores the difficulties that may be encountered in seeking to finance the cost of acquiring and deploying bmd capability likewise us efforts to hold the reduction to the absolute minimum indicate the limits of american sympathy for the japanese governments political situation implications for us policy as the us bmd program progresses number of uncertainties concerning japans future participation are likely to emerge as executive branch and congressional concerns assuming development proceeds as us planners hope japan may have to address the issue within the current term of the bush administration japans decisions are not likely to have significant impact on the us program but could affect the size and effectiveness of us bmd capability in asia as well as on us japan alliance cooperation more generally japanese decisions either for or against the acquisition of bmd capability raise separate sets of subsidiary issues the following discussion analyzes some implications of alternate outcomes 1 burdensharing issues because the japanese commitment on the us bmd project to date is only for technology research on four specific components for seabased midcourse defense the us department of defense anticipates significant but not crucial japanese technological contribution if japanese cooperation ends at the joint technology research level however japan still will behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31337crs28 major beneficiary if bmd capability assuming as is likely that such capability is deployed with the us 7th fleet homeported in japan if japan does not develop or deploy the system with the united states what kinds of compensat ion if any would the united states expect of japan at the moment this is still hypothetical question number of signs indicate that japan wants to acquire bmd capability these indicators include not only the funds that the japanese government is committing to cooperative rd but also the fact that two new aegis destroyers and funds for the most current radar and communications suite have been included in the current five year defense plan if however japan decided not to acquire bmd capability the decision would play into the broader issue of defense burdensharing at minimum decision not to acquire bmd capability could revive congressional concerns about whether japan is shouldering enough of the burden of regional stability and its own defense 2 utility of jointly deployed usjapan bmd capability to us military operations in the event of regional conflict although the japanese government has rarely issued objections to the us militarys joint operations with japan in the past prior to the recent response to the usled anti terrorist campaign in afghanistan such activities have been carefully restricted to training exercises having limited objectives such as sealane defense air defense or peacekeeping support current rules of engagement governing the operations of the japanese navy rule out activities that could be construed as combat support of us forces for any missions not involving the defense of japanese territory if missile defense capability were deployed on japans aegis destroyers and conflict erupted on the korean peninsula on between china and taiwan the united states might put pressure on japan to deploy some missile defense capability outside its own territory under prevailing japanese rules of engagement and constitutional interpretations favorable japanese response would appear all but impossible less clear is whether in crisis situation the exchange of realtime data between japanese aegis ships equipped with bmd capability could pass political or constitutional muster for instance could japanese ships equipped with the sea based midcourse system back up more forwarddeployed us units with supplementary target information presumably they could so long as japanese territory or us bases in japan were possible targets of missile attack under current japanese constitutional constraints however the us military would likely find it prudent not to count on japanese participation in anything short of clear and present threat to japanese territory the example of prime minister koizumi reversing his decision to send an aegisequipped destroyer to the indian ocean is case in point in summary an integrated binational bmd capability could be highly useful in situations that also threatened japanese territory but might be of little utility to us forces in situations outside japanese territorial waters or not involving an attack on japanese territory in these cases us forces presumably would have to operate independently since bmd capable ships are being designed to be selfsupporting if necessary these limitations are not critical but they raise questions about the ultimate value to us security of japanese bmd capabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31337crs29 67 ayako doi japans new leader foreign policy liability in the making forum the daily japan digest arlington va news service april 27 2001 68 editorialamending the constitution is not realistic proposition asahi shimbun may 4 2001 asahi news httpwwwasahicom 69 chester dawson blueprint for controversy far eastern economic review july 13 2000 19japanese perspectives on the limits of the collective security ban are in flux and prime minister koizumi has speculated in public that japan might have to have more open mind about situation involving an attack on us military forces in the region67 while campaigning for the ldp presidency koizumi said that he would give high priority to constitutional revision but since taking office he has given first priority to his call for the direct election of the prime minister and appears to have downgraded the urgency of revising article 9 while calling for continued discussion of the issue the prime ministers caution may reflect repeated polls consistently showing that 70 or more of the respondents oppose revising article 968 3 impact of japans active involvement in regional deployment of bmd system on us operational flexibility given the historical mistrust of japans intentions and programs among its asian neighbors highly visible involvement by japan in missile defense were it otherwise possible could have negative implications for us security interests in asia china for instance might see an integrated usjapan bmd capability as more threatening to its interests than us system alone because of the implication that japan is joining facto collective security arrangement that is aimed at china especially in confrontation involving taiwan china and other neighboring countries may be less than convinced that article 9 will continue to inhibit japans participation in collective security with the united states especially because the restriction has become the target of nationalist opposition in japan thus for china north and south korea and some southeast asian countries an integrated usjapan bmd system could be viewed as symbolizing the remilitarization of japan under the cloak of alliance cooperation with the united states to the extent that joint bmd deployment generated fears of rearmed japan it could detract from the acceptability of us bmd capability on the other side of the equation japans neighbors are likely to regard an independent japanese bmd with even greater concern for some of japans neighbors such as south korea japanese capability firmly linked to that of the united states would seem more desirable china on the other hand opposes both deployment options 4 command control communication and intelligence c³i issues these could be critical issues in the case of an integrated usjapanese bmd capability to what degree would the united states be dependent on the decision making capability of the japanese cabinet which has yet to develop effective crisis management capabilities would some ask japan allow us commander to control the button that would activate joint system this would be most unlikely according to japanese sources69httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31337crs30 70 chester dawson blueprint for controversy far eastern economic review july 13 2000 1820 theater missile defenses in the asiapacific region henry l stimson center working group report june 2000 napsnet napsnetnautilusorg special report p 9a similar dilemma could arise if us and japanese missiles were integrated into joint sensor and command and control system in scenarios that do not involve the defense of japanese territory such as the deployment of us bmd systems to protect taiwan the question arises as to whether japan could or would allow the involvement of jointly operated satellite and command and control facilities several defense commentators and private analysts have suggested that this problem could be circumvented by the creation of joint command and control system that would also allow either party to act independently if necessary70 japanese officials and defense analysts are well aware of the inadequacy of their current crisis managem ent and c³ capabilities prime minister koizumi reportedly hopes to succeed where his recent predecessors have failed in getting the diet to approve legislation giving him the emergency powers necessary for crisis decisionmaking as of early 2002 however the prospects for the introduction of such legislation remain doubtful conclusions the united states and japan have shared concerns about the proliferation of ballistic missiles in asia and therefore shared interest in the theater missile defense the technological and financial contributions that japan may bring into cooperative research on the seabased midcourse system element of the us bmd program are potentially significant although not critical japan continues to keep its options open regarding the acquisition and deployment of bmd capability subject to flexible enough rules of engagement and crisis management capabilities japans possession of an operationally compatible bmd capability would contribute importantly to the ability of us military forces to deploy an effective missile defense system in the asian region as seems to be envisioned by bmd supporters in congress and the bush administration also the very feasibility of deploying bmd system in asia depends on the availability of bases in japan most notably the us naval base at yokosuka on tokyo bay which is the home port for the us seventh fleet considering the wide range of issues that the japanese government must resolve before proceeding with decision to acquire bmd capability the future of an interoperable usjapan capability cannot be taken for granted let alone an integrated binational system on the positive side japanese defense officials seem clearly to be leaning in the direction of at least national bmd capability that would be interoperable with that of the united states even if japan does opt to procure and deploy an operationally compatible bmd system however it remains highly questionable whether japan will agree to an integrated command and control arrangement at present substantial majority of the japanese public appears opposed to constitutional changes that would allow collective selfdefense either for missile defense or other purposeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31337crs31 senior bush administration officials most notably deputy secretary of defense armitage have expressed strong desire for japan to address the constitutional constraints were japan to amend or reinterpret article 9 however japanese policy would still be based on its national interest perceptions thus any decision by japan to opt for joint deployment of bmd capability would itself raise additional foreign policy issues for japan and operational challenges for us forces several of these foreign policy issues are trilateral rather than bilateral for instance japanese policy could turn on the evolution of us relations with the prc and taiwan and whether or not the united states succeeds in negotiations to eliminate the north korean missile threat north koreas taepo dong launch of august 1998 provided an important public relations asset to bmd supporters in japan on the other hand number of indicators suggest that the main concern among defense analysts and planners in japan and those in the political world who think about such matters is fear that china may one day threaten japan with ballistic missiles from this perspective missile defense capability is one means to counter chinas rising military power it is difficult to assess the impact of future political change on japanese decisionmaking concernin g bmd cooperation especially regarding any matters touching on the constitution in general political change since the split in the ldp in july 1993 seems not to have had much perceptible impact on the trend towards more assertive defense posture and increased usjapan security cooperation because of the steady decline of the social democratic party of japan sdpj the two most likely alternatives to the status quo are revitalized democratic party of japan dpj which remains divided between former members of the sdpj and more conservative defectors from the ldp and the more nationalistic wing of the ldp as represented by shintaro ishiharo the popular iconoclastic governor the tokyo metropolitan prefecture for different reasons neither of these alternatives to the political status quo has been enthusiastic about missile defense cooperation with the united states what stance they would take were they to attain power is difficult to forecast with any confidence another imponderable at this time is the longer term prospect for retaining us bases in japan at present the principal targets of public opposition to us bases in japan are facilities in okinawa whose training and other operations have large impact on the environment and quality of life these mainly involve the us marines stationed there in general us navy and air force bases receive less criticism nonethe less some of the same groups that support defense buildup and closer alliance relations are ambivalent about hosting major us military presence more than five decades after the end of the us postworld war ii occupation already okinawans have succeeded in getting the japanese government to relay their desire to put fifteen year limit on use by the us marines of proposed replacement for the current futenma marine air station for now issues concerning us access to bases in japan are limited to okinawa and to forces that do not relate to bmdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31337crs32 71 for more background on

congress section on security issues by larry nikschshould this situation change it would become more difficult for the united states to maintain an asian bmd capability71 japans involvement in joint development of the smd element of the us missile defense program represents considerable progress by japan towards greater alliance burden sharing but its full implications remain to be seen neither japans participation in joint research and development nor decision by japan for or against acquisition or deployment of bmd capability are likely to have critical impact on the development of us missile defense capability or on the deployment of an american seabased capability in asia nonetheless japans participation in the research and development phase is viewed by us officials as possibly contributing important technology and decision by tokyo to acquire bmd capability could have considerable foreign policy significance for the united states and important military implications given the prevailing uncertainties about japanese policy and the implications of its future decisions congress may decide to consider carefully the assumptions of the administration and the terms of any further steps in bmd cooperation with japan part of such consideration could be obtaining additional information on the threat perceptions of the japanese defense agency jda and selfdefense forces sdf the possible implications of change in the perceived threat from north koreas missiles the attitude of japanese political leaders and ministry of foreign affairs policymakers towards china japans fiscal situation and defense budget trends public and political attitudes towards usjapan security cooperation and us bases in japan and the prospects for constitutional revision and the acquisition of emergency powers by the japanese national command authorities
