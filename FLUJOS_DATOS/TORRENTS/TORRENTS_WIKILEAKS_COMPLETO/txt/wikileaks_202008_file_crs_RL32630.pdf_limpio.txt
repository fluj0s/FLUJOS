umriww major transportation r oute for products moving to and from illinois iowa minnesota missouri and wisconsin have met with significant controversy some of th is controversy centers on the cumulative environmental effects of the current navigation system and the proposed expansion the upper mississippi river system umrs whic h includes the navigation channel and surrounding floodplain s upports an unusually large number of species for temperate river the umriww navigation system alters umrs habitat and contributes to decline in the abundance of some species for example locks dams and other channel structures inhibit the m ovement of fish betw een and within river segments fill side channels backwaters and wetlands w ith sediment and suppress plant growth by reducing water clarity in 2001 in response to criticism that dr aft navigation feasibility studies did not look at navigations cumulative environmen tal effects the corps restructured its feasibility study to include an ecosystem re storation component in late september 2004 the corps released final feasib ility report recommending that congress approve 50year framework for combined ecosystem restoration and navigation improvements the ecosystem restoration component is aimed at maintaining and restoring broad array of bitats and ecosystem processes at total cost of 53 billion for the 50year plan authorization of an initial set of both restoration projects at 158 billion and navigation pr ojects at 203 billion has been proposed in the 109th congress for discussion of proposed legislation see crs report rl32915 upper mississippi riverillinois waterway investments legislation in the 109th congress by nicole t carter and kyna powers the federal responsibility and more speci fically the role of the corps for restoring ecosystems altered by federal projects is still being defined consequently the scope of largescale restoration effort s and the federalnonfe deral costshare are being developed largely on casebycase ba sis the corps umrs restoration plan recommends actions limited to the navigation system and its floodplain with federal responsibility for more than 90 of the cost the underlying question is whether or in what form congress will authoriz and appropriate funds for ecosystem restoration on the umrs if authorized umrs restoration would be the corps second largescale restoration effort and the first larges cale restoration effort for highvolume commercial waterway this report explains what is meant by restoration and why the umrs ecosystem is being

authorization issues in the 109th congress coordinated by nicole t carter evolution of ecosystem restoration plan the corps feasibility study which began in 1993 to investigate the l ongrun navigation

subsequent investigation are cited by some corps observers as evidence that fundamental changes need to be made in the corps project development and approval process4 the corps had also been criticized by state and federal natural resource agen cies and environmental groups since the early years of the study for not including mitigation of environmental impacts beyond the incremental environment impacts of lock expansion the national research council nrc of the national academy of sciences repeated this criticism in 2001 report reviewing the feasibility study5 in response in 2001

nationally significant ecosystem and commercial navigation system in the water resources development act wrda of 1986 pl 99662 according to the co rps and basin state representatives the umrs ecosystem is in decline and action is needed if further degradation is to be avoided8 the umrs has been changed by multiple factors with the construction of navigation infrastructure and water ma nagement for navigation being principal among these factors thirtyseven lock and dams and channel training structures that create 9foot deep navigation channel alte r the distribution and movement of river water these changes allow for lowcost transportation between the upper mississippi river basin and the gulf of mexicos ocean ports however these structures also inhibit the movement of some animal species between and within river segments fill side channels backwaters and wetlands with sediment and suppress plant growth by reducing water clar ity other factors also have contributed to ecosystem decline including landuse practices in the watershed that cause sediment to enter the system and levees th at isolate floodplains from the river the mississippi and illinois rivers also have

million recreational visits to the umrs12 boating sightseeing sports fishing hunting and trapping are some of the more popular recreational uses13 it is estimated that recreation activities generate 12 billion and over 18000 jobs annually14 congress has recognized the importance of umrs habitat since early in the 20th century congress established the uppe r mississippi river national wildlife and

ongoing decisionmaking known as adaptive management and they would be au thorized in phases according to the corps integrated management of the environmental and na vigation purposes will improve operational efficiency resulting in costsavings and synergistic benefits34 the corps also argues that dualpurpose authorization would give it flexibility to useoperation and maintenance funds for ecosy stem restoration and for navigation 35 representative of the upper mississippi river basin association testified before congress that the states enthusia stically supported the corps decision to restructure the study consistent with their longstanding commitment to integrated management of the river36 number of agencies and nongovernmental organizations also support dualpurpose au thorization barge industry group also testified that it supports the ecosystem re storation plan but be lieves that ecosystem restoration should be imple mented without adversely affecting the growth of navigation37 moreover entities such as the national corn growers association and the midwest area river coalition 2000 do not support dualpurpose operation or integration of operation and maintenance for navigation and ecosystem restoration citing that an existing backlog of navigation operation and maintenance om activities and lack of clarity regarding implementation criteria for integrating operations38 adaptive management the third component of the corps proposed management framework is adaptive management adaptive management is mechanism for dealing with the uncertainty of undertaking largescale multiyear effort to change complex system th adaptive management component of the corps plan which is budgeted for 653 milli on calls for scien tific panel system level learning and re

also examined multiple options for navigation improvements these are not discussed in this report 43 corps final feasibility report and peis p 183while the builtin flexibility of adaptive management is seen as an asset for coping with uncertainty adaptive management can be seen as risky because there is the potential that it could be used to justify delays in implementing important activities or to abandon previously set goal s moreover adaptive management is relatively recent management approach thus contributing its own uncertainties entities such as the national corn growers association has expressed concerns about adaptive management but hopes that th corps will continue to work closely with stakeholders however the us environmental protection agency the basin states and environmental organizations support the corps proposal for adaptive management for umrs restoration the october 2004 nr c report found the adaptive approach to be vital to the integrity of the corps preferred plan for combined ecosystem restoration and navigation investments it st ates that the preferred plan provides for program of incremental implementati on an excellent framework for comprehensive adaptive management if the corps is provided the resources and if it commits to the needed data collection improved modeling techniques and evaluation many of th flaws and omissions in this study can be corrected in the course of implementation by the application of adaptive management principles40 at the same time the nrc was critical of the corps for not defining clear sciencebased framework for implementation monitoring and evaluation41 preferred and alternative plans in addition to describing the corps pref erred restoration plan and an integrated management framework the feasibility report also describes how the corps arrived at its recommendation in selecting its pr eferred plan the corps analyzed five 50 year options for ecosystem restoration42 each of

comparison across projects this analysis is not used for restoration projects because computing the economic value of restoration benefits is difficult 49 corps final feasibility report and peis p 515plan selection the corps evaluated its five ecosystem restoration alternatives using combination of qualitative analyses and estimated quantitative outputs qualitative assessments included ecosystem diversity ability to address ecosystem objectives maintenance and enhancement of ecosystem goods and services acceptability and adaptability46 quantitative measures included costs acres of influence cost effectivene ss ecosystem completeness and regional economic development from this evalua tion the corps rated alternatives d and as close in their overall ranking but r ecommended alternative d specifically alternative d was identified as the preferred alternative primarily because it is likely to achieve high degree of completeness and diversity in the most efficient manner47 while the basin states and envir onmental organizations generally support the corps preferred alternative d number of entities including the us epa the us fish and wildlife service and number of basin states would prefer the more extensive alternative in its analysis the corps compared environmental benefits with the cost of achieving those benefits this comparison is called cost effectiveness analysis cost effectiveness analysis is used as an optimization technique to identify either the least costly alternative for an established policy objective that defines the level of benefits desired or to maximize what can be achieved for given investment in the case of the final feasibility report and peis the corps does not use cost effectiveness analysis for either of thes purposes instead the alternatives analyzed describe range of benefits for range of investments that is each of the five analyzed alternatives generates different quantity of benefits measured as acres of influence benefits were estimated by examining the acres of habitat affected through restoration ac tivities under the emp comparing acres of influence and cost helps the corps to compare alternative plans however the usefulness of the comparison is limited by the fact that different acres of habitat are of different quality moreover the corps analysis is not particularly useful for comparing the benefits and costs of the umrs restoration effort with the benefits and costs of other largescale restoration efforts or corp s flood control and navigation investments48 the corps proposal for 15year

oodplain restoration projects would largely be paid by the states and nonprofit entitie s and the us fish and wildlife service would likely assume responsibility for opera ting and maintaining completed habitat projects52 while the feasibility report does not include an analysis of alternative 15year increments the corps states that measures were selected to provide 1 the best return on investment 2 the best gains in habita t and species diversity and 3 additional knowledge that will f acilitate adaptive implementation of the 50year plan the corps also selected measures for which there would be sufficient time to plan design construct and monitor within the 15year time frame53 however some environmental organizations contend that 15year time frame is insufficient to achieve tangible results and that longerterm authorization is needed the us fish and wildlife service for example states that there will be need for ecosystem restoration authority for as long as the navigation system is operated and maintained54 on the other hand the state of wisconsin supports the 15year time frame on the basis that it will likely allow time to document the need for alternative as it stands the corps proposed 15 year increment includes 225 measures under three main activities55 fish passage and dam operations fish migration is largely impeded by the locks and dams on the navigation system to help fish stocks move more freely th rough the system the 15year plan would include about 30 of the fish passage nd dam operations measures recommended in the 50year plan

proposal if congress decides to authorize an ecosystem restoration plan for the umrs it will face number of policy decisions the more contentious aspects of such authorization may deal with the plans magnitude and cost costshare scope and relationship to authorizati on of navigation investment s and navigation operations these decisions are br iefly described below restoration magnitude and cost the corps analysis of ecosystem restoration includes fi ve alternative plans of which re storation goals can be achieved at different levels of inve stment policymakers are now confronted with deciding on the magnitude of restoration fforts if any to be undert aken should the restoration effort maintain existing ecosystem conditions ie net loss or should it restore ecosystem conditions without trying to at tain some preexisting situation if restoration is the objective how much of the earlier ecosystem function should be restored answers to these questions ar based on value judgements and depend on balancing what the federal government and the basin states are willing to invest in restoration with the desire for restored ecosystem as previously described the corps 53 billion restoration plan would maintain and restore ecosystem function one factor that some restora tion supporters argue should be considered in deciding on federa l investments is the relative spending on restoration and navigation implementing th corps 50year restoration plan would result in an average annual cost incl uding both initial investments and om of almost 140 million this compares to the 185 million on average annually spent on the om and rehabilitation of the existing navigation system and the additional 60 million annually for implementing the corps 50year navigation plan56 costshare another investment consideration is the di stribution of financial responsibility among federal and nonfederal sponsors the umrs restoration planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32630crs16 57 m reuss reshaping national water politics the emergence of the water resources development act of 1986 alexandria va us army corps of engineers institute for water resources oct 1991 58 ibid p 199 59 the october 2004 nrc report p 52 was cr itical of using market test for umrs investments because of the role of the umriww navigation project in ecosystem decline and because the benefits of restora tion investment may not be local raises the question of who is responsible for paying for restoration of ecosystems partially damaged by existing federal projects since wrda 1986 nonfederal sponsors have been responsible for greater portion of corps project costs the cost share formulas evolved out of debate over having beneficiar ies ie nonfederal sponsors pay for the benefits received by footing portion of project costs57 the established costshare for corps ecosystem restoration projects is 65 federal 35 nonfederal however the corps reco mmends for the umrs costshare arrangement that increases federal responsib ility because of the role of the federal umriww navigation system in earlier gradation the extensive federal land holdings and the multistate nature of the effort the recommended arrangement which is generally supported by the st ates agencies and environmental and navigation organizations would result in the 53 billion of restoration costs being split 91 federal 9 nonfedera l this cost share coul d be viewed as reflecting federal responsibility for mitig ating damage caused by existing federal projects other federal agencies basin states nvironmental organizations and the nrc support the corps proposed costshare obser vers outside the ba and others less likely to be direct beneficiaries of investments may argue that nonfederal beneficiaries should pay hi gher portion of the cost although the corps provides justifi cation for the dominance of federal financing some observers may dispute this dominance for various reasons one reason stems from part of the percei ved motivation for adopting costshare arrangements in wrda 1986 the costsha re formulas cant gu arantee that every new project will be worth the price but they will force state and local interests to weigh the costs against the benefits more conscientiously58 in this view one purpose of costsharing is to put corps proj ects to market test whereby state and local beneficiaries confirm the value of project by agreeing to share in the cost59 another benefit is that nonfederal spons ors may have greater sense of project ownership in contrast the absence of local financial involvement can be seen as particularly problematic for restoration project which lacks benefitcost analysis that identifies the level of investments at which the costs outweigh the benefits of longer term ecosystem services suppor ting humaneconomic endeavors and other societal values on the other hand one could argue that the willingness of local partner to pay for ecosystem restorati on does not provide an accurate litmus test given the ecosystems national significance some environmental organizations are concerned with how the costsshare arrangement will effect the corps restoration priorities they fear that requiring the nonfederal sponsors to contribute 35 for some activities will discourage the corps from aggressively pursuing these activities particularly floodplain management activities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32630crs17 60 corps final feasibility report and peis p qm5 61 ibid p qm5a second objection to the dominance of fe deral financing for umrs restoration may be that the available fe deral funding for umrs restor ation could be constraint on restoration progress the federal government and the corps in particular is or may become involved in other largescal multibillion dollar restoration efforts such as the florida everglades restoration and the coastal louisiana wetlands restoration this growin g financial commitment to re storation investments is happening within the context of large proj ected federal budget deficits and backlog of corps construction projects curren tly estimated at more than 40 billion restoration scope the corps constrained the restoration plan by limiting its geographic scope the corps plan targ ets restoration for the umrs that is the umriww and its floodplain as result reducing stressors that are beyond the floodplain in the larger watershed ar not included among the recommended measures instead the plan recommends measures to address the symptoms of these stressors that is the corps restorati on plan does not include changes to land use practices related to increased sedimentation and degradation of other water quality parameters flood damage reduction practi ces on largescale or significant alterations to navigation infrastructure for example the corps plan recommends backwater dredging measures dredging addresses the symptom of elevated sedimentation but not the land use practices that can cause it b ecause these practices are considered outside the scope of th navigation study and navigation project substantial restoration benefits are not in the corps plan because they would interfere with navigation the corps also limits the recommended restoration measures to the scope of the navigation project and study that is the measures are to address the cumulative impacts of operations of fe deral projects and other ecosystem stressors without harming navigation for example dramatic water level change s that could produce substantial restorati on benefits are not in the corps plan because they would interfere with navigation the nrc recommended in its december 2003 report that the corps should to the extent feasible use more holistic approach that includes factors such as water quality flood damage reduction and sediment transport the corps maintains that more comprehensive watershedtype approach is beyond the scope of the authorization under which the ag ency is conducting the feasib ility study60 according to the corps another reason for the current restoration scope is that the five basin states support the concept that the study should remain focused on navigation and an environmentally sustainable navigation system61 because only some of the stressors causing ecosystem degradation are manage d under the corps plan not all of the ecosystems natural river processes are restored resulting in the need for regular human intervention to obtain some restor ation benefits so environmental organizations such as american rivers w ould prefer to have ecosystem restoration authorized for the entire watershed activities under th corps proposal would be limited in scope to the umrs the oct ober 2004 nrc report s howed less concern about the geographic scope of the restora tion effort and was more interested inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32630crs18 62 this interest in natural river processes and floodplain connectivity is linked to another criticism made by the nrc the october 2004 nrc report p 8 states that proposed restoration measures repres ent an impressive range and number of candidate actions the assembly of those measures into restoration alternatives however is not adequately grounded in pr inciples and theories of large river floodplain science and restoration 63 ibid pp 23 the october 2004 nrc report also questions if the corps assumption that the navigation season and 9foot channel depth will remain unchanged is appropriate and if this assumption implicitly gives navigation superior position to other river uses ibid pp 1920 64 these organizations do not necessarily support the corps entire navigation proposal they tend to oppose lock expansion but support smallscale measures 65 for more information on current legislation see crs report rl32574 upper mississippi riverillinois waterway investments proposed authorization legislation in the 108th congress by nicole t carter and kyna powers restoring natural river pro cesses that shape floodplains62 consequently the nrc supports not only dual purpose authorizati on but also multipurpose authorization that includes flood management63 would more comprehensive watershed approach accomplish restoration at less cost in the longrun and if so would this reduced cost be offset by potential constraints on naviga tion and flood damage reduction benefits linked authorization as described above th corps limited the scope of its ecosystem restoration proposal to the navigation channel and surrounding floodplain the corps selected this scope because restoration pl ans were developed in the context of the navigation study that is the study has restor ation as half of dualpurpose plan the environmental co mmunity uniformly support the need for restoration investments nd dualpurpose management the community however is not united on how to achieve th is some environmental groups64 such as the mississippi river basin alliance and audubon s upport aut horizing package of restoration and navigation investments within dual purpose management context other environmental groups would like to see additional ecosystem restoration authorized through the existing structure of the emp without authorizing largescale investments in navigation legislation on the corps proposal coul d link navigation funding to ecosystem restoration alternatively legislation could authorize ecosystem restoration without authorizing the navigati on project or vice versa65 should authorization or funding for ecosystem restoration and navigation be linked if so how closely should they be joined these questions apply be yond the corps pr oposal for the umr iwwumrs to other corps projects and other fe deral restoration efforts as the first combined largescale navigation and ecosy stem restoration project it could set precedent for future proposals what is the threshold for adding ecosystem restoration to other federa l projects should all larg escale water projects eg locks dams and levees have an ecosyst em restoration component in addition to their ecosystems rivers are resources that may be used for multiple purposes such as hydro power navigation flood control r ecreation and water pply while manyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32630crs19 66 most federal dams are managed for multiple purposes furthermore licenses issued by the federal energy regulatory commission for nonfederal dams often contain provisions aimed at retaining or enhancing the rivers recreational ecological or tribal benefitsfacilities such as dams66 are managed for multiple purposes agencies have been directed to construct and operate number of federal projects for single purposes should all federal projects be managed for multiple purposes linking ecosystem restoration and navigation as with any multipurpose designati on is ultimately policy question of how congre ss wants federal agencies to manage public resources conclusion the army corps of engineers has released final feasibility report and chiefs report recommending that congress aut horize 15year initial increment of ecosystem restoration measures as part of combined 50year investment and management framework for umriww navigation and umrs restoration authorization of umrs rest oration poses policy questions for decision makers such as what level of restorati on should be authorized and at what cost what should be the federal responsibility for umrs restoration inves tments congress is being asked to answer these questions in the context of interest in and debate over navigation expansion on the umriww the answers that congress may provide are likely to be viewed as precedent setting for other largescale restoration efforts especially efforts for ecosystem restorati on of other inland wate rways and rivers an additional challenge is the uncertain ty of what would be achieved through umrs restoration investments this uncertainty comes from multiple sources ecosystem restoration is young science th corps plan only ddresses some of the stressors causing ecosystem decline an d restoration impleme ntation depends on available appropriations the issue for po licymakers is further complicated because analytic tools to assist in decisionmaking for restoration projects are less robust than for other corps projects that use benefitcost analysis the corps has recognized these challenges in its feasibility report in res ponse the agency recommends an adaptive management and implementation strategy for restoration however some observers see adaptive management as c ontributing another element of uncertainty and risk congress may weigh these risks when considering the level of ecosystem restoration and fede ral investment for the umrs if it wants to make these restoration investments in conjunction with navigation ex pansion or separately and what role it wants during imp lementation and funding
