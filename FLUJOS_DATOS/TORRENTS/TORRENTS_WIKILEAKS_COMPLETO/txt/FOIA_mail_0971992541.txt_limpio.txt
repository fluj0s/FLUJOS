from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject re jgr paper date thu oct 19 175541 2000 i am just having to go so i will think about the should we the answer to the can we is yes i have spoken to the person organising the editorial review and she has promised she will get it to us in the next week or so if we can get it back immediattely she says we can make the december issue therefore it is possible to do the edits if it means very little change to the text i have also confirmed that we will pay 1500 dollars for the colour and they say they are working on these now i really want to get this into the 2000 so i can include it in the rae ed is here now and has some great looking extended pdsi reconstructions 1000 years for the western us i am suspicious as to whether the negative trend in mikes hockey stick prior to the 20th century is not at least partly the result of trend in the long high elevation western us trees he uses malcolm sent some figures for the hihol meeting and in this work he cuts off the juvenile growth sections of the long tree data but does detrending on the remainder this might leave linear age trend in these data i remember that mike in his long reconstruction stated that the pc representing the western us stuff was essential for getting verifiable result interesting but only diversion we can discuss the jgr and other stuff in avignon hope your weekend was god one i tend to agree bout the nao meeting you could use the money and perhaps time to better effect at 0424 pm 101900 0100 you wrote keith have you had to produce the cameraready copy for the agebanded jgr paper yet if not then is it possible to make some minor changes to it for the comparison with the mann et reconstruction i had previously just taken their landmarine full northern hemisphere mean annual temperature time series and recalibrated it against the instrumental land north of 20n aprsep mean temperature time series well i have not taken the mann et spatial temperature field reconstructions and computed land north of 20n area mean i still have to recalibrate it against the instrumental series because it is an annual rather than aprsep mean after doing all this youll be pleased to know that the final figure is only slightly different the mann et curve is very slightly more of an outlier during the 15001700 period and is cooler and closer to observations post1950 but not much different elsewhere what does change however are the correlations the correlations with instrumental data are slightly worse from 076 to 073 and from 092 to 089 decadal but im not sure that we show these anyway but the crosscorrelations between the mann et and the other reconstructions which we do show are all stronger than previously which now seems little unfair on them crosscorrelations between unfiltered series mann versus jones briffa abd briffa torntaiyam before 047 036 033 now 050 037 034 crosscorrelations between 50yr smoothed series mann versus jones briffa abd briffa tty overpeck crowley before 078 043 050 086 076 now 081 051 055 086 078 i dont have copy of the paper in front of but the before values should match those in one of the tables some of the 50yr smoothed new values are noticeably stronger can we make these changes still or is it too late and do you think we should cheers tim
