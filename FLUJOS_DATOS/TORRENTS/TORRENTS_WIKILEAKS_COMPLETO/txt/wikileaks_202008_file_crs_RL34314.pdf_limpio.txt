its relatively low savings rate the us economy depends heavily on foreign capital inflows from countries with high savings rates such as china to help promote growth and to fund the federal budget deficit china has intervened heavily in currency markets to limit the appreciation of its currency especially against the dollar as result china has become the worlds largest and fastest growing holder of foreign exchange reserves fer china has invested large share of its fer in us securities which as of june 2007 totaled 922 billion making china the 2 nd largest foreign holder of us securities after japan these securities include longterm lt treasury debt lt us agency debt lt us corporate debt lt us equities and shortterm debt us treasury securities are issued to finance the federal budget deficit of the public debt that is privately held about half is held by foreigners as of october 2008 chinas treasury securities holdings were 653 billion accounting for 215 of total foreign ownership of us treasury securities making it the largest foreign holder of us treasuries replacing japan in september 2008 chinas holdings of us treasuries rose by 45 billion september 2008 and by 66 billion in october reflecting in part movement by china away from purchases of us agency asset backed securities such those issued by fannie mae and freddie mac to more safe us government securities some us policymakers have expressed concern that china might try to use its large holdings of us securities including us public debt as leverage against us policies it opposes for example in the past some chinese officials reportedly suggested that china could dump or threaten to dump large share of its holdings to prevent the united states from imposing trade sanctions against china over its currency policy other chinese officials reportedly stated that china should diversify its investments of its foreign exchange reserves away from dollar denominated assets to those that offer higher rates of returns the recent global financial crisis has heightened us concerns that china might reduce its us asset holdings gradual decline in chinas holdings of us assets would not be expected to have negative impact on the us economy since it could be matched by increased us exports and lower trade deficit however some economists contend that attempts by china to unload large share of its us securities holdings could have significant negative impact on the us economy at least in the short run especially if such move sparked sharp depreciation of the dollar in international markets and induced other foreign investors to sell off their us holdings as well in order to keep or attract that investment back u s interest rates would rise which would dampen us economic growth all else equal other economists counter that it would not be in chinas economic interest to suddenly sell off its us investment holdings doing so could lead to financial losses for the chinese government and any shocks to the us economy caused by this action could ultimately hurt chinas economy as well the issue of chinas large holdings of us securities is part of larger debate among economists over how long the high us reliance on foreign investment can be sustained to what extent that reliance poses risks to the economy and how to evaluate the costs associated with borrowing versus the benefits that would accrue to the economy from that practice this report will be updated as events warrant

finance the federal budget deficit and its capital needs in order to enjoy healthy economic growth it therefore depends on countries with high savings rates such as china to invest some of its capital in the united states chinas central bank is major purchaser of us assets largely because of its exchange rate policy in order to mitigate the yuans appreciation against the dollar chinas central bank must purchase us dollars 1 this has led china to amass huge level of foreign exchange reserves fer these totaled 19 trillion as of september 2008 rather than hold dollars which earn interest the chinese central government has converted some level of its fer holdings into financial securities since foreign exchange holdings facilitate trade and prevent speculation against their currency the central bank also holds securities from other foreign countries the united states is major destination of chinas overseas investment china is the second largest holder of us securities which include us treasury securities that are used to finance the federal budget deficit some us policymakers have expressed concern that chinas large holdings of us securities may pose risk to the us economy should china stop purchasing those securities or attempt to divest itself of large share of its holdings in addition chinas fer are expected to continue to grow rapidly in the near future potentially continuing and possibly increasing chinas role as major buyer of us securities the recent financial crisis in the united states and the administrations proposed plans to purchase troubled assets is expected to cost th government hundreds of billions of dollars at least initially this will require substantial level of new government borrowing some of which will likely be financed by foreign investors china could be major purchaser of new us government debt this report examines the importance to the us economy of chinas investment in us securities as well as us concerns over the possibility that china might unload large share of those holdings the likelihood that this would occur and the potential implications such action could have for the us economy the report concludes that large selloff of chinese treasury securities holdings could negatively affect the us economy at least in the shortrun as result such move could diminish us demand for chinese products and thus could lower chinas economic growth as well the issue of chinas large holdings of us securities is part of broader question that has been raised by many economists what are the implications of the

against their currency the central bank also holds securities from other foreign countries there are official estimates of what share of chinas foreign reserves are held in dollar denominated assets assets that were bought with dollars and are cashed in dollars but the treasury department conducts an annual survey of foreign portfolio holdings of us securities by country and reports data for the previous year as of the end of june 6 the report does not distinguish between government and private holdings of us securities us securities include longterm lt us treasury securities lt us government agency securities7 lt corporate securities some of which are assetbacked equities such as stocks and shortterm debt8 according to the latest treasury survey released in april 2008 chinas total holdings of us securities of 927 billion at the end of june 2007 were more than triple its holdings in 2003 see figure 1 9 from june 2006 to june 2007 chinas us securities holdings grew by 223 billion

japan11 chinas main holdings were in lt treasury securities and lt government agency securities see figure 1 12 this likely indicates that large share of chinas holdings of us securities are controlled by the chinese government and that it has been pursuing relatively lowrisk investment strategy in contrast most of the united kingdoms securities holdings were in corporate debt and equities chinas holdings of us securities accounted for 94 of total foreign holdings of us securities as of june 2007 although the chinese government does not make public the dollar composition of its foreign exchange holdings many analysts estimate this level to be around 7013 if this figure is correct chinas holdings of us securities may have reached 13 trillion as of september 2008 11 according to the treasury department data on foreign holdings of us securities should be treated with caution due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate information on the actual foreign owners of us securities for example chains of foreign financial intermediaries may be involved in the custody or management of these securities 12 china was the largest foreign holder of lt us agency securities

programme university college oxford before the house budget committee foreign holdings of us debt is our economy vulnerable june 26 2007 p 11 in addition the peoples daily online august 28 2006 estimated chinas dollar holdings to total fer at 70 rough estimate can be made by taking the value of chinas holdings of us secur ities 922 billion at the end of june 2007 and dividing it by chinas foreign exchange reserves 1333 billion at the end of june 2007 which would equal 692 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34314g5g145g146g151g138g514g156g561g10g152g149g141g146g151

china could use it as political tool against the united states to illustrate an august 7 2007 article in the telegraph an online british newspaper cited interviews with officials from two leading chinese government think tanks who reportedly stated that china had the power to make the dollar collapse if it chose to do so by liquidating large portions of its us treasury securities holdings if the united states imposed trade sanctions to force yuan revaluation and that the threat to do so could be used as bargaining chip 19 the article prompted concern among many us policymakers including senator chuck grassley who in an august 9 2007 letter to the chinese ambassador to the united states zhou wenzhong called the comments dangerous and factor in why the united states is right to be concerned with chinas currency practices the letter asked the chinese government to confirm that the comments do not reflect the official position of the chinese government 20 in response the chinese

of its foreign reserves21 in addition chinas xinhua news agency on august 13 2007 quoted an unnamed official at the peoples bank of china as stating that dollard enominated assets including us government securities are an important component in chinas foreign exchange reserve investment portfolio and that china was responsible investor numerous reports have appeared in the media citing various chinese officials who have claimed or hinted at government plans to reduce its holdings of us treasury securities for economic reasons for example on september 29 2007 the chinese government officially launched the stateowned china investment corporation which chinese officials state was created to better manage its foreign exchange reserves it reportedly will initially manage over 200 billion of chinas reserves making it one of the worlds largest sovereign wealth funds some contend the creation of this entity could signal chinese plans to diversify away from relatively lowyielding assets such as treasury securities and perhaps dollardenominated assets in general 22 on november 7 2007 cheng siwei the vice chairman of the chinese national peoples congress reportedly made remarks that the chinese government will favor stronger currencies over weaker ones and will readjust accordingly the media claimed that his remarks were major factor in sparking sharp decline of the dollar against the euro in international currency markets that day23 however on november 14 2007 yi gang assi stant governor of the peoples bank of china was quoted as saying that the us dollar is the main currency in our reserves and that policy remains very firm and said that statements by other officials to the contrary were opinions24 some us policymakers have recently raised concerns that china for economic reasons such as concerns over the safety of its current holdings of us securities might seek to liquidate such assets or significantly cut back on purchases of new securities these fears have been heightened as result of the us subprime mortgage crisis and the subsequent global financial crisis 25

would be sold to other investors foreign and domestic who would presumably require higher interest rates than those prevailing today to be enticed to buy them one analyst estimates that chinese move away from longterm us securities could raise interest rates by as much as 50 basis points27 higher interest rates would cause decline in investment spending nd other interestsensitive spending all else equal the reduction in chinese treasury holdings would cause the overall foreign demand for us assets to fall and this would cause the dollar to depreciate if the value of the dollar depreciated the trade deficit would decline as the price of us exports fell abroad and the price of imports rose in the united states 28 the magnitude of these effects would depend on how many us securities china sold modest reductions would have negligible effects on the economy given the vastness of us financial markets since china held 922 billion of us governme nt assets as of june 2007 and possibly 13 trillion as of september 2008 any reduction in its us holdings could potentially be large if there were large reduction in its holdings the effect on the us economy would still depend on whether the reduction were gradual or sudden it should be emphasized that economic theory suggests that slow decline in the trade deficit and dollar would not be troublesome for the overall economy in fact slow decline could even have an expansionary effect on the economy if the decrease in the trade deficit had more stimulative effect on aggregate demand in the short run than the decrease in investment and other interestsensitive spending resulting from higher interest rates historical experience seems to bear this outthe dollar declined by about 40 in real terms and the trade deficit declined continually in the late 1980s from 28 of gdp in 1986 to nearly zero during the early 1990s yet economic growth was strong throughout the late 1980s potentially serious shortterm problem would emerge if china decided to suddenly reduce their liquid us financial assets significantly the effect could be compounded if this action triggered more general financial reaction or panic in which all foreigners responded by reducing their holdings of us assets the initial effect could be sudden and large depreciation in the value of the dollar as the supply of dollars on the foreign exchange market increased and sudden and large increase in us interest rates as an important funding source for investment and the budget deficit was withdrawn from the financial markets the dollar depreciation would not cause recession since it would ultimately lead to trade surplus or smaller deficit which expands aggregate demand 29 empirical evidence suggests that the full effects of change in the exchange rate on traded goods takes time so the dollar may have to overshoot its eventual depreciation level in order to achieve significant adjustment in trade flows in the short run30 however sudden increase in interest rates could swamp the trade effects and cause or worsen 27 testimony of brad setser befo re the house budget committee foreign holdings of us debt is our economy vulnerable june 26 2007 brad setser is senior economist roubini global economics and research associate global economic governance programme university college oxford setser does not detail how much us debt he assumes china would sell to reach his estimate 28 the extent that the dollar declined and us interest rate s rose would depend on how willing other foreigners were to supplant chinas reduction in capital inflows greater willingness would lead to less dollar depreciation and less of an increase in interest rates and vice versa 29 sharp decline in the value of the dollar would also reduce living standards all else equal because it would raise the price of imports to households this effect which is referred to as decline in the terms of trade would not be recorded directly in gdp however 30 since the decline in the dollar would raise import prices this could temporarily increase inflationary pressures the effect would likely be modest however since imports are small as share of gdp and import prices would only gradually rise in response to the fall in the dollar

problems for the us economy as these increases reduce the market value of debt securities cause prices on the stock market to fall undermine efficient financial intermediation and jeopardize the solvency of various debtors and creditors resources may not be able to shift quickly enough from interestsensitive sectors to export sectors to make this transition fluid the federal reserve could mitigate the interest rate spike by reducing shortterm interest rates although this reduction would influence longterm rates only indirectly and could worsen the dollar depreciation and increase inflation some us officials have expressed doubts that chinese selloff of us securities would cause liquidity problems or have much of an impact on the us economy in january 2007 secretary of treasury henry paulson was asked at senate banking committee hearing whether or not he was concerned over chinas large ownership of us debt paulson stated that the daily volume of trade in treasury securities was larger than chinas total treasury securities holdings and concluded given the size of our debt outstanding and the way it trades and the diversity and so on thats not at the top of the list 31 according to the treasury department gross foreign purchases and sales of us marketable treasury bonds and notes in 2006 were 110 trillion and 108 trillion respectively32 in addition the average daily trading volume by primary dealers of all us treasury securities sold in the us in 2006 was 524 billion33 in march 2007 federal reserve chairman ben bernanke reportedly stated in letter to senator shelby that because foreign holdings of us treasury securities represent only small part of total us credit market debt outstanding us credit markets should be able to absorb without great difficulty any shift of foreign allocations he also reportedly stated that even if such shift were to put undesired upward pressure on us interest rates the federal reserve has the capacity to operate in domestic money markets to maintain interest rates at level consistent with our economic goals 34 the likelihood that china would suddenly reduce its holdings of us securities is questionable because it is doubtful that doing so would be in chinas economic interests first large selloff of chinas us holdings could diminish the value of these securities in international markets which would lead to large losses on the sale and would in turn decrease the value of chinas remaining dollardenominated assets 35 this would also occur if the value of the dollar were greatly diminished in international currency markets due to chinas selloff36 second such move would diminish us demand for chinese imports either through rise in the value of the yuan against the dollar or reduction in us economic growth especially if other foreign investors sold their us asset holdings and the united states was forced to raise interest rates in 31 congressional transcripts congressional hearings senate banking housing and urban affairs committee hearing on uschina strategic economic dialogue january 31 2007 32 these figures include purchases of newly issued securities as well as transactions executed in the

bernankechina holdings of us debt not problematic march 26 2007 35 since there are many other holders of us assets it is po ssible that if china believed decline in asset values was imminent it could minimize its losses by dumping its us assets first however 36 selling off us dollar assets could cause the yuan to ppreciate against the dollar which would lower the value of remaining us assets since the assets are dollardenominated

total merchandise exports in 2007 sharp reduction of us imports from chin could have significant impact on chinas economy which heavily depends on exports for its economic growth and is viewed by the government as vital source of political stability38 finally any major action by the chinese government that destabilized or further destabilized the us economy whether deliberate or not could provoke protectionist sentiment in the united states against china g5g152g151g140g149g158g141g146g151g144g561g17g139g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 many economists argue that concerns over chinas holdings of us securities represent part of broader problem for the us economy namely its dependence on foreign saving to finance its investment needs and federal budget deficits 39 the large us current account deficit the manifestation of the high us savinginvestment gap cannot be sustained indefinitely because the us net foreign debt cannot rise faster than gdp indefinitely 40 some economists argue that at some point foreign investors may view the growing level of us foreign debt as unsustainable or more risky or they may longer view us securities as offering the best return on their investment and shift investment funds away from us assets thus forcing us interest rates to rise to attract needed foreign capital this would result in higher interest rates and lower investment rates all else equal which would reduce longterm growth 41 other economists contend that although the low us savings rate is problem the us current account deficit and high levels of foreign capital flows to the united states are also reflections of the strength of the us economy and its attractiveness as destination for foreign investment and therefore discount the likelihood that foreign investors will suddenly shift their capital elsewhere42 the united states continues to press china to make its currency policy more flexible so that the yuan will appreciate more significantly against the dollar and to adopt policies that promote domestic consumption as major source of chinas economic growth as opposed to export and fixed investmentled growth that has resulted from chinas currency policy 43 this is viewed as major step towards reducing global trade imbalances including the large uschina trade 37 in addition if dollar collapse occurred us imports from other major trade partners would decline which could slow their economies this in turn could weaken their demand for chinese products 38 although falling dollar may harm chinas shortterm gr owth via reduced chinese exports and export sector related employment it would also improve chinas terms of trade with the united states raising chinas overall consumption since it could now spend less to acquire the same amount of american goods which would also create jobs in other sectors of the economy because of increased consumer purchasing power 39 nations such as the united states that fail to save enough to meet their investment needs must obtain savings from other countries with high savings rates such as china by obtaining resources from foreign investors for its investment needs the united states is able to enjoy high er rate of consumption than it would if investment were funded by domestic savings alone the inflow of foreign capital to the united states is equivalent to the united states borrowing from the rest of the world the only way the united states can borrow from the rest of the world is by importing more than it exports which produces trade and current account deficit 40 the current account

must also boost its level of savings if china consumed more and saved less it would have less capital to invest overseas including in the united states thus if the united states did not reduce its dependence on foreign savings for its investment needs and china reduced its us investments the united states would need to obtain investment from other countries and the overall us current account balance would likely remain relatively unchanged some us policymakers have expressed hope that china will increase its us debt holdings in order to help the federal government pay for its financial rescue plan and future stimulus packages44 but others have expressed concern that becoming more reliant on chinese purchases of us debt would increase chinas political leverage over the united states and may make it more difficult for the united states to induce china to appreciate its currency more quickly and to make other needed reforms to its economy
