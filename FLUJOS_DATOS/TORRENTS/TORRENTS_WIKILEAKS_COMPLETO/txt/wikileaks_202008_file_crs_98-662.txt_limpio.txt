since its inception congress has used commemorative legislation to express public gratitude for distinguished contributions dramatize the virtues of individuals groups and causes and perpetuate the remembrance of significant events during the past two centuries commemoratives have been become an integral part of the american political tradition they have been used to authorize the minting of commemorative coins and congressional gold medals fund monuments and memorials create federal holidays establish commissions to celebrate important anniversaries and name public works scholarships endowments fellowships and historic sites prior to the 96th congress 19791980 the volume of commemorative legislation never exceeded 10 of public bills signed into law during the next 16 years 96th103rd congresses however commemoratives constituted an average of 3075 of all public laws signed by the president by far the most common of these congressional expressions 73 were requests for the president to issue special proclamation designating particular day week month or year for commemoration this dramatic increase caused concern among both members of congress and other observers particularly the media it was asserted that the time spent in consideration of commemoratives hindered the ability of congress to deal with more pressing legislative issues at the outset of the 104th congress the house adopted rule change which banned legislation that commemorated any remembrance celebration or recognition for any purpose through the designation of special period of time this change together with the passage of more restrictive laws rules and procedures governing the enactment of several other types of commemoratives has substantially reduced the time congress spends considering and adopting such measures this report summarizes the evolution of commemorative legislation as well as the laws rules and procedures that have been adopted to control the number of

legislation evolution and procedures at the opening of the 104th congress on january 4 1995 the newly elected republican majority in the house of representatives adopted several new rules which formally signaled time of change on capitol hill among these procedural and institutional modifications was banning of legislation that commemorated any remembrance celebration or recognition for any purpose through the designation of special period of time1 simple resolutions designating special days weeks months and years for commemoration continue to be passed by the senate but they only express the sentiments of that body the houses action in banning commemorative observances did not affect passage of other types of commemorative legislation such as the naming of public buildings structures and other sites awarding congressional gold medals authorizing the issuance of commemorative coins creating national monuments and memorials and commissioning statuary and busts during the past several years through various laws and committee rules congress has established criteria for the consideration as well as enactment of various types of commemoratives this report summarizes those procedures and provides brief overview of the evolution of commemorative legislation evolution of commemorative legislation since its inception congress has used commemorative legislation to express public gratitude for distinguished contributions dramatize the virtues of individuals groups and causes and perpetuate the remembrance of significant events the first commemoratives were primarily in the form of individually struck medals during the 19 th century congress gradually broadened the scope of commemoratives by recommending special days for national observance funding monuments and memorials creating federal holidays authorizing the minting of commemorative coins and establishing commissions to celebrate important anniversaries in the 20th century it has become increasingly commonplace for congress to use commemorative legislation to name buildings dams and other public works scholarships endowments fellowships and historic sites prior to 1900 commemorative legislation rarely accounted for more than 1 of the total public laws enacted by particular congress and never exceed 5 until the 85 th congress 19571958 during the next two decades 19591978 the ratio 1 ban on commemoratives congressional record daily edition vol 141 jan 4 1995 pp h29h30 crs2 ranged from 5 to little less than 10 of all legislation then dramatic change took place in the 96th congress 19791980 commemorative legislation increased by 70 the following congress commemoratives rose by nearly 50 by the 98th congress 19831984 they constituted more than onethird of all bills signed into law by the president by far the most common of these congressional expressions nearly 80 were requests for the president to issue special proclamation designating particular day week month or year for commemoration2 growth of commemorative proclamations commemorative observances continued to be the most popular type of commemorative legislation for another decade 19851994 accounting for an average of 276 of the public laws signed by the president other types of commemorative bills made up another 9 of public enactments for the period for those ten years 366 of all public laws enacted were commemorative in nature see table 4 for statistical summary of commemorative laws enacted in the 20th century significant decline in the percentage of commemorative observances in the 102nd and 103rd congresses did little to deter those opposed to such legislation by that time representatives of both political parties had become convinced that congress should not devote even small portion of its attention to such legislation when other matters in their opinion were far more important and pressing3 at the same time the media poked fun with increasing frequency at what it perceived to be the misplaced priorities of the commemorative process4 2 commemorative proclamations can be issued by presidents without any action by congress and have been regularly throughout american history since 1789 when president george washington issued the first proclamation declaring november 26 of that year national day of thanksgiving there have been hundreds of such designations on more than 1300 occasions however congress initiated such actions by passing joint resolution requesting the president to make such designation although most commemorative observances approved by congress are only applicable for single year or single congress more than 40 perpetual observance resolutions that call for the president to issue annual proclamations automatically have been approved since 1914 see table 3 for list of perpetual commemoratives 3 1990 house survey found that an overwhelming majority of respondents felt congresss time would be better spent on matters having higher priority us

march 10 1990 p a21 crs3 earlier reform efforts presidential commission idea during the mid1960s several proposals were introduced to shift the responsibility of designating commemorative celebrations to presidential commission twice the commission idea was embraced by the house but was never acted upon by the senate5 proposed rule changes others sought to reform the process by prohibiting consideration of special observances or by creating commemorative calendar to control their floor consideration house committee guidelines aimed at limiting commemoratives were formally published for the first time in 1976 when the post office and civil service committee assumed jurisdiction over commemorative celebrations similar procedures were adopted by the senate judiciary committee decade later observances however continued to be passed in near record numbers effect of the house ban during the 102nd103rd congresses which immediately preceded the house ban 147 and 81 commemorative observances respectively were approved the ban has also influenced senate consideration of commemorative observances since adoption of the ban senate action on commemorative observances has declined significantly it approved just 28 observances in the 104th congress and has thus far approved only 41 observances in the 105th congress of the senate resolutions adopted in the 104th 105th congresses 80 included request for presidential proclamation while 20 proclaimed specific days or weeks for commemoration independent of any presidential action the president on his own initiative issued 96

enactment of commemorative legislation are derived from committee practice committee rules and law the accompanying guidelines cover the five most common types of commemoratives approved during the past two congresses 1 senate resolutions calling for the commemoration of special days weeks months or years 2 legislation naming federal buildings 3 legislation authorizing the minting of commemorative coins 4 legislation authorizing the president to award gold medal on behalf of congress and 5 legislation calling for the construction expansion or renovation of monument or memorial in the district of columbia commemorative observances senate resolutions designating special days weeks months or years are generally referred to the judiciary committee the senate judiciary committee crs5 currently considers commemorative legislation only in the months of february june and october written reports are not filed regarding this type of legislation each commemorative measure must have at least 50 cosponsors at least 20 must be republicans and 20 democrats the sponsor of the measure is not included in this number the judiciary committee prohibits the commemoration of commercial enterprise industry or specific product or fraternal political business labor or sectarian organization particular state or any political subdivision of state city town county school or institution of higher learning or living person proposals for recurring annual commemorations are prohibited by the senate judiciary committee the committee will provide for an annual commemoration in each of two years however if 1 such proposal is introduced during the first session of congress 2 it is substantially similar to an earlier bill that was passed in each of the four years immediately preceding the first year of the proposed commemoration or 3 the commemoration period proposed would occur before the commencement of the next congress request for waiver of these requirements may not be considered unless twothirds of the senate indicates desire to do so6 naming federal buildings us post offices when considering legislation calling for united states post office to be named after particular individual the house subcommittee on postal service of the committee on government reform requires that the bill be cosponsored by all the representatives from the state in which the facility is located the senate committee on governmental affairs has such requirement7 other federal buildings by law the administrator of general services is authorized notwithstanding any other provision of law to name rename or otherwise designate any building under the custody and control of the general services administration8 both the current administrator as well as his immediate predecessors however have always deferred to congress in such matters rule 7d of the senate committee on environment and public works prohibits naming building structure or facility for any living person except former presidents or former vice presidents of the united states former members of congress over 70 years of age or former justices of the supreme court over 70 years of age9 1995 memorandum prepared by the

the senate congressional record vol 145 jan 20 1999 p s809 crs6 transportation of the committee on transportation and infrastructure identified seven criteria for the subcommittee to consider in naming public building 1 the building must be under the control of the general services administration gsa or the architect of the capitol leased buildings are normally not named unless the building is under lease purchase authority 2 the building must not currently be named for an individual 3 subcommittee consideration does not occur unless the member in whose district the building is located sponsors the legislation or otherwise consents to the naming 4 age requirements are not applicable 5 priority is not given to any particular class or occupation of individuals 6 the subcommittee generally does not name buildings for sitting members of congress and 7 the person for whom the building is named must have good reputation10 commemorative coins the guidelines for consideration of legislation authorizing commemorative coins most of which have been established in the 1990s were developed in response to perceived need to limit the number of commemorative coin programs authorized annually and to ensure the financial integrity of the program advisory coin committee in 1992 congress created sevenmember citizens commemorative coin advisory committee cccac to advise the secretary of the treasury and congress on the selection of subjects and designs for commemorative coins the cccac was specifically charged with designating annually the events persons or places that the advisory committee recommends should be commemorated by the issuance of commemorative coins in each of 5 calendar years succeeding the year in which such designation is made making recommendations with respect to the minting level for any commemorative coin recommended and submitting report to congress containing description of events persons or places which the committee recommends be commemorated by coin the minting level recommended for any such commemorative coin and the committees reasons for such recommendations11 criteria for selection of commemorative coin themes in its first annual report to congress in november 1994 the cccac concluded that given the current state of the commemorative market the committees first priority must be to restrain the proliferation of commemorative coin programs while at the same time developing program that reflects the noblest values and achievements of the 10 us congress house committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on public buildings and economic development the naming of public buildings internal committee memorandum dated july 16 1995 the subcommittee which was renamed the subcommittee on economic development public buildings hazardous materials and pipeline transportation at the start of the 106th congress still adheres to these guidelines 11 public law 102390 sec 229 oct 6 1992 106 stat 1632 crs7 nation12 after soliciting comments from the general and numismatic press and public forum at the 1994 annual convention of the american numismatic association the committee established the following criteria for selection of commemorative themes for united states coins to achieve these goals historical persons places events and themes to be commemorated should have had an enduring effect on the nations history and culture their significance should be of national or international scope13 events to be commemorated should have national or international significance and draw participation from across america or around the world living person should be honored by commemoration on us coins united states commemorative coins should be issued in the appropriate year of commemoration historical events should generally be considered for commemoration on important or significant anniversaries commemorative themes and designs should not be considered if one treating the same subject has been issued in the past ten years commemorative coinage designs should reflect traditional american coin iconography as well as contemporary developments in the arts designs should be determined in consultation with sponsoring organizations but should not be determined by legislation commemorative coinage should not be required to contain logos and emblems of nongovernment organizations as part of the design coins should be dated in the year of their issuance legislation authorizing the production of coins should be enacted less than nine months prior to the date on which the coins may first be available to the public14 1993 sense of the congress resolution fourteen months after congress created the citizens commemorative coin advisory committee it declared in 12 citizens commemorative coin advisory committee first annual report to congress nov 1994 pp 14 13 the following themes were considered inappropriate for commemoration 1 state or regional anniversaries with little or national significance 2 local institutions such as governments universities and public and private schools 3 commercial enterprises and products and 4 organizations individuals and themes principally sectarian in nature ibid p 7 14 ibid pp 78 crs8 sense of congress resolution that the senate and house banking committees should not report or otherwise clear for consideration more than two commemorative coin programs for any year unless the committee determines on the basis of recommendation by the citizens commemorative coin advisory committee that extraordinary merit exists for an additional commemorative coin program it was in the interests of all members of congress the resolution found that policy be established to control the flow of commemorative coin legislation which had increased at pace beyond that which the numismatic community can reasonably be expected to absorb15 surcharge recipients required to submit quarterly reports 1993 also in 1993 congress enacted legislation requiring each recipient of surcharges derived from the sale of commemorative coins under any act of congress to submit quarterly financial reports to the director of the mint and comptroller general of the united states describing in detail the expenditures made by such person from the proceeds of the surcharge16 1996 statutory restrictions additional clarifications were made in the commemorative coin program in 1996 these adjustments placed restrictions on the number of new commemorative coin programs two each calendar year beginning january 1 1999 and annual mintage levels of such programs required that all surcharges from numismatic operations be deposited in the numismatic public enterprise fund stipulated conditions for payment of surcharges to recipient organizations mandated an annual audit of recipient organizations and prohibited proceeds of any surcharge from being used to influence coin legislation17 15 pl 103186 title iii sec 301 dec 14 1993 107 stat 2251 16 ibid sec 302 the surcharge is fee that congress by law adds to the price of commemorative coin for distribution to specific endowment fund or organization these entities are then allowed to use the revenues raised through the surcharges to promote or commemorate notable individuals from the past service and heroism historical events national monuments and memorials and american ideals by law the mints numismatic coin programs must be selfsupporting any profit made after all costs associated with producing marketing and distributing coins have been paid and surcharges distributed are deposited in the treasurys general fund to reduce the national debt 17 pl 104208 110 stat 30093493009351 surcharge payments are not made until 1 all operation and program costs have been recovered and 2 the designated organization has submitted an audited financial statement that demonstrates it has raised funds from private sources that are equal to or greater than the maximum amount the organization may receive from the proceeds of the surcharge ibid 110 stat 3009350 sec 529f1b crs9 committee rulespractice rule viicvii of the house committee on banking and

congress is an integral part of the american political tradition this category of enactments has included recommendations for presidential proclamations commemorative observances congressional gold medals and commemorative coins monuments and memorials and the naming of federal buildings and other structures between 1979 and 1994 the volume of these measures grew to such an extent that many congressional observers claimed they hindered the ability of congress to deal with more pressing legislative issues rules adopted at the beginning of the 104th congress redressed the balance substantially reducing the time used to consider and adopt such measures while preserving many of the elements of this enduring tradition 27 ibid sec 1007a 28 ibid sec 1008b 29 this subsection is not
