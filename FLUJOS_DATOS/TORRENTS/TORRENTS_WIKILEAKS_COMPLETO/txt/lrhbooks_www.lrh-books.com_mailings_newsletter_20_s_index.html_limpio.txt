bridge publications inc newsletter date seriousness and failure failure is merely the gradient scale of death if person fails too many times hes going to die thats certainbecause this society will deny him food clothing and shelter if he fails too many times he will die its all right to cut your finger but dont cut your throat cutting the finger is little bit of dying if you cut your finger too hard and too solidly you could kill yourself in other words this is the way people look at this thats their gradient scale of failure the gradient scale of defeat and they regard life seriously just to the degree that they regard death seriously and they regard failure and defeat seriously just to the degree that they will regard the whole computation of survival how serious is it that you live well if youre going to die it becomes very serious that you livebecomes serious business and person actually is situated on the tone scale to the degree that they are serious about living they are also effective in inverse ratio to their seriousness you can show any person who is taking it very very very seriously and ill show you long chain of failures person gets most serious about living when he is dying l ron hubbard excerpted from the scientology milestone one lectures your sphere of influence and space an article by l ron hubbard from the scientology milestone one lectures now the individual let us say has offended against groupshe doesnt want to take responsibility for those groups anymoreand so the dynamic of groups is something he is not going to touch and lets say hes offended against children so hes not willing to take responsibility for children and hes missing on that dynamic hes offended against womenhes not willing to be responsible for women therefore his second dynamic is all the way out this leaves him dynamic one he still owns his body pretty well as long as hes alive and so his sphere of influence could then be his body or the first dynamic only and when he has offended against this often enough he wont even take responsibility for the first dynamic and so he contracts his sphere of responsibility and when he has contracted his sphere of responsibility to this regard then all the dynamics all the counterefforts all the counteremotions all the counterthoughts of all the dynamics can hit him and most people by the way are riding on this very little thin margin between not quite being able to stop all these efforts and barely being able to sidestep them enough to keep alive in their own body this is just concept that they have your body is not your mind your facsimiles are not your body even though those facsimiles contain that blueprint the size of your mind is not the size of your brain the size of your mind is not the size of your body your mind is as big as the galaxies or as big as the island universes or as big as all the universes there ever areit doesnt matter how big it is but it will be as big as and will influence as much as you want it to influence thats very blunt you could conceive your mindit could be withdrawn in its periphery to something the size of head of pin as in politicians or you could expand it out so that you were able to command your own body as will do an athlete he is at least in command of his own body or you could expand it out to the size of group where you are trying to handle or manage group you can expand your mind that far and by the way you wont handle that group unless you do conceive your mind to be as big as that group youve got to be able to conceive your mind to be as big as whatever youre trying to influence because it means that youve got to take the responsibility of whatever you are trying to influence so therefore youve got to conceive yourself that size you see the trick in this is the mind doesnt have any size it doesnt have space or time it merely has recordings of space or time most people looking at themselves in the mirror looking at space and time around them looking at themselves conceive their mind to be merely as big as themselves now most people do not believe that they handle much of periphery of influence most people are actually having trouble with themselves they have trouble with themselves if you cant sit down to typewriter and learn how to type on it in fifteen or twenty minutes youre having trouble with yourself if you cant grow betterlooking nose youre having trouble with yourself thats really blunt thats compared to an optimuman optimum situation therefore in order to secure any freedom or to call yourself to any degree selfdetermined you have to have concept of yourself to the size to the sphere of influence that you are trying to determine whats selfdeterminism selfdeterminism could be called something much better but most people couldnt take the bridge that fast it should be called something like pandeterminismpan meaning all the way across or around or over pandeterminism determinism on all dynamics and if you were in 100 percent possession of your mind of your actions and so on you would have 100 percent sphere of influence over all the dynamics pandeterminism youre just as responsible for russia going to war at this moment or trying to threaten the rest of civilization with war as russia is and in view of the fact that russia is not even vaguely responsible for what it does having contracted in each and every mind within it to barenecessity control of self and having to think in terms of were collectively something but individually nothingpretty badly off if you knowif you know that you can be determined all the way across the line just potentially determined across all the dynamicsthen you see you have to accept the responsibility for russia being in the state of mind that its in as well as the united states being in the state of mind its in and if you were to just broadly accept responsibility for the atomic situation in the world today you would of course do great deal about it but as long as your concept is that you can barely take care of yourself youll not be able to do anything about the war l ron hubbard from the lecture thought emotion effort and the
