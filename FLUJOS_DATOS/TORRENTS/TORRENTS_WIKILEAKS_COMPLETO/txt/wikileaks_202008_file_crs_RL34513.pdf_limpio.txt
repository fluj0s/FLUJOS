bill s 3036 to control greenhouse gas emissions in the united states this action is indicative of the pressures members of congress increasingly face on whether and how to addr ess humaninduced climate change contentious debates scrutinize issues of science economics values geopolitics and host of other concerns deliberations also weigh the appropriateness of alternative policy tools and program designs the economic stakes are potentially largewith both the costs of controls and the costs of inaction ranging by some estimates into trillions of dollars over several decades major international assessment released in 2007 concluded that the earths climate had warmed unequivocally over the past century and that elevated levels of socalled greenhouse gases ghg were likely responsible for major portion of the observed warming elevated concentrations of ghg in the atmosphere are due mostly to human activities especially emissions from use of fossil fuels clearing of land and some industrial processes continued population and economic growth with dependence on fossil fuels and needs for expanding agricultural lands are expected to drive ghg emissions and induced climate change over the 21 st century to levels never experienced by human civilizations while benefits may accrue to some people who may experience limited amount of climate change the aggregate effects are expected to become increasingly adverse with people living in dry regions or along lowlying coasts and people with low incomes expected to be especially vulnerable adaptations can moderate the impacts and expand opportunities but at cost besides the overall costs of climate change key concerns include the distributional effects within and across generations how to value ecological impacts and the potential for abrupt and irreversible changes while important uncertainties remain concerning future climate change and its impacts many experts are convinced that the evidence calls for us action to abate ghg emissions others argue that mandatory controls would be premature unnecessary or too costly for decisionmakers considering actions to address climate change an assortment of policy instruments is available studies suggest that combination could be most effective in achieving various climate policy objectives current policy attention has focused on cap and trade strategies to reduce ghg emissions with additional policy tools aimed at promoting the technology development considered necessary to slow climate change significantly in parallel growing attention is being given to supporting adaptations to expected future changes as well as to strategies to gain effective international engagement in reducing ghg one significant obstacle to consensus is concern about the potential costs of abating ghg emissions since deep reductions would require extraordinary changes in energy use and technologies studies suggest that efficiently designed programs could moderate the costs of reducing ghg emissions technically and politically though an efficiently designed program may not be realistic policy options can ease the adjustments required and modify the distribution of costsor potential wealth embodied in distribution of emission allo wancesacross specific sectors or populations core challenge of policy design then is balancing the climate effectiveness of policy the economic costs and its distributional effects httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34513g5g149g146g150g138g157g142g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g497g561g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g11g156g156g158g142

and supporting adaptations to changes already observed or expected future changes domestic actions to address climate change are moving independently across many fronts in the 110 th congress numerous bills have been proposed to address climate change research and policy one bill s 2191 that would cap and reduce greenhouse gas emissions was reported by the senate committee on environment and public works and the senate agreed on june 2 2008 to consider the bill now s 3036 the supreme c ourt in 2007 ruled that the administration must consider regulating greenhouse gases from motor vehicles as air pollutants and president george w bush in 2008 proposed qualified national goal for us greenhouse gas emissions to peak by 2025 and then decline states and localities have moved forward with their own plans and regulations in lieu of strong national framework primary concerns are the costs which could reach trillions of dollars over coming decades depending on policy choices the distribution of those costs and the effectiveness of policies with the knowledge that us greenhouse gas reductions would achieve success only if sufficient international cooperation can be achieved as well debate internationally has revived over how nations may commit to mitigation adaptation and technology actions beyond 2012 the end of the curr ent commitment period of the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change negotiations are aiming to produce post2012 decision by the end of 2 009 us domestic policy development could influence and support international

climate scientists recognized more than century ago that pollution from human activities could theoretically warm the earth greenhouse gases ghg in the earths atmosphere allow the suns short wavelength radiation to pass through to the earths surface once the radiation is absorbed by the earth and reemitted as longer wavelength radiation ghg trap the heat in the atmosphere this is often called the greenhouse effect the natural presence of ghg especially water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the earth to habitable temperatures studies show that solar variability has contributed some of the observed changes in global temperature especially early in the 1900s few studies conclude that at most solar variability 2 for further information see crs report rl34266

observed change of the 20th century4 further research would be required to quantify how some suggested influences for example galactic cosmic rays contribute to observed climate changes most scientists conclude that majority of the earths warming since the 1970s is due to ghg emissions from human activities especially use of fossil fuels clearing of land and some industrial processes while scientists agree that ghg in the atmosphere are responsible for trapping the suns radiation and raising the earths temperature to current levels some scientists disagree that projected increases in ghg concentrations would raise temperatures significantly

nitrous oxide n 2o and certain fluorinated compounds including chlorofluorocarbons cfc hydrochlorofluorocarbons h cfc hydrofluorocarbons hfc perchlorofluorocarbons pfc and sulfur hexaflouride sf 65 these ghg remain in the atmosphere for decades to thousands of years and are generally wellmixed around the globe hence their warming effects are largely global and persist for decades to millenia the long atmospheric residence also means long lag between policies to abate ghg emissions and their full effects on the climate system when emissions of the longlived ghg are greater than their removals by for example photosynthesis the ghg accumulate in the atmosphere the ghg concentrations increase the increases of concentrations of specific ghg since the industrial revolution measured since about 1850 include co 2 by more than 33 from about 280 parts co 2 per million ppm to current levels of over 380 ppm methane ch 4 by about 150 although the rate of increase has declined over the past decades to essentially growth but variable yeartoyear and nitrous oxide n 2o by 16 4 number of peerreviewed references are available from crs upon request 5 additional pollutant emissions indirectly affect climate change largely on the local to regional scale they include carbon monoxide co nitrogen oxides x other than n 2o and nonmethane volatile organic compounds nmvoc and particulate matter or aerosols perhaps more important humaninduced climate change and land uses may indirectly affect water vapor in the atmosphere influencing both global and regional climate change including the distribution of precipitation and are likely to alter the reflectivity of the earths surface compared to other effects these effects are poorly understood though they may have large impacts

the atmosphere will raise the global average temperature above natural variability by at least 15o celsius 27o fahrenheit above 1990 levels the estimates considered most likely by many scientists are for ghginduced temperature increases around 25 to 32oc 45 to 58o f by 2100 there is small but not trivial likelihood that the ghginduced temperature rise may exceed 5oc 9o f above natural variability by 2100 in context the global average temperature is estimated currently to be approaching or exceeding the highest level experienced since the emergence of human civilizations future climate change may advance smoothly or sporadically and some regions are likely to experience more fluctuations in temperature precipitation and frequency or intensity of extreme events than others almost all regions are expected to experience warming some are projected to become warmer and wetter while others would become warmer and drier sea levels could rise between 7 and 23 inches by 2100 not including the effects of possible accelerated melting of the greenland or antarctic ice sheets patterns consistent among different models have led to some common expectations ghginduced climate change would include more heat waves and droughts decreased extreme cold episodes and increased summer warming and dryness in the central portions of continents scientists also expect precipitation to become more intense when it occurs thereby increasing runoff and flooding risks 12

expected to be adverse eg lower agricultural productivity in many regions drought rising sea levels spread of disease vectors greater needs for cooling risks of abrupt surprising climate changes with

but also impose costs often on those who can least afford them because climate change will occur with different magnitudes and characteristics in different regions resulting dislocations and disparities across locations may have implications for political stability and security some experts and stakeholders believe that likely ecological disruptions are among the most compelling reasons that humans must act to reduce their interference with the climate system as the degree and distribution of climate changes continue ranges of species are likely to change climate change is highly likely to create substantial changes in ecological systems and services in some locations and may lead to ecological surprises the disappearance of some types of regional environments also raises risks of extinc tions of species especially those with narrow geographic or climatic distributions and where existing ecological communities disintegrate one 12 kevin trenberth et the changing

disappearing climates and previously identified biodiversity hotspots for these regions standard conservation solutions eg assisted migration and networked reserves may be insufficient to preserve biodiversity many different views exist regarding how mu ch concern to give to ecological impacts 14 some people value the impacts only according to the rvices that natural systems provide to humans for example for recreational activities or provision of food other people emphasize ethical perspectives for example for stewardship of the earths resources likewise some people emphasize the relatively mild impacts possible for the united states 15 while others give weight to the catastrophic impacts likely for at least some populations in other countries such differences in values are behind many of the controversies in the public debates about how to address climate change and what part of the global effort the united states should undertake growing attention to impacts and possible adaptations has led in the 110th congress to proposals in number of bills that would increase research and programmatic attention on possible impacts of climate change and options for adaptation some bills are crosssectoral including some that propose to repeal and replace the global change research act of 1990 others are targeted to specific concerns such as drinking water or wildlife some proposals are aimed at increasing research on impacts and adaptation while others are intended to provide authority and resources to plan and carry out specific adaptations in selected

of stabilization is associated with wide range of possible temperature outcomes current co 2 concentrations are over 380 parts per million ppm future projections in the absence of changes from current policies range from about 550 ppm to almost 1000 ppm by 2100 most debate concerning the appropriate level at which to stabilize ghg concentrations is around levels of 450 550 or 650 ppm by 2100 some people advocate targets as low as 350 ppm lower than current concentrations while others oppose setting stabilization 13 john w williams stephen t jackson and john kutzbach projected distributions of

alternative targets are partially explained by differing views of how great the adverse impacts of climate change w ould be associated with different stabilization targets and differing views of how to address risks16 the stern report discussed further in the economics sections below concluded that stabilising atmospheric concentrations at or below 550 ppm co 2 e17 would require global emissions to peak in the next 10 20 years and then fall at rate of at least 1 3 per yearby 2050 global emissions would need to be around 25 below current levels these cuts will have to be made in the context of world economy in 2050 that may be 3 4 times larger than today so emissions per unit of gdp would need to be just one quarter of current levels by 2050 to stabilise at 450 ppm co 2e without overshooting global emissions would need to peak in the next 10 years and then fall at more than 5 per year reaching 70 below current levels by 205018 while technologies exist today to begin such

mitig ation and design of program are the distributions of costs on specific industry sectors and employment groups us regions and income groups one particularly challenging issue is how to address concerns regarding possible harm to trade and competitiveness of those countries and industries that shoulder the responsibilities of ghg reductions to the degree that those industries or companies within industries increase their costs with mitigation measures they may experience price disadvantage in relation to competitors withou t ghg requirements or comp etitors that are advant aged by ghg regulation for example sources that have positioned themselves to reduce emissions at lower costs than their competitors other groups that are likely to be disproportionately impacted by policies to limit ghg emissions include low income populations which typically spend more of their incomes on energy bills and may not have choices or control over factors that determine their energy dependence such as renters alternatively some groups may gain disproportionately from ghg controls for example manufacturers that specialize in highefficiency vehicles would experience different costs market share and profitability than manufacturers that specialize in highpowered vehicles some groups may benefit from certain policy designs for example depending on whether existing ghg em itters are given rather than sold their emission permits allowances these equity issues may drive policy design and could make the emerging policy overall more costly but with more acceptable distributional effects

with more study and improved analysis and explicit methods for taking uncertainties into account with value judgments for more robust decisionmaking

globally aggregated net benefits further climate change would tend to decrease benefits while damages would increase in net they conclude that longterm climate change is likely to damage economic

economists who have modeled both mitigation costs and its benefits conclude that well designed policies could have modest costs and save trillions of dollars over the coming century most economists would agree that the l ongterm costs of climate change merit some degree of nearterm and mandatory action to reduce ghg however beyond those general points there is wide range of views and

rigorous review of the benefits of mitigating climate change is the stern report commissioned by the government of the united kingdom and released in 200627 the stern report has been strongly criticized by some notable economists due to differences of views over methodological challenges as well as to allegations of selectiveness of studies used other equally reputable economists have indicated their acceptance of the methods andor provided analysis contending that the stern timates of possible climate change costs may be low in brief the stern report underscores that climate change policy must involve valueladen choices by public decisionmakers28 in support of this the stern report laid out hierarchy of different valuation choices leading to estimates of climate change damages ranging from 0 to 20 or more of global consumption now and in the future

several studies of the potential costs or benefits to the united states of projected ghginduced climate change have been conducted though none is comprehensive and all suffer from the general challenges of applying economic and ethical methods to the issue recent review of economic studies of impacts in the united states by the university of marylands center for integrative environmental research stated the following five key lessons which reflect commonly held views among climate impacts researchers economic impacts of climate change will occur throughout the country economic impacts will be unevenly distributed across regions and within the economy and society negative climate impacts will outweigh benefits for most sectors that provide essential goods and services to society climate change impacts will place immense strains on public sector budgets secondary effects of climate impacts can include higher prices reduced income and job losses29 the report cites variety of regional studies that project costs of climate change impacts to localities or sectors in the tens of millions to hundreds of billions of dollars through the 21st century the report also concludes there is however lack of research that quantifies and compares these impacts and deficiency in using what is known about climate impacts to guide adaptation actions from the national level down to the local level thus the full economic costs will likely be much higher than what is reported currently 27 stern nicholas the economics of climate change stern review report london hm treasury october 30 2006 httpwwwhmtreasurygovukindependent_reviewsstern_review_economics_climate_change stern_review_reportcfm 28 examples of choices more appropriately addressed by policymakers than researchers include how to value impacts on current versus future generations whether to give weight to impacts on particular populations such as lowincome populations or children whether certain adverse impacts are not acceptable and might lead to maximum allowable degrees of change etc 29 ruth mathias dana coehlo and daria karetnikov the us economic impacts of climate change and the costs of inaction center for

aggregate the economic costs of climate change to the united states across sectors in the absence of effective mitigation policies and all of those studies qualify their results by recognizing the uncertainty and methodological questions one such study by economist dale jorgenson30 and others which examined wide range of possible projections of climate change though only market effects concluded based on the market sectors and range of impacts considered for this analysis projected climate change has the potential to impose cons iderable costs or produce temporary benefits for the us economy over the 21st century depending on the extent to which pessimistic or optimistic outcomes prevail under pessimistic assumptions real us gdp in the low climate change scenario is 06 percent lower in 2100 relative to baseline that assumes change in climate in the high climate change scenario the predicted reduction in real gdp is 19 percent lower in 2100 under the additional high and drier climate scenario however real gdp is reduced more dramaticallyby as much as 30 percent by 2100 relative to baseline conditions furthermore under pessimistic assumptions negative impacts on gdp grow progressively larger over time regardless of the climate scenario in contrast under optimistic assumptions real us gdp by 2100 is 07 to 10 percent higher than baseline conditions across the low central and high climate scenarios but these benefits eventually diminish over time nevertheless to the extent that responses in certain key sectors conform to the optimistic scenarios there is distinct possibility that some degree of climate change can provide modest overall benefits to the us economy during the 21 st century many studies underscore key point the impacts of climate change on people and on ecosystems and the benefits or damages will depend heavily on the ability to adapt by different populations and systems and the effectiveness of actions to adapt concerns about climate change consequently often emphasize the vulnerabilities of populations with low financial and technical resources or that may be otherwise constrained in their adaptations eg native cultures that are dependent on and value habitat that may be eliminated by climate change as in some arctic populations

of ghg mitigation would be many measures that would help to avoid climate change and would serve other national goal s such as improving energy security abating the world food crisis reducing pollution and conserving critical natural resources and biodiversity for example actions to suppress demand for petroleum would help suppress global oil prices and total us expenditures for ener gy such cobenefits of ghg mitigation would boost the value of abating climate change offsetting the benefits would also be some tradeoffs with other national or local goals although many tradeoffs could be minimized or eliminated through policy design that is mindful of the relationships among issues for example incentives to reduce ghg emissions by increasing biofuel use could raise food prices as in the present situation and reduce food security or could enhance food security by selectively encouraging feedstocks that do not compete for agricultural land and food products and by improving agricultural efficiencies 30 jorgenson dale w richard j goettle brian h hurd and joel b smith us market consequences of climate change prepared for the pew center on global climate change arlington va

climate change policies provide incentives but few requirements to reduce ghg emissions for example number of tax incentives are in place to encourage purchase of more efficient vehicles and to make efficiency improvements to buildings other incentives induce agricultural producers to enhance soil carbon suite of federal programs provides information technical assistance and nominal awards to businesses universities and other consumers to quantify and reduce their ghg emissions such programs generally are intended to encourage emission reductions that are already economical but that do not occur because of market inefficiencies some ghg reductions are also achieved by existing regulations governing the energy efficiency of vehicles and appliances methane emissions from landfills and other controls again these regulations have been put in place for reasons other than abating climate change large programs are devoted to developing new technologies that would be necessary to reduce ghg emissions below current levels many ex perts contend that voluntary efforts such as the us climate leaders program research on technologies and existing regulatory and tax incentives cannot achieve the ghg reductions necessary to avoid dangerous climate change the united states and the european union have proposed for the doha round of the world trade organization wto negotiations new

framework to address us ghg emission reductions majority of states have establ ished formal ghg m itigation policies including targets for future reductions california hawaii and new jersey have passed laws establishing mandatory economywide ghg emission limits while number of additional states have set controls on co2 emissions from particular sources in several regions including the northeast the midwest and the west states are working together to create regional schemes to cap ghg emissions and allow trading of emissions permits across borders the increasingly complicated mosaic

federal government toward actions to reduce ghg emissions for example the supreme court ruled in 2007 that the epa must consider regulating co 2 and other ghg emitted from motor vehicles as pollutants under the clean air act40 further litigation has been pursued to challenge the executive branch to action using the endangered species act the energy policy and conservation act and the outer continental shelf lands act few internationallaw claims have been filed against the united states as well41 however whether these new paths will yield results only time will tell it is clear however that if there is to be government response to climate change at all solution from the political branches is more likely to be comprehensive and fully reflective of societal priorities than the typically narrowly targeted results of litigation 42 g18g138g155g157g561g22g145g155g142g142g497g561g22g145g142g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g22g152g152g149g561g4g152g161g561 with growing consensus on climate change science and pressures from interest groups many legislators are deliberating whether and how to address climate change some may prefer to continue to employ the existing set of research and voluntary programs available for others who are considering additional actions is an assortment of policy tools that they see as stimulating further reductions of ghg emissions and reducing risks to the economy specific populations and natural systems part three of this report identifies variety of policy tools potentially affecting these objectives regulatory including marketbased tools to reduce ghg distribution of potential revenues from ghg programs nonregulatory tools that help markets work more efficiently tools to stimulate technological change options to ease the economic transition to lower ghg economy instruments to encourage international actions and tools to stimulate adaptation to climate change the following sections summarize some potentially applicable instruments in each of these categories that have been proposed or used in th past many of these tools are complementary and proponents often contend that they would produce results more efficiently

most experts agree that the most economically efficient way to reduce ghg emissions substantially is to put price on emissions that reflects the costs or risks of those emissions to others putting price on ghg emissions can be done with traditional sourcebysource regulation andor with market mechanisms

achieved by setting emission performance standards on each source of pollution or requiring that sources use particular type of technology such as the best available control technology practice has successfully included technologyforcing regulation as well that sets future performance standards well beyond contemporaneously achievable levels regulatory controls have proven to be effective through decades of experience though studies have demonstrated that the compliance costs might have been reduced if strategies had given priority to costeffectiveness and flexibility even when regulators have been allowed by law to consider costs in setting emission regulations they have had additional factors to consider and often have had weak information about the costs of technology for each individual source also regulations can be difficult to adjust as circumstances change although in some circumstances sourcebysource regulation may be most effective and efficient 43 it often cannot achieve by itself desired emission reduction target at the least possible cost g15g138g155g148g142g157g561g150g142g140g145g138g151g146g156g150g156g561 regulatory approaches that utilize aspects of commodity markets can achieve in some cases similar emission reductions but at lower overall cost bills introduced in the 110 th congress have proposed such market mechanisms to reduce ghg emissions because fo r some sources they can increase the efficiency of sourcebysource regulation by allowing the least costly reductions first market mechanisms begin with regulations to reduce emissions but then may allow flexibility in who makes the emission reduction when the reductions are made and where the emission reductions occur outside of the regulated sources or even internationally two principal types of market mechanisms pertinent to ghg reductions are ghg or carbon taxes or capandtrade systems the key contrast between these two mechanisms is that ghg taxes would provide certainty about the prices paid by sources but uncertainty concerning how much ghg would be reduced conversely capandtrade systems provide certainty in how much ghg would be reduced but not regarding the prices paid by sources both emission fees and capandtrade systems potentially generate revenuespotentially in the billions of dollars annually issues regarding what to do with revenues will be introduced following brief discussion of some potentially contentious design issues 43 in some instances performance standards can be very efficient for example when transaction costs are high compared to the incremental cost of control httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34513g5g149g146g150g138g157g142g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g497g561g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g11g156g156g158g142

source would reduce its emissions down to the level where it is longer cheaper to make the reductions per ton than to pay the tax per ton there could be many variations on this basic model including charging fees only on emissions above rates designated by source types aside from possible tax exemptions emission fees would not allow flexibility in who or where ghg reductions would occur system might be designed to allow flexibility in when ghg reductions are made though the principal flexibility would be the sources decision whether to make the reductions or pay the taxes many economists believe that emission fees or taxes would be the most economically efficient way to reduce emissions though this might depend on micro economic factors and it would not guarantee an overall level of effectiveness for the program some people object to paying taxes in general even if it is to correct an acknowledged problem g515g5g138g153g561g138g151g141g561g157g155g138g141g142g516g561 in capandtrade program the regulator sets an overall cap on emissions and must allocate responsibility for achieving the cap to individual sources frequently termed allowances to emit in capandtrade programs the trade component allows entities to sell their unneeded emission allowances while emission sources that emit more than their allowances may comply by reducing their emissions andor buying additional allowances 44 capandtrade programs allow flexibility in who makes the required emission reductions within capandtrade systems are two additional types of flexibility international credits or offsets flexibility in where reductions occurin the united states or internationallycan also minimize costs although some questions arise about enforceability loss of program effectiveness and financial flows allowing international credits or offsets to the degree that ghg could be reduced reliably at lower cost in other countries which could help reduce costs of complying with us ghg requirements banking and borrowing when flexibility could allow entities to save or bank unneeded allowances until they need them or to borrow against their future allocations of allowances with charge for borrowing banking and borrowing could apply to sourcebysource regulation as well as to capandtrade programs

woul d be responsible for reducing ghg emissions this determines who pays for the reductions not who actually makes the reductions in capand trade system allowances can be given away eg grandfathered to existing ghg sources or given to non source entities sold at fixed price auctioned or combination of these techniques allowances are valuable commodity because they can be sold how this valuable commodity is allocated could potentially transfer billions of dollars of wealth across different groups this transfer of wealth from entities who need to buy allowances to entities that sell them could be many times greater than the economic cost of the ghg reductions how to allocate allowances is therefore an important componentand among the most controversialin the ghg reduction debate giving allowances to particular groups may be tempting way to increase the acceptability of ghg control program or to improve the fairness of the program but it could distort incentives and reduce the efficiency of the program one way among others to minimize the transfer of wealth in ghg control program would be to sell allowances rather than to give them away sales including auctions would in crease the efficiency of an overall ghg reduction selling the allowances at fixed price becomes very much like an emission fee or tax program many proposals would give away some allowances to both sources of emissions and other entities eg states other sectors and would auction some allowances

program become market commodity the prices of most commodities rise and fallsometimes with great volatilityas daily seasonal or annual conditions vary variance would be expected with ghg allowance prices prices could rise above anticipated levels if reducing ghg turns out to be more difficult than projected or if speculators bid up prices or under other conditions some people concerned about the costs of ghg reduction programs advocate setting ceiling on the maximum price source might have to pay for allowances it may need to comply some have termed this safety valve on prices if prices were to exceed designated level for some period of time either the regulatory authority could release additional allowances into the market through an auction or sales at fixed fee while this would limit the overall cost of the program it would also limit the overall ghg reductions although these could be borrowed from future years and it would reduce incentives for technological innovation the profits that can be reaped when prices spike is part of the calculation that stimulates some investors to finance technological research other stakeholders argue that to stimulate technological advance floor should be set on the prices for allowances in the market ie the regu lator set reserve price for allowances sold at

taxed or allowances are sold to sources at flat fees or by auction public revenues could be generatedas much as hundreds of billions of dollars per year depending on the size of the tax or the quantity of reductions required key policy issue associated with taxes sales or auctions is what to do with the revenues revenues can be used to offset reductions of other taxes sometimes called revenue recycling eg labor taxes rebate to sources to help defray compliance costs of covered sources eg according to their production levels fund programs or provisions that could reduce transition costs such as worker retraining and relocation programs market facilitation programs technology development programs tax credits loan guarantees etc provide payments to address distributional concerns eg tax credits to low income consumers or fund programs that may have little to do with reducing ghg emissions but that garner wider support for the legislation as discussed in later section how any revenues are used may help to minimize the overall costs of the ghg reductions or conversely may lead to higher costs

complementary typically nonregulatory policies may help to achieve reductions at the lowest possible costs public or targeted information programs can help prepare people for the changes ghg control policy may demand and gain their support for it additionally technical assistance programslike several existing federal voluntary programs such as the climate leaders or energy star programs 46can help consumers and businesses to make efficient choices technical assistance programs may provide for example calculation tools training and access to information programs may work with equipment suppliers to commercialize products that are more efficient or emit fewer ghg as has occurred with for example energy star home electronics initiatives or the mobile air conditioning climate protection partnership most experts agree that such programs work best when targeted to address specific decisionmakers or imperfections in the market and that the ghg reductions they could yield by themselves are limited 46 number of federal voluntary programs help businesses other institutions and consumer to identify how they contribute to ghg emissions and to identify and carry out changes

levelsnecessary to avoid most projected climate changewould require extraordinary chan ges in how energy is used and supplied over time the cost of reducing ghg emissions would depend critically on development and deployment of improved technologies that can reduce emissions at lower costs than current technologies while public policies clearly have led to major technological advances in other fields eg developing nuclear energy putting man on the moon the link between policy tools and the technological advance that could be expected is unpredictable policy tools can act on the demand for new technologies or on the supply two types of policy tools act primarily to stimulate demand for new technologies technologyforcing regulations 47 have effectively stimulated demand for better and more costeffective technologies in the past technologyforcing policies respond to the reality that the world is not static and that policy itself can create and shape the options society faces in meeting its needs48 however economists prefer price incentives to stimulate technological change because it decentralizes decisionmaking to consumers and suppliers and is arguably more costeffective tax incentives can reduce the price to purchasers of certain technologies the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 for example extended numerous tax credits to individuals and businesses to make investments in energy efficiency or renewable energy generation that meet certain criteria in order to accelerate technology deployment other policy tools primarily act on the supply of technologiesincreasing incentives for technology suppliers to conduct research and development rd and to commercialize more advanced technologies subsidies to research and develop new or improved technologies is common tool of federal policy including current approaches to mitigating climate change federal appropriations of billions of dollars have been enacted in recent years to stimulate more efficient energy technologies renewable nuclear and clean coal technologies and approaches like alternatives to gasoline or diesel fuel for vehicles these subsidies can take the form of tax credits for rd costsharing grants or contracts direct investments loan guarantees and others 47 where regulator mandates standard that cannot be met with existing technology according to gerard david

that develop advanced technologies that meet specified criteria government procurement policies can drive technological development forward by setting challenging standards for performance and guaranteeing purchase of that technology at particular attractive price or by purchasing lessemitting technology even if it is not the lowest cost alternative both types of procurement policies have been used by the federal government to advance technologies that emit fewer ghg than more conventional technologies manhattan projectlike federal research has been proposed by some experts who argue that focused cadre of researchers with sufficient resources and allowed to pursue highrisk highpayoff projects could facilitate technological breakthroughs that could facilitate radical change in energy systems some policy tools that may affect the advance of technologies could be indirect for example incentives to ensure sufficient supply from universities of well trained scientists and engineers in ghg mitig ationrelated fields could be component of promoting technological advance

policy choices to address one problem may have ancillary effects on technology incentives for example if ghg capandtrade program were to set safety valve to limit maximum costsby setting ceiling on

emissions results because the us economy has optimized its infrastructure to depend on fossil fuels particularly coal and on private petroleum dependent vehicles for transportation this has been efficient disregarding existing subsidies without factoring in the environmental energy secu rity and other external costs several policy mechanisms can help to ease the transition of the current economy to one optimized around low ghg emissions timing the total required ghg reductions to coincide with normal retirements of equipment and infrastructure and when new investments may be made49 trading banking and borrowing of allowances allow sources to manage the timing of their reductions at least cost 49 however some experts suggest that much capital can be maintained to last for decades longer than its nominal lifetime and that the benefits of timing regulations to coin cide with capital turnover may frequently be overstated see for example lempert robert j stephen w popper susan

described above can help sources make optimal decisions including information campaigns that help sources anticipate the regulatory regime investment in appropriate infrastructure important also for state local and private entities that enables deployment of emerging technologies and regulatory and permitting regimes that are adequately prepared for new technologies in new locations eg in permitting carbon capture and storage technologies or resolving solar rights issues in addition the private sector is concerned about the possible international competitiveness and trade impacts of ghg reductions in the united states some policy tools that could be applied although some could encounter potential challenges under the world trade organization wto rules include border tax adjustments that would raise the prices of imports from countries without ghg controls comparable to those of the united states international reserve allowances that importers of certain goods must purchase raising the cost of imports if the country of origin does not apply ghg controls comparable to those of the united states giving over some period allowances or revenues from sales of allowances to affected industries in order to facilitate adjustment in the process of crafting domestic policies negotiating with potentially affected wto members to seeks ways to avoid imposing restrictive import measures working within the wto to change or cl arify rules to permit the imposition of import restrictions by countries ad opting tradevulnerable ghg control requirements or working multilaterally to have ghg emission controls applied equitably to sources internationally see discussion below and to avoid wto challenges the design of competitivenessoriented policy tools would require caution to avoid challenge under wto as unfair trade practices g11g151g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g22g152g152g149g156g561 the effectiveness of us policies to address climate change will depend on the collaboration of almost all other countries especially the largest emitters some of the large emitters such as japan and nations of the european union already have committed to reducing their ghg emissions below year 1990 levels and have propos ed further reductions beyond the current kyoto protocol discussed in later section however the united states china and other large developing country emitters have not committed to quantified ghg reduc tions and the position of russia beyond 2012 remains question the united states can use number of policy tools in order to encourage effec tive global ghg reductions leadership and relationshipbuilding strategic policy leverage including quid pro quo capacity building and other technical assistance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34513g5g149g146g150g138g157g142g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g497g561g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g11g156g156g158g142 g156g561g138g151g141g561g18g152g149g146g140g162

to stimulate effectiv adaptation to climate change included in the policy toolbox to promote efficient adaptation to climate change are to name few research to improve characterization of future climate change50 its variability and its potential implications for different sectors and ecosystems public information both broad and targeted to specific risks including access to robust characterization of future climate conditions and associated risks programs to develop practical tools to assist decisionmakers to understand the implications of climate change for their areas of operation eg water management infrastructure engineering disease vector prediction etc financial or regulatory incentives to reduce risks eg to discourage construction in vulnerable flood plains to encourage insurers to include climate change risks in their premium schedules etc improved emergency planning to reduce risks and respond to extreme weather events eg droughts tornadoes etc acquisition of key assets such as easements in coastal zones or lands along wildlife migratory routes that may be valuable for longterm adaptation policy tools to encourage private and public sector

and international levels as well as the introduction of numerous ghg reduction bills in the 110th congress it seems likely that members of congress will have to decide whether the time is appropriate to legislate climate strategy and what forms legislation should take in considering the alternatives policymakers may wish to answer for themselves such questions as 50 current scientific uncertainty is very wide not just on humaninduced climate change but also on underlying natural variability what humans and ecosystems will experience and may need to adapt to will be the combination of both influences on climate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34513g5g149g146g150g138g157g142g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g497g561g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g11g156g156g158g142

certain to call for policy actions to mitigate the causes andor adapt to perceived inevitable change how domestic policy package can be designed that balances the risks of climate change with costs that are accepted as reasonable and fairly distributed how domestic policy would interact with international negotiations to avoid unacceptable climate risks while distributing the effort equitably among countries and sectors when and how to promote appropriate adap tation by private and public decision makers to the uncertain climate ahead
