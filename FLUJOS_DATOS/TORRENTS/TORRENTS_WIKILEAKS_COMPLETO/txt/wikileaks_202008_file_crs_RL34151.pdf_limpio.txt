10533 established the medicarechoice program now called medicare advantage creating new options for the delivery of required benefits under medicare one of these options is private feeforservice plan pffs statutorily defined as plan that 1 reimburses hospitals physicians and other providers on feefor service basis without placing the provider at financial risk 2 does not vary rates for provider based on utilization relating to that provider and 3 does not restrict the selection of providers from among those who are lawfully authorized to provide services and agree to accept the terms and conditions of payment established by the plan recently enrollment in pffs plans has increased dramatically in april 2003 there were 22344 medicare beneficiaries enrolled in one of the three available pffs plans and one pffs demonstration program in april 2004 cms had cont racts with six pffs organizations with total enrollment of 31550 by april 2007 cms had 47 pffs contracts and enrollment had jumped to 15 million an increase of over 4000 in three years approximately 18 of all medicare advantage beneficiaries are enrolled in pffs plan and cbo projects this number to grow to approximately onethird of all ma enrollment by 2017 plans operate in nearly all united states counties giving every medicare beneficiary access to at least one pffs plan the majority of pffs enrollees reside in urban areas however close to half of all rural beneficiaries participating in medicare advantage plans are enrolled in pffs plan unlike coordinated care plans which tend to serve more densely populated areas pffs plans also choose to serve rural areas pffs plans may choose their service areas because 1 medicare private plan payments are higher than the average cost of traditional medicare in many of the counties pffs plan chooses to serve and 2 pffs plans are not required to form networks establishing and maintaining networks of providers can be costly particularly in rural areas congressional attention to these plans has increased this past year for number of reasons first enrollment in these plans has risen significantly second payments to pffs plans are typically higher than payments to other managed care plans and higher than expenditures in ffs medicare third the marketing and sales tactics of pffs plans has raised concerns related to beneficiary protection lastly pffs plans are subject to different statutory requirements than other medicare private plans this report examines the differences between pffs plans and other medicare private plans specifically local health maintenance organizations hmos and regional preferred provider plans ppos some of the reasons for growth in pffs plans are also discussed as well as advantages and disadvantages of these plans the report concludes with brief discussion surrounding current issues

services part b the supplementary medical insurance program covers broad range of complementary medical services including physician laboratory outpatient hospital services and durable medical equipment beneficiaries choosing traditional feeforservice medicare may receive covered benefits from any qualified provider who participates in the medicare program alternat ively beneficiaries eligible for medicare part and enrolled in part b may choose to enroll in medicare private plan under part c of medicare the medicare advantage program and receive all required parts and b benefits except hospice services through private plan medicare part d provides prescription drug coverage available through either standalone dr ug plan pdp or for most medicare advantage enrollees through their plan 1 medicare has offered its beneficiaries enrollment in private plan as an alternative to the traditional feeforservice ffs program since the 1970s not long after the establishment of medicare over the years congress has continued to legislate an increasing number of private plan options for medicare in 1982 congress created medicares risk contract program allowing private entities mostly health maintenance organi zations hmos to contract with medicare in 1997 congress passed the balanced budget act of 1997 bba pl 10533 creating the medicarechoice mc program offering new types of private plans including private feefor service pffs plans the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 changed the name of the program to medicare advantage ma and further expanded medicares private plan options with the addition of new regional preferred provider organizations ppos among others further modifications to the ma program were made in the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 dra and the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 recently congressional attention has turned to the ma program focusing in large part on pffs plans there are number of reasons for this attention first enrollment in these plans has risen significantlyincreasing from 22344 beneficiaries in april of 2003 to almost 15 million four years later second payments to pffs plans are typically higher than payments to other ma plans and higher than expenditures in ffs medicare recent analysis conducted by the medicare payment advisory commission medpac demonstrated that in 2006 payments to pffs plans averaged 119 of ffs expenditures this is in contrast to payments to all ma plans which averaged 112 of expected ffs expenditures and payments to hmos which averaged 110 2 complaints have also been made related to allegedly aggressive and potentially misleading marketing practices of pffs plans leading some to question medicares oversight of these plans3 1 ma organizations must offer at least one plan in each area they serve that provides qualified part d prescription drug benefits except for pffs plans which may offer but are not required to offer part d coverage enrollees in pffs plan that does not offer qualified prescription drug coverage may buy standalone pdp while enrollees in other ma plans that do not offer qualified drug coverage may not buy standalone pdp 2 report to the congress promoting greater efficiency in medicare medicare payment advisory commission medpac chapter 3 update on the medicare advantage

medicaid services cms seven health care organizations representing 90 of the nongroup pffs market voluntarily agreed to suspend marketing of their pffs products because of complaints and accusations of deceptive marketing practices4 according to cms the suspension for given plan will be lifted when the plan meets specified conditions finally pffs plans are subject to different statutory and administrative requirements than other medicare private plans specifically those related to access quality review of plan premiums medicare prescription drug benefits and balance billing policy makers and beneficiary advocates are questioning whether beneficiaries fully understand these differences when they enroll in pffs plan and what their implications are for beneficiary spending access to providers and adequacy of benefits this report focuses on pffs plans and how they differ from two other widely available ma options local hmos and regional ppos5 background information related to enrollment and the characteristics of these plans is presented as well as discussion surrounding current issues appendix provides sidebyside comparison of the major statutory differences between these

characteristics also have many differences that may be important in dete rmining who enrolls the average generosity of benefits and payment and geographic differences first it is important to understand the basic structure of each of these types of plans local hmo local hmo is public or private entity that meets all of the required solvency and other standards and has contract with cms to provide required and other health benefits members receive services mainly through the plans network although plans may allow outofnetwork coverage hmos typically serve one county but are allowed to expand their service area to more than one county if they wish each ma participating organization offering local hmo is required to provide at least one ma plan with qualified part d prescription drug coverage in its service area 8 regional ppo in addition to requirements for local plans regional ppo must provide for reimbursement for all covered benefits regardless of whether the benefits are provided in or out of the network at minimum regional ppo must cover an entire region it must also have unified part and b deductible and catastrophic cap on outofpocket expenses9 like ma participating organizations that offer local hmos each regional ppo must offer plan with qualified prescription drug coverage pffs plan in addition to the solvency and other standard requirements for local plans pffs plan 1 must reimburse hospitals doctors and other providers at rate determined by the plan on feeforservice basis without placing the providers at financial risk 2 can not vary rates based on utilization relating to the provider and 3 can not restrict the selection of providers among those who are lawfully authorized to provide the covered services and agree to accept the terms and conditions of payment established by the plan enrollees in pffs plans are generally not restricted to network of providers although pffs plans have the option to form networks in contrast to other ma participating organizations pffs plans are not required to offer qualified prescription drug coverage

related to traditional feeforservice medicare than to other ma private plans while almost all ma plans provide full range of services to enrollees in exchange for monthly capitated payment 10 local hmos act as both the insurer and provider of health care services to receive benefits the enrollee must get medical care through network of providers managed by the plan with very few exceptions such as emergency care 8 cms defines an ma organization as public or private entity organized and licensed by state as risk bearing entity that is certified by cms as meeting the ma contract requirements each ma organization may offer multiple health plans in its service area 9 for discussion of medicare part and b and deductibles under those parts of medicare please see crs report rl33712 medicare

insurance policy the insurer reimburses hospitals doctors and other providers on feeforservice basis at rate determined by the plan the structure of pffs plans allows enrollees greater flexibility in choosing provider than in other ma plans in hmos for example beneficiaries typically have to visit their primary care physician and get referral before seeing specialist in pffs plans beneficiaries can visit specialist or any provider who agrees to the terms and conditions of the plan without prior authorization enrollees can also receive services from providers outside of their service area regional ppos operate somewhere in between in th at members can choose in or outofnetwork coverage members however save in outofpocket costs when selecting innetwork providers while regional plans have low enrollment compared to other types of ma plans they are included in this analysis because they are new option with unique requirements under the statutes and because they may also have exceptions to network requirements also similar to pffs plans regional ppos are providing access to medicare managed care plans in areas that traditionally have not been served by managed care in the past appendix provides detailed comparison of local hmos regional ppos and pffs plans following the sequence of the social security statues for medicare advantage including information on residency

and accept the pffs plans terms and conditions of payment11 although pffs plan does not have to establish provider network it must meet certain access requirements and demonstrate to the secretary that professionals and providers are willing to provide services under the terms of the plan the plan may satisfy this requirement by 1 establishing payment rates that are not less than those under traditional feeforservice medicare or 2 having signed direct contracts with sufficient number and range of providers in particular category that agree to the plans fee schedule most pffs plans are meeting access requirements by paying providers at the medicare rates most pffs plans deliver services through deemed contracting providers deemed provider is provider who before delivering service knows that beneficiary is enrolled in the pffs plan and has been given or has reasonable access to the pffs plans terms and conditions for participation 12 in general if pffs enrollee notifies the provider that he or she is in pffs plan 11 medicare eligible provider must be state licensed and have medicare billing number institutional providers such as hospitals and skilled nursing facilities must be certified to treat medicare beneficiaries 12 pffs plan is required to make its terms and conditions of participation reasonably available to providers according to the cms posting the terms and conditions on website and making them available upon request is sufficient the terms and conditions specify 1 the amount the pffs organization will pay for covered services 2 provider billing procedures 3 the amount the provider is permitted to collect from the enrollee and 4 whether the provider must obtain advance authorization from the pffs organization before furnishing particular service once the provider knows an enrollee is pffs plan member the provider has the responsibility to access the plans website or continued

becomes deemed provider for that service if the provider furnishes services to pffs enrollee but the deeming requirements are not met generally because the provider does not know that the patient is pffs enrollee ie an emergency situation the provider becomes noncontracting provider noncontracting provider is entitled to receive the same amount the provider would have received under traditional medicare as payment in full for given service local hmos in contrast are required to form provider networks to meet access requirements each provider has written contract or agreement to furnish services to enrollees in the plans network care is generally not covered if received from provider who is not in the hmos network13 regional ppos have less restrictive networks enrollees can see provider outside the plans network but must pay greater portion of the cost of their care for doing so further if the plans demonstrates that it can not set up network in part of the region it has the

requirements as other ma plans to provide additional benefits to enrollees if their bid for providing required parts and b benefits is lower than the benchmark amount determined by cms however unlike other ma plans the secretary does not review approve or disapprove the pffs plans basic or supplemental premiums 16 thus pffs plans could charge their enrollees any premium they choose the limiting factor in this case would be that as the premium increases enrollees may not see the plan as good value and would not join pffs plan with premium that seemed too high relative to the benefits

schedule the plan uses subject to the terms and conditions of particular plan this is in addition to any cost sharing established by the plan and applies to all types of medicare providers pffs plans are obligated to inform beneficiaries of these balance billing amounts additionally hospitals are required to provide pffs enrollees advance notice of any balance 15 beginning in 2006 payments to local ma health plans are determined by comparing plans bid to statutorily determined benchmark for each local service area by the first m onday in june each local plan must submit to the secretary an aggregate monthly bid amount for each ma plan it intends to offer in the upcoming year plans that bid below the benchmark for their local service area receive payment equal to their bid am ount plus 75 of the difference between the benchmark and their bid amount this rebate must be returned to the enrollee in the form of supplemental benefits reduced cost sharing or reduced premiums 16 basic premium is the amount plan charges for coverage of required medicare benefits when its bid amount to provide those services is higher than the benchmark amount paid by cms supplemental premium is the amount plan charges for coverage of optional supplemental benefits that are not covered by medicare and not required under the bid and benchmark process 17 as reported by abby block director centers

than payments to other ma plans according to the medicare payment advisory commission payments to pffs plans in 2006 averaged 119 of expected ffs expenditures payments to all ma plans averaged 112 of expected ffs spending payments to ma hmos averaged 110 of expected ffs expenditures18 one of the reasons for this differential is that pffs plans have chosen to operate in areas with historically higher medicare payments these areas are often referred to as floor counties 19 payments in floor counties which are mainly rural and sparsely populated areas are among the highest in the country local hmos have typically chosen not to offer managed care plans in these areas because the costs of forming provider networks can be significant because pffs plans are exempt from network requirements and they face little competition from other plan types they have been able to offer and maintain coverage in these areas as of july 2006 approximately 87 of pffs plan enrollees resided in floor counties 20 g16g142g157g160g152g155g148g561g7g161g140g142g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 unlike local hmos and regional ppos pffs plans are not required to establish networks of providers to serve beneficiaries this gives pffs plans an advantage particularly in rural areas where forming networks is difficult because of the limited number of providers and small population of medicare beneficiaries21 this exception also makes pffs plans attractive to beneficiaries because an enrollee can visit any provider willing to accept the plans terms of payment and conditions however the lack of written agreement between the plan and provider 18 report to the congress promoting greater efficiency in medicare medicare payment advisory commission medpac chapter 3update on the medicare advantage program and implementing past recommendations june 2007 19 congress created floor payment rates with the bba to help reduce geographic variation in payment rates across the country and attract private plans to areas with historically low ffs costs predominantly rural areas by establishing minimum amounts that could be paid to plan the bba raised payment rates in certain areas sometimes by as much as 100 further legislation established multiple floor rates based on population and location which raised payment rates in rural areas as well as small urban markets although plans are longer paid these floor payments counties whose current ma payment rates are based on yearly increases to the original floor amounts are still referred to as floor counties 20 as reported by mark miller executive director medicare payment advisory commission in testimony before the house committee on ways and means subcommittee on health on may 22 2007 on ma pffs plans httpwaysandmeanshousegovmediapdf110block20testimonypdf 21 in its june 2001 report titled medicare in rural americ medpac documents number of obstacles to forming networks in rural areas with fewer providers in rural areas health plans have less leverage to negotiate discounted prices in exchange for delivering large number of patients to the providerthe primary tool health plans have to persuade providers to accept lower rates additionally health plans prefer to enroll high volume of beneficiaries because it enables them to spread their costs and protect themselves from risk finally health plans must meet certain state and federal regulatory requirements when forming provider networks such as distance and timeliness standards which pose significant challenges to health plans operating in rural areas httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34151g18g155g146g159g138g157g142g561g8g142g142g561g143g152g155g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g561g507g18g8g8g21g508g561 g18g149g138g151g156g561 g561

anecdotal evidence suggests that this may be posing access barriers for beneficiaries in certain areas as providers are unwilling to accept the pffs plans terms of payment22 pffs plans are not required to establish networks through contracts with providers and typically pay providers the same rate they would receive from traditional medicare however if the pffs plan establishes an adequate network with particular type of provider the pffs plan must pay all providers of that type the same amount even those who do not have contract which may be less than or greater than traditional medicare amounts the only exception would be for providers who did not know that the patient was enrolled in pffs plan such as an emergency room physician treating patient who could not communicate those providers receive the medicare rate g4g142g151g142g143g146g140g146g138g155g162g561g5g145g152g146g140g142g561 pffs plans offer beneficiaries particularly those residing in areas with few medicare private plans the choice to opt out of traditional feeforservice medicare in certain parts of the country pffs plans may be the only managed care option available to beneficiaries therefore some of the recent growth in pffs enrollment could be attributed to the extra value they may offer to beneficiaries who for the first time have the option to enroll in private plan additionally many ma plans offer extra benefits above and beyond what is offered in traditional medicare or reduced cost sharing making these plans attractiv alternatives to feeforservice according to the cms in 2007 pffs plan enrollees are receiving an average of 756 per year in additional benefits above what is being offered in traditional medicare compared with an average of 1032 per year in additional benefits for all ma plans 23 g15g138g155g148g142g157g146g151g144g561 the rapid increase in the number of pffs plans available to beneficiaries particularly in rural areas may have contributed to surge in marketing and sales of these plans across the country thereby contributing to rising enrollment in these plans the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 added provision for 2007 and 2008 granting beneficiaries currently enrolled in traditional medicare the option to enroll in pffs plan or nondrug ma plan anytime during the year because local hmo and regional ma plans are statutorily required to offer least one prescription drug plan in their service area pffs plans are exempt from this requirement this may have provided pffs plans with an incentive to market to beneficiaries all year round this provision has since been repealed as of july 31 2007 24 additionally some growth in pffs may be due to questionable marketing practices in response to marketing concerns cms announced in june that seven health insurance plans offering pffs 22 the house committee on ways and means subcommittee on health held hearing on may 22 2007 on private feeforservice plans in medicare advantage

payment for each service provided pffs plans pay providers either negotiated amount established in contract between the plan and provider or the equivalent of the current medicare allowable charge because pffs plans pay providers on feeforservice basis the providers face incentives to limit services to enrollees in contrast providers contracting with local hmo or regional ppo plan can be placed at financial risk for providing all covered services for capitated amount under capitation providers receive one monthly payment for every enrollee despite an enrollees actual service use these plans may offer bonuses or withhold certain payments in an attempt to promote efficient use of services providers have more flexibility under pffs plan than coordinated care plan because they do not sign contracts requiring them to provide services to select group of enrollees providers can choose to accept pffs patients on an enrolleebyenrollee basis and even on servicebyservice basis 26

could be unfamiliar and confusing to providers when an enrollee visits provider it is up to the provider to educate himselfherself on the plans terms and conditions of payment which in some cases may be different than those under traditional medicare this must be done prior to treating the patient once services have been provided the physician is required to comply with the plans terms and conditions as deemed contracting provider these terms and conditions may include different balance billing or cost sharing requirements than traditional medicare and different administrative or documentation requirements in the months to come these disadvantages may emerge disappear or become less problematic as the operations and structure of these plans become more understood

other private plans beneficiaries enrolled in pffs plan may choose any lawfully authorized provider 25 the marketing of pffs plans is discussed in more tail in the current issues section of this report 26 in traditional feeforservice medicare nonparticipating providers also have this option they may agree to accept assignment for payment for some services and not accept assignment for other services provided to that same beneficiary however physicians who do not accept assignment can balance bill their patients up to 115 of medicare rate but are paid lower rate by the medicare program than physicians who accept assignment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34151g18g155g146g159g138g157g142g561g8g142g142g561g143g152g155g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g561g507g18g8g8g21g508g561

conditions of participation provider choice is very important to some beneficiaries27 and may be benefit over local hmos and regional ppos that require enrollees to receive services from network provider s to demonstrate that providers are willing to serve pffs plan enrollees as required by statute the plans pay providers an amount that is not less than what they would receive under traditional medicare or an amount negotiated in contract between the plan and provider if the disadvantages to providers of serving pffs plan enrollees as discussed above do not deter providers from participating then the monetary compensation and flexibility of participation both comparable to traditional medicare suggest that pffs plan enrollees would have choice of providers comparable to their choice under traditional medicare enrollees in pffs may receive greater benefits than individuals in traditional feeforservice medicare such as catastrophic cap on outofpocket spending emergency care overseas and lower costsharing for at least some services depending on an individuals needs and preferences particular set of benefits included in pffs plan may be more attractive than traditional feeforservice also enrollees in pffs plans do not have to receive prior authorization from primary care physician to see specialist for some beneficiaries having this freedom to choose is attractive g6g146g156g138g141g159g138g151g157g138g144g142g156g561g157g152g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g140g146g138g155g146g142g156g561 pffs plans also have disadvantages over other ma options and traditional feeforservice medicare from an enrollees perspective if providers choose not to serve pffs enrollees then their choice of providers is limited much as it would be limited by network membership under coordinated care plan or by providers choosing not to serve medicare beneficiaries pffs providers can choose to participate on servicebyservice basis this means that enrollees are not guaranteed that provider who saw them previously for particular service will agree to see them for the same service in the future the onus is on the enrollee to determine which providers are willing to serve them with local hmos and regional ppos providers are required to participate for the duration of their contract with the plan guaranteeing access to the same providers at least for the duration of the providers contract with the plan enrollees in coordinated care plans can check to see whether provider is in the plans network before seeking services enrollees in pffs may find themselves in situation where provider may decline to provide services even if they previously served another plan enrollee or that enrollee 27 fortynine percent of beneficiaries said that choice of personal doctor would be extremely important if choosing health plan today medicare beneficiaries and health plan choice mathematica policy research january 2001 the mathematica policy research report

medicare population because payments to pffs plans are higher than payments to other ma plans increases in enrollment could raise medicare costs over the next 5 to 10 years recent cbo analysis showed that if medicare were to reduce payments to pffs plans to 100 of local ffs costs medicare would save 54b between 2009 and 2012 and as much as 149b between 2009 and 2017 28 on the other hand reducing payments would likely have an impact on the availability of these plans to serve beneficiaries since pffs plans serve some beneficiaries who do not have access to alternative private plan options reductions in payment could result in certain pffs plans leaving the ma program as result some medicare beneficiaries could loose access to any ma plan according to cms in some states such as alaska utah maine idaho and new hampshire ppfs plans are the only ma option in some if not all counties 29 g3g140g140g142g156g156g561g157g152g561g18g155g152g159g146g141g142g155g156g561 one of the reasons congress established pffs plans in the bba was to provide medicare beneficiaries with the option to enroll in health insurance plan that would not restrict or limit choice of providers specifically the law states that pffs enrollees can see any medicareeligible provider that is willing to treat the enrollee and accept the plans payment terms and conditions however providers are not required to accept pffs beneficiaries recent press reports and advocates report that at least in some areas beneficiaries are having trouble finding provider who is willing to accept the plans payment terms and conditions and provide care to the enrollee30 some of the reasons cited for providers unwillingness to participate in these plans are confusion surrounding payment rates receiving lower payment rates than traditional medicare having difficulty accessing plans terms and conditions and other administrative hassles related to reimbursement31 although pffs plans have been around for decade enrollment was low enough that most providers were not exposed to these products with enrollment on the rise providers are just now becoming familiar with the rules governing these plans 28 the house committee

and the proportion of enrollees subject to those features are shown in table 2 many pffs enrollees are enrolled in plans that have benefit structures or cost sharing that appear more generous than traditional medicare for example 60 of pffs enrollees are enrolled in plan with catastrophic cap on outofpocket spending that is between 1001 and 5000 whereas traditional medicare does not have catastrophic cap in another example 68 of pffs enrollees are enrolled in plan that covers 90day hospital stay for 1000 or less outofpocket this is considerably less than the 8432 outofpocket cost for 90day hospital stay under traditional medicare however pffs plans are not always more generous than traditional medicare statutorily the actuarial value of cost sharing for medicare benefits in ma plans cannot exceed the actuarial value of cost sharing in traditional medicare cost sharing for some services in pffs plans may be higher than the amounts in traditional medicare or lower than the amounts in traditional medicare depending on the service and plan while hmos may also have different cost sharing than traditional medicare more individuals are familiar with hmos than with pffs plans pffs plans may be more confusing because beneficiaries expect them to be more similar to traditional medicare for example unlike traditional medicare some plans charge an additional copayment if the beneficiary fails to inform the plan of scheduled hospital admission for another example under some plans beneficiary could pay 2000 more for hospital admission than they would have paid under traditional medicare depending on the length of the admission such unexpected variations in cost sharing can be confusing and surprising to beneficiaries furthermore these differences make it unclear whether or not participating in pffs plans actually save beneficiaries money it is likely that for some enrollees total costs would be lower than those they would have incurred had they been participating in traditional medicare however for others costs may be higher additionally medicare statutes allow providers participating in pffs plans including hospitals to balance bill enrollees up to 15 above the reimbursement rate set by the plan subject to the plans terms and conditions this is in addition to the plans copayments and coinsurance amounts despite having the option pffs plans do not currently allow physicians to balance bill beneficiaries in traditional medicare most physicians agree not to balance bill t able 2 p er centa ge of private f eef or ser vice enr ollees with

conduct on the part of pffs plans has raised concerns among policy makers advocates and state health commissioners report receiving complaints related to allegedly deceptive and aggressive sales practices by pffs plans that have resulted in beneficiaries either being unintentionally enrolled in pffs plan or enrolling in pffs plan without fully understanding the plans coverage policies32 between december 2006 and april 2007 cms reported received approximately 2700 complaints related to medicare advantage plan marketing 33 on june 15 cms announced that in response to marketing concerns seven health insurance plans offering pffs options agreed to voluntarily suspend their marketing of these plans34 these seven plans represent 90 of pffs enrollment35 before they can resume marketing

knowledge conducting verification calls to beneficiaries to ensure they understand the plan and implementing provider outreach and education program to ensure that providers have reasonable access to

providers local hmos and regional ppos may be better able to manage the utilization and delivery of care furnished by their providers plans do this by developing care coordination disease management preventive care and other qualityrelated programs without networks and contracts pffs plans have less control over the numbers and types of services provided by their providers as well as the quality of those services the same holds for traditional medicare which also pays providers on feeforservice basis and does not form provider networks furthermore pffs plans are exempt from having to establish and monitor quality improvement program which provides for the collection and ongoing analysis of quality 32 advocates and state insurance commissioners report receiving the following types of complaints from beneficiaries enrolled in pffs plans being told they can see any medicare provider without explaining that the provider must accept the plans terms and conditions for payment being enrolled in plan without their knowledge ie falsifying signatures on applications or telling beneficiaries they are signing an attendance sheet or other form when they were actually signing an
