6205c29 shspec152 question and answer period routine 3g4 is another untested process that might get used on cases which dont get plowed up enough with 3gaxx you find goal then find goal that would oppose it then do another assessment for goals that would not oppose it then assess for goals that would want that goal you get four goals that all tick alike then you list all four and you would theoretically get the four items which are actually two items in the same way as in 3gaxx i cant say what the life expectancy for this process is it is probably longer than 3ga in answer to the question since we dont have modifier now how do you keep gpm keyed in if it should key out and you get free needle actually the modifier is only the label on one of the items that you are listing on that listing you are still fighting the same package as in routine 3d by listing each one of those lines you keep it pulled in as much as you would anyway you might have more trouble keeping things stirred up for the second goal but by then the pc should be able to approach the gpm more closely so there should be trouble stabilization is just going on and on getting more goals and more fourlists until you couldnt get the meter to read if you hit the guy over the head with club you are not likely to find the guy flying off in keyout because every time you find goal you will wrap your paws around every element of it that was part of the gpm stabilization is getting rid of any masses the clear might run into which would get him reinvolved with the bank formerly before stabilization he could have gotten enturbulated again but by doing 3ga again and again you will get to where there is gpm to key in it is so intricate to keep the gpm there at all in the first place as you get rid of more packages you get rid of things that could cause the person to go unclear again something else can be done with the person drill him into the reacquisition of skills that is not doing anything to clear it is going into ot which is the recovery of skills of the thetan clearing is just getting the bricks off the track not the recovery of skills it looks to the thetan as if he will get his head knocked off if he does certain things what really knocks his head off is his inability to reach sustainability which is inherent in his bank not in the physical universe as long as he has aberrations he will key himself in by indulging in such exercises if there is nothing to key in he wont get keyed in prepchecking is the best setup procedure assuming very competent auditor problems intensive see hcob 9nov61 the problems intensive use of the prior confusion and p 134 above note that as used at the time of this tape prepchecking was used in place of sec checking in the problems intensive is like junior grade prepcheck but it can be done by notveryskilled auditor with skilled auditor prepchecking and cchs are by far the best difficult though it is to teach auditors to prepcheck well ive been experimenting the past many weeks trying to work out some repetitive process which could be used at lower levels to get some benefit there is lot of value to it doubt this involves threeway bracket what have you suppressed what has another suppressed what have others suppressed same phrasing with invalidated same with failed to reveal same with been careful of youve got these buttons and you could run them back and forth and undoubtedly get somewhere in 37 12 hours you could get as far with this as i could in one hour of prepchecking the problems intensive using the changes list getting the biggest selfdetermined change finding the chronic ptp and so on gives you way to do something for the pc particularly if you are not very skilled at prepchecking but if you are it is to some degree waste of time there are pcs who dont respond to much else besides prepchecking the changes list prior confusion people in it prepcheck them route is very interesting to the pc and gives wins but otherwise it is an excursion it is also useful for teaching the auditor to assess because you get everybody the pc knew prior to the time of the change this means that the auditor learns to list the importance of havingness is that if the pcs havingness goes down he will have odd reactions you check look around the room and tell if you can have anything if it reads turn down the sensitivity and get can squeeze havingness being down brings masses in on the body and the pc will get reads with small body motions as when he looks around and moves even his eyes the pc is bundle of piano wire with masses packed in against the body with low havingness these masses are likely to start talking circuits turn on the reason missed withhold reads with double tick is that the person is pulling back against himself pulling masses against the body the same as when havingness is down extreme nohavingness results in getting needle action when the pc moves his ear watch it in routine 3 especially you dont want to do goals assessing on lowhavingness pc when you find the right havingness process the drop on the second squeeze after few commands should be third to half dial drop
