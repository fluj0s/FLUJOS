exonerate the premier as u will see on review of the attached document the premiers hostile outburst towards the governor was nothing but smoke screen design to divert the public attention of his wrongdoing in the bhc scandal when this diversion did not work he then sought an order of the court to prevent the local news agencies fro m reporting on his involvement in the bhcs scandal this was evident in his press conference wherein he only spoke of himself however thanks to the advent of the internet th story of his wrongdoing will be told and the people will then cide knowing the real

the government purse over and above his salary and ministerial perks of 124600000this figure is notwithstanding the unlawful taking of the missing st george post office cedar beams and the labour of purportedly having th em installed at his ap owen residence 22 that the acting director of public prosecuti on mr kulandra ratnesser proposed that civil action be taking out against dr brown for the recovery of the monies he has allegedly embezzl ed from the tax payers of this country so plp members do not be easily deceived the polic investigation did not exonerate dr brown from wrongdoing the fact of the matter is that the acting director of public prosecution mr kulandra ratnesser allegedly refused to review the relevant police investigation dossier on dr browns and some of his cabinet colleagues purported crimi nal activity along with other individuals connected to the bermuda hou sing corporation on review of the police dossier it is apparent that t he investigation was incomplete and abruptly halted in our system of go vernment only one person can halt an investigation that is the govern or as result of this scandal the dismissal of contr actors and various employees from the bermuda housing corporation it has been revealed that in late 2000 in an effort to secure the passage of the change of the 6040 ownership rule legislation through parliament the bank of bermuda limiteds charity the centennial trust offered to contribute to bermuda housing corporation 4000000000 to build low cos t housing but this was rejected by the government given our current housi ng situation mr brown may want to explain why when the mri machine was first proposed to the king edward memorial vii hospital in 2000 i like its then chairperson ms ianthia wade mr raymond dill and other board members and hospital executives viewed documents showing that the overseas company being p roposed by dr brown to oversee the operation of the mri machine was in fa ct company that he held an undeclared interest in this occurrence mus t be seen in the light of the recent resignation of the king edward memori vii hospital chairman and three other board members this year t hey all resigned following cabinet office meeting wherein the then hospital chairman was summon to attend and i nstructed which he refused to do to sign off on the contract just giv to kurron prior to it being presented to the board for approval or put out for tendering in the royal gazette last monday mr james stat ed that he never personally received money from the bermuda housing corporation and that is true however the police investigation surrounding mr james had to do with the use of the bermuda housing corporation fun ds to pay for work done at one of the island golf courses which is in brea ch of the bermuda housing act to dispel dr browns assertion that there is pol itical conspiracy involving the governor and the governments opposit ion the united bermuda party that simply is not true i am former suppor ter of the plp looking again to once again becoming supporter and experi encing bermuda that the late mr freddie wade had envisioned for us all i have taking this action because i strongly believe that it was wrong to just punish mr terrence smith when there is clear evident within t he police bermuda housing corporations dossier that other are guilty of wrongdoing in closing i would like to say that at the appropr iate time i will attend the hamilton police station with my lawyer and give myself up for my role in this matter i am also aware that in having acce pted this task i may have committed an offence and i am prepared to acce pt whatever punishment the courts may deed appropriate i am sincere ber mudian who believes in right and wrong and i ask that my actions are see n in the light of the result i was entrusted with information and once i read it i had to choose to either live with this knowledge and prote ct unethical wrongdoers by being silent or expose the knowledge and let my fellow bermudians make up their own minds about dr brown s and his cohorts integrityi sure did i also expect that the investigation into the purpo rted wrongdoing in the bermuda housing corporation will be reopened compl eted and that the appropriate punishment be metedout in the event th at dr brown and the other individuals reported in the documents have in fact committed criminal or civil wrongdoing signed by of the soil
