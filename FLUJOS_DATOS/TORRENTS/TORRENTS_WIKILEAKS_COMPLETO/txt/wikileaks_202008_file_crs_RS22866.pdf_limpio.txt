g345g5613 in the case of limited tax or tariff benefit identification of the individual or entities reasonably anticipated to benefit to the extent known to the member 4 the purpose of the earmark and 5 certification that the member or members spouse has financial interest in such an earmark8 when submitting earmark requests it is important to note that individual committees and subcommittees often have their own additional administrative requirements beyond those required by house rules eg prioritizing requests or submitting request forms online the house appropriations committee for example has stated that it will require members requesting earmarks to post information regarding their earmark requests on their personal website this information must be posted at the time of the reque st and must include the purpose of the earmark and why it is valuable use of taxpayer funds 9 committees may also establish relevant policy requirements eg requiring matching funds for earmark requests or restrictions regarding earmark requests eg not considering earmark requests for certain appropriations accounts or disallowing multiyear funding requests in addition committees and subcommittees often have deadlines especially for earmark requests in appropriations legislation for this reason it is important to check with individual committees and subcommittees to learn of any supplemental earmark request requirements or restrictions10 the committee of jurisdiction is responsible for identifying earmarks in both the legislative text and any accompanying reports when it is not clear whether member request constitutes an earmark the committee of jurisdiction may be able to provide guidance when submitting an earmark request it may be relevant whether the member wants the earmark to be included in the text of the bill or the committee report accompanying the bill committees may make an administrative distinction between these two categories in terms of the submission of earmark requests and there may be policy implications of an earmarks placement in either the bill text or the committee report for example under executive order 13457 11 issued in january 2008 executive agencies are directed not to commit obligate or expend funds that were the result of an earmark included in nonstatutory language such as committee report12 8 the committee on standards and official conduct is available to provide guidance and clarification in making such determination as stated in the march 27 2007 memo from the house committee on standards and official conduct titled financial interests unde r the new earmark rules available at httpwwwhousegovethics m_financial_interest_earmarkpdf 9 as stated in the january 6 2009 joint press release from the house and senate

conference committees fall into three major categories 1 determining if spending provision is an earmark 2 compiling earmark requests for presentation to the full chamber and 3 preserving the earmark requests individual committees may establish their own additional requirements committees of jurisdiction must use their discretion to decide what constitutes an earmark definitions in house rules as well as past earmark designations during the 110th congress may provide guidance in determining if certain provision constitutes an earmark house rule xxiii clause 17b states that in the case of any reported bill or conference report list of included earmarks and their sponsors or statement declaring the absence of earmarks must be included in the corresponding committee report or joint explanatory statement in the case of measure not reported by committee or managers amendment the committee of initial referral must cause list of earmarks and their sponsors or letter stating the absence of earmarks to be printed in the congressional record before floor consideration is in order the house appropriations committee has stated that it will make earmark requests publically available the same day that subcommittee reports their bill 13 conference report to accompany regular appropriations bill must identify congressional earmarks in the conference report or joint explanatory statement that were not specified in the legislation or report as it initially passed either chamber14 each house committee and conference committee is responsible for maintaining all written requests for earmarks received even those not ultimately included in the measure or the measures report furthermore those requests which were included in any measure reported by the committee must not only be maintained but must also be open for public inspection rule xxiii does not specify how the information shall be maintained and open for public inspection
