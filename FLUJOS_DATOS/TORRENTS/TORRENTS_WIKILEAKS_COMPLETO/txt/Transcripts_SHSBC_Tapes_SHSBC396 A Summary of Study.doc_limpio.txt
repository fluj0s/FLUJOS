summary of study lecture given on 4 august 1964 thank you this is the what of what audience august 4th ad 14 august the 4th ad 14 memorable day because its the day after bank holiday parade and nobody has pneumonia from the usual rain that they have on bank holiday very memorable day saint hill special briefing course august the 4th ad 14 all right you seem to have hit few records here lately in your examination grades your examination grades on lectures and so forth are coming up up up up and im very proud of you with this thank you very much aside from your own brightness on the subject some of this is attributable to the fact that ive been talking about and teaching you something about study and i think you have learned quite bit about study in the last many weeks and that is the subject of this lecture i want to give you in this lecture before it gets cold brief summaryno matter how rough and ragged and matter how well worked out laterof the things i have learned about study and i break my record by lecturing from note but i dont want this to go too far before i make it matter of lecture and record because i found out it was already getting dim in skull and i keep very little information in my skull lately and that i do put in sometimes tends to get dim because it gets lost so i didnt want that to happen and i want to give you this information about study now theres not been technology of study or technology of education now that sounds like very farfetched fantastic statement but its trueits true there was school technology andsort ofbut it didnt have too much to do with education you see there was the technology of how you go to school and how you get taught in school and how you teach children to go to school and how you go through grades and how you get examined and how you go through the college and so forth there was an awful lot of this school technology and you should differentiate between school technology and an educational technologyits the first thing id ask you to dobecause education very seldom in its final touches has anything to do with school the engineer who goes out reports to the job and hes been beautifully taught along various ways on how to do the calculus curve of mensuration on how much gravel there is in an irregular pile and by getting the calculus curve of several sections of this pile measured and formulized very carefully he is then able in looking at this barge and measuring it up to finally tell how much gravel there is in this barge this actually happenedhappened in cavite before the war many years before the war this young engineer had just gotten out of school and he did just that he went down and he calculated the amount of gravel in the barge by calculus and it was very arduous and hed been sent down by the chief engineer of the yard to find out if they had enough gravel and he didnt come back for most of the afternoon so finally the chief engineer got very very curious about this and he went down there to find out where this young new engineer was and what he was doing and whether or not the sharks had gotten him or something and he found him down there just putting the finishing touches on it and he gave himthe young engineer gave the chief engineerwith great triumph the fact that he had 15079 cubic yards of gravel on hand he had pages of calculations and the yard foreman filipino standing near at hand looked very sourly at the young engineer and he said is that what you were doing and before the chief engineer could even get in there and find out what it was all about he said you see those white paint marks on the front and the back of the barge well they tell you how much gravel is in the barge ive had wonderful example of how pedantic schooling can be as opposed to education i read dissertation last night on the subject of slides the preparation of lantern slides and boy this was the most intricate calculations of how close you had to be to screen and howthe density of the lantern slide had to be in order for you to get proper lecture hall projection and these went on and on and if i hadnt myself had experience in this particular line i would have taken all this quite seriously but it was somebodyi guess his pen just got to going and he couldnt stop it because what you do if you have dim lantern slides is get brighter lamp you dont move projector backward and forward in the hall and calculate the superreflectiveness of the screen and all that sort of thing now with great experience thenand it is considerable experience you see i know slides and densities and that sort of thing by experiencei knew that this data i was being fed so laboriously had very very little importance see it was interesting you know it was interesting that anybody would write that much on the subject but reg and i and bonwick at circus not too long ago with mismatched voltage line and common bed sheeting hung up between two circus poles enlarged picture four to five diameters above anything ever intended for either the picture or the projector everybody was delighted they looked beautiful we had twelvebytwelve screen of bed sheeting which even had puckers in it there was only one slide that it made look oddone slide out of about two hundredand it just happened to fall this pucker did in young mans face and it just fell wrong not critical proposition at all you take any old density of slide and show it inthrow it into projector then with enough lampand you put up sheet that will reflect and youve got yourself just about the finest lantern slide show you ever wanted to see and there isnt anybody going to say word about it two pages of text out of how you calculate the density of lantern slidenot critical problem so education would take into effect as opposed to schooling the relative importance of the data being taught thats very very important the relative importance of the data being taught by which one would say the relative applicability of the data being taughtthe applicability now schooling as opposed to education has in actual fact thought real thought of applicability such thought it is just as important to the pedantic or scholastic school of education this technology that pliny in the year umptyumpdashump did hereinto aforesaid with semicolons discover that there were sturgeons now what you going to do with that datum yet mans whole career could have been wiped out you see by an inability to have vociferated this fact this is under fishing heading of ichthyology see fishing fishes guy goes down to the bureau of fisheries see on his final examination paper he was asked who and what and when discovered sturgeons you can just see him nowyoung fellow in the bureau of fisheries out there off the north coast of norway blowing about forty degrees below zero trying to count the number of herring boats out there hes going to have to rescue in the next twentyfour hours using this datum about pliny you can just see this now inapplicable so theres sort of pomposity that goes along in the field of schooling that has real basis in education youll find this in the arts you will find people who really think they are artistic and really know something about art who are simply capable of rattling off number of pictures theres this picture and that picture and theres the other picture and so forth and it was paintedit was painted by jules drool you know and in 1710 see you say what did jules drool paint it with bud what did he use oh uhhaha i think its an oil but he knows its 1710 see and he knows it was jules drool and he knows the name of the painting is shameful morning or something but you ask this birdyou ask this bird you say what did he paint it with oh i think it wasuh i think its an oil ii think its an oil iii think its an oil its an oil he aint got the point its very valuable to know what they were painting with when see thats quite valuable you can use that well youdjust crudest possible useyou see something that is painted with ici best house paint as represented of having been painted in 1510 you know thats wrong because they didnt make peanutoilemulsion paint in i mean thats crude see but you can see that it does have some applicability in the detection of authenticity what did he paint it with thats verythats good applicable datum you see ill give you parallel datum like this i was tearing apart encyclopedias yesterday to find out if anybody else had ever mentioned certain art form i could find it place but i did find in the dictionary that doré meant gold colored i thought that was very interesting because the name i was looking for as an art form was doré type and so i didnt know which way i was going on this thing i thought it was probably mans name probably interfered withwith gustave doré you know and his etchings it wasnt after mans name and so the thing has never survived as name because it wasnt man you see it was simply goldish form of art reproduction so they called it doré type and the name is so esoteric that it has only survived in the supersuperprofessional lines if guy was really on the ball and he delved into everything hed know there had been such thing as doré type see but otherwise he wouldnt know anything about it everybody knows what for instance daguerreotype is see nothing like that but what was doré type well that becomes important in examining the development of picture display the display of pictures and so forth so there was type which did strange piece of picture display well you should be able to run such things back beyond that in actual fact whether it was mr wall or mr pall who invented it whenhas nothing much to do with it but how it was done you see at such and such timeoh that would have quite bit to do with it see so when youre dealing with education you have to be very careful not to lean over into the significance dont lean over into the significance exclusive of the mass that is very interesting datum now when you get into significance versus mass you get into action and action could be defined as significance versus mass of some kind or another thats rather drawing longbow you understand but the reason one engages in action or doingness and so forth is he has some kind of an idea of accomplishing something or making something or avoiding something or he hastheres significance there you know theres an idea about it even thougheven when we look at lot of particles flying around in the air and we say thats confusion weve added significance to the mass dont you see do you see that but in education when the significance is never added to the mass but stands in pristine purity all by itself you tend to get jammed curriculumno doingness lets get down to earth about it you see ive just given you an example of itive just given you an example of it of whowho invented what see and now we say and there was great deal of conflict between these two men at that particular time one of themone of them had greater idea of the destiny of his development than the other one did oh whats this got to do with anything its disrelated datum dont you see its just significance it hadnt anything to do with the doingness or the action had nothing to do with the mass that you are now confronting all it does is throw you curve you get the idea so school is expert at throwing curves until one begins to wonder whether or not school ever has education in mind so you could have school technology which would teach which would never really educate never really train anyone you see that but it could be marvelous you could fill your whole university through courses of the work of thomas hardy you could have the plight of miners in roman times on the cornwall coast you could have the number of synonyms and antonyms used by hunters and huntresses in the 16th century you could have courses which flunk people because they referred to the wrong word they used the wrong word in connection with the wrong group of animals you see you know like you have covey of quail you see and covey of foxes you know that kind of thing see very pedantic but what is the basic error here the basic errorill come back to it nowthe basic error is simply failing to add the mass or doingness to the significance see failing to add the mass or the doingness to the significance you say this fellow was good painter he painted and he painted and he painted and he painted and he painted well he painted lot you could say this in 90000 different ways he drove sevenhis first seven wives batty by the fact he never paid any attention to anything but his painting well its good curiosa but it is not an educational datum its just curiosa what did he paint see your student then must be taken into consideration your student is trying to get to be painter and im afraid theyve spent so much time teaching them on how many wives the painters have had or havent had that their idea of painting is to get married and divorced or to become walking catalog well of course if youre judge if youre going to be professional judge or professional critic not painter but one of these birds naturally you want to be practically walking catalog see you want to overwhelm everybody its good oneupmanship you know you walk through looking at things this waythis way yes this man over here hes copiedhes copied hans verboten yes thats very obscure painter of the 1416 see you want to know things like that you know if youre going to be that but to be painterand thats why youd almost never turn member of the arts out of university that is almost impossible its unheard of andto teach short story they ruin more writers well its of interest how they do this and they detach the significance and the action they separate these two things so it becomes pure significance without any action or mass connected with it and when you have done this you have then sort of wound guy up in noconfront of the subject and youve introverted him and the way student becomes introverted is to give him too much significance and too little doingness and too little mass thats still knocking you for loop you keep looking at with your heads tipped over here and i want to know whats so incomprehensible about it its slipping somewhere i dont know how to state it really any more plainly than im stating it if youre going to teach fellow about roller balls give him roller ball is thisis this difficult see dont teach him the history of roller balls am i making more sense audience yes all right does itdoes that make sense it doesnt audience yes yes so when you have detached the significance from the action and separated these two things apart you can have schooling but you cant have education and thats basically how its done if you want to wind up with whole bunch of doless graduates if you want to wind up with whole bunch of painters who cant paint whole bunch of doctors who cant doc engineers who cant eng then by george youre going to justall you have to do is take the doingness and the mass connected with the subject and park that over here as something you really dont want to have much to do with and go into the total significance of it all and then you make highly impractical person and this is the only way its done there arent number of other ways to do this you wind it up hard enough and he never does go out of school he never does leave school he becomes professor now ive learned that for person to teach who cannot do is terrible mistake lets get right down to earth here in scientology if our instructors couldnt auditguahhh what goes on if our instructors couldnt audit what catastrophe would we face in all educational lines supposing they all knew the history of auditing and then supposing they could give you chapter and verse of everything ever written on the subject and tell you exactly where to find this and tell you how many pages it had supposing they could do thatbut they couldnt audit this would be somewhat catastrophic and any trouble that an instructor has in teaching has little bit of something to do with something he doesnt confront about the doingness or the mass of the subject you got the idea so this instructor finds that he really doesnt like to teach geometry or something like that well he cant do anything with geometry do you see hes got blind spot in this particular direction now this became so notable from my inspection and study of study that i was practically struck dumb on the subject it goes to this degree that person who is simply writing the reports of people who can do is too far removed for the execution of good textbook person writing reports of people who can do matter what people this person consulted is too far removed from the doingness and mass to make studiable good textbook that is remarkable now you understand all this background i am giving you here on this particular subjectcame about when i realized that if we were going on upstairs and we knew something about the mind that we had to wrap up another subject which is entirely separate to the subject we were trying to wrap up this is our inheriting the dropped balls of yesterday they didnt wrap up the subject of education so we have to wrap up the subject of education you see in order to educate just for our own practical application see well they didnt do it they got lot of money for it they were paid to do it and they didnt do it see so you feel the same crossness that you would feel at the switchman that you had down there on the railroad tracks and he drew his pay to throw the switch and he didnt you know and the twentieth century limited went off the rails see and you say that blas of blah blah blah blahthat was his job and he didnt do it see same way same way here we are weve got difficult subject to confront because one is studying what one is and we should have had the whole subject of education beautifully wrapped up but instead of that its just muddied up there are many preconceptions in this line so i recognized that it was necessaryeven though we had made great inroads on thisi recognized that it was necessary that i get new viewpoint on this subject therefore i picked up an analogous or similar line of study in that its practical subjectif you know certain things and you do certain things you get certain result see that type of practical subjectand yet one that sort of borders over into the field of the arts dont you see so that you have to have some judgment and taste and so forth and i picked up this subjectone because it was available two because i had some interest in itbut basically because it did show fairly decent pattern of what an auditor would do in other words he has certain theories and actions which hes supposed to perform which when applied will produce certain result if he uses judgment and good taste now youdit isnt the same thing auditing and photography are very long from the same thing but auditing does have this in common with photography that when you do certain things and you do them right you then wind up with result with certain result but if you do these things bit wrong you dont wind up with result you see but also if you do these things and you do them without using good sense see you also dont wind up with result see its comparable action so i picked up this particular field and took full blasting exclamation point professional course on this from the word izzard straight on through now this was all sandwiched in during the last few months of everything else ive had to do and i learned however great deal about it just by experiencing subjectively something that was off the subject of what we are doing something that i had dilettante knowledge of and so forth and as i showed you the other day i think it was starting to come up with professional result so then therefore the course was well studied and did lead to finite result at the other end of things ive gone past the point now of just studying it and i can actually develop those points and portions of it necessary to produce the better result dont you see its gone over that borderline for instance its all right to do this and that and the other thing and you do that exactly by the textbook but if youre terribly good by the textbook why you can then give it that extra frill over here that makes it come out on top dont you see in other words you can use the textbook so well that you can think while youre doing it do you see that now that is what i have been going through and i noticed great many points very early that would never have struck if i were not working in completely new field of study this is not field by the way that i was absolutely new to ive actually been trained in darkrooms and that sort of thing from practical viewpoint so from another viewpoint herethat i got an idea ofthat actually just practical training isnt enough you cant just give the guy the tools and say all right well dabble around with it and go to work on the daily express and watch the birds rushing in and out of the darkroom at the daily express and if you do that long enough why you will become good photographer thats not true i have fabulous evidence that this is not true the evidence lies before you every morning when you glance at the paper what they commonly call news photograph is so bad and oddly enough most of those boys are untrained the topnotchers that you see around the real headliners and that sort of thing oddly enough are trained it isnt then gift that they suddenly pick up see it isnt this vast talentfellow sees cameraoh you see and this huge streak of light goes through his skull of that brilliant inspiration and he clicks the shutter and then he has pictures all over the front of everything it doesnt work that way and he can go through all of the menial jobs he wants to in the field of photography cleaning plates and all the rest of those things through to the last bitter end of the thing and he will never become topnotch photographer theyre doing it all the time because this is the way the newspapers get the young men to come in and work in their darkrooms they tell them this and thats not true topnotch photographers of england are most severely trained photographers you ever had anything to do with they are just little bit too severely trained if anything but theyre hot you get tony armstrongjones my god if you ever saw man use standard photography this guy uses it with capital s with an exclamation point he cant even take picture of his own new baby without setting up the exact textbook lighting for baby picture see he doesnt even get thrown by the event of being father you see he goes and gets the exact lamps and he sets them up at the exact angle and he fixes them up this way he got fluke picture by doing thisits just one of those flukes you run into them all the timeyou take advantage of them nevertheless his lighting was absolutely textbook this guy is headliner see hes taken design photography now and in thein the big sunday times magazine sectionhe had an article in there couple of sundays ago and i know he just laughed like mad when he published that lead picture in there hes standing outside of building he gets the perfect architectural texturehes been elected to the design council and so forthhe takesstands outside the building he gets the perfect texture of the brick perfect texture of glass perfect texture of everything and shoots the inside of the building like daylight and i know what he did he said nobody will notice it but pro but let them figure out how i did it see he knew the public would just be interested in it sort of as picture and so forth but im sure that it was in the back of his mind let somebody figure out how i did this see i dont know how he did it i know how i would have done it but you dont shoot from the outside of building in glaring sunlight and get the total detail of the inside of the building without doing cutouts or something and this is cutout how did he do it see and i know he sort of laughed to himself because hes put together of course two brands of very standard lighting knows his subject cold you see so hebut he uses it in this peculiar way with color film to get this fantastic result you never stand outside of building see it in perfect detail and look into the room inside and see it in perfect detail at the same level of light and then you dont shoot this in color latitude to the film but pro can be counted on to do things like that but when you break him right on down why can he do things like that he knows all the right ways to do it and therefore he knows how to fail at doing what hes doing and then he can think that extra step see he knows his equipment and so when he can think that one more step that makes him champion the leading glamour photographer of england is fellow named tom hustler theyre always calling in tom hustler to shoot some star or something of the sort they rave about his pictures well its quite amazing because tom hustler never took anything in his life except standard professional photograph he never took anything he doesnt even add that extra he is so standard that hes painful to look at if youre pro see the hair light is always exactly where the hair light is supposed to bethat light that you see in portraits that gives the little gleam to the persons hair see his main light the big one and the fill theyre always in exactly the right position his background is always exact its just technically perfect photograph do you see there isnt anybody else in england taking them lancere the great theater photographer i am toldi am toldtheir great theater photographer i saw some pictures by this character the other day hes about as standard as pig lost in the swamp see and the pictures look ittheyre faulty and his lighting is not standard and he doesnt know what to do with the lighting i think hes got baby picture lighting hes lighting stars with or something of the sort hes just not pro you see shows upbang people look at the picture and you show them one that is perfectly lighted you say how about this one you see they say oh thats beautiful picture you see and you show the next one and its got technical imperfection in it and they well they dont like that so well they cant tell you why this is common guy off the street see now photography has got the common denominator of the public taste what does the public want to see and what does the public like to see so now we have new subject in photographythis is another reason i chose itbrand new subject just little over century old about 18101810 somebody said you know i get poiple shadow on piece of paper when i paint it with some funny chemicals and there it all began color photography is so far from new that they were actually projecting color photographs on the screen for the edification of audiencesnot handcolored or anythingas the same time as mr brady but thats all new thats johnnycomelately subject isnt it its not really had time to pick up too much snob its not had time to get lost so to make my point when you give it all mass and doingness and significance you also fail in other words you can send this fellow up as darkroom assistant to the daily mail have him packing cameras for somebody or other and have him standing in there at lanceres adjusting lights for half lifetime without his ever really becoming pro so professionalism has to do with the significance and the doingness and the mass it has to do with all of those things you cant have all doingness and significance and you cant have total significance and doingness and wind up with final result in the way of student education then would consist of balanced activity which would treat with equal importance the significance and the doingness of subject you would treat these things equally now this is not new thoughtits not new thought its been with us for some time but it was terribly confirmed to on an inspection of what is standard photography today and having been over the jumps and being almost finished with this course and ready for my finals i thought i had better just make all these notes of it and so forth but one of the things that stuck in the eye all the way through the line is the pro the real pro was the fellow who knew the significance and had experience in the doingness and the handling of the mass and that was real pro real professional now you say well what about this fellow who comes busting out of the middle of nowhere and he all of sudden develops this whole fantastic panorama of new material you were looking at pro you didnt look at anybody who suddenly busted out of nowhere uninformed and so forth but his education might easilybecause it wasnt being taught anyplacethe significance was backed up by great deal of additional hard study see you still had the study there see he studied like mad lets take somebody like the fellow who projected the first color pictures i bet you he could have given you the number and book of practically every photograph that had been taken in the history of photography which went back of him only about 2030 years he must have known them see he must have known them all then you go back into it little bit further youll probably find out he was chemist by training see professionalism then doesnt leap fullarmed from the breath of somebodys hope professionalism is sweated for and also professionals are distinguished by the fact that they work hard dilettantism is supposed to mean good at many things but actually i would rather extend its meaning little bit to saying that unprofessional at everything because part of professionalism is hard work you reallyto pick up all the significance of subject and to put that into doingness action and so forth rough rough rough now that all sounds very interesting but there is another factor involved in it is you dont have to have done everything that was done in order to be pro and that is very hopeful thing and i learned that the hard way you dont have to have made piece of photographic film in order to become grounded in making photographic film see thats lucky for you you dont have to make human mind in order to fix one up thats carrying the point little broad but you actually dont have to have run standard operating procedure of july of 1950 in order to call yourself professional auditor if you did that why greatgreat see fine but you take someone whos being trained in 1964 to ask him to do that would be silly right now tothis stage of study for to go and get some chemicals of some kind or another and some old horses hooves and boil them up andso as to have some gelatin and put these things all together so as to make one of the original forms of wet plate and expose it wet in one of my cameraswhich was the way they did it you see and so forth well itd just come out at the other end iwhat would i say out of this well ive done it so what im not going to do it not again that would wreck the camera of course do you see what i mean that can be overstressed now we get to the overstresses the doingness can be terribly overstressed ive already showed you significance can be terribly overstressed pliny did write on theye old wax tablet which he wrote on with stylus which that day had dull point because his slave had headache that sturgeons see you can go crazy on this subject see of significance you can go nuts you can wildly overestimate what student has to know you can also underestimate it but the wildest shot when they get to formal schooling is to shoot the moon with this thing just go overboard with it just go crazy with itmakedrive everybody around the bend with it see its sort of method of forbidding somebody the subject see see if you cant tell us all the papers of sigmund freud you can never be diplomate in psychiatry its fact the total examination for the highest rank of psychiatry is simply the title the date written and the place of publication of each one of freuds papers i know i exaggerate and psychiatrist if he were here right now would say oh how yourowrrowrrowrrowrrowrrowr you know hed sound like vixie out here when you kick her but hed be lying in his teeth because thats his diplomate examination i knowi knew psychiatrist nursed him through psychotic break because he was taking it and i dont think you can get much closer to the examination without in actual fact taking it yourself and that was what was driving him around the bend he was preparing for that exam that way and he took the exam that way and that was it it was very funny watching him prepare for the exam hed keep rolling up on ball sucking his thumb rolling up in ball you know in the fetal position on the couch so he could study this it was very funny i never did tell him you know brother i think youre keyed in but overweighted significance is way of defeating student way overweighted now you can err to the degree that youre giving him subject which hes never going to do now lets take it over into scientology youre giving him all the data necessary to run standard operating procedure of july elizabeth new jersey and so forth and the mistake is to give him all of it hes never going to use it all you want to know youall you want to give him is enough so he can identify it if he collides with this thing again he said hey thats standard operating procedure of july you know back there elizabeth early days elizabeth is about all you want to get through there yeah that sort of thing finger snap yeah something like that oh yes they did that early days have some dim idea where this thing fits you see thats about all you want to get across to him hes not going to do it see so therefore if hes not going to do it youve got to strip the significance off of it you got the idea thats the way these are kept in balance if the guy isnt going to do it take the significance off of it see youve got to keep these things in balance if hes going to do it pour it to him man lets take an esoteric process like bromoil well they didnt use to have panchromatic film so it drove them mad they didnt use to have film that responded to color so it drove them absolutely stark staring mad trying to get tree light enough so that it looked like tree you know when they made picture of tree they had an awful time with this sort of thing so they did this fantastic process like photolithography i wont burden you with any of the details becauseohhhorrible it makes shudder to remember it nobodys ever going to do bromoil unless hes doodledaddle type of darkroom bug you know see hes got to be real darkroom bug because theres much simpler methods of producing the same result do you see well some oldtime photographer that is real purist and so forth in new york would listen to that statement and hed say i dont know that youll never do bromoil you cant be sure you know i myself have done bromoils and so forth only took thirty days one time to do one bromoil print thats about the length of time see oh cruel and right when i was coming down the home stretch with my course i had half textbook on how you did bromoil prints half textbook it is there in its most painful excruciating detail but not incidentally in such way that you could really do one by referring to the text it goes like this the order of action which is another point down here which ill get tothe order of action is all wrong in it that is to say now make sure that you lay this wet picture you see this wet print out on the back of the tray that will fit it or glass and make sure that you lay it out and pin it all down carefully now before you do that make sure that you have the other print ready because youre going to need it in second oh see youre on what i know as order of youve got down to this line and youre slavishly going down the line mentally doing the action you see and then you find out youve made mistake see he tells you now that there was another action you should have done before the action he tells you to do see zzrrrrrrr and you have feeling like youve made terrible mistake but bromoil is there in its most excruciating detail and has not been done seriously for number of years you could probably win salon exhibit with bromoil print you probably could today judges would stand there and theyd look at it and theyd say whats this theyre quite beautiful uhh whats this my god bromoil you know gee you know give him first technical prize thats about all youd get for it see somebody has actually done bromoil printwow see and theyd say gee you know they themselves would know what this involvedbeing trained people see public would go by look on down at the rest of the pictures wouldnt stop any eyes but it would have meant about thirty days or something like that of pure dripping sweat but to be taught how to do it down to the last comma down to the last bit of temperature down to every mistake that you could make in doing this thing which youre never going to do absolutely takes the cake right off the top of the oven wow see there is all this doingness which is never going to be matched with doingness you see so all this significance is then built up with an undone neverwillbedone doingness so it all becomes significance so the doingness all but moves over here into the significance department dont you see and it doesnt just unbalance it it winds you up with some ghastly headaches i know i say well ive got to get through this to get to the end of this course or i dont get any diploma got to make it so you take stipple brush now let read that again you ghastly you know youre never going to take stipple brush you couldnt care less so they couldnt make prints in 1890 all right great we dont happen to be having that trouble today like asking you to study the aspectsyou are studying to some slight degree but they are very usefulbut studying some of the aspect of pc lists that were made in 1950they werent publishedbut what couldyou know meters seeso what could the auditor detect without any meter what would the pc do that would indicate this see and then giving it to you in total painful detail all youre going to do is read your tone arm see but giving you this other in total painful detail you sit there and you audit with your fingers on their pulse you see and now give you the whole rundown of the japanese or chinese system of pulse counting by pressure because thats the more complex system that was actually what i used the chinese system of pulse counting trying to get up on ithowoh youd be surprised manyou sit there todayyou were absolutely at the beginning of road nowhere in thejust about 1415 years ago there was way to tell what the reaction of the pc was there was way to tell what hot subject was there was way to look into anybodys mind there was way to record it if you did just nowhere view see grim but now for you to be taught who are never going to do it how you detect tone arm response without any meter because of the various physiological manifestations of the pc the motion of the chestvery important see the change of breath coloration eye coloration there is whole subject of how do you know if process is flat by the eye coloration very interesting subject how would you like to learn the several thousand words that were written on this subject all you have to know if you were taught this is that there was such subject you see you could very easily learn there was such subject and there is the subject which is what makes the emeter important see this other subject is so complex that the emeter solves this other subject which is how do you tell whats going on in the pc and that subject had many ramifications see and if process is really getting to pc his eye color will change you see or his pulse will smooth out you know thats about all you have to know the rest of this is bricabrac all right somebody can spend his whole life whole life working in the field and realm of bricabrac and have good time there are fellows who study the history of bromoilnot do itstudy the history of itas almost fulltime hobby or profession or something see so you can get these incredible significances built up in subject which actually dont amplify the doingness or the expected action of the student then this is giving him doingness which becomes significance so we get to the next point of the line which is the conversion of doingnesses to only significances and if subject does very much of this youve just about had it if you convert all the doingnesses of subject over into significancethats how you do it is you take some subject which is not going to be performed and you describe it far beyond any necessity then youve got conversion see now if you can go the reverse you can say the significance is convertible over to the doingness and you have just had an example of thatthe fellow is never going to make bromoil so you make him make bromoil see its properly merely significance today its just properly significance there was thing called bromoil print fine it existed see what it was was it depended on the same principle now used in photolithography gelatin holds water and water repels oil see uses these various principles interesting to know see you can cover it in paragraph or two see now if we go too far on this particular line by making some person do some ancient old act which he is never again going to do weve taken something that should have just remained there as significance and we have pushed it over into doingness action and it again upsets the student most ghastly im sure he would haveim sure itd be cute to grind some wheat with millstone you see it could be hobby dont you see it could be very nice but there would have to be some good reason why you were doing it do you see good reason why you were doing it see and if its just that you want to see how they did it primitively well maybe thats good enough reason see but thats if you want to do it did you notice the choice of words to make student do it is fantastic error silly and his reaction to your effort to teach him is an arc break he cant figure out why the devil hes doing this in the first place so we come to the conclusion that the doingness and the mass of subject are the current applicable and useful doingnesses and masses of the subject and those are what should be taughthard theyre applicablethe applicable doingnesses and masses in other words the student should be taught what the student is going to be doing and the significances that should be taught to the student aredont compare to what i just told you the significances are enough background so as not to getand this is something theyve all missed and this is how an engineer gets to be forty years old and goes old hatis enough significance so that he doesnt get stuck in the mechanical doingness hes been taughtand youve got to give him enough significance in other words thats little bit more significance than you would expect to give him and thats why you give him the history of it to show that it was developed and give him some sketch of its development and thats why you show him how the thing evolved and what the doingnesses of it were so you see it becomes asinine to make him do these old things youre just trying to show him that there were some other doingnesses dont you see and youre making him conversant with the principles with which hes operating and if hes sufficiently conversant with those then the doingness and the other action which he is being taught dont become obsolete because he can think see and thats the difference between prothats the difference between pro and practical man it shows up quite additionally is pro always does it by the textbook with difference always does it by the textbook bit better and when the thing shifts it doesnt look like shift to him it looks like simply the same thing with its face slightly shifted do you see it doesnt look all that brassy new now youll hear people aroundyouve just shifted how you do repetitive commandand you will have people around that tell you weve changed all of scientology well they had learned the practical actiontheyd learned the doingness of giving practia repetitive command but they had theory over here of why they were doing this or what waswhat one was trying to accomplish with this such as flatten the mental comm lag do you see that the guys going through or anything like that flatten the process they just knew this thing of steady grind so the second you changed one comma in it they thought youd changed all of scientology dont you see but the guy who has grounding on the subject and who knows what processes are and what theyre supposed to do he would say yeah well thatthat hed give it the proper significance you see hed say well ahthats an outslightly out of arc so it should be shifted slightly see that knocks the pc little bit out of arc but this other wording thats very clever that doesnt knock the pc see that doesnt give him arc you see yeah nothing changed see to him everything looked calm normal so forth now professional then is able to advance and practical man quite commonly cannot advance theoretician then would be well taught but seldom educated somebody who is just dealing in theory and nothing but theory and so forth could be absolutely beautifully taught he could be wonderfully schooled but he would not be educated in that subject because he would have had the doingness missing in that subject his doingness would have been gone hes just an expert on the painters of the nineteenth century thats all he knows the theory of all of their paintingsjust the theory its not being done anymore nobody ever expects to do it again but youll find odd bits of the society and culture get parked like this and he can become important just because millionaires these days are trying madly to save their cash with art art and land increase in value so theres guys walking into salons today who know nothing about art but have just got that 100000 bucks that they want to get deposited fast before inflation eats it up and they feel if they bought big nice good solid piece of art that would be known into the future then of course its worth 100000 now but when money inflates itll be worth 200000 like land it would have increased its value with the inflation so therefore its like gold you see so he walks into the gallery and he looks at this painting huh its girl holding what thats the total knowledge he has of any of this so hes got experts and the expert cant paint but he can tell him the real from the false something like that but if that guy himself had doingness of detection or doingness of anything else his opinion wouldnt be worth anything either he wouldnt be able to see and hed be able to palm off everything but youve got quite culturewinds up in some very odd spots and you occasionally look into some of these spots and youll think you have total theoretician or something like that that youve got totality and you may very well have but theres nothing sadder than an expert on steamdriven road equipment i imagine there is one in england today hes an expert the last practical expert on the subject of steamdriven road repair equipment did you ever see any of these things in textbooks theyre steam engines that have rollers and they go up and down the roads andin the days before the internal combustion engine hes the lasthe was the worldshe was good practical man he never had any theory of any kind on the subject of steam or propulsion or anything else but hes awful practical on the subject of these things you see he was all doingness and thought well he antiquated he became antique he became unemployable actually so when you break up this balance in an education then you havent educated the bloke and you havent safeguarded his future fellow is betrayed then to the degree that he is not educated and only schooled and that is most of the protest of the young that they are being schooled not educated theyre not being fitted for life ill give you an idea how far adrift it can go i asked my kids the other day to write something write their names sign their names and boy of all the tonguebetweentheteeth actions you know oh that was grim they had signatures i came down on their teacher like ton of bricks you see theyve donedo lots oflots of exercises in the field of writing they couldnt sign their own name marvelous example dont you see yet im sure that theyve been very busy making circles and very busy making slant exercises and very busy doing other things and very busy doing everything but write and somewhere or another if you wanted to know what was wrong with that and why that occurred somewhere or other the doingness moved into the field of theory or significance see the doingness moved became just significance but it isnt doingness dont you see i mean writing words has very little to do with traveling ovals as they call them and so forth see so you can just go just so far with traveling ovals and you get notheres doingness there so the guy is actually in motion but it isnt an educational doingness and thats where an instructor could make his mistake you see because people are busy or active or acting then he thinks they are doing it all depends on what they are doing if theyre not doing something that is immediately going to add up to an action applicable by them in life to the accomplishment of result theyre in the field of significance and they react like they are in the field of significance they become very stultified and bored and protesting and annoyed see they themselves have recognized that theyve exceeded the doingness that this doingness has nothing whatsoever to do with what theyll be doing so they fall back then and they just treat it as significance because its purposeless it doesnt go anyplace you see nothings happening so it might as well just be significance and therefore all the motion is motion at all so all the motion being motion really they get this funny bored you know feeling like you know theyre not moving here they see all the motion but theyre not moving and actually its significance which has some motion in it and it doesnt have anything to do with going anywhere and they get this funny sensationit actually develops physiological sensation its being up against something but not being able to move through it funny funny sensation its identifiable well those fundamentally are the basic balances of proper education whatever else you want to say about it those are the basic balances there are lot of very specific things there are lot of odd and very sharp and very true and very positive and very practical aspects of all this but education is theshould be the activity of relaying an idea or an action from one being to another in such way as not to stultify or inhibitthe use thereof and thats about all it is you could add to it that it permits then the other fellow to think on this subject and develop he should be able to think on the subject and develop on the subject in other words he takes this idea that youve given him and it applies only to murals youve given him enough background and so forth and youve told him this applied to murals and one day hes looking at miniature and he says for heavens sakes that also appliesfor this particular job that im doingthat other principle applies to the miniature ill give you one i can think of one right offhand photomural should never be painted until it is actually assembled on wall if youre going to paint photomural see well i can think of an association that guy would get in his skull if he was having any trouble doing miniatures supposing for some wild reason or another somebody came up and wanted him to do miniature on ivory well this is feasible you can do it so if he knew photomurals and he knew lot of other work and he knew lantern slides and so forth and then also he knows how to go back and find how to make an emulsion you know one of the basic emulsions thatmake it out of egg white or something he knows what textbook to find it in hed probably whop all this together and then he would also know that you certainly better not paint it until youd totally finished it see and in other words the information is loose in the guys head its flexible he can use it see it isnt jammed into his head crosswise so that it just associates just with one thing see dont give iteducation shouldnt give people the technology in such way that the technology is not useful to them theyve got to be able to think with it youve got to remember that when you teach this engineer in university all there is to know about nuclear physics that in just about dozen years through the investment of national governments and other things and particularly since its very destructive we know that national governments will invest very heavily and we know that this field is going to change and were going to teach him all there is to know on the subject well we could make just technician out of him for common ordinary gardenvariety actions of reading meters or we could teach him current technology or current theory as biblical fact or we could teach him in such way that he could think in the subject and of them the only fair thing to do is teach him in such way as he could think in the subject because its an advancing subject and he wont become an antique in dozen years see if we did anything else he would become antique because this thingafter all governments are in there shoveling the money into atomic development and so forth left right and center theyve got guys on pure mathematics and theyve got guys on this and guys on that and theyrei dont care how they say theyrebut i always get suspicious they say theyre abandoning the production units of uranium 235 and then the following sentence is added onto this we take ityes theyre abandoning the manufacture of 235 well buy that now the because is what youwhat you wince on because theres already sufficient quantities of it to answer all possible needs for the next 500 years see theres that because the first sentence all right all right so theyre going to abandon this development but their because maybe so but we dont really think so theyve discovered something else brother theyve discovered something that makes u235 you know look like last seasons highbutton shoes and of course theyre not about to let it out every time somebody discovers one of these secrets or the secretary of state or somebody like that of the united states gets on plane hurriedly in order to tell the last atomic secrets to khrushchev i dont think thats his job but thats what hes been doing latelythis bird he goes ramming across and around and about and screaming about this and screaming about that there isnt any of these secrets that have been stolen such as the fuchs and that sort of thing as damaging as they were that didnt excite the government into fantastic internal convulsion on the subject of develop something new something better something that hasnt been stolen yet and their best prevention of espionage is not political because that theyre sour at their best prevention of espionage is just being newer so i imagine the poor kid being educated right up now in birmingham on the subject of atomic physics is probably already 10 15 years behind the mark hell probably get out and he will look very bright and he will say all right now we take the rigabongs and so forth and the fellows on the place say the what oh yes yes we remember that weitswethats historical that was his last course see was in rigabongs you know oooh well what are you fellows doing oh well we havent time now but theres pile of textbooks over in the corner those are our more recent notes well education then to fit this fellow for life would have to fit him for this operating atmosphere it would have to fit him to think at the same time theyd have to teach him that disciplines are disciplines and actions are actions but at the same time theyd have to teach him to think with these actions and advance these actions and carry them out to finite and final conclusion theyd have to do these things well thats quite trick to teach somebody on the one hand that this is an exacting discipline and on the other hand that you should have loose and flexible attitude toward it quite trick isnt it well you recognize what the strain is youre trying to make practical person who applies it to result who can give it that extra fillip you know that extra little zing that pushes it on through he can think on his feet in other words andso that he wont antiquate give him all this so he wont antiquate well thats quite trick actually that is being demanded of scientology as in nowhere else and anybody studying in scientology is under considerable stress and strain because of these various factors you have madly advancing subject which is advancing beyond the expectancy that it wasits expectancy keeps rising dont you see and which is already taking off from thefrom the basis of having exceeded all former expectancies see and now it is still advancing and its expectancy level is rising see consistently i mean more and more is developed that broadens the view more and more see and so therefore education in scientology becomes much touchier proposition than in any other analogous subject and its very rough its very rough that is why i undertook to find out what are these various balances and what do you do and so forth and how do you bring somebody up to point where he can study this thing without too much casualty and upset and what are the touchy points then of education and of course education is subject that has not been worked out by definitionthere isnt even definition you see such as i just gave you moment ago they dont operate in school with definition well thats wonderful because what trouble do you get into if you read paragraph beyond something that you havent got the definition of you get into trouble promptly instantly and immediately catastrophic trouble well educations been in trouble ever since it started to do something which it never defined thats the basic thing wrong with education see lets call somebody who is being educated different than somebody who is being taught lets make that shading of difference here and then lets get the technology of schooling and understand that the technology of schooling somebody does exist and that man has had that for quite while but it doesnt necessarily have too much to do with the technology of educating him which has been relatively undeveloped so just because one is going to school is reason one is getting educated see but theres terrific technology wrapped up around school and that the success of any taught subject is to the degree that it keeps its significance sensibly balanced with its action and the masses associated with it and thats sensibly balanced subject and the odd whiparound can occur here that actually person can think hes engaged in doingness when actually hes engaged in significance because the doingness is never going to be applied see and he can actually be engaged in significance which is really doingness on the other side of the fence naturally if it balances one way itll for sure balance the other way he can be engaged in ain significance of the action of contemplation and its as silly as that dont you see its too silly to require very much stress what is the significance of an action well if an individual was terribly significant about everything under the sun moon and stars you could of course work up significance into some kind of an educational subject dont you see so the significance itself would lean over and become doingness sounds silly but its true im now talking about the expert on art of the nineteenth century see and there are fellows who make terribly good living which is the achievement of final result of education after all i dont care how much communism weve got amongst us you know the guy is making living by simply being walking dictionary see memory expert on something or otherhes somebody or other he knows all the formulas there are to be known on the subject of paint he never mixed any paint he wouldnt know what to do if you showed him paint can he actually abhors the smell of itit makes him quite sick but he can sit there in little cubicle and be an expert on the subject of paint so his of course has becomehis significance has become his doingness perfectly allowable the society has that so somebody writes him letter and they say dear expert jones we are working with the formula of rosin anduhsuanduhamber and we are trying very hard to develop theso on could you please give us the background music to this here paint and he says well that paint was originally used on the tyrrhenian sea and uhso forth and their amber was different than anybody elses amber and he goes on and on and on at the other end ofthe guy the practical bird takes look hey wonder it wont paint their amber was different theres different type of amberthats russian amber and russian amber it has an awful lot of beeswax in it or something you know whatever it is this paint requires wax so we dump some wax in all right now it paints things see but this bird didnt have any idea of applying this to anything if he said enough on the subject then somebody who was doing the subject you know could make some sense out of it so there are experts theres guys like einstein he sat around and did wonderfulhe had total doingness that was of significance he figured and figured and figured and figured and figured and he figured everybody into hole but he sure stimulated guys more mathematicians were made trying to understand einstein than any other single man that ever worked the joke of it is there might be nothing in his work at all its sort of idiotic to say thatsomebody comes along and tells you that the speed of light is c and its never any different whats he talking about what light well now i dont even think he says its the light between 3600 angstroms and 5600 angstroms i dont think he got that definite he just said the speed of light well thats great does he mean light as we normally see light well light in actual fact is simply the light vibration that you see dont you see by definition thats light well then he must have meant that light visible light well great im glad he did because when it goes through prism it longer travels at c well what do you say it could longer travel at c for this excellent reason it emerges from the prism at different speeds otherwise you would never have spectrum oh yes but now youre only talking about wavelength and youre only talking about the amplitude of the wavelength and that sort of thing and thats why it turns the corner im afraid that that cant be true either it must be at different speed because if youve ever watched soldiers in an evolution the fellow on the outside is going faster than the fellow on the inside have you ever noticed that well light to bend and fan into dispersal when it goes through prism must be handling something that has to do with speed but because everybody has gone stoneblind on this because einstein has said quite the contrary dont you see now theyve got to have some weird idea and actually it might interest you to know that they have finally abolished light i thought that was mighty nice of them theyve now got it worked out that color is only something that is manufactured by the eye to relay to the brain and doesnt exist in actual fact anywhere thats actually told to youthats being taught right now i think its wonderful idea but if the guy hadnt read psychology textbook before he wrote that textbook i would be happier about it theres something wrong with all of this for this excellent reason is vibration is vibration i dont know why you have to get psychology into it thats the influence of locke and hume you see these old birds if there was sound descartes yeah if thereis there sound in the forest if there is nobody there to hear it well what do they want to chase themselves up those blind alleys for man because theyre very easily answered they are confusing the role of thetan because they havent got him and of course hes the wild missing variable in all of their equations so all right so the thetan builds the universe now of course he can experience it you can experience what you can build so therefore there would be such thing as light it all depends on how youre looking at it and from what mental science you are looking at it as to whether or not you make pronunciamentos concerning it one way or the other but you might get an idiocy that would go something like this now light doesnt exist because you arent now if you were then light couldnt because you see if light really does come through the pupil of the eye and excite the brain into various sensations known as color and so forthbut if these things do not exist in actual fact then of course nothing is behaving outside of your skull at all nothing is happening outside of your skull you are saying such things as cook can never eat the cake he bakes see this is the plea for total introversion you follow dont you therefore if weve got to have an argument about if the tree falls is there sound if nobodys there if were going to have an argument of that character then lets have some real arguments like can cook bake cake and eat it see but youd have to go upstairs into the role of being in this universe or thetan youd have to come off the kick of the big thetan idea see you follow the big thetan built light and you can only experience light and you dont have anything else to do with light except experiencing light therefore youre total effect brother lie down see you get how these tricks are worked well in education and so forth youll find out that its very safe to advance from basic premise or basic assumption and to make it very clear what basic assumption you are advancing from and then not try to spread this assumption over into thousand different things they have assumed in physics the conservation of energy well let them talk about that loud and clear and then let them not talk about the organization of mass because theyve merely started from the conservation of energy they havent said anything about mass but now they try to drag in mass by saying mass is merely bunch of energy why did they do that because their basic assumption is the conservation of energy energy can neither be made nor destroyed by anybody particularly you see thats the basic assumption of physics so this naturally is energy see now its not the conservation of space its not the conservation of time and its not the conservation of mass so now everything then has to become energy because theyve started out with their basic assumption therefore they themselves become blind to where their subject took off and therefore where itll err its going to depart see the second something comes up which is not energy its going to exceed the basics of finite physics and thats all thats wrong with that because they didnt start with anything but energy dont you see so theyre not going to go anyplace but energy were in very safe relationship to this we start with the being you thetan we can prove that you being as thetan exists we can prove that and we can back you out of your skull and you can stand without body so youre not body thats very simple we dont do this very often and dont require you to do it as one of your class exercises because it makes people sick and unhappy but it does happen and it does work all right so we start out with the basic building block of the universe thetan now were on fairly solid ground there but of course having done that we are now exceeding all former basic assumptions which start subjects now in trying to communicate this idea then we collide with all preconceptions we collide with everything in the background of people we collide with all of their upsets in the past with practically everything under the sun we can only go then in the direction of processing we cant go in the direction much of the theory and philosophy of the universe because the only way we will really win is in the direction of processing handling and doing something with the unit because the unit is not educatable at degraded state see thats elementary so unfortunately then we have to know about all there is to know and know it better than anybody has ever had to know anything before particularly about education because we cant teach anybody to do it youre tackling very tough subject its very easy subject youre tackling essentially very tough subject in scientology which has been made as easy as possible and my efforts have been devoted to in the last few months in studying study to make it even easier now i havent told you very much in this lecture that you can use but ive told you something that you might have some inspective relationships with you know well lets say whole school system of country miseducated all the youth of this country with malice aforethought they would get to point where they couldnt receive datum so theyre in war and the enemythe enemy sends them despatch and says we are going to attack tomorrow morning but they cant receive datum theyve got it that plain and clear see and they are all in bed and they all get shot down in flames and thats the end of the country see it gets down to the reductio ad absurdum of not being able to observe anything not be able to perceive anything not be able to understand anything and have arc with anything which looks to like sort of thetan death situation so it looks to like there is great deal of comparison between miseducation and aberration and it also looks to that great deal of work could be put in on this field from standpoint of deaberrating people at the lower levels ill give you an example just offhand tell this would not be repetitive processbut tell word that you have not understood in this life and then you make the guy go ahead and clarify it i think youd get some of the most interesting resurgences i think some of the many of the personal problems of the individual would blow up in smoke but here just on this other subject of studyof studying the subject of studyone walks forth with brandnew avenue of lowerlevel disentanglement and lowerlevel therapy lines which look quite promising they look quite promising but what im mainly interested in is you scientology pro training people have to know something about this subject im interested in your education right now as you exist and im trying to make it as easy as possible on you and teach you something about it thank you very much
