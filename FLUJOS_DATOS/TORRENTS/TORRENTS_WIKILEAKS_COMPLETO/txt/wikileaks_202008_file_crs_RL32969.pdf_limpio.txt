the nations highest office on the death resignation or removal from office of the president it delegates authority for succession beyond the vice president to congress over the past two centuries congress has exercised its authority in three succession acts in 1792 1886 and 1947 it has also added to revised and clarified the succession process by the 20th amendment proposed by congress in 1932 and ratified by the states in 1933 and the 25th amendment proposed in 1965 and ratified in 1967 th succession act of 1947 61 stat 380 3 usc 19 and the two amendments curre ntly govern succession to the presidency despite occasional discussions presid ential succession was widely considered settled issue prior to the terrorist ttacks of september 11 2001 these events demonstrated the potential for mass decapitation of both the legislative and executive branches of government and ra ised questions as to whether current arrangements were adequate to guarantee continuity in congress and the presidency under such circumstances with respect to presidential succession there has been wide range of discussions in both cong ress and the public policy community since that time and members of both houses have introduced legislation addressing this question in the contemporary context1 legislation proposed in the 109th congress fell into two basic categories bills to expand the line of succession to incorporate the secretary of homeland security dhs into the order of succession and thos that sought more extensive overhaul of succession policies nd procedures the 109th congress did

pr ovisions and gislation 17871967 article ii of the constitution as origin ally adopted provided the most basic building block of succession procedures stating that in case of the removal of the president from office or of his death resignation or inability to discharge the powers and du ties of the said office the same shall devolve on the vice president and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal death resignation or inability both of the president and vice president declaring what officer shall th act as president and such officer shall act accordingly until the disability be removed or president shall be elected2 this language evolved during the cons titutional convention of 1787 the two most important early drafts of the constitution neither provided for vice president nor considered succession to the presidency and it was only late in the convention proceedings that the office of vice president emerged and the language quoted above was adopted3 while the need for vice president was debated during the ratification process the stion of succession received little attention meriting only one reference in the supporting federa list papers the vicepresident may occasionally become substitute for th president in the supreme executive magistracy4 the succession act of 1792 the second congress 17911793 exercised its constitutional authority to provide for presidential vacancy or inability in the succession act of 1792 1 stat 240 afte r examining several options including designating the secretary of state or chief justice as successor congress settled on the president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives in that order these offi cials were to succeed if the presidency and vice presidency were both vacant during house debate on the bill there was considerable discussion of the question of whether the president pro tempore and the speaker could be considered officers in the sense intended by the constitution if so they were eligible to succeed if not they could not be included in the line of succession the house expressed its institu tional doubts when it voted to strike this provision but the senate insisted on it and it b ecame part of the bill enacted and signed by the president5 although the speaker and pr esident pro tempore were thus incorporated in the line of succession th ey would serve only temporarily however since the act also provided fo r special election to fill the vacancy unless it occurredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32969crs3 6 it should be recalled that during this period presidential terms ended on march 4 of the year after the presidential election also the act provided only for election of the president since electors cast two votes for president during this period prior to ratification of the 12th amendment which specified separate electoral votes for president and vice president with the electoral vote runnerup elected vice president 7 ruth silva

president garfields cabinet and other nominationslate in the last full year of the incumbents term of office6 finally this and both later succession acts required that designees meet the constitutional requirements of age residence and natural born citizenship presidential succession in 1841 setting precedent the first succession of vice president occurred when president william henry harrison died in 1841 vice president john tylers succession set an important precedent and settled constitutional ques tion debate at the constitutional convention and subsequent writing on succession indicated that the founders intended the vice president to serve as acting president in the event of presidential vacancy or disability assuming the powers and duties of the office but not actually becoming president7 tylers status was widely debated at the time but the vice president decided to take the presidential oath and considered himself to have succeeded to harrisons office as well as to his powers and duties after so discussion of the question congress implicitly ra tified tylers decision by referring to him as the president of the united states8 this action set precedent for succession that subsequently prevailed and was later formally incorporated into the constitution by section 1 the 25th amendment the succession act of 1886 and the 20th amendment 1933 president james garfields death led to major change in succession law shot by an assassin on july 2 1881 the president struggled to survive for 79 days before succumbing to his wound on september 19 vice president chester arthur took office without incident but the offices of speaker and president pro tempore were vacant throughout the presidents illness due to the fact that the house elected in 1880 had yet to convene and th senate had been unable to elect president pro tempore because of partisan strife9 congress subsequen tly passed the succession act of 1886 24 stat 1 in order to insu re the line of succession and guarantee that potential successors would be of the same party as the deceased incumbent this legislation transferred succession after the vice president from the president pro tempore and the speaker to cabinet officers in the chronological order in which their departments were created pr ovided they had been duly c onfirmed by the senate and were not under impeachment by the house fu rther it eliminated the requirement for special election thus ensuring that any future successor would serve the full balance of the presidential term this act governed succession until 1947httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32969crs4 10 feerick from failing hands pp 207208 11 this requirement was included because the constitution article i section 6 clause2 expressly states that person holding any office under the united states shall be member of either house during his continuance in office 12 3 usc 19 d2section 3 of the 20th amendment ratified in 1933 clarified one detail of presidential succession procedure by declarin g that if presidentelect dies before being inaugurated the vice presidentelect becomes presidentelect and is subsequently inaugurated the presidential succession act of 1947 in 1945 vice president harry s truman succeeded as president on the death of franklin d roosevelt later that year he proposed that congress revise the order of succession placing the speaker of the house and the president pro tempor of the senate in line behind the vice president and ahead of the cabinet the incumbent would serve until special election scheduled for the next interv ening congressional election filled the presidency and vice presidency for the balance of the term truman argued that it was more appropriate to have popularly ected officials first in line to succeed rather than appointed cabinet officers bill incorporating the presidents proposal minus the special election provision pa ssed the house in 1945 but action was taken in the senate durin g the balance of the 79th congress the president renewed his call for legislation when the 80th congress convened in 1947 and legislation was introduced in th senate the same ear debate on the senate bill centered on familiar questions whether the speaker and president pro tempore were officers in the sense intended by the constitution whether legislators were wellqualified for the chief executives position whether requiring these two to resign their congressional membership and offices before assuming the acting presidency was fair10 in the event the senate and house passed legislation that embodied trumans reque st but again deleted the special election provisions under the act 61 stat 380 3 usc19 if both the presidency and vice presidency are vacant the speaker succeeds after resigning the speakership and his house seat11 if there is speaker or if he does not qualify the president pro tempore succeeds under the same requirement s if there is neither speaker nor president pro tempore or if neither qua lifies then cabinet officers succeed under the same conditions as applied in the 1886 act see table 3 for departmental order in the line of succession any cabinet fficer acting as president under the act may however be supplanted by qualified nd priorentitled indivi dual at any time12 this means that if cabinet officer is rving due to lack of qualification disability or vacancy in the office of speaker or pr esident pro tempore and further if properly qualified speaker or president pro tempore is elected then they may assume the acting presidency supplanting the cabinet officer the presidential succession act of 1947 has been regularly am ended to incorporate new cabinetlevel departments into the line of successi on and remains

observers believed that vice presidential vacancy for any length of time constituted dangerous gap in the nations leadership during the cold war an era of international tensions and the threat of nuclear war14 it was widely argued that there should be qualified vice president ready to succeed to the presidency at all times the 25th amendment providing for vice pres idential vacancies and presidential disability was proposed by the 89th congress in 1965 and pproved by the requisite number of states in 196715 the 25th amendment is the cornerstone of contemporary succession procedures

provision for filling vice presidential vacancies renders recourse to the speaker the president pro tempore and the cabinet unlikely except in the event of an unprecedented national catastrophe presidential succession in the post911 era the events of september 11 2001 and the prospect of d ecapitation of the us government by an act of mass terrori sm have led to r eexamination of many previously longsettled elements of presidential succession and continuity of government on th federal level17 number of proposals to revise the succession act of 1947 were introduced in the 108th and 109th congresses some of these were in the nature of housekeeping legislation that is they proposed to insert the office of secretary of the department of home land security into the line of succession as has been done in the past when new cabin et departments are created by congress others proposed more complex changes in the legislation this growth of concern over succession issu in the wake of 911 was further reflected in the fact that the senate committees on rules and administration and the judiciary held joint informational hearing on september 16 2003 and the house judiciary committees subcommittee on the constitution conducted hearing on the succession question on october 6 2004 on both occasions witnesses offered wide range of viewpoints and vari ous legislative and

6061constitutional legitimacy there is question as to congresss constitutional ability to provide for presid ential succession this power is directly granted by article ii section 1 clause 6 modified by the 25th amendment as noted earlier in this report what the constitution means by the word officer however has been perhaps the most durable element in the succession debate over time the succession acts of both 1792 and 1947 assumed that the language was sufficiently broad as to include officers of congress th president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives18 some observers assert that these two congressional officials are not officers in the sense intended by the constitution and that the 1792 act was and the 1947 act is constitutionally questionable attorney miller baker explained this hypothesis in his testimony before hearings held jointly by the senate committees on the judiciary committee and on rules and administration in 2003 the constitution is emphatic that members of congress are not officers of the united states the incompatibility clause of article i section 6 clause 2 provides that person holding any ffice under the united states shall be member of either house during his tinuance in office in other words members of congress by constitutional finition cannot be officers of the united states19 this point was raised in congressional debate over both the succession act of 1792 and that of 1947 in the former case opini on appears to have been divided james madison arguably the single most form ative influence on the constitution and serving representative when the 1792 act was debated held that officers of congress were not eligible to succeed other representatives who had also served as delegates to the constitutional convention we re convinced to the contrary20 in addition political issues also contributed to the debate in 1792 fordham university law school dean john d feerick writing in from failing hands the story of presidential succession noted that the federalistdom inated senate insisted on inclusion of the president pro tempore and the speaker and excluded the secretary of state largely because of its distrust of thomas jefferson who was secretary of state and leader of the antifederalists group that later emerged as the jeffersonian republican or democra tic republican party21 questions as to the constitutional legitimacy of the speaker and the president pro tempore as potential successors to the president and vice president recurred during debate on the 1947 succession act at that time feerick notes long acceptance of the 1792 act passed by the s econd congress which presumably hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32969crs8 22 241 us 103 1916 according to

httpjudiciarysenategovprint_testimony cfmid914wit_id2605 visited march 20 2007firsthand knowledge of original intent in this question was buttressed as an argument by the supreme courts decision in lamar v united states 22 professor howard wasserman of the fl orida international university school of law introduced another argument in support of the speakers and president pro tempores inclusion in the order of succe ssion in his testimony before the 2003 joint hearing held by the senate judiciary committee and the committee on rules and administration the succession clause of the constitution provides that congress may by law provide for the case of removal death resignation or inability both of the president and the vice president declaring what officer shall then act as president and such officer shall act accordingly this provision refers to officers unmodified by reference to any department or branch elsewhere the constitution refers to officers of th united states or officers under the united states or civil officers in contexts that limit the meaning of those terms only to executive branch officer s such as cabinet secretaries the issue is whether the unmodified fficer of the succession clause has broader meaning on one hand it may be synonymous with the modified uses of the word elsewhere all referring solely to executive branch officials in which case the speaker and the president pro tem cannot constitutionally remain in the line of succession on the other hand the absence of modifier in the succession clause may not have been inadvertent the unmodified term may be broader and more comprehensive covering not only executivebranch officers but everyone holding position under the constitution who might be labeled an officer this includes the speaker and president pro tem which are identified in article i as officers of the house and senate respectively23 given the diversity of opinion on this stion and the continuing relevance of historical practice and debate the issue of constitutional legitimacy remains an important element of any congressional effort to amend or replace the succession act of 1947 succession issues political and administrative second category of succession issues includes political questions and administrative concerns the latter have become increasingly urgent follo wing the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 democratic principle and party continuity these interrelated issues collectively comprise what might be termed the political aspect of presidential succession the first democratic prin ciple was perhaps the dominant factorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32969crs9 24 feerick from failing hands pp 204205 25 us president truman public papers of the presidents of the united states harry s truman 1945 washington gpo 1961 p 129 26 the president pro tempore is elected by the whole senate but this office is customarily filled only by the senator of the majority party who has served longest thus the act of election is arguably formalitycontributing to the passage of the 1947 ccession act simply stated it is the assertion that presidential and vice pres idential succession should be settled first on popularly elected official s rather than the appointed mbers of the cabinet as was the case under the 1886 act according to feerick the 1886 acts provisions aroused criticism not long after vice president rry truman became president on the death of franklin d roosevelt24 president truman responded less than two months after succeeding to the presidency when he proposed to congress the revisions to succession procedures that when amended eventually were enacted as the succession act of 1947 the president ex plained his reasoning in his special message to congress on the subject of succession to the presidency by reason of the tragic death of the ter president it now lies within my power to nominate the person who would be my immediate successor in the event of my own death or inability to act i do not believe that in democracy this power should rest with the chief executive in so far as possible the office of the president should be filled by an elective officer there is officer in our system of government besides the president and vice president who has been elected by all the voters of the country the speaker of the house of representatives who is elected in his ow n district is also elected to be the presiding officer of the house by vote of all the representatives of all the people of the country as result i believe that the speaker is the official in the federal government whose selection next to that of the president and vice president can be most accurately said to stem from the people themselves25 conversely cr itics of this reasoning assert that the speaker while chosen by majority of his peers in the house has won approval by the voters only in his own congressional district further although ected by the voters in his home state the president pro tempore of the senate serves as such by virtue of being the senator of the majority party with the longest tenure26 against the case for democratic succession urged by president truman the value of party continuity is asserted by some observers the argument here is that person acting as president under these circumstances shoul d be of the same political party as the previous incumbent in order to assure continuity of the political affiliation and presumably the policies of the candidate c hosen by the voters in the last election according to this reasoning succession by speaker or president pro tempore of different party would be re versal of the people s mandate that would be inherently undemocra tic moreover they note this possibility is not remote since passage of the succession act of 1947 the nation has experienced divided government that is control of the presid ency by one party and either or both houses of congress by another for 34 of the 58 intervening years as yale university professor akhil amar noted in his stimony at the 2003 joint senate committee hearing the current succession provisi ons can upend the results of

base of legitimacy to cabinet officer pressed to act as president the link between cabinet officers and the president preserves some measure of the last presidential election the most r ecent popular democratic statement on the direction of the executive branch28 efficient conduct of the presidency some observers also question the potential effect on conduct of the presidency if the speaker or president pro tempore were to succeed would these persons whose duties and experience are essentially legislative have the skills necessary to serve as chief executive moreover it is noted that these offices have often been he ld by persons in late middle age or even old age whose health and energy levels might be limited29 as miller baker noted in his testimony before the 2003 joint committee hearings history shows that senior cabinet officers such as the secretary of state and the secretary of defense are generally more likely to be better suited to the exercise of presidential duties than legislative officers the president pro tempore traditionally the senior member of the party in control of the senate may be particularly illsuited to the exercise of presidential duties due to r easons of health and age30 conversely it can be noted that the speaker particularly has extensive executive duties both as presiding officer of the house and as facto head of the extensive structure of committees staff and physical installations that comprise the larger entity of the house of representatives moreover it can be argued that the speakership has often been held by men of widely recognized judgment and ability eg sam rayburn nicholas longwo rth joseph cannon and thomas reed bumping or supplantation this question centers on the 1947 succession act provision that officers actin g as president under the act do so only until the disability or failure to qualify of any officer higher in the order of succession is removed if the disability is removed the previously entitled officer can supplant bump the person then acting as president for instance assuming the death disability or failure to qualify of the pr esident vice president the speaker the president pro tempore or senior cabinet secretary31 is acting as president supplantion could take place under any one of several scenarioshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32969crs11 32 3 usc 19 b 33 3 usc 19 d3 34 howard m wasserman

become acting president32 and the senior cabinet secretary by virtue of the fact that under the act the taking the oath of office by cab inet secretary shall be held to constitute his resignation from the office by virtue of the holding of which he qualifies to act as president33 disability of the president and vice president the speaker is acting president either the president or vice president could supplant after recovering but the speaker or the president pro tempore should that officer be acting would be out of job due to the requirements noted above failure to qualify of the speaker or president pro tempore the president and vice president are di sabled or the offices are vacant the speaker and the president pro tempore decline to resign their congressional membership and ffices and the acting presidency passes to the senior cabinet officer at some point the speaker or the president pro tempore decides to claim the acting presidency resigns and bumps the serving cabinet secretary the same scenario could occur to president pro tem supplanted by the speaker critics assert that the suppl antation provisions could lead to dangerous instability in the presidency during time of national crisis imagine catastrophic attack kills the president vicepresident and congressional leadership the secretary of state assumes the duties of the presidency but whenever congress elects new speaker or president pro tem that new leader may bump the secretary of state th result would be three presidents within short span of time34 moreover as noted previously any person who becomes acting president must resign his previous position in the case of the sp eaker and president pro tempore or have his appointment vacated by the act of oath taking it is certainly foreseeable that public officials might hesitate to forfeit their offices and end their careers before taking on the acting presidency particularly if the prospect of supplantation loomedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32969crs12

thus return to their prior duties on recovery of either the president and vice president and their services would not be lost to the nation nor would there be the need to nominate and confirm replacement succession during presidential ca mpaigns and transitions the related issue of succession during presiden tial campaigns and during the transition period between elections and the inaugura tion has been the subject of renewed interest since the terrorist attacks of ptember 11 2001 the salient elements of this issue come into play only during elections when an incumbent president is retiring or has been defeated and the prospect of transition between administrations looms but uncertainties about succession arrangem ents during such period have been cause for concern among some observers procedures governing these eventualities depend on when vacancy would occur between nomination and election this first contingency would occur if there were vacancy in major party ticket before the presidential election this possibility has been traditionally covered by political party rules with both the democrats and republicans providing for replacement by their national committees35 for example in 1972 the democr atic party filled vacancy when vice presidential nominee senator thomas eagleton resigned at the end of july and the democratic national committee met on august 8 of that year to nominate r sargent shriver as the new vice presidential candidate between the election and the meeting of the electors the second would occur in the event of vacancy after the ection but before the electors meet to cast their votes in december this contingency has been the subject of speculation and debate some commentators suggest that the political parties employing their rules providing for the filling of presidentia l and vice presidential vacancies would designate substitute nominee the electors who are predominantly party loyalists would presumably vote for the substitute nominee given the unprecedented nature of such situati on however confusion controversy and breakdown of party discipline among the members of the electoral college might also arise leading to further disarray in what would already have become problematical situation36httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32969crs13 37 ibid pp 3940 38 ibid p 12 39 us congress house proposing an amendment to the

assert that once majority of electoral votes has been cast for one ticket then the recipients of these votes become th president and vice presidentelect notwithstanding the fact that the votes are not counted and certified until the following january 638 if so then the succession procedures of the 20th amendment noted earlier in this report would apply as soon as the elector votes were cast namely if the presidentelect dies th the vice presidentelect becomes the presidentelect this point of view receives strong suppor t from the language of the house committee report accompanying the 20th amendment addressing the question of when there is presidentelect the report states it will be noted that the committee uses th term president elect in its generally accepted sense as meaning the person who has received the majority of electoral votes or the person who has been chosen by the house of representatives in the event that the election is thrown into the house it is immaterial whether or not the votes have been counted for the person becomes the president elect as soon as the votes are cast39 between the electoral vote count and inauguration as noted previously the 20th amendment covers succession in the case of the presidentelect providing that in case of his death the vice pr esidentelect becomes presidentelect40 further vice presidentelect succeeding under th circumstances and subsequently inaugurated president would nominate vice president under provisions of the 25th amendment major concern that has ri sen about this period since the terrorist attacks of

the secr etary of homeland security43 freestanding proposals to revise the order of succession to include the secretary of homeland security perhaps of most immediate interest in the case of presidential ccession was the establishment in 2002 of the department of homeland security dhs the secretaries of newlycreated cabinet level departments are not automatically included in the order of succession this is normally accomplished by an appropriate provision in the legislation authorizing the new department44 in some instances however the secretarys inclusion has been omitted from the authorizing act and has been accomplished later in perfecting legislation the act establishing the dhs in the 107th congress pl 107296 did not incorporate the secretary of the new department in the line of presidential succession leading to the introduction of pr oposals for the secretarys inclusion in the 108th and 109th congresses s 422 and hr 1455 the primary purpose of these two 109th congress bills was to include the secretary of homeland security in the line of presidential succession s 442 was intr oduced on february 17 2005 by senator michael dewine and was cosponsored by senator herb kohl the companion bill hr 1455 was introduced in the house on apr il 5 2005 by representative tom davis and was cosponsored by representative t odd platts both bills departed from tradition however by proposing to place the secretary of homeland security in the line of succession directly following the ttorney general in this position the secretary would have been eighth in line to succeed the president rather than 18th at the end of the order following the secretar of veterans affair s had it passed this realignment would have had hi storical significance as the four offices that would immediately precede the secretary of home land security constitute the original cabinet as established between 1789 an d 1792 during the presidency of george washington the secretaries of state the treasury defense and the attorney general they are sometimes referred to as the big four45 this departure from tradition derived fro m heightened concern over the question of continuity of government46 it was argued that the proposed placement of the dhs secretary will have at least two advantages first the department of homeland security is one of the largest and most important executive departments with many responsibilities directly affec ting the security and prepar edness of the nation bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32969crs16 its size and crucial role were cited as arguments for placing the secretary of dhs high in the order of succession second the secretary of homeland security is charged with critically impor tant responsibilities in these areas and may be expected to possess the relevant knowle dge and expertise that arguably justify placing this official ahead of 10 secretaries of more senior departments particularly in the event an unprecedented disaster were to befall the leadership of the executive branch on the other hand the bill was open to criticism on the grounds that it was an exercise in undue alarmism and that pl acing the secretary of homeland security ahead of the secretaries of more seni or departments might set questionable precedent by seeming to elevate the offi ce to sort of super cabinet level that would arguably be inconsiste nt with its legal status s 442 was read twice and referred to the senate committee on rules and administration on february 17 2005 on july 26 the committee was discharged by unanimous consent and the bill passed th senate without amendment by unanimous consent the same day s 442 was receive d in the house on july 27 it was referred to the house judiciary committee and on september 19 further referred to the subcommittee on the constitution furthe r action was taken during the balance of the 109th congress on april 5 2005 hr 1455 was referred to the house committee on government reform and in addition to the house committee on the judiciary for period to be subsequently determined by the speaker in each case for consideration of such provisions as fell within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned in judiciary the bill was subsequently referred to the subcommittee on the constitution on may 10 on october 20 the b ill was considered in the committee on government reform and was reported favorably to the full house by voice vote further action was taken dur ing the balance of the 109th congress proposals for substantive revisions to the succession act of 1947 other bills introduced in the 109th congress called for substantive changes in the order of succession beyond the vice president some of the concerns expressed by critics of the 1947 act were reflected in th proposals which are examined below hr 1943 and s 920 the presi dential succession act of 2005 these similar bills were both introduced on april 27 2005 by representative brad sherman and senator john corn yn respectively both would also have added the secretary of homeland security to the or der of succession but they went beyond s 422 and hr 1455 in several re spects addressing various post911 concerns the bills would not only have amended the ccession act they also expressed the sense of congress on succession contin gencies that could occur between presidential campaign and the inauguration of an incoming president section 1 identified each bill s short title as noted above section 2 in each case sought to revise the succession act 3 usc 19 in several respects first it would have incorporated the dhs secretary in the line of ccession but directly following the secretary of veterans affairs rather than following the attorney general it also added the following united states ambassa dors to order of succession following the dhs secretary 1 the united nations 2 the united kingdom great britain 3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32969crs17 47 this assumption is grounded in the tradition that presidents almost always choose members or supporters of their own political party for cabinet positions there have been exceptions to this practice for instance secr etary of transportation norman mineta served as democratic representative in the 94th through 104th congresses 19751996 and as secretary of commerce in the clinton administration 20002001russia 4 china and 5 france the in tent here was to dd highranking federal officers to the succession list who are normally not physically present in washington at any given time thus assuring there would be president in the event of worst case scenario the mass decapitation of th us governments political leadership by successful attack on the capital section 2 in hr 1943 would also have revised existing language to establish the use of the term acting president throughout the section although the phrase act as or acting as president appear s frequently throughout the section this language sought to establish the term and the position more solidly in law finally both bills made major changes with respect to ccession by cabinet officers the present mechanisms of succession by the speaker of the house of representatives or the president pro tempore of the senate would not change if however cabinet officer became acting president then he or she would continue to serve the balance of the presidential term of office unless the service was due to disability of the incumbent in that cas the president or vice president would resume office once the disability was removed this provision would have eliminated supplan tation or bumping of cabinet officers serving as acting president thus reducing the potential fo r executive instability or revolving door presidents as discussed earlier in this report in addition another change to the act proposed to eliminate the provision that acceptance of the acting presidency by cabinet officer constitutes an automatic resignation from his or her office this ch ange would have had the effect of allowing cabinet officer to take facto leav of absence to serve as acting president particularly if the succession were connected with disability on the part of the vice president this provision addressed seve ral issues cited earlier in this report that have been noted by critics of the succession act of 1947 first by eliminating the displacement of cabinet officer acting as president except in cases of presidential or vice presidential inability it would have removed potential source of instability once installed as acting president the cabinet officer would remain in this position for the balance of the presidential term unless as noted above the officer were acting due to the presumably temporary inability of the president or vice president further under these circumstances it would almost certainly have rem oved the possibility of president and vice president being succeeded by an acting president of different party which has proved to be an issue of continuing concern since passage of the succession act of 194747 the section concluded by recasting the requirement that any cabinet officer serving as acting president must hold his or her permanent office by and with thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32969crs18 advice and consent of the senate prior to the time the powers and duties of the president devolve to such officer nd not under impeachment by the house of representatives at the time the powers nd duties of the office of the president devolve upon them section 2 of bot h bills proposed routine conforming amendments to the succession acts language in the us code section 3 of both bills declared the sense of congress concerning electoral college procedures in the event presid ential or vice presidential nominee should die or be permanently incapacitated firs t it advised the presidential and vice presidential nominees of political parties to designate substitute candidates who would receive the electoral votes otherwise cast for them if they were to die or be permanently incapacitated second it dvised electors pledged to vote for presidential nominee to cast their electoral votes for the vice presidential nominee if the presidential nominee had died or was permanently incapacitated third if the vice presidential nominee suffered the same circumstances then the electors were advised to vote for the substitute vice presidential nominee finally if both candidates died or were permanently incap acitated then the electors were advised to vote for both substitute nominees for president and vice president the section concluded by advising the political parties to establish rules and procedures consistent with these practices the purpose of section 3 was to eliminat the uncertainties that would surround the death or permanent incapacity of presidential or vice presidential nominee at any time between the nomination and casting of electoral votes these issues have been discussed previously in this re port under succession during presidential campaigns and transitions although th political parties would not have been compelled to accept section 3s recommendations they the recommendations would carry considerable weight as the expressed sense of congress while their apparent prudence and common sense might have persuaded the national committees of the major parties to consider them serious ly or to adopt them in this sense the section provided template or m odel legislation for the parties section 4 declared the sense of congress that continuity of leadership in the federal government should be assured during periods of presidential transition and inauguration section 4 of hr 1943 include d preamble that cited the presidential transition act of 1963 3 usc 102 whic h seeks to avoid disruption in the us governments functions during these peri ods and also noted that the national commission on terrorist attacks upon th united states the 911 commission made specific recommendations concerning continuity of government during the transition from an outgoing presidential administration to an incoming one particularly with respect national security officials the remainder of section 4was identical in both bills it specifically suggested that outgoing presidents should submit minations proposed by the presidentelect for appointed offices in the line of successi on during the transition period it further urged that the senate conduc t and finalize its confirma tion proceedings for these nominations between january 3 the date on which new cong resses convene and january 20 when new presidential terms begin finally outgoing presidents were urged to sign and deliver the commissions for these officials before leaving office on january 20 the intention here was to ddress the contingenc identified earlier inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32969crs19 this report the awkward period around the inauguration when the outgoing cabinet has resigned but the newly nominated cabin et officers have yet to be approved and are not yet eligible to succeed to the presidency traditionally presidentselect announce their cabinet choices during the transition period that normally takes place between election day and january 20 of the following year when the newlyelected president actually assumes office also during this period the outgoing presidents cabinet officers traditionally submit their resignations generally ffective on or before inauguration day although investigations of and hearings on cabinet nominees for an incoming administration are often under way before the changeover official nominations by an incoming president and subsequent advice and consent by the nate cannot occur until after the new president has assumed office fr equently this proce ss continues for some weeks or longer in the case of controversia l or contested nominations so that the full cabinet may not be sworn til well after the inaugurati on representative sherman and senator cornyn sponsors of hr 1943 and s 920 respec tively and other observers viewed this gap particularly in the confirmation and swearingin of cabinet officers included in the line of successi on as threat to continuity in both the presidency and in executive branch management one advantage conferred by this proposal would be that cabinet secretaries unlike elected officials do not serve set terms of office which expire on date certain further the process recomme nded by hr 1943 and s 920 had the additional advantage of bein g able to be implemented without legislation or constitutional amendment if the level of interpersonal and bi partisan cooperation envisaged in these bills could have been attained an incoming president might assume office on january 20 with full cabine t or at least key officers in the line of succession eg the secretaries of state the treasury defense and the attorney general already sworn and in stalled thus reducing the pot ential for disruption of the executive branch by terrorist attack in addition to the national securityrelated advantage this would confer it arguably provided an impetus to streamlining the sometimes lengthy and contenti ous transition and appointme nts process faced by all incoming administrations it would also however have faced substantial obstacles since its success would be dependent on hi gh levels of good will and cooperation between incumbent presidents and their successors and between the political parties in the senate moreover it would have imposed siz eable volume of confirmation related business on both the lame duck and newlyswor n congresses during the 10 weeks following presidential election du ring this period the expiring congress traditionally adjourns sine die while the new congress generally performs only internal business and counts the electoral votes between its own installation on january 3 and the presidential inauguration hr 1943 was referred to the house committee on the judiciary on april 27 2005 while s 920 was referred to the senate committee on rules and administration on the same day further action

joint senate committee hearings held in september 2003 would ve congress establish number49 of additional federal officers whose specific duties and f unction would be to be ready to assume the acting

officers and members of congress in other words private citizens who have had broad experience in government they would receive regular briefings and would also serve as advisors to the president further crucial element is that they would be located outside the washington dc area in order to be av ailable in the event of governmental decapitation fortier further suggested th at these officers s hould be included ahead of cabinet officers lower in the line of succession50 although he was not more specific in his testimony it could be argued that these officers might be inserted after the big four ie the secretaries of state the treasury and defense the attorney general and possibly the secretary of homeland security should that officer be included at that place as proposed in some pending legislation miller baker offered other proposals dur ing his testimony at the september 2003 hearings all of which would require amending the ccession act of 1947 under one the president would be empower ed to name an unspecified number of state governors as potential successors the constitutional mechanism here would be the presidents ability to call state militias the national guard into federal service51 baker argues that by virtue of their positions as commandersinchief of their state contingents of the nationa l guard governors could in effect be transformed into federal officers by the federalization of the guard52 another proposal by fortier would am end the succession act to establish series of assistant vice presidents nominated by the president and subject to approval by

nominated by the president and subject to confirmation by th senate in his testimony before the september 2003 joint senate committee hearings he suggest ed that presidential candidates should announce their choices for this office durin g the presidential campaign this would presumably enhance the electoral legitimacy of the assistant vice president as voters would be fully aware of the candidates c hoices for this potentially important office and include this in their voting decisions54 further variant was offered by howa rd wasserman during his joint senate committee hearing testimony he suggested establishment of the cabinet office of first secretary nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate the first secretarys duties would be the same as those of the offices proposed above with special emphasis on full inclusion and participation in administration policies this officer must be in contact with the president and the administration as an active member of the cabinet aware of and invol ved in the creation and execution of public policy55 finally fortier proposed constitutiona l amendment that would eliminate the requirement that successors be officer s of the united states empowering the president to nominate potential successors beyond the cabinet subject to advice and consent by the senate such an amendm ent he argues would eliminate any doubts about placing state governors in th line of succession and could provide for succession to the presidency itself s opposed to the acting presidency56 fortier envisions that these persons would be emin ently qualified to serve as examples he suggested that president george w bu sh might nominate former president george hw bush and former vice pres ident dan quayle both of whom longer live in washington to serve in the line of succession similarly future democratic president might nominate former vice pres idents gore and walter mondale to serve in the statutory line of succession57
