resolution the senate passed the measure without amendment on march 16 2006 by vote of 5248 the enactment of pl 109182 obviated the need for any action on debt limit legislation under the reconciliation process crs3 overview of the budget reconciliation process the congressional budget act of 1974 established the congressional budget process1 under the act the house and senate are required to adopt at least one budget resolution each year and have done so except for fy1999 fy2003 and fy20052 the budget resolution which takes the form of concurrent resolution and is not sent to the president for his approval or veto serves as congressional statement in broad terms regarding appropriate revenue spending and debtlimit policies as well as guide to the subsequent consideration of legislation implementing such policies at agency and programmatic levels budget resolution policies are enforced through variety of mechanisms including points of order3 the house and senate budget committees which were created by the 1974 act exercise exclusive jurisdiction over budget resolutions and are responsible for monitoring their enforcement in developing budget resolution the house and senate budget committees use various sources of budgetary information and analysis including baseline budget projections of revenue spending and the deficit or surplus prepared by the congressional budget office cbo budget resolution typically reflects many different assumptions regarding legislative action expected to occur during session that would cause revenue and spending levels to be changed from baseline amounts most revenue and mandatory spending4 however occurs automatically each year under permanent law therefore if the committees with jurisdiction over the revenue and mandatory spending programs do not report legislation to carry out the budget resolution policies by amending existing law revenue and mandatory spending for these programs likely will continue without change there are some notable exceptions to the permanency of revenue and mandatory spending laws such as many of the tax cuts proposed by president george w bush and enacted in 2001 and 2003 discretionary spending on the other hand is provided annually in regular supplemental and continuing appropriations acts the house and senate therefore are assured an opportunity each year to consider discretionary spending within the 1 see titles iix of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93344 july 12 1974 88 stat 297339 as amended and codified at 2 usc 621692 2 for background information on budget resolutions see crs report rl30297 congressional budget resolutions selected statistics and information guide by bill heniff jr 3 the congressional budget process and its enforcement procedures are discussed in more detail in crs report 98721 introduction to the federal budget process by robert keith and allen schick also see crs report 97865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturno 4 mandatory spending also referred to as direct spending is provided mainly in substantive law under the jurisdiction of the legislative committees in contrast to discretionary spending which is provided in annual appropriations acts under the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations committees most direct spending programs are entitlements such as social security medicare federal civilian and military retirement and unemployment compensation crs4 context of budget resolution policies the enforcement of budget resolution policies regarding discretionary spending relies for the most part on the ability to raise points of order against individual appropriations acts that violate the suballocations of discretionary spending made pursuant to section 302b of the 1974 act the budget reconciliation process is an optional procedure that operates as an adjunct to the budget resolution process5 the chief purpose of the reconciliation process is to enhance congresss ability to change current law in order to bring revenue spending and debtlimit levels into conformity with the policies of the budget resolution under the reconciliation process the house and senate may compel their committees to develop legislation changing existing law accordingly reconciliation can be potent budget enforcement tool for large portion of the budget reconciliation is twostage process first reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution directing the appropriate committees to develop legislation achieving the desired budgetary outcomes if the budget resolution instructs more than one committee in chamber then the instructed committees submit their legislative recommendations to their respective budget committees by the deadline prescribed in the budget resolution the budget committees incorporate them into an omnibus budget reconciliation bill without making any substantive revisions the second step involves consideration of the resultant reconciliation legislation by the house and senate under expedited procedures among other things debate in the senate on any reconciliation measure is limited to 20 hours and 10 hours on conference report and amendments must be germane and not include extraneous matter the house rules committee typically recommends special rule for the consideration of reconciliation measure in the house that places restrictions on debate time and the offering of amendments in cases where only one committee has been instructed the process allows that committee to report its reconciliation legislation directly to its parent chamber thus bypassing the budget committee in some years budget resolutions included reconciliation instructions that afforded the house and senate the option of considering two or more different reconciliation bills once the reconciliation legislation called for in the budget resolution has been approved or vetoed by the president the process is concluded congress cannot develop another reconciliation bill in the wake of veto without first adopting another budget resolution containing reconciliation instructions as an optional procedure reconciliation has not been used in every year that the congressional budget process has been in effect beginning with the first use of reconciliation by both the house and senate in 1980 however reconciliation has been used in most years congress has sent the president 19 reconciliation acts over the years 16 were signed into law and three were vetoed and the vetoes not 5 see crs report rl33030 the budget reconciliation process house and senate procedures by robert keith and bill heniff jr for more information on the process crs5 overriden table 1 provides list of the 10 reconciliation acts presented to the president from 1990 for fy1991 and subsequent years to the present seven of the acts were signed into law and three were vetoed by president bill clinton the inclusion of reconciliation instructions in budget resolution has not always resulted in house or senate consideration of reconciliation measure under the instructions in 1996 the fy1997 budget resolution hconres 178 provided for three separate reconciliation measures dealing with 1 welfare and medicaid reform and tax relief 2 medicare preservation and 3 tax and miscellaneous direct spending reforms reconciliation measure reforming the welfare system was enacted in 1996 pl 104193 but the house and senate did not act on the other two reconciliation measures provided for under the budget resolution further not every reconciliation measure considered by one chamber has been considered by the other chamber or been regarded as reconciliation measure when considered by the other chamber in 2000 for example the house considered and passed several reconciliation measures but they were not considered by the senate6 initial actions under reconciliation focused on deficitreduction efforts consequently the procedures were employed to achieve spending reductions and revenue increases on net basis in the latter part of the 1990s particularly when large surpluses emerged in the federal budget for the first time in decades the focus of reconciliation action was shifted to reducing revenues which continued into the 2000s in the fy2006 budget resolution reconciliation directives entail reductions in both revenues and spending 6 see crs report rl30714 archived congressional action on revenue and debt reconciliation measures in 2000 available upon request from the author crs6 table 1

years in which congress used omnibus reconciliation legislation to achieve net deficit reduction occurred in the 1990s one reconciliation act each in 1990 and 1993 and two in 1997 over fiveyear period according to cbo the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 reduced the deficit by an estimated 482 billion the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 reduced the deficit by an estimated 433 billion and in 1997 the balanced budget act and the taxpayer relief act together reduced the deficit by an estimated 118 billion in all three years as shown in figure 1 the reconciliation acts relied on net mandatory savings amounting over five years to an estimated 75 billion in the 1990 act 77 billion in the 1993 act and 107 billion in the 1997 acts with regard to revenues however the 1990 and 1993 acts reflected estimated net increases over five years of 158 billion and 241 billion respectively while the 1997 acts reflected an estimated net reduction of 80 billion over five years fiveyear net savings in discretionary spending attributable to statutory limits established in the 1990 act and extended in the 1993 and 1997 legislation ranged crs7 from an estimated 69 billion in the 1993 act to 89 billion in the 1997 acts to 190 billion in the 1990 act although estimates of savings in discretionary spending were included in the cbo assessments of the budgetary impact of the reconciliation measures the discretionary savings actually occurred as the annual appropriations acts were enacted over the fiveyear period debt service savings accounted for the remaining deficit

legislation were included in the cbo assessments of the budgetary impact of the reconciliation measures but the discretionary savings actually occurred as the annual appropriations acts were enacted over the fiveyear period crs8 the budget policy context the house and senate as stated earlier are required under the congressional budget act of 1974 to reach agreement each year on budget resolution that establishes budget plan for at least five fiscal years the upcoming fiscal year and the ensuing four fiscal years changes in the current fiscal year may be made as well during the 2005 session for example the budget resolution developed by the house and senate covered fy2006 which began on october 1 2005 through fy2010 and included revisions for fy2005 many factors influence the development of budget resolution particularly the presidents annual budget submission toward the start of the session development of the budget resolution as well as the presidents budget involves the consideration of estimates of future spending revenues and the resultant deficit or surplus based on current law these estimates are referred to as baseline budget projections as prepared by the congressional budget office cbo and current services estimates as prepared by the office of management and budget omb the impact of congressional and presidential budgetary policies often is assessed by comparing revenue spending or deficit or surplus levels under such policies to the cbo and omb baseline estimates this section provides background on budget policies for fy2006fy2010 as formulated in 2005 with respect to budget components targeted by the reconciliation process the deficit mandatory outlays revenues and the public debt limit for each component information is provided on baseline budget projections the presidents budget submission and the congressional budget resolution baseline budget projections on january 25 2005 cbo issued its annual report providing baseline budget projections the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 2006 to 2015 the baseline budget projections were updated on march 8 in conjunction with the development of the fy2006 budget resolution the

amounted to 1232 trillion as percentage of gdp the baseline deficit was projected to decline from 23 to 13 over this period cbo noted that the statutory rules governing the preparation of baseline projections likely resulted in an understatement of spending for military operations in iraq and afghanistan by tens of billions of dollars thereby understating the deficit for fy2006 and possibly later years as well the omb current services estimates included higher deficit levels than cbo for each year but followed the same trend of gradual decline reflected in the cbo projections9 omb estimated decrease in the deficit for fy2005 from the prior years level to 390 billion further omb projected the deficit to decline from 361 billion for fy2006 to 207 billion for fy2010 over five years the cumulative projected deficit amounted to 1351 trillion mandatory outlays under the cbo baseline budget projections mandatory outlays were projected to grow by 339 billion over the fiveyear period from 1385 trillion for fy2006 to 1724 trillion for fy2010 in comparison outlays for net interest were projected to grow by 93 billion from 211 billion for fy2006 to 304 billion for fy2010 and discretionary outlays were projected to grow by 65 billion from 915 billion for fy2006 to 980 billion for fy2010 as percentage of gdp mandatory outlays were projected to increase by fy2010 to 109 an increase of 02 from fy2006 outlays for net interest were projected to increase to 19 an increase of 03 and discretionary outlays were projected to decrease to 62 decrease of 09 the omb projections for mandatory outlays showed an increase over the five year period of 336 billion nearly the same as the cbo projection the omb projections however showed higher levels of mandatory outlays for each fiscal year rising to 1752 trillion for fy2010 revenues according to cbo total revenues were projected to rise by 594 billion over the fiveyear period from 2213 trillion for fy2006 to 2807 trillion for fy2010 as percentage of gdp revenues were projected to increase by fy2010 to 178 an increase of 06 from fy2006 omb projected greater increase in revenues 663 billion over the fiveyear period rising to 2841 trillion for fy2010 9 the omb current services estimates unlike the cbo baseline budget projections were not prepared strictly in accordance with the baseline rules established in the budget enforcement act bea accordingly some of the differences in the amounts presented by omb and cbo are attributable to conceptual differences as discussed in cbo an analysis of the presidents budgetary proposals ibid p 17 crs11 public debt limit finally cbo projected the increases that would be needed in the public debt subject to statutory limit which currently stands at 8184 trillion although the revised debtlimit levels were not identified in the baseline projections published in march the projections published in january indicated that the debtlimit level would amount to 8529 trillion for fy2006 rising steadily to 10847 trillion for fy2010 the last four increases in the public debt limit which occurred between 1997 and 2004 are shown in table 4 the amount of increase

the 330plus billion growth in mandatory outlays projected by omb and cbo in the baseline during fy2006 fy2010 third revenues would be reduced in the net by 106 billion during the fiveyear period13

outlays mainly social security personal accounts and additional war funding for fy2006 the levels associated with the presidents recommendations regarding savings in mandatory outlays in reductions in

resolutions employed fiveyear time frame covering fy2006 fy2010 with revisions included for the then current fiscal year fy2005 as well the three main pillars of budget policy as reflected in the reported budget resolutions involved significant restraint on the growth of discretionary spending more modest curtailment of the growth of mandatory spending and further reductions in revenues although at more modest level compared to the actions taken in 2001 and 2003 while the house agreed to the budget resolution reported by the house budget committee without change the senate revised the version reported by its budget committee although dozens of amendments were adopted in the senate many of them involved precatory language ie senseofthesenate statements or procedural matters rather than changes in spending or revenue levels some significant changes were made in budget levels including to reconciliation instructions as discussed below but the basic outline of budget policy recommended by the senate budget committee remained intact the positions of the house the senate and the final conference agreement regarding several key components of the budget plan are presented in

recommendations was september 16 2005 the reporting deadline for the revenue reconciliation measure was june 24 each of the four amendments made in order during initial house consideration of the budget resolution would have modified or eliminated the reconciliation instructions for fy2006fy2010 recommended by the house budget committee the hensarling amendment would have increased the savings in mandatory outlays to more than 125 billion and the revenue reductions to about 106 billion the obey amendment would have added revenue increases of nearly 26 billion intended to be targeted at wealthy taxpayers and the watt and spratt amendments would have eliminated the reconciliation instructions completely as indicated earlier all of the amendments were defeated subsequently the house agreed to the budget resolution without having made any changes in the reconciliation instructions as reported by the budget committee initial senate action the senate budget committee reported its version of the fy2006 budget resolution sconres 18 on march 11 200517 the reconciliation instructions included in the budget resolution as reported by the senate budget committee differed in several respects from the instructions in the budget resolution agreed to by the house see table 9 first section 201a of sconres 18 included instructions to seven committees to achieve savings in mandatory outlays of 4244 billion in fy2006 and 32042 billion in fy2006fy2010 less than half the fiveyear amount recommended by the house second section 201b of the measure included instructions to the senate

legislative action compared to the houses recommendation imposing an earlier submission date for spending reconciliation recommendations june 6 instead of september 16 in the house and later reporting date for revenue reconciliation legislation september 7 instead of june 24 in the house the reporting date for the reconciliation measure pertaining to the public debt limit was september 16 the senate unlike the house agreed to amendments that changed the reconciliation instructions recommended by the budget committee on march 17 the senate adopted three amendments that revised both the spending and revenue reconciliation instructions first the senate adopted bingaman for smith amendment 204 by vote of 5248 the amendment struck the spending reconciliation instructions to the finance committee in section 201a6 and added crs19 to the budget resolution provision establishing reserve fund of 15 million for the creation of 23member bipartisan medicaid commission it had been widely assumed that the finance committee would consider reductions in medicaid spending in order to meets its instruction of 15036 billion in savings over five years consequently the amendment was seen as means of protecting the medicaid program from spending cuts the second amendment that the senate adopted on march 17 was bunning amendment 241 by vote of 5545 the amendment which increased the revenue reduction under reconciliation by 48 billion for fy2006 and 639 billion for fy2006fy2010 was characterized by senator bunning as accommodating the repeal of 1993 increase in the taxation of social security benefits finally the senate adopted on march 17 kennedy amendment 177 as modified by vote of 5149 the amendment decreased the instruction to reduce revenues by 723 million for fy2006 and 5474 billion for fy2006fy2010 thereby offsetting spending increases for education programs the senate also considered and rejected several other amendments that would have modified the reconciliation instructions in particular the senate rejected cantwell amendment 168 by vote of 4951 the amendment which would have struck the instruction in section 201a4 to the energy and natural resources committee to reduce outlays by 2658 billion over five years was characterized by senator cantwell as precluding the opening of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr to oil exploration in the net the amendments that the senate adopted decreased the total outlay reduction over five years by 15036 billion from the reported level of 32042 billion to 17006 billion and increased the total revenue reduction over five years by 58426 billion from the reported level of 70154 billion to 128580 billion by scaling back the outlay reductions and boosting the revenue reductions required by the reconciliation instructions the senate dramatically changed the net effect of reconciliation on the total deficit estimate over the fiveyear period while the reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution as reported by the senate budget committee would have increased the deficit in the net by about 38 billion over five years the instructions in the resolution as passed by the senate would have increased the deficit in the net by about an additional 73 billion over that period or about 111 billion in total action on the conference report the conferees reported their agreement on hconres 95 on april 28 2005 in addition to the separate spending and revenue reconciliation measures that each chamber had proposed the conferees agreed to third reconciliation measure on the public debt

have enacted various measures intended to provide relief to the victims of hurricane katrina and hurricane rita and to fund reconstruction activities19 legislative efforts in this area have continued into 2006 republican leaders in the house and senate and others expressed concern about the impact of these relief and reconstruction efforts on the federal deficit and developed plans to enact offsets to some of the relief costs on october 6 2005 speaker of the house j dennis hastert issued press release on plan developed by house republican leaders20 in commenting on the plan speaker hastert noted hurricanes katrina and rita have dealt severe blow to our nation both in terms of human and economic losses we can and will recover but it will require some serious belttightening throughout the federal government house republican leadership committee chairmen and key members of the conference have worked together to come up with proposal we believe can accomplish this task in order to maintain our commitment to deficit reduction we are proposing to move midsession budget amendment for the first time in almost 30 years 1977 the amendment will increase the total amount of savings which can help pay for these unexpected costs the hastert plan has four elements according to the speakers press release an increase of 15 billion or more in the mandatory savings required to be achieved through the budget reconciliation process from about 35 billion for fy2006fy2010 to at least 50 billion for that period as well as the dollarfordollar offset of any new mandatory spending for disaster relief included in reconciliation legislation continued restraint on discretionary spending including an additional acrosstheboard cut in discretionary spending for fy2006 packages of additional rescissions to further help offset reconstruction costs and 19 hurricane katrina made landfall in louisiana mississippi and alabama on august 29 2005 after impacting florida on august 25

elimination through deauthorization of programs already zeroed out in the current appropriations process21 as announced by the speaker the plan did not indicate what portion or amount of costs would be offset the speakers press release stated that first step in implementing the plan could be the consideration of revised budget resolution for fy200622 house action on revised budget resolution tentatively was scheduled for thursday october 20 but action was postponed and was not rescheduled23 the house and senate budget committees may mark up the budget resolution for fy2007 as early as march 2006 in some past years the budget resolution has included revised figures for the fiscal year in progress according to an assessment made by the senate budget committee on january 18 2006 the fiveyear costs stemming from these measures covering fy2006 fy2010 are estimated at 98921 billion most of the relief costs 623 billion are attributable to two emergency supplemental appropriations acts pl 10961 and pl 10962 the senate budget committees assessment does not reflect several measures still pending in the house or senate or expected to be considered at later time these measures could increase the costs for hurricanerelated relief by tens of billions of dollars in the meantime seven of the eight house committees were informed by the republican leadership that they should work toward achieving in the aggregate an additional 15 billion in fiveyear savings through their reconciliation recommendations although the increased savings amounts for each committee were not announced officially media reports indicated that the house ways and means and education and workforce committees were expected to achieve most of the increased savings roughly an additional 7 billion and 5 billion respectively24 by informal agreement the schedule of reconciliation actions in the house was delayed to accommodate these developments in the senate the republican leadership announced its support for enacting offsets but did not specify comprehensive plan to do so or indicate any intent to consider revised budget resolution on september 12 senate majority leader bill frist and senate

sent letters to the chairmen of nonreconciled committees encouraging them to find savings within their committees jurisdiction as well26 specific amounts of additional savings for the committees were not identified in the correspondence as discussed in the next section the spending reconciliation bills reported by the house and senate budget committees proposed net savings substantially greater than were required but the savings were scaled back somewhat during further legislative action according to cbo the net savings over five years attributed to the conference agreement on the spending reconciliation bill amount to 39523 billion assuming the correction of two apparent drafting errors which is nearly 5 billion more than required under the reconciliation instructions in the fy2006

executive branch shall construe such provisions in manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the president to supervise the unitary executive branch and to recommend for congressional consideration such measures as the president shall judge necessary and expedient36 at the same time dispute arose regarding an apparent clerical error in the measure and its impact on the status of the deficit reduction act of 2005 as public law the issue pertains to section 5101 of the act which deals with rental reimbursement periods for durable medical equipment under medicare section 5101a provides for 13month period for certain durable medical equipment such as wheelchairs and section 5101b provides for 36month period for oxygen equipment37 apparently due to clerical error the engrossed senate amendment mistakenly referred to 36month period in section 5101a which the house agreed to without correction in the course of enrolling the measure for the president the erroneous reference to 36month period in the subsection was corrected to reflect 13month period according to the congressional budget office net medicare savings would be reduced by about 2 billion over fiveyear period fy2006 fy2010 if the rental reimbursement period under section 5101a were extended to 36 months38 due to concerns regarding the apparent clerical error the senate on february 8 passed

reflecting the intent of the congress in enacting the bill into law39 the house has not considered sconres 80 white house spokesman scott mcclellan in the daily press briefing on february 13 indicated

further cbo noted that the conference agreement contains as determined by the jct two unfunded privatesector mandates involving repeal of the fsceti grandfather rule and an amendment to the section 911 housing exclusion as well as an intergovernmental mandate pertaining to withholding on certain government payments in section 511 which exceed annual cost thresholds established in the unfunded mandates reform act the conference agreement recommends significant revenue reduction beyond the fiveyear budget window fy2006fy2020 encompassed by the reconciliation instructions principally with respect to extensions of current capital gains and dividends provisions through december 31 201064 the senates byrd rule section 313 of the congressional budget act of 1974 prohibits the consideration of reconciliation legislation that increases the deficit beyond the budget window the prohibition is enforced by point of order in the senate which requires the affirmative vote of threefifths of the members 60 senators if seats are vacant to waive past taxcut reconciliation acts have included sunset provisions in order to comply with the byrd rule but the conference agreement on hr 4297 includes offsets of the revenue losses instead the jct estimates the total revenue loss over ten years fy2006fy2015 at 69084 billion an amount nearly 900 million smaller than the fiveyear revenue loss on may 9

increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 consists of five titles as shown in table 16 the changes made by the act involve the extension and modification of certain provisions including reduced rates on capital gains and dividends increased expensing for small business and exceptions under subpart f regarding taxation of controlled foreign corporations title i various other

act is expected to lead to net revenue reductions ranging from 6765 billion to 23231 billion per year during the fy2006fy2010 period see table 16 in total net reductions in revenues are estimated to amount to 69960 billion over five years and 69084 billion over ten years fy2006 fy2015 the net revenue reduction expected over ten years is less than the net revenue reduction expected over five years by 876 million because the act increases revenues modestly by between 85 million and 423 million in each of the last five years covering fy2011fy2015 consequently prohibitions against incurring

2006 debtlimit reconciliation legislation neither the house ways and means committee nor the senate finance committee scheduled any meetings to consider debtlimit reconciliation legislation on november 15 2005 the treasury department indicated that the level of public debt subject to the statutory limit had exceeded 8 trillion for the first time 800260700000068 in view of the pattern of monthly deficits and surpluses in the last several years the current limit of 1184 trillion was expected to suffice into about the middle of the first quarter of calendar year 2006 in letter to senate majority whip mitch mcconnell dated december 29 2005 treasury secretary john w snow indicated that the debt limit would become insufficient in midfebruary 2006 and that all available prudent and legal actions to finance government operations within that limit would be exhausted by mid march69 thus by using various financing techniques that have been employed in the past the treasury department was expected to be able to cope with an insufficient debt limit for about month before defaulting on government obligations70 in addition to the reconciliation process the house and senate may use other procedures to develop and consider debtlimit legislation71 pursuant to house rule xxvii the gephardt rule hjres 47 was deemed to have passed the house automatically on april 28 2005 in conjunction with house approval of the conference report on the fy2006 budget resolution the measure proposed an increase of 781 billion in the statutory debt limit to 8965 trillion the same increase recommended
