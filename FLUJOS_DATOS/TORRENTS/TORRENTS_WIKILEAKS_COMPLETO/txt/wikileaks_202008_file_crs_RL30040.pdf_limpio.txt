taxes innovation and growth summary the growth effect of cutting capital gains taxes on innovation where lowe r capital gains taxes may encourage investment in new hightech firms has been subject of continued interest recent congressional budget office study whil concluding limited and unc ertain effect on growth induced by capital gains tax cuts through normal savings and investment channels noted lack of evidence on th effect through new firm formation the belief on the part of many venture capital advocates tha t the capital gains tax plays an important role developed because the slump and recovery in the ventur capital market in the seventies and early eighties was associated with rise and fall in the capital gains tax more recent evidence however indicates that there is n apparent relationship between venture capital investments and the capital gains tax there are several reasons why the effect of capital gains taxes on growth through investment in firms would be expected to be small first most capital gains accrue to mature firms and real estate only small share is associated with small and new firms most f ormal venture capital is provided by institutional investors not subject to the capital gains tax secondly capital gains tax cut will not specifically favo r this type of investment but will benefit wide range of investment opportunities indeed it could actually discourage such investment by reducing the presen t differential tax benefit for new stock issues nor is the capital gains tax likely to be an efficient mechanism to encourage acquisition of skilled executives through stock options since these stock options are often not subject to the capital gains tax an d since only tiny fraction of gains is associated with stock options it might be possible to devise more targeted provisions lthough such provisions tend to be complex and may themselves be relatively unsuccessful in stimulatin g investment this report will be updated as developments

act of 1998 august 1998capital gains taxes innovation and growth one issue ofte n raised with respect to the growth effect of cutting capital gains taxes is the effect on innovation this effect on innovation is often suggested s occurring through two mechanisms the first and most important one is i n encoura ging venture capitalists to invest in new hightech firms the second i s through attracting talented individuals to new ventures through stock options there is little empirical evidence regarding the link between taxation an d investment behavior most empirical evidence of aggregate savings suggests littl relationship between savings rates and the rate of return and economic theor suggests that increasing the rate of return can either increase or decrease savings1 it is very difficult to obtain clear evidence of the effects of capital gains taxes i n reallocating investment into venture capital indeed much of the capital mad available to new firms is of an informal type not easily identified or measured nor are there studies of the effects of capital gains taxes on stock options on the career choices of executives as result of this paucity of direct information the congressional budget office in its study of the macroeconomic effects of cutting capital gains taxes concluded that while the effects through savings were small and of uncertain direction the effect s through innovation were an open question 2 while uncertainties remain there are some ways to develop bette r understanding of the likely role of capital gains tax reductions on venture capital by interpreting available evidence in the framework of economic theory the nex t section outlines the basic venture capital process and what types of investment are involved the following sections discuss important empirical and theoretical issues relating to the effect of the capital gains tax on venture capital in particular three issues are discussed first the historical relationship between venture capital an d changes in the capital gai ns tax is discussed secondly the degree to which capital gains tax cut is or is not targeted to venture capital is addressed third sectio n incorporates this information into general framework for predicting the likely effects on venture capital of general cut in the capital gains tax targeted cut is als discussed the final section of the paper discusses stock optionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30040crs2 there are any number of articles and books describing this process see for example 3 william d bygrave and jeffrey timmons venture capital at the crossroads boston harvard business school press 1992 karl vesper new venture mechanics engelwoo d cliffs nj prenticehall 1993 jeffrey timmons new venture creation entrepreneurship for the 21 century 4 edition irwin burr ridge ill 1994st th vesper ibid p 1414 timmons new venture creation entrepreneurship for the 21 century op cit t5 st various points the author sugg ests that there is 50 to 80 billion in informal venture capital for the 35 billion of outstanding assets in venture capital firmsthe venture capital process it is useful prior to discussing the capital gains ta x to briefly describe the capital formation process for new firms individual entrepreneurs may turn to man y3 potential sources in raising capital for their enterprises most entrepreneurs initially rely on their own savings on bank loans and n friends and acquaintances survey by the national federation of independen t businesses indicated that 48 percent of fi nancing came from savings 29 percent from banks or other institutional lending 13 percent from fri ends 4 percent from individual investors and less than one percent from ventur capital firms of course the high4 tech firms that may be more associated with innovation typically need more capital and rely more heavily on equity capital from venture firms and other unrelate d investors successful firm eventually goes public that is issues stock fo r purchase by the general public in most cases nevertheless formal venture capital accounts for less than one percent of investment in the econ omy even in strong year and informal equity investments are estimated t be about twice the size of the formal investments 5 many authors of studies on the venture capital process emphasize that th informal investors generally have ties to the business that are not purely financial indeed entrepreneurs are urged to see k out business investors who bring more to the firm than fundsinvestors with contacts or other types of business expertise who can be more active partners wealthy investors may cho ose to invest firms in areas where they have particular knowledge often in their local community or region and i n industries where they worked or owned businesses the role of various financial sources is important because these less passiv sources of investment are probably less sensitive to taxes and more influenced by the nature of the business opportunity this issue is an important one to keep in mind since most of our data are on the formal venture capital funds if there is evidence that these firms are highly responsive to capital gains taxes then the question of th response by more informal sources of funds is clearly left open if however th evidenc does not support strong role for the capital gains tax in formal ventur capital arrangements then there may be little reason to expect that the tax wil l strongly influence these earlier stage investmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30040crs3 bygrave and timmons venture capital at the crossroads op cit pp 2622656venture capital and capital gains taxes the historical record for some time claim has been made that capital gains taxes have an important impact on venture capital as bygrav and timmons indicate this view was formed6 in large part because of the slump in venture capital after the increase in the capital gains tax in 1969 and its surge in the period around the tax cuts in 1978 and 1981 the author s note and this is confirmed in the data in table 1 that the rise in th capital gains tax rate enacted in 1986 for 1987 1988 and thereafter was t associated with decline in venture capital as share of total investment and that there is statistically significant correlation between lower capital gains taxes and venture capital investment share over time period that includes these later years the authors speculate on possible reasons for this lack of effect and one of them is the increase in the sha re of venture capital provided by institutional investors who are not subject to tax m ost formal venture capital investment is not associated with the capital gains tax in 1994 about 70 percent of venture capital was provided by pension funds foundations endowments and foreign i nvestors all groups not subject to any us income tax most of the remainder is supplied by insurance companies or other corporations not fully subject to tax or not subject to the individual income tax and thus to the individual capital gains tax overall only about 12 percent f formal venture capital investments are provided by individuals bject to the individual capital gains tax however the series in table 1 also examines venture capital provided b individuals as in the case of total ventur capital the expected response to the 1986 act did not occur although it was clear that capital gains taxes were rising venture capital investment shares rose in 1986 the year of enactment and in 1987 of course there may have been offsetting economic fa ctors however the same argume nts can be made about the effects of the 1969 and 1978 changes th principal influences on the level of venture capital as fraction of total investmen t appear to be factors other than capi tal gains taxes it is even less likely that these tax burdens affect informal investors or the entrepreneur himself or his friends an d relatives where the business or product idea of the person behind the enterprise is an important motivating factor the lack of visible relationship between the capital gains tax and venture capital in the aggregate data over time do not mean very much because there are so many other factors that could cloud s uch relationship it is probably impossible to obtain any meaningful empirical evidence from the data however as discussed in th following section the lack of such relationship is also consistent with theoretica l insights into the link between general capital gains t ax reduction and venture capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30040crs4 table 1 formal venture capital as percent of total investment and the capital gains tax rate 19781995 year

jane gravelle and kent sce pters dynamic tax models why they do the9 things they do national tax journal vol 50 september 1997 pp 657682 for brief continueda recent study by gompers and lerner examined the determinants of aggregate venture capital over the period 1972 to 1994 and found negative relationshi p between capital gains tax rates and venture capital investment however they found this effect was statistically significant only for and most powerful for investment s made by pension funds the investors that are not affected by the tax rate 7 the authors suggest that this tax relationship may derive from the demand side individual entrepreneurs altered their investment due to capital gains taxes an d demanded more financing this argument is not very persuasive from theoretical standpoint because as discussed above an entrepreneur has the least substitutable alternatives and should be much less sensitive to taxes than passive investors 8 more likely explanation is that there is some other factor driving this result one problem with the study was the tax rate used as noted above when the capital gains tax was raised prospectively in 1986 venture capital commitments went up the authors do not use the expected capital gain s tax rate but the current lower tax rate which would have contributed to the negative relationship they found i n addition in 1994 the capital gains tax was reduced for small business investment s held for five ye ars in this case the authors used prospective rates and this tax rate decrease coincided with rise in venture capital but there are many limits on th application of this tax rate it does not apply to shares in limited partnerships th commo n form of venture capital investments but only to corporate stock and fo r entrepreneurs the demand side there are number of restrictions including limits on the amount of gain relative to basis that can be eligible for relief that make th provision less important because of the small number of observations and th importance of these particular years usin g different capital gains tax rates might have significantly altered their results how targeted is the capital gains tax to venture capital the lack of rela tionship between venture capital as percent of investment and the capital gains tax rate should not be surprising given that the capital gains ta x applies to broad array of investments the vast majority of the capital gains ta x arises from gains on assets that are not associated wit h venture capital thus cutting the capital gains tax is not welltargeted approach and should not be expected t have much of an effect in incre asing the share of investment going to venture capital not does it seem likely th at venture capital increases because total savings increases given the lack of theoretical or empirical evidence for such an aggregate effect 9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30040crs6 continued9 survey of this evidence much of the capital gains tax

industries that ar unlikely to be involved in significant amounts of innovation since much of th remaining activity is also in areas not considered hightech such as services only small proportion of capital gains on corporate stock is likely to be associated with profit from newer hightech firms that are more likely to be associated wit h innovation firms with assets of less than 50 million that

approximately one percent of invest ment the numbers from this survey tend to be larger than those reported by the venture capital annual review which covers commitments t formal venture capital funds by limited partners see appendix table 620 science an d engine ering indicators 1998 where venture capital according to that measure was 4 2 billion in 1995 the moneytree survey reported 62 billion

and 89 are in agriculture construction trade real estate and l services subchapter s corporations organized as corporations but taxed s partnerships for which separate data on industry classification are not available account for 20 percent of the total of subchapter s and partnership assets th distribu tion of subchapter s corporate activities is likely similar to that of smal l corporations and partnerships these data ggest that only small fraction of investment and small fraction of capital gains are associat ed with investment in new innovative firms most capital gains taxes are associated with real estate mature corporate firms or new businesses that are unlikely to be associated with innovation of course some small firms will grow to be larg ones however the small role played by venture capital in general as documented in table 1 and from other sources also indicates that only small share of capital gains are associated with this purpose in 1997 f ormal venture capital was responsible for 115 billion of investmen t according to the moneytree survey report which tends to report slightly highe r amounts of venture capital than the source us ed for the series in table 1 and thus is an upper bound investment since total investment was 11730 billion venture capital11 is only 1 percent of total investment moreover as noted in the previous section only small share 12 percent of this formal venture capital investment comes from individuals of course there is also more informal venture capital which as suggested earlier may be about twice th size of formal venture capital suggesting an investment share of slightly over tw percent for individuals subject to the capital gains tax while it is impossible t pinpoint the exact share of the capital gains tax derived from venture capital r investment in new enterprises it is clear that the share is very small the fact that capital gains taxes cover wide range of investments other tha n venture capital has important implications even if the capital gains tax plays role in increasing the amount of venture capit this approach is relatively inefficient for every dollar of capital gains tax reduction less than five cents is likely to b associated with venture capital httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30040crs8 this would be tr ue in the case of the trapped equity or new view of dividends see m12 kevin mcgee capital gains taxation and new firms investment national tax journal vol 60 december 1998 pp 653 671 this view assumes that the dividend tax is irrelevant to funds obtained from retained earnings because the dividend tax is saved in the short run although paid in the future and that only the capital gains tax matters for these investments note however that many economists do not find the new view persuasive because f certain inconsistencies with observed firm behavior the capital gains tax reduces both expected return and the variation in return so tha t13 investors could find it desirable to decrease the share of risky investment in their portfoli when taxes are lowered so as to restore the mean and variance of return the major caveat to this apparently unexpected result is the lack of full loss offset which means that losse s cannot always be fully deducted in the year incurred the effective tax rate is the pretax real return r minus the aftertax real return r divided14 by the pretax real return the formula used is r lne 1ttpt where p is th erpt inflation rate t is the holding period and t is the tax rate the nominal return is the rea l return plus the inflation rate see jane g gravelle the economic effects of taxing capital income cambridge ma15 continuedthe lack of targeting also suggests that capital gain s tax cut is unlikely to have very much effect on diverting funds into venture capital out of other uses since so many other types of investments are also ffected by the capital gains tax there is not much particular benefit for investment in new firms cut in the capital gains ta x would favor all for ms of equity investment in corporate stock as well as partnership interests and investment in real estate more of the return to an investment in new venture may accrue in the form of capital gain than is the case for stock of more mature firms where dividends are paid and investments in real estate where rents are received there are som offsetting effects however that make it unclear as to the degree of relative benefi t received by venture capital thro ugh lower capital gains taxes certain theories of the firm and why they pay dividends would predict that the capital gains tax is mor important for invest ment in mature firms rather than new firms risk analysis does12 not clearly indicate that raising taxes will reduce investment in risky enterprises 13 moreov er for enterprises that are expected to yield high return there i s already builtin tax benefit in the deferral aspects of the capital gains tax fo r example with 2 percent inflation rate and 10 percent minal return an asset held for seven years will b subject to an effective tax rate of 19 percent with statutory rate of 20 percent if the expected return is 20 percent the effective tax rate is 13 percent the effective tax rate falls because the advantage of deferring taxe s becomes greater with the larger rate of return thus while capital gains tax cut14 would reduce the tax burden proportionally the tax burdens on assets with capital gainsintensive returns are smaller to begin with and the tax less important as share of return there is little other direct evidence about portfolio substitution amon g investments however most evidence on the substi tutability between debt and equity suggests relatively modest substitution eff ect new study

is anecdotal taxes received virtually mention in recent text on new enterprises indeed the au thor stressed finding equity investors whose17 interests were in the enterprise itself rather tha n financial return and who could bring additional expertise into the business eg contacts business acumen finally there is currently prov ision that allows for fifty percent exclusion for gains on stock invested in certain small corporations gains taxes may be deferred if reinvested th is provision is limited to stock originally issued by corporation with less than 50 million in assets engaged in an active business and excludes firms i n certain types of industries finance insurance farming extraction and certain types of services indeed this provision which was enacted in 1993 was explicitl directed at new innovative firms the rollover provision was adopted in 1997 lowering the capital gains tax will reduce the relative advantage held by these assets and could discourage investment in the form of purchases of new stock issues of course it would be possible to design more targeted capital gains tax cut that goes beyond this current exclusion for small busines s stock issues how effective such targeted incentive would be is difficult to determine given the paucity f information most formal venture capital would not be affected by even targeted tax cut since most suppliers are not subject to the tax in formal investors and friends and acquaintances wh supply seed money for new ventures may be less sensitive to financial return because they are influenced more heavily by other factors that is they would see alternative investments as less perfect substitutes and would b expected to be less sensitive to changes in financial returns targete d tax subsidies while they have more bang for the buck would b more difficult to administer especially in the case of capital gains tax reductio n where there is lag between purchase and sale upfront investment incentives r

f22 economic research working paper 6467 march 1998how desirable is reallocating investment to risky enterprises many of the arguments for increasing investment in venture capi tal or other high tech enterprises presume that shifting investment into these operations is desirable new enterprise s for example are identified as creating jobs and innovating earning higher rates of return timmons for example reports that new firms ar e18 respons ible for 68 percent of job growth and 50 percent of new innovations moreover it is generally recognized that the return to society on innovations is high and that society tends to underinves t in rd however new enterprises also fail at19 much higher rate almost quarter 24 fail within two years over half 52 fail within four years and 63 fail within six years 20 thus the tradeoff for obtaining these higher returns is risk it is not clear however that it is desirable for tax policy to intervene by altering that riskretur n ratio if the social benefits exceed the private benefits then it would be appropriate to induce more risktaking and higher private returns through tax subsidies however it has t been clearly demonstrated that new business enterprises generate suc h externalities or that these externalities outweigh other costs for example hig h failure rate has consequences not only for investors who may lose some or all of their investment but also for employees who work at more risky jobs stock options another although less important route through which capital gains ar sometimes argued to affect entrepreneurship new firm formation and innovation i s through capital gains taxes on stock ptions these tax benefits are argued to attract skilled managers and highlevel employees there are two important reservations about this argument first many stoc k options now granted executives are nonqualified options which are not subject t the capital gains tax capital gains taxes do apply to qualified options but there are many restrictions on the use of these options21 secondly as in the case of stock of new firms in general these types of stoc k options are very small part of the capital gains tax executive stock options ar estimated at about onehalf of one percen t of all shares outstanding and since many22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30040crs11 of these re nonqualified and many are for mature firms very little of the revenu loss from capital gains tax cut would accrue to these purposes conclusion the pattern of venture capital provided over time does not support strong role for capital gains tax this absence of empirical relationships could be due to other influences however economic theory and anal ysis supports the view that general capital gains tax cut is poorly targeted and ineffe ctive incentive to investment in small innovative firms while more targeted cut might be more effective even targeted capita l gains tax r eduction may not have much of an effect on venture capital commitments that are driven largely because of expectations of economic profitability and close association with the entrepreneur or with the particular type of innovation suc h targeted tax cuts are also difficult to administer and it may be that better alternative would be nontax subsidy or different type of tax subsidy
