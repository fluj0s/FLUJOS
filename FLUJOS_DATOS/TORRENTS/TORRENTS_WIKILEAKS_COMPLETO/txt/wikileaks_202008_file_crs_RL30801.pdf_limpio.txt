as discussed below marriage tax penalty legislation hr 2488 included provisions addressing the marriage penalty the original house bill included only an increase in the standard deduction for joint returns to twice the size of the those of single returns most of the reductions in the bill were acrosstheboard rate cuts the senate opted for optional separate filing the final bill approved by both houses would have increased the standard deduction for married couples to an amount equal to twice the standard deduction for singles and would also have increased the width of the 15 rate bracket for joint returns to twice thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30801crs3 of single returns the bill would also raise the income phaseout limit in the earned income tax credit by 2000 for joint returns these

there was some criticism of these bills by democrats including considering the bill in isolation from other tax provisions and before the budget resolution was developed and providing tax cuts to couples with marriage bonuses in the house democrats proposed to increase the standa rd deduction but not the rate bracket which would target lower income couples it would also adjust the alternative minimum tax amtto allow the full benefits of the tax cut and allow an eventual 2500 increase in the phaseout of the earned income tax credit democrats have also proposed optional separate filing estate and gift taxes on june 9 2000 the house approved hr8 bill to repeal the estate and gift tax by 2010 this bill would cost 28 billion over the next five years but the cost would rise rapidly hr 8 was approved by the senate on july 19 the president indicated that he would veto hr 8 and did so on august 31 but said he might support less expensive relief provision the veto was sustained in the house on september 7 the estate and gift tax bill hr 8 would have converted the unified credit into an exemption in 2001 and repeal tax rates in excess of 53 and the 5 surtax in 2002 all rates in

be repealed entirely in 2010 state death tax credits would be reduced in proportion to the estate and gift tax reductions from 20032009 this proposal would cost 283 billion over five years but the treasury department estimated that the annual cost would be 50 billion by 2010 democratic alternative would have reduced estate and gift tax rates across the board by 20 created 2 million exclusion for farms and closely held businesses and allowed any portion not used in the estate of one spouse to be allowed in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30801crs4 estate of the second spouse and increased the

17 overview of the 1999 general tax cut hr 2488 both house ways and means chairman archer and senate finance chairman roth proposed major tax packages in 1999 the house plan originally estimated to cost 864 billion over 10 years was scaled down to 792 billion the same as the cost of the senate plan the house approved the bill on largely partyline vote on july 22 the senate bill was approved by 57 to 43 vote on july 30 the conference committee completed consideration on hr 2488 on august 3 the house and senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30801crs7 approved the bill on august 5 the senate by onevote margin the house along party lines the president vetoed the bill on september 23 the conference committee compromised between the house rate cut 10 acrosstheboard cut and the senate rate reduction reduction in the 15 rate to 14 in the lowest rate bracket and an expansion of the new 14 bracket by reducing taxes one percentage point across all tax rates however this tax cut would have sunsetted after 2008 in the case of the marriage penalty they included the increase in standard deduction for joint returns in the house bill and also increased the width of the new 14 bracket for joint returns the latter provision also sunsetted in 2008 several other provisions would also have sunsetted before the end of the budget window chairman archers original proposal was passed by the ways and means committee on july 15th concern that the 864 billion cost was not in compliance with the budget resolution resulted in proposal to cut back the provisions as part of the rule there had been some uncertainty about whether tax cut of this size wouldl pass the house given reservations by some republicans and trigger provision was added to delay the acrosstheboard tax cuts if interest on the public debt rose there were also some concerns by other republican members that the bill did not fully address the marriage penalty senat or roths proposal the taxpayer refund act of 1999 s 1429 was approved on july 21 by the finance committee with minor amendments among them permanent extension of the rd tax credit the senate passed the plan as their version of h r 2488 on july 30 with some amendments most of them minor one amendment would however allow deduction for the first 1000 of capital gains as the result of procedural vote relating to budget rules the senate tax cut would expire in 2009 house democrats had offered smaller plan and the president indicated willingness to support 250 billion cut the treasury had projected that the cost of the ways and means committee bill would explode in the second 10 years senate finance committee democrats proposed tax cut of 290 billion which was defeated bipartisan plan costing 500 billion senators breaux kerrey chafee jeffords and others was withdrawn this proposal would allocate 283 billion to an increase in the standard deduction eliminating the marriage penalty for taxpayers with lower and moderate incomes plan by senators gramm lott and others which was similar to the house bill failed to gain the 60 votes needed to set aside budgetary point of order several other proposals were also defeated on procedural votes the house and senate plans differed in some fundamental ways the largest elements in both bills were the rate cuts the general rate reductions in the house bill cost more than in the senate bill and by the year 2009 the annual cost would have been twice as large as that in the senate bill 112 billion versus 47 billion if the expansion of the 14 rate for joint returns is included and 112 billion versus 27 billion if the expansion of the bracket is excluded the senate version targeted larger share of its benefits to middle income taxpayers and to married couples including rate changes for all marriage penalty relief the house bill would have cost 117httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30801crs8 billion in 2009 while the senate bill would have cost 96 billion revenue estimates do not allow these distinctions for the conference agreement but in 2008 before the sunset there would have been 57 billion revenue loss from the percentage point rate reduction plus an increase in the 14 bracket for nonjoint returns that accounted for about 13 billion of the total increases in the standard deduction and the size of the first bracket for joint returns to make them twice the size of singles would have added 28 billion for total of 85 billion the conference agreement would have been subject to sunset provisions which automatically sunset in 2009 due to procedural budget rule in addition number of provisions are terminated in 2008 which is not budget rule requirement there was also trigger similar to that in the house bill all revenue effects reported below are for fiscal years 19992009 and are based on the joint tax committees estimates conference report percentage point rate reductions including the alternative minimum tax or amt and increasing the width of the 14 bracket with greater increases for married couples and increas in the standard deduction for joint returns would cost 399 billion marriage penalty relief for the earned income credit would cost 4 billion the dependent care credit would be increased 5 billion the individual amt would be modified to allow immedi ately the use of personal credits and would be phased out 103 billion but sunset would occur in 2008 savings incentives include reduction in long term capital gains tax rates from 20 and 10 to 18 and 8 and prospective inflation indexing after 2009 this prospective indexing led to behavioral responses causing 15 billion temporary revenue gain in 2001 for net cost of 32 billion sunset would occur in 2008 individual retirement contributions were increased gradually to 5000 with sunset in 2008 for cost of 27 billion other increases led to total of 67 billion for savings provisions pension plan revisions would cost 15 billion education provisions include expansion of education savings

be phased out 64 billion maximum capital gains tax rates would be cut from 20 to 15 and taxpayers in the 15 bracket would see their capital gains tax rates cut from 10 to 75 this revision would cost
