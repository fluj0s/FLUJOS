presidents 2003 proposal for dividend relief to eliminate double taxation of corporate source income including creating jobs suggestive of shortrun stimulative effect enhancing longterm growth and efficiency fairness and increasing the value of the stock market dividend relief was enacted on temporary basis in 2003 and was extended in 2006 elimination of the tax is focus of some tax reform proposals dividend relief was not considered in 2008 shortrun stimulus objectives often conflict with longrun growth because an increase in spending is needed to stimulate an underemployed economy in the short run while an increase in saving or labor supply is needed to increase longrun growth dividend relief proposal is less likely to stimulate shortrun demand than spending increase or some other tax cuts because it accrues to higher income individuals who may save larger fraction of the cut it is also unlikely that this saving effect will be quickly translated into investment spending indeed dividend relief could decrease spending by shifting assets out of direct investment in unincorporated business assets and housing and into financial assets the longerrun growth effects of the dividend proposal financed by debt and measured as changes in standard of living are likely negative and would become quite large over time if debt financed this analysis finds that reductions of 016 to 010 would occur after 10 years with 039 to 022 after 20 years only very large savings elasticities well out of the range of empirical evidence could induce growth that offset s deficit effects positive growth effects may occur if the cut is offset by spending cuts and the savings elasticity positive but such effects are small and require quick spending decrease in one simulation tax cut which increased the deficit for 10 years induced negative output effects for over 30 years economic analysis would reject fairness argument across investors because of reallocation of capital however reallocation is the key to achieving efficiency gains that are the main benefit of the dividend relief proposal the effects on the stock market are likely to be small with an upper limit of 5 to 6 but probably much less due to changes in interest rates and expectations of adjustment changes on the order of 2 to 3 may be more likely any stock market effects represent temporary windfalls to holders of current stocks and are simply manifestation of the income effects of the tax cut these wealth effects should not be considered as an additional stimulus there is little evidence of general effects on spending through consumer confidence and the effect is quite small to function as signal recent studies finding that dividends had increased substantially have been used to argue that the tax cut induced private savings this evidence does not appear robust and even if dividends increased there are obvious consequences for savings this report describes basic economic relationships and will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31824g6g146g159g146g141g142g151g141g561g22g138 g161g561g20g142g149g146g142g143g561 g561

dividend relief to eliminate double taxation of corporate source income including creating jobs which is suggestive of shortrun stimulative effect enhancing longterm growth and efficiency fairness and increasing the value of the stock market this report discusses these effects after providing general analysis of the effects of tax cuts on short and longrun growth the paper discusses three additional aspects of the proposed dividend revision reallocation of capital and its implications for fairness and efficiency tax exempt investments and preference passthrough restrictions and the role of the stock market dividend relief was enacted in 2003 in the jobs and growth tax reconciliation act pl 10827 and extended in the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act pl 109222 in 2006 the enacted version did not contain the preference passthrough limits but only partially cut dividend taxes by lowering the rate to 15 it also reduced capital gains tax rates to the same level these offsetting effects left the final version similar in overall magnitude to the presidents proposal although having somewhat different features the an alysis of the stimulus growth and efficiency effects performed originally for the presidents proposal should also reflect the general effects of the final enacted proposal presuming the tax cuts are expected to become permanent g21g145g152g155g157g556g20g158g151g561g21g157g146g150g158g149g158g156g561g138g151g141g561g14g152g151g144g556g22g142g155g150g561g9g155g152g160g157g145g561 one of the confusing aspects of economic policy is that policies that are effective for shortterm stimulus purposes tend to reduce longterm growt h spending promotes shortrun growth saving promotes longterm growth it is particularly rd to devise an individual tax cut that can accomplish its shortrun purpose effectively without undermining longterm growth absent some other future policy and while there may be circumstances where fiscal stimulus is desirable ie when interest rates are extremely low initially or contraction is severe many economists feel that the primary tool of economic stabilization should be monetary policy this view is reinforced by the leakage of fiscal stimulus but not monetary stimulus that occurs in an open economy g21g145g152g155g157g561g20g158g151g561 in the short run to stimulate the economy through fiscal policy requires an increase in spendingon consumption on investment or on government purchases the most direct way to accomplish this effect is through spending by the government spending increases add to the deficit and reduce the capital stock which can be harmful to longrun growth but if the spending increase is temporary this effect will be small the major problem with spending is that spending programs are often difficult to agree upon and put into place in timely fashion although if cutbacks are already planned delay of the cutbacks would be relatively easy emergency spending can also be wasteful and it may be difficult to reverse the spending increase in the future once groups have stake in it nevertheless stimulating the economy through increasing private incomes through transfers or tax cuts is likely to be less effective and more problematic than spending increases for two reasons first there is at least some reason to believe that much of temporary tax cut will not be spent initially but rather will be spread over long period of time permanent tax cuts or transfers which may be more successful in inducing spending add to the deficit every year and so reduce the longrun accumulation of capital reversing purportedly permanent tax cuts after granting them undermines the belief that tax cuts will be permanent and interferes with their s httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31824g6g146g159g146g141g142g151g141g561g22g138 g161g561g20g142g149g146g142g143g561 g561

fraction of income even permanent income and saving does not increase aggregate demand this effect is however probably not very important both of these problems are likely to be less serious with transfers or with tax cuts directed at lower income individuals who are more likely to be liquidity constrained in their spending and thus would spend all the tax cut and who tend to have lower savings rates in these cases tax cuts particularly temporary ones are likely to be more effective if directed at lower income individuals one of the potential ways to provide tax cuts that are effective stimulants without undermining longrun growth through deficit financing is to pr ovide investment incentives to firms if firms directly increase their investment in response to tax cut the induced private investment expands demand in the short run and also offsets the reduction in the capital stock tax subsidies for investment may not however work very well if firm s with excess capacity typical in sluggish economy cannot be easily encouraged to spend in this case however temporary tax cut is actually more effective than permanent one because it encourages firms to accelerate their capital investment program such temporary tax cut bonus depreciation was enacted in 2002 how does dividend tax reliefand specifically provision that provides dividend exclusion and future capital gains exclusion for earnings retainedfit into this standard analysis as permanent provision it is more likely to result in stimulus dividend relief tends to be directed at relatively high income individuals who are less likely to spend so it might be somewhat less effective than tax cuts aimed at lower income indivi duals if the tax cut induces an increase in the savings rate the stimulative effect would be smaller although the effect on the savings rate could go either way as discussed below nor is the tax cut likely to be very effective at inducing investment spending by firm for several reasons first the incentive is provided to the individual who receives the benefit rather than the firm this approach results in more indirect route to investment stimulus second even if the firm responds quickly on behalf of its shareholders this type of tax cut largely benefits earnings from existing capital and is one of the least effective tax cuts for encouraging investment spending 1 finally as discussed below in the section on portfolio shifts the reallocation effects of the relief could actually contract investment spending in the short run g14g152g151g144g556g20g158g151g561g9g155g152g160g157g145g561 in the long run the dividend relief proposal will succeed in increasing output and growth other than the modest effects associated with economic efficiency only if it increases personal saving by more than the revenue cost and accumulating interest on the debt2 it is theoretically possible for this effect to occur initially but most evidence does not support large savings response to tax rate changes indeed some evidence suggests that sa vings can fall as the rate of return rises due to wealth effects even large savings responses would eventually result in deteriorating capital 1 permanent investment stimulus eg accelerated depreciation would be more effective than rate cut per dollar of revenue loss because rate reduction provides more of its benefits for returns to the existing capital stock temporary investment stimulus would be more eff ective still but temporary rate cut coul d have perverse effects because it could actually increase effective tax burdens on new investment by reducing the value of accelerated depreciation 2 in an open economy government borrowing may be offset by foreign net capital inflows however that additional capital cannot contribute to the future standard of living of americans other than in minor way because it and its returns are owned by foreigners note also that the dividend exclusion plan does not apply to foreign shareholders and thus provides incentive for increases in foreign equity investment in the us however the provision does provide incentives for equity investment abroad by us firms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31824g6g146g159g146g141g142g151g141g561g22g138 g161g561g20g142g149g146g142g143g561 g561

dividend relief proposal would harm longrun growth as long as it is based on deficit finance to demonstrate the magnitude and potential direction of these growth effects we use neoclassical growth model with an endogenous savings rate the details of this model are presented in the appendix

elasticities for the first fifth tenth and twentieth year representing reasonable span of the empirical evidence on savings elasticities3 small and possibly negative elasticities are also theoretically consistent with offsetting income and substitution effects greater wealth from higher rates of return increase current consumption but cheaper price of future consumption reduces current consumption the estimates assume fixed labor supply also consistent with empirical evidence and cobb douglas production function rather than considering percentage changes in gdp measure reflecting standard of living effects is used income available for consumption after accounting for steady state investment necessary to sustain the capital stock at its current level this measure could loosely be interpreted as change in the sustainable standard of living4 the percentage change is similar to the percentage change in output as table 1 suggests the plans projected effects would be to reduce output by growing amount because the effect of the deficit on reducing the capital stock is larger than any induced savings response in none of these cases is the effect on private saving large enough to offset the contraction in capital the effects are actually quite small an outcome that is not surprising because the dividend relief proposal is relatively small the negative effects continue to grow over time as deficits accumulate and eventually the model explodes as deficits displace the entire capital stock t able 1 p er centage incr ease in income available for consumption from dividend

relief plan can induce an increase in output this effect is more likely to occur when elasticities are positive and large although even with very large elasticities eventually the effect on output becomes negative another way to produce positive effect is to offset the relief plan with some offsetting spending reduction table 3 explores these effects with some very high savings elasticities and assumptions that either offset the deficit immediately or offset the deficit after 10 years higher elasticities can reduce the negative output effects but only very large elasticities clearly far out of the range of empirical estimates produce shortrun positive effects and these would also produce contractionary effects for shortrun stimulative purposes eventually the effects would turn negative even the elasticity of 3 has an effect that peaks at only 7100 of 1 after about 20 years and becomes negative after 50 years table 3 also examines assumptions that the deficit will be offset by spending decreases in one case immediately and in the other after 10 years eliminating the deficit through spending offset would increase output although the amount is likely to be small for reasonable elasticities eliminating the deficit after ten years with an elasticity of 02 however produces contractions in output for 36 years

is simplified solow growth model with an endogenous savings rate which relies on reduced form empirical elasticities and assume myopia5 there are also models that are built up from consumers who maximize utility and are forward looking model that is currently in use is life cycle model6 forward looking models cannot be solved at all 5 reduced form estimates are derived from regressions of savings rates on observed returns and other variablesa reduced and simplified form of supply relationships that might be derived from an approach that begins with utility function for choosing between

budget deficit7 although behavioral responses are derived from econometric studies these models rely on many arbitrary assumptions that could greatly alter the outcome in particular they tend to have large income effects and have generally not been empirically tested for reduced form effects g17g159g142g155g138g149g149g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561g152g151g561g9g155g152g160g157g145g561 the estimates from these modeling simulations show that capital income tax cuts financed by government deficits induce negative effects on output in full employment model and that these negative effects get larger over time the initial effects in either direction are quite small reflecting the small size of the tax cuts and the slow adjustment of the capital stock however even if the deficit effects are offset under reasonable elasticities these negative growth effects appear for many years when gains to future wellbeing are appropriately measured such negative effects cannot be avoided with foreign capital inflows nor is the negative effect an artifact of the type of model such effects would also occur with more sophisticated life cycle models as well thus economic benefits of debtfinanced dividend relief proposal must be sought elsewhere the next section turns to the classic argument for corporate tax integration

might not increase private savings and it will contract the capital stock if it is financed by debt but it should also alter the allocation of savings from other uses into the stock market capital may be withdrawn from debt including tax exempt debt investment in unincorporated business or in owner occupied housing this induced allocation of savings has certain effects in the short run as well as the long run that might be considered in the short run the reallocation of assets could undermine the effects of the dividend relief provision as stimulus if assets are moved from actual physical investment such as investments in housing consumer durables and unincorporated business assets the reallocation of capital out of debt and into equity which would have the effect of raising interest rates depressing bond and housing prices and increasing stock market va lues could also undermine the stimulus effect if firms are more sensitive to the effects of interest rates on their investment plans than they are to stock prices in the long run the reallocation of assets has important implications for two issues closely associated with corporate tax relief fairness and economic efficiency although references have been made to the unfairness of the double tax this argument is not generally made by economists heavier tax on one type of investment leads to changes in investor behavior investors withdraw from the he avily taxed sector and invest in the more lightly taxed sector the result of this process is that aftertax returns net of risk are equated since investors are free to invest in any type of asset there is inequity across taxpayers based merely on where they invest there is however inefficiency because heavily taxed assets must earn higher return before tax than lightly taxed investments 7 see crs report rl32517 distributional effects of taxes on corpor ate profits investment income and estates by jane g gravelle for more detailed discussion of the issues

standpoint because higher income individuals receive more of the benefits from the tax cut8 moreover merely changing tax provision actually induces some unfairness across current investors because it provides the taxpayers holding the assets whose taxes are reduced in this case investments in stocks with windfall gains and those holding disfavored assets with windfall losses for dividend relief these windfall gains are captured in stock market effect which is subject for discussion below the classic economic argument for eliminating double taxation or more generally integration of corporate and individual income taxes has always been efficiency the current system creates number of economic distortions causing too little capital to be allocated to the corporate sector debt ratios that are too high and payout ratios th at are too low there is some dispute about the magnitude of efficiency gains but treasury using range of models and assumptions estimated gains that ranged from 011 to 053 of consumption in study of integration released in 1992 9 most of these efficiency effects would not appear in actual output increases but in more desirable allocation of consumer goods and more efficient allocation of risk however these improvements in welfare are represented as the equivalents of dollar increases in output and at 2001 income levels these amounts are between 8 billion and 37 billion these projected efficiency gains would take some period of time to occur as the capital stock shifted between sectors but would eventually offset some of the negative effects of diminished capital stock they would be permanent effects however nd would not prevent the eventually explosive effects of continual deficits these effects do not account for specific aspect of the dividend proposal that decreases its cost and may reduce the associated welfare gain the limit on preferences discussed in the next section

benefits are not available to taxexempt shareholders eg pension funds or foreign shareholders who do not pay us individual income tax over half of stockholders fall into this position10 secondly in the original proposal there was restriction on benefits for income that is not subject to tax because of tax preferences which probably reduced the tax cuts by around third11 the final provision enacted was of probably similar perhaps 8 see crs report rl31597 the taxation of dividend income an overview and economic analysis of the issues by gregg esenwein and jane g gravelle 9 us department of the treasury integration of the individual and corporate income tax systems taxing business income once jan 1992 the range represents differences in model assumptions about the substitutability of capital between sectors and how revenue would be made up through lump sum taxes or an overall increase in all capital gains taxes these effects would be smaller if trapped equity or new view of dividends is assumed an issue that will be discussed separately 10 see crs report rl31597 the taxation of dividend income an overview and economic analysis of the issues by gregg esenwein and jane g gravelle 11 tax expenditures are special deductions exclusions and credits that are considered to department from normal income tax in 2003 tax expenditures were about 65 of tax liability implying about 40 reduction in cost however because of the stacking of dividend relief first which is subject to higher taxes the reduction in revenue cost would be smaller by as much as half tax expenditures are little higher than average currently because of temporary expensing however the tax expenditure list may not include all subsidies

partially cut the dividend rate to 15 rather than eliminating the dividend ta x cutting the rate by slightly more than half for top rate taxpayers it also cut the capital gains tax rate these aspects introduce some uncertainty in general into the analysis of effects for example to the extent that taxexempt holdings are not marginal the effect on savings would be larger because the marginal effect would be larger than the average it is unlikely however that this effect would reverse the conclusions that the proposal will be contractionary for growth for modeling purposes if term were added for an additional marginal tax rate effect that doubles its size and substitution elasticity of 1 plus the base elasticity were used in the growth model discussed above see discussion in appendix the effects even for the highest value in table 1 would be negligible in the first few years and still eventually turn negative reducing output by 002 in year 10 and by 021 in year 20 since tax exempt funds can make portfolio choices there is less reason to adjust efficiency effects discussed in the previous section or stock market effects to consider them inframarginal the second provision originally in the presidents proposal would have restricted tax benefits for income that is preferentially treated 12 it is always possible that such restrictions might be reconsidered in future proposals these provisions were designed to disallow dividend exclusions and increases in basis for income that has not been subject to tax there are many implications of these provisions while these provisions would not drive potential wedge between average and marginal tax rates as in the case of the tax exempt investors they make the interpretation of welfare gains more problematic to the extent that they preserve differential treatment between corporate and noncorporate investment debt and equity and payout functions compared to provision that did not limit tax benefits they lower the welfare gains of corporate tax integration if they discourage activities that were desirable to encourage the effect would also be to lower welfare gains however if they discourage activities that were not desirable to encourage the effect would be to raise welfare gains whatever the net effect of the preference passthrough provision better approach if preferences were viewed as undesirable would be to repeal them outright as this provision preserves the benefits for unincorporated business investment and debt finance but not for corporate equity investment these two aspects of the proposal might also have interacted there are incentives for tax exempt investors to shift to firms that have lot of preferences and taxable investors to shift to firms with few preferences which could result in larger tax cut and larger cost g22g145g142g561g21g157g152g140g148g561g15g138g155g148g142g157g561 there has been considerable discussion of the effect of the dividend relief on the stock market certainly the decline in the stock market during the time the proposal was formulated caused losses to the financial assets of many individuals although many observers believed that stock values were overpriced and that the market would eventually have to decline some arguments incorporate increasing investor or consumer confidence which suggests shortrun stimulus objective 12 for an analysis of this provision see crs report rl31782 the effect of the presidents dividend relief proposal on corporate tax subsidies by gregg esenwein and jane g gravelle

important price signal mediating between investors and firms to undertake permanent tax change for the purpose of influencing the stock market price is an objective not easy to justifyparticularly since it cannot be done second time the principal justification for focusing on this value is an expectation that the rise in the stock market would spur spending in the short run increases in stock market values are thought to increase spending through wealth effect although both theory and empirical evidence suggest the wealth effect on consumption is small13 in theory however rise in the stock market induced by tax cuts reflects the windfall gains that accrue to investors who already hold an asset and arise from the need for time to adjust portfolios and capital stocks in response to the tax change the rise is simply manifestation of part of the income effect that should already be considered in evaluating any economic stimulus and therefore should not be considered as having separate stimulative effect on the economy unless investors are not rational if adjustment were instantaneous the stock markets value would never change at least under traditional views of dividends the larger the stock market price effect the smaller the economic efficiency benefits to reallocating capital that are the principal justification for corporate tax integration moreover the rise in the stock market does not simply appear by magicit arises out of shifts in supply and demand as do any other prices in the economy if savings and portfolio allocations were fixed changes in the value of the stock market would occur and stockholders would simply earn higher rate of return if the stock market does rise it is also important to recognize the processes that lead to that increase and their consequences for shortrun effects on demand individuals may be saving more which is contractionary or they may be shifting out of other assets which can be contractionary if coming from physical investment and raise interest rates if coming from bonds the rise in interest rates will contract investment spending financed from debt if corporate firms are to increase their equity investment they must either retain more earnings which reduces dividends available for other spending or they must increase the supply of stock shares by issuing stock or reducing repurchases this increase in stock shares will push stock prices back down somewhat and the increase in investment will ultimately drive down returns per share it is possible that rise in the stock market could result in an increase in business or consumer confidence that could separately produce an economic stimulus some research in this area has suggested that such an effect on consumers is not very likely since the run up in the stock market in the 1990s seemed to primarily manifest itself in the increased spending of higher income individuals who own stock 14 moreover businesses particularly sophisticated firms would likely be aware of the link between tax cuts and wealth but in any case if there is relationship it presumably would depend on the magnitude of expected effectsthey should be large enough to 13 see james m

when the dividend proposal was initially introduced potential effects on the stock market of up to 20 which would be significant were mentioned15 two other estimates of the effect one provided by the administration at 10 and one estimated by mit economist james poterba of 5 to 6 were reported in wall street journal article 16 the proposal also includes reductions in capital gains taxes on income retained in the firm this section examines the value of 56 proposed by poterba where underlying data are presented to support the calculation the analysis suggests that this value is probably an upper limit to the effect and the likely effect would be much less perhaps more than 1 or 2 certainly the effect is likely to be small compared to normal fluctuations in market values there are explanations of the source of the 10 estimate but poterba provides the basics for his calculation which is very straightforward estimate of the present value of the tax cut divided by the value of the stock market his calculation appears to be of the form change in stock value tax cut discount stock value there are four issues that affect this percentage the size of the tax cut the discount factor the current value of the stock market and whether the formula itself which reflects full and permanent expected capitalization effect is complete we consider each factor in turn

2003 according to an administration document issued on january 7 2003 this number is however somewhat understated for capitalizing over time because the proposal includes not only dividend relief but also basis adjustment that will reduce tax revenue later only small share of this basis adjustment is included in the first year cost there may also be some slight difference because of accruals versus collections to correct for the first the estimated costs would increase to about 25 billion were the full effects of basis adjustment to be 15 see can dividend tax cut juice growth business

then discounted at some rate of return in order to create present value poterba estimates the present value of the stream of tax cuts to be 500 billion to 650 billion in growing economy one would normally think that dividends and tax payments would grow at the growth rate of the economy as well as being discounted at some aftertax equity return thus we can think of the discount factor as being r g where r is the after tax required rate of return of the investor and g is the growth rate the difference between the two should also reflect the current after tax earnings as percentage of asset value by working backward we can determine this discount factor to be 004 26650 and 0052 26500 this range of values is reasonable 18

value was estimated at 122 trillion 19 which leads to range of percentage appreciation derived from the tax cut of about 41 to 53 using poterbas method slightly over week later on january 24 it had fallen to about 116 trillion poterba appears to be using value of around 10 trillion to 11 trillion which is lower than these values but reasonable given the markets volatility in any case 5 to 6 stock market gain from the tax proposal is relatively small effect for example for the slightly over threemonth period from the end of september 2002 to midjanuary 2003 the market rose by 12 an effect over twice the size of the estimated stock market effect of the dividend tax proposal the market fell by 5 from january 15 to january 24 period of 17 based on an average fiveyear holding period the current year cost for the basis adjustments effect on capital gains will be about fifth of the longrun effect however the capital gains tax is much lower than the dividend tax so its importance is somewhat diminished capital gains tax rates are around 18 gains for those in the 15 bracket are taxed at 10 if held for one year and 8 if held for five years otherwise gains are taxed at 20 if held for one year and 18 if held for 10 years if we cut the 18 rate in half to account for the fact that about half of gains are never realized and assume that the average marginal tax rate on ordinary income is around 30 the capital gains tax rate is about 30 of the individual rate with about half of earnings paid out as dividends based on data for the last few years the permanent cost will bear the ratio of 05x030505x0 2x0305 or 123 this ratio suggests cost of 246 billion note when calculating dividend payout shares from the national income and product accounts it is important to subtract out from earnings and from dividends the significant amount of dividends paid by subchapter s corporations that do not pay the corporate tax there may also be some slight difference because of accruals versus collections 18 one can use either real or nominal values with 25 real growth rate the 4 value implies real return of 65 and nominal return of 8 with 25 inflation the 52 value implies return of 77 real and 102 nominal return with 25 inflation 19 this value is based on market value at the end of the 3rd quarter 2002 for the nasdaq new york stock exchange and amex 1717 trillion 9041

effect is about the same size as poterbas estimated stock market effect and it suggests that if poterbas calculation is correct the increased value is unlikely to have much effect on consumer or

in the market but there are two important reasons that this value is an upper limit20 the first and perhaps most important is that the higher returns in the stock market will attract money out of the bond market and raise interest rates the economic stimulus itself also increases interest rates by increasing the demand for money this increase in interest rates will have two effects that tend to lower the effect on the stock market the most important is that the expected after tax return that forms part of the discount factor is tied to interest rates and will rise even very small increases could eliminate most of the expected rise in stock prices for example 10 basis point change in the interest rate that increases it by 01 would reduce market values by 2 to 25 and would offset about half the estimated rise in value 21 change of slightly over 20 basis points would eliminate the effect completely even if this effect occurred only through the discount factor the higher interest rates will also however increase the cost of borrowing for firms and reduce cash flow which would also act to reduce stock market values if the supply of savings is fixed eg increased private savings does more than offset government borrowing to finance the tax cut there is new wealth in the economy in that case asset prices in the economy will quickly return to their equilibrium values as soon as individuals make their portfolio shifts out of bonds and into stocks which would presumably happen very quickly the interest rate would rise moreover some effect on corporate cash flow would occur as borrowing costs rose the offsetting of the price effect would appear more quickly if individuals are forwardlooking and expect intere st rates to rise that is if individuals have foresight and expect interest rates to rise they will take this expectation into account and alter their own discount rate for valuing stock immediatel even before portfolio shifts are complete or all debt has turned over if the savings rate increases there could be longer adjustment period but the rise in prices would be temporary that is because added investment would ultimately drive down the marginal return on capital if individuals are myopic there could be rise that will simply decline over time but if investors are rational and forward looking the expected change itself would moderate the initial rise the appendix shows how this adjustment process might occur when we hold the interest rate fixed if h is the fraction of the remaining difference between the new and old values of the marginal product of capital that is made in each period then the ratio of the actual percentage change assuming forward looking investors to the change as calculated above is discountdiscounth as shown in the appendix in the case for example where the dividend rate equals 04 and the fully capitalized effect is 53 if h 010 the actual effect will be only 20 under one theory about markets mainly that dividend taxes in excess of capital gains taxes are capitalized into asset values there is permanent rise in the stock market from repealing the dividend tax this view referred to as the trapped equity view and also the new view as opposed to the traditional view suggests that dividend taxes do not matter to investment behavior and will be discussed below 21 the ratio of new to old market value is rgrg01 where rg is the discount factor thus the price falls by 25 at 4 104041 and by 19 at 52 1052053 this calculation assumes an additive risk premium

the desired marginal product of capital is only about 4 or 5 this change is small one that could be expected to be adjusted to quickly there is one offsetting factor that could lead to small share of the market rise being permanent the possibility of permanent excess profits from market power if firm is earning excess profits because it has market or monopoly power that effect would have been capitalized into higher market value for stocks to use an extreme case if every firm were pure monopoly with demand characterized by linear demand curve only half of change in tax is passed on in price therefore one would expect that if the only adjustment that occurred was change in the marginal product of capital half the rise in the stock market would be permanent and using the example in the previous paragraph the initial effect might be 3 increase rather than 15 increase this effect is much too large however some of the adjustment is likely to take place in the discount rate in the denominator which exerts the same proportional effect regardless of market value pure unregulated monopolies largely dont exist in the united states and the passthrough becomes larger as the number of firms increase moreover in oligopoly models of any size price competition known as bertrand competition can lead to the same effects as perfect competition thus while the effects of market power are likely to slightly increase the initial price effect because some effects are permanent this effect is probably quite small

referred to as the trapped equity or new view although it is 25 years old that suggests dividend taxes in excess of capital gains taxes are irrelevant to investment behavior the entire stream of dividend taxes in excess of capital gains taxes under the proposal would show up as windfall to current stockholders if one holds this view the effects on the stock market should be larger however there would be little efficiency gain from the reallocation of capital for eliminating these taxes again belief in large permanent effect on the stock market is only consistent with belief that there is little to gain in efficiency effects from dividend tax relief as this section suggests howev er even this analysis suggests stock market increase of only 3 for tax that reduces both dividends and capital gains taxes the portion that reflects the excess of dividends over capital gains would be permanently capitalized assuming tax rate of 30 on dividends and 10 on capital gains and about half of income paid in each form about half the tax cut would be permanently capitalized to understand how this theory developed and what it means it helps to contrast it with the traditional view which underlies the analysis in the previous section in the traditional view of dividends the cost of capital is affected by both the dividend and capital gains tax rates the double tax on dividends causes inefficiencies and misallocation of capital away from corporate equity investment in the new view the dividend tax has effect on investment see appendix for mathematical derivation of this effect in the traditional view with perfect competition and without other tax subsidies the value of dollar of equity owned capital is equal to dollar of value in the stock market while stock market prices may rise initially they will eventua lly return to this equilibrium value as discussed above and expectations will limit the initial rise in the trapped equity view dividend taxes in excess of capital gains taxes which do not infl uence investment are windfall losses to the individuals who own stock when the dividend tax is imposed and are expressed in permanent

loss to current owners the actual supply and demand processes that accompany this effect are not clear one of the issues that spurred the development of the trapped equity theory was the fact that firms pay dividends even though they are more heavily taxed than capital gains to explain why firms pay dividends the traditional view of dividends requires that dividends have some value or be differentiated in some way from capital gains otherwise firms would never pay dividends and would distribute excess earnings by repurchasing stock several economic theories could motivate the payment of dividends the simplest is that dividend and capital gains income differ in important ways earnings from sales of assets fluctuate more and involve greater transactions costs than the receipt of dividends economists have also advanced notions dealing with imperfect information dividends are signal that the firm is doing well and principal agent problems dividends keep managers from divert ing or wasting too much of the earnings the original form of the trapped equity view was essentially an alternative way of explaining why firms pay dividends it is based on the notion that dividends are trapped in the firm and that earnings cannot be paid out to the shareholder in any other form ie share repurchases the dividend tax must be paid now or later with interest but cannot be avoided the idea is much like an that associated with an individual retirement account the problem of double taxation is much less severe because the cost of capital is affected only by the accrual equivalent capital gains tax rate which tends to be small because of lower rates deferral of tax and avoidance of tax if held until death assuming financing via retained earnings in the new view dollar of equity capital has value referred to as q of 1 θ1c where θ is the dividend tax rate and c is the capital gain tax rate this ratio occurs because the shareholder is indifferent between receiving dollar of dividends net of tax that is the cost of retaining earnings is 1 θ and retaining it in the firm where its value is the increase in value or q times 1c where c is the capital gains tax rate this formula may explain how some of the larger effects that might be expected on stock market values might have been calculated if dividend relief was provided for example if the dividend rate is 30 and the accrual equivalent capital gains tax is 10 an estimate that is consistent with evidence suggesting that close to half of capital gains are never taxed the value of the stock market is 103101 or 078 for each dollar of capital eliminating both taxes or reducing the dividend tax to 02 would permanently increase the value to 1 or almost 30 and thus it may not be surprising if the finding of evidence for the new view in academic research might have lead to the conclusion of 20 stock market effect these estimates are however likely to be overstated because large fraction of taxpayers more than half are not subject to taxes on dividends if weighted average is used the tax rates would be only about 40 as large so the effect on the stock market would be closer to 9 rising from 104x03104x01 or 0917 to 1 in the actual proposal of course dividend taxes would not be eliminated but would remain to the extent of preferences if preferences reduce the tax cut by third the new value would be 104x03x067104x01x067 or 0945 implying only 3 increase the trapped equity view at least in its pure original form has fallen out of favor somewhat for theoretical reasons one of the requirements for this pure form is that firms not be able to repurchase their own shares an option that has always been available in the united states and in fact has increasingly been used by firms another is that firms do not issue shares and pay httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31824g6g146g159g146g141g142g151g141g561g22g138 g161g561g20g142g149g146g142g143g561 g561

accommodate the repurchase of shares along with payment of dividends while modifications to the new view to make it consistent with observed share repurchases may succeed in maintaining the view that dividends are irrelevant to investment but tend to reduce the magnitude of the stock market effects one such approach is to make the dividend tax rate in the valuation formula weighted average of the dividend tax and the capital gains tax based on the ratios of dividends paid to share repurchases although even this view requires quite restrictive assumption of fixed proportion of repurchases and dividends there are some other conceptual problems that arise with the trapped equity view as well as number of attempts to address the issue through empirical studies 22

raj chetty and emmanuel saez24 hereafter the chettysaez study the other released by the securities industry association25 hereafter sia report the accf report argues that the evidence in these two studies shows that corporations increased dividend payments in response to the rate cut and that this response should stimulate more savings and investment this section discusses two issues the first is the evidence on the effect of the tax cut on dividend payments the second is the implication of this evidence for savings rates as discussed below the evidence from the recent updates of the national income and product accounts nipa does not appear to support significant response of dividend payouts to the dividend tax cut even they it did however there is reason to connect that dividend cut to savings and growth indeed as discussed above it appears unlikely that dividend tax cut financed by deficit increased saving in the economy the most certain route to increasing saving is probably to reduce the deficit 22 for an earlier and nonmathematical survey of this issue see george zodrow on the traditional and new views of dividend taxation national tax journal vol 44 part 2 dec

center for research on securities prices to examine dividends paid through the 1st quarter of 2004 while the authors found an increase in dividends paid they did not find the increase statis tically significant ie could not determine that the increase was not due to chance primaril because few firms in their sample greatly influenced the level of dividends they did find statistically significant increase in the number of firms initiating the payment of dividends the sia report does not provide statistical analysis the author reports evidence from standard and poors dividend record that indicates an increase in the number of firms paying dividends and also reports results from the chettysaez study finally the author reports data identified as being from the nipa that appear to show

difficult to isolate single factor in time series analysis26 these data also suggest that the sample used by chetty and saez may not be representative for example in the chettysaez report dividends rose in their sample from 26 billion in the 4th quarter of 2002 to 29 billion in the fourth quarter of 2003 rise of 11 the aggregate data indicate change not only did dividends grow very little but they grew more slowly than nominal output and much more slowly than corporate profits from the 2nd quarter of 2003 to the 2nd quarter of 2004 output grew by 697 while dividends grew at 474 corporate profits grew considerably faster at 18 than the economy in general this effectcorporate profits growing faster at this point in the business cycleis not unusual but it does suggest that the dividend payout ratio fell rather than rose during that time g25g145g138g157g561g6g152g142g156g561g146g157g561g15g142g138g151g561g143g152g155g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g501g561 the chettysaez study was aimed at finding empirical evidence regarding the two competing views of dividends to recap the traditional view is that the dividend tax affects investment in the corporate sector and that cut in the dividend tax would change the return to investmentsetting into motion variety of potential behavioral effects the new view or trapped equity view argues that the dividend tax has effect on investment the tax is capitalized into asset values 27 in that view the dividend tax cut provides nothing more than windfall gain for existing holders of stockand the central issue then becomes distributional one the argument made in these reports in varying degrees is that evidence for the traditional view means that the dividend cut would increase divide nd payout shares divert investment into the corporate sector and increase savings as suggested above the empirical evidence for an increase in dividends in response to the tax cut seems weak although one can make case for the traditional view on other grounds 28 but even had dividends increased one cannot necessarily ascribe that increase to the tax effects of the traditional view since dividends can increase in the new view if profits rise more quickly than investment opportunities an effect that could occur in business cycles but more importantly finding support for the traditional view does not mean that the tax cut increased savings there are two possible reasons for this result first if firms pay out more dividends then individuals might consume rather than invest them much depends on whether one views stockholders as seeing through the corporate veil and recognizing the increase in dividends as tax induced 26 note that the dividend series in the nipa include profits of subchapter s corporations firms that are incorporated but taxed as partnerships however these profits should be growing both because of time trend and also because profits in general are rising during this period so this factor is unlikely to account for the flat dividend performance during this period 27 for more complete explanation of the new view versus the traditional view see th discussion in crs report rl31824 dividend tax relief

rational and recognize the tax induced payout and even though the change might shift investment out of owneroccupied housing and smaller unincorporated businesses to corporate firms gain in efficiency the total capital stock may not increase that is while the traditional view is necessary in theory to lead to an increase in savings it is not sufficient while accord ing to theory dividend cut under the new view should unambiguously decrease savings dividend cut under the traditional view could either increase or decrease savings that ambiguity arises from two sources mentioned previously the income and substitution effects and as noted in the section on growth the effects would also depend on how the tax savings were offset in sum it is not clear that dividends increased in response to the tax cut and whether they did or did not private savings may or may not have increased g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 none of the effects of the dividend tax relief proposal are likely to be large mainly because the tax cut itself since it is restricted to individual taxes and does not include tax exempt investors it amounts on average to about one percentage point reduction in the overall tax rate on capital income and about two percentage points in reduction of the tax on corporate equity as shortterm stimulus either directly or via stock market effects which are themselves quite small it is not clear that the dividend relief is superior to other alternatives while its longrun growth effects are negative if it is deficit financed and may be negative even if it is not the principal economic justification for the proposal is the economic efficiency gains from more efficient allocation of capital httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31824g6g146g159g146g141g142g151g141g561g22g138

the marginal product of capital term note that this model as shown in equation 1 4 implies perfect substitutability between receiving earnings as dividend and as capital gain and dividends are paid out only as residual after all investment needs are satisfied note also that the model longer works if share repurchase is allowed as an alternative which would imply that the earnings of share repurchase 1c equals the benefits of reinvestment q1c in this case q would have to equal 1 moreover dividends would be paid to allow for simultaneous investment share repurchase and dividends model that provides imperfect substitutions between these choices or some additional benefit of dividends or cost of share repurchases one such theory consistent with traditional view is that dividends are differentiated from capital gains so that for the marginal dollar the dividend and its benefit or the capital gains and its cost are equated other theories have presupposed that there is fixed share of dividends and retained earnings with all marginal adjustments made through share issues which is consistent with traditional view while another is that share repurchases and dividends are made in fixed proportion theory consistent with modified new view where dividend taxes do not matter in the cost of capital and the value of θ is weighted average of the dividend and capital gains tax why such choices should be completely imperfect substitutes is not clear however theories also suppose that repurchasing shares is costly relative to paying dividends because of information asymmetries which again would permit modified new view g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy
