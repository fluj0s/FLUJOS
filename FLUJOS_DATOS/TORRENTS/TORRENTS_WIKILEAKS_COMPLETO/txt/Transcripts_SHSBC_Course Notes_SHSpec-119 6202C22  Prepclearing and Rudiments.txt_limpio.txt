6202c22 shspec119 prepclearing and rudiments terminology its prepcheck and the whole activity is prepclearing one index that withhold chain is working well is that the pcs havingness doesnt drop as much as before ta motion is another indicator one could clear up environment as part of ruds by prepchecking rooms this would in effect be prepchecking havingness to some extent we can locate withholds about games conditions what has the pc denied people what has he pushed people out of if you prepchecked this for broke you would find that his havingness would stay in without havingness process provided that he was willing to talk to the auditor at all times so use havingness while getting the pc to talk to the auditor then use things like the joburg form 3 for new students and form 6a for oldtime auditors to clean up withholds for problems find what problems he has caused people in this lifetime and prepcheck them as overts the problems intensive gets you to the problem he is sitting in you could go at it that way getting prior confusion etc or you could shortcut it by getting what problems he has caused in this lifetime as the zero question prepchecking might get you mest clear clear for this lifetime psychoanalyst would be able to learn to do this he would be flabbergasted by it especially when he learned that it was only preparatory action this system can be adapted to whatever the pc is doing you dont want the pc to give you whole lot of unconnected withholds if he does give them take up the one that reads and clear it up keep to the withholds on the same chain mine chain subject there is an art to converting what the pc says to what question you have to listen to what the pc said there are some rules it must not be too general so wide as to miss chain it must not be so narrow as to pin the pc in single incident it should be aimed at the part of the withhold that is most dangerous to the pc you must not take motivators or criticisms other peoples withholds or explanations if you get one of these you turn it around given motivator ask what overt the pc has done to that class of people many motivators are untruths anyway at least in part so it throws ruds out for you to accept one just convert it do an overt with q and criticism likewise leads to an overt it is hope that they can damage with an inability to do so it is bit higher toned than straight motivator motivator is based on an unknowingness criticism isnt necessarily criticism is also confession of an overt it converts as question to what have you done to _______ it is not always true that criticism is based on unknowingness but motivators always are it always seems safe to the pc to get other peoples overts off this is below motivators actually if the auditor lets the pc get these off you will get session where the pc made goals or gains when the pc says that said b did something ask the pc which person he knows then get what the pc has done to that person on explanations you know there is an overt so this also converts to what have you done actually the explanation itself is perfectly innocent but it leads to target eventually it is an extenuating circumstance for some overt you have to figure out what one way to open up some areas is to ask what should be done about _______ with the dynamics in the blank the pc goes off on some point and you can mine it whatever you get on some target convert the question to handle it in doing this you are steering the pc down chain of incidents that he considers relatively discreditable because he considers them discreditable he is not in communication with the subject matter he feels at the effect point of the subject matter the pc is the source of the aberration with which he is boxing as far as one lifetime or valence is concerned the individual has chosen certain areas as his randomity if he is giving other peoples withholds however he is not even on the causeeffect line motivators being effect victim criticism the impulse to destroy explanation lines in dispersal you are walking the pc back to being cause by knocking out any reason he has to attack certain points or defend himself from them or to retreat from certain subjects on his track so he can communicate on all subjects naturally on areas where he is not being cause he doesnt know if you want to find person who is in total ignorance pull other peoples withholds here the pc doesnt even know he has bank or aberration on the subject on the motivator he knows that he is in trouble but he doesnt really know why critical pc may understand the situation but he wants to make nothing of it similarly with explanation there may not be any unknowns see fig 8 cf the ow cycle as given in hcob 5jan61 0w limited theory what you handle is determined by what is real to the pc as shown by what reads on the meter if you get read it is the charge generated between the notknow and the know the pc must know something about it to have clash with the notknow on the subject if it is totally known there will be charge and read if it is totally unknown to the pc in the bank and everywhere else it doesnt register on the meter when the pc gets audited he will know more something that didnt show up before may well now read on the meter similarly the more pc knows about his own life the more charged up the bank will appear to be so you are always getting new withholds off the pc as areas of occlusion are located better it is not an endless situation since the pcs ability to find withholds and blow them increases at first withholds are few and blow slowly as the pc gets audited he gets more withholds and they blow faster and faster 195a figure 8 withhold manifestation scale openness pc just gives the auditor the withhold this is withhold that is not dangerous explanation equals lines in dispersal the withhold is seen as somewhat dangerous there may be unknowns in the explanation he might understand the situation but want to make nothing of it nevertheless it is an extenuating circumstance for some overt criticism equals the impulse to destroy the pc hopes that he can cause damage but is unable to do so the withhold is seen as rather dangerous it is not necessarily based on unknowingness he might understand the situation but wants to make nothing of it it is confession of an overt motivator equals being effect victim he has elected himself to be at the effect point the withhold is seen as superdangerous motivating is always based on unknowingness the pc knows that he is in trouble but doesnt really know why it is confession of an overt other peoples withholds the pc is not even on the causeeffect line withholds are seen as so unsafe that it is only safe to get off other peoples the pc is in total ignorance he doesnt even know he has bank or aberration on the subject dont go for backtrack incidents with prepchecking the pc will just get mired down if you dont get this lifetime straightened out by getting ruds in on it he will get wins on it and have gains if you were crackerjack expert on 3dxx you could probably produce all the gains of prepchecking in terms of clearing up this lifetime blowing things into view etc but you would probably run into things like missed withholds which would make the pc blow and lots of outruds etc one of the things you could show the pc with prepclearing is that his ruds can be gotten in more details on prepclearing procedure and ruds
