the crisis in darfur background the current crisis in darfur began in february 2003 when two rebel groups emerged to challenge the national islamic front nif government in darfur the sudan liberation army sla and the justice and equality movement jem claim that the government of sudan discrimin ates against muslim african ethnic groups in darfur and has systematically targeted these ethnic groups since the early 1990s the government of sudan dismisses the sla and jem as terrorists the conflict pits the three african ethnic groups the fur zaghawa and massaleit against nomadic arab ethnic groups periodic tensions between the largely africanmuslim ethnic groups and the arab inhabitants of darfur can be traced to the 1930s and most recently surfaced in the 1980s successive governments in khartoum have long neglected the african ethnic groups in darfur and have done very little to prevent or contain attacks by arab militias against nonarabs in darfur1 nonarab groups took up arms against successive central govern ments in khartoum albeit unsuccessfully in the early 1990s the nif government which came to power in 1989 began to arm arab militias and attempt to disarm the largel african ethnic groups the current crisis the current conflict in darfur burgeoned when the government of sudan and its allied militia began campaign of terror against civilians in an effort to crush rebellion and to punish the core constituencies of the rebels at the core of the current conflict is struggle for control of political power and resources the largely nomadic arab ethnic groups often venture into the trad itionally farming communities of darfur for water and grazing at times triggering armed conflict between the two groups darfur is home to an estimated 7 million people and has more than 30 ethnic groups which fall into two major categorie s african and arab both communities are muslim and years of intermarriages have made racial distinctions impossible fighting over resources is one of several factors that has led to intense infighting in darfur over the years many observers believe that the nif government has systematically and deliberately pursued policy of discrimination and marginalization of the african communities in darfur and has given support to arab militias to suppress nonarabs whom it considers threat to its hold on power in 2000 after the ouster of the founder of the nif hassan alturabi and split within the islamist movement the government im posed state of emergency and used itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32643crs2 2 office of the united

of the local population as well as officers and soldiers in the sudanese army significant number of senior officers and soldiers in the sudanese armed forces come from darfur the sla reportedly benefitted fro m outside support including from fellow zaghawa in chad and financial support from darfur businessmen in the persian gulf the government of sudan has accused er itrea and the sudan peoples liberation movementarmy splma of pr oviding support to the sla the government of sudan has also accu sed the founder of the nif hassan turabi of having links with jem some observers say that turabi through his supporters provides political and financial support to jem in late march 2004 turabi was arrested along with number of senior army officers the government claimed that turabi was be hind an attempted coup alt hough officials in khartoum seemed to back away from that claim by midapril 2004 in late september 2004 the government of sudan once again accused s upporters of alturab i of an attempted coup the government arrested more than 30 people including military officials the military campaign and human rights abuses in mid2003 the government of sudan si gnificantly increased its presence in darfur by arming arab militia s collectively known as the janjaweed and by deploying the popular defens force pdf the janj aweed under the direction of regular government forces

against the rebel forces and in mid february 2004 president omar bashir in nationally televised speech declared that the security forces had crushed the sla nd jem and offered amnesty to the rebels

peace and comprehensive political solution to sudans long debilitating political impasse looked promising the government of sudan and the sudan peoples liberation movement splm had reached comp rehensive peace agreement in may 2004 after two years of intense negotiations th country witnessed tw years of relative peace and stab ility during the period of negotiations while the nif government emerged from its international isolation wh the darfur crisis first erupted in early 2003 the government of sudan seriously unde restimated the challenge presented by the sla and jem as it had with other po litical and armed groups in different parts of sudan at that time the government of sudan and the splm had signed only the machakos protocol 7202002 the first of several northsouth accords the violence in darfur began to intensify at the height of subsequent intense and acrimonious negotiations over power shar ing security and wealth sharing arrangements for the interim period as agreed to in the machakos protocol in february 2004 first vice president li osman taha the governments chief negotiator told the mediators that he had to leave the talks to deal with the darfur problem in february 2004 the govern ment of sudan in itiated major military campaign against the sla and jem and decl ared victory by the end of the month attacks by government forces and the janjaweed militia against civilians intensified between february and june 2004 forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee to neighboring chad some observers assert that the darfur crisis is directly linked to the northsouth negotiations senior members of the g overnment of sudan opposed to the north south negotiations observers argue used the darfur crisis to divert attention from the negotiations and to obstruct agreemen t between the government and the splm since the beginning of the northsouth nego tiations there has been rift within the ruling party related to the northsouth talks number of senior officials have been sidelined over the past two years and two coups were attempted against the government of president omar bashir the crisis in darfur intensified ar ound the time when several important agreements had been reached between the government of sudan and the splm thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32643crs4 6 author interview with us officials sudanese leaders and regional officials in washington ethiopia eritrea and kenya august 2004government of sudan has b een under intense internationa l pressure to conclude peace agreement with the splm on number of occasions during the negotiations directly and through the medi ators representatives of th government of sudan asked for political alliance with the splm during the interim period they considered an alliance with the splm as possible insurance policy for their own political survival expecting intense political challenge from northern opposition forces the splm rejected political alliance with the ruling party arguing that there are major philosophical and political differe nces between the two parties senior government offici als reportedly made some concessions during the negotiations expecting that they would then forge an alliance with the splm some observers contend that the darfur crisis is now being used in order to delay implementation of the peace agreement r eached in may 2004 since the signing of the nairobi declaration in june 2004 there has been progress in the implementation of the peace agreement the chief igad mediator general lazarus sumbeiywo concerned that the process has stalled traveled to sudan to meet with president bashir and vice president taha in august 2004 the government of sudan rejected sumbeiywos request for vice president taha to meet with dr john garang of splm to resolve outstanding issues many observers assert that khartoums response to the darfur crisis is similar in many ways to how the government of sudan has handled counterinsurgency challenges in other parts of the country the government of sudan used tribal militias in its counterinsurgenc measures in southern sudan nuba and in eastern sudan for most of the 1990s the government of sudan used the nuer tribe from the upper nile region against the dinka tribe by arming and training nuer militia the nuer militia in coordination with government forces engaged in campaign of terror against dinka civilians and the spla for most of the 1990s there are over dozen nuer militia factions operating in southern sudan backed by the government of sudan in fact one of the contentious issues in the ceasefire negotiations in mid 2004 was what to do with these militia groups similarly the government of sudan used arab militias primarily from the baggara tribes in slave raids in bahr ghazal for most of the 1990s these militias were used to terrorize the civilian population by killing the men and abducting women and children in mid2004 the government of sudan deployed nuer militia to th shilluk kingdom killing thousands of civilians and forcing tens of thousands into refugee camps the attacks in shilluk kingdom followed the defection of former minister to the splm key players in the darfur campaign 6 the government of sudans response to th crisis in darfur is well thoughtout political and military strategy with multiple objectives according to some observers president omar elbashir stunned by th humiliating defeat in elfashir in 2003 at the hands of the rebels clearly sought to cr ush the rebels at all costs the defeat at elfashir left the army an important constituency of bashir on the sidelines and gave the security services the excuse to take the lead in the darfur campaign thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32643crs5 7 see appendicessituation placed first vice president taha in charge of the darfur campaign since he controls the security services in sudan taha through some of his key allies in the security services managed to grab control and took charge of the offensive in darfur according to us and regional officials however at the height of the darfur crisis taha appeared more engaged in the rthsouth negotiations and not actively engaged in the darfur crisis but us and re gional officials point to taha as the key player behind the scenes even while he was negotiating in naivasha with the splm according to variety of sources vice president taha worked through key security officials considered to be taha loyalists and committed islamists of the ruling party these include salah abdalla gosh head of the national intelligence security service niss who reportedly s played key roles in coordinating the recruitment and training of the janjaweed and directing the security services in attacks against civilians in darfur dr nafie ali nafie the former external intelligence chief man long considered by us and regional officials as responsible for the governments international terro r links and abdalla safi alnur state minister for cabinet affairs who is also considered key player in the darfur campaign ahmed mohamed haroun state mini ster and former head of the popular police force is also considered key ally of taha and an important player in the darfur campaign ali ahmed karti state nister and former head of the popular defense force pdf group created by the national islamic front movement as an alternative force to the regular armed forces tayeb ibrahim mohamed kheir security advisor to the president and mu trif sidiq undersecretary in the ministry of foreign affairs are all considered key players in the darfur campaign these key players in the view of us and regional officials constitute an important faction running the governments military campa ign in darfur behind the scenes the bush administration has not decide d whether to name some of these individuals publicly or impose targeted sanc tions against them as proposed by the house of representative and the senate the bush administration has publicly named number of janjaweed leaders7 members of congre ss have named number of janjaweed leaders as well as government officials they consider responsible for the atrocities in darfur some us government officials believe that the bove named individuals are direc tly involved in the darfur campaign but are concerned that publicly identifying them and targeting them for sanctions could lead to confrontation and help unify the government of sudan administration officials are also concerned that going after these individuals could di srupt cooperation on counterterrorism issues esp ecially since some of these individuals have long been tied to international terrorism for example the head of the niss abdalla gosh is seen both as key player in the darfur campaign and an important actor in counter terrorism efforts although some observe rs have doubts about the value of the intelligence khartoum may currently be offeringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32643crs6 8 us agency for international

however the 305 troops from rwanda and nigeria are tasked to protect the au ceasefire monitors in darfur the limited mandate of the au force logi stical and financial troubles of the organization and the size of the for ce have made the au mission inefficient according to many observers the deployment of the au force albeit small took more than four months after the signing of the agreement moreover even the limited mandate of monitoring of the cease fire agreement has not been effective the mandate does not have any enforcement mechanisms aside from reporting the violations to the joint commission since the signing of the ceasefire agreement and the deployment of the au mission there have been many violations and only limited number of the violations have been reported to the joint commission moreover corrective measures have been taken by the au to end these violations in september secretary general kofi annan reported that it is clear that the ceasefire is not holding in many parts of darfur clashes were reported from 812 september in sayyah north of fasher and government aligned militia attacked the sla in abu dalek on 7 september9 president paul kagame of rwanda who came to power after the 1994 rwandan genocide had stated that his country w ould respond if called to end genocide during speech in april 2004 at the 10th anniversary of the rwa ndan genocide rwanda was the first to deploy troops as part of th au mission senior rwandan officials have also asserted that despite the limite d mandate rwandan troops would defend civilians if they are attacked rwanda has not yet followed through its threat however despite continued attacks against civilians over the past several months rwandan government officials argue that it is better to have small force present in darfur than have nothing at all however kigali has made its views clear that the proposed expanded force should have mandate to protect civilians many members of the african union do not share the view that genocide is occurring in darfur and still consider the government of sudan as the central player in the resolution of the conflict and protector of civilians while us and officials hold the government of sudan responsible for the atrocities in darfur in late september 2004 as noted above the government of sudan and the au agreed to expand the au mission by over 3500 troops several weeks after the united nations security council endorsed an ex panded mission for the au and threatened sanctions if the government failed to c ooperate many observe rs contend that the proposed increase in the force protection is not enough since darfur is the size ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32643crs8 france moreover they argue the mandate of the au force is still not clear the government of sudan has rejected pr oposal to expand the mandate to include protection of civilians especially the internally displ aced people idp in camps throughout darfur the government of suda n has also rejected the use of the phrase peacekeeping instead the force is likely to retain its current label protectors of ceasefire monitors rwanda has reportedly offered to send more troops to darfur but observers and us officials assert it will take months to deploy additional troops to darfur us officials are concerned that the au might not be able to deploy new forces until early 2005 given the number of comp lications that must first be resolved the african union and the government of sudan have to agree on the mandate and size of the new force moreover resour ces and logistical support to transport the troops have to be secured especially w ith donor governments with the capability to move these troops from their re spective countries to darfur prospects for negotiated settlement in darfur in september 2003 the government of sudan and the sla signed ceasefire agreement mediated by president idriss deby of chad the agreement collapsed in december 2003 in early april 2004 the g overnment of sudan and the slajem agreed to ceasefire and po litical dialogue to peacefully resolve the conflict the government of sudan agreed to negotiate with the rebels after considerable international pressure the negotiations were ducted under the auspices of president deby of chad and assisted by the african union the united states and other international participants played an important role in facilitating the negotiations although the gove rnment of sudan delegation walked out of the talks in protest when the head of the us dele gation began to deliver his opening remarks on april 8 2004 the parties agreed to observe ceasefire for period of 45 days renewable automatically if both parties were to agree in late may the parties renewed the ceasefire agreement howe ver attacks by the progovernment militia have been verified by the ceasefire commission established under the april 8th accord these violations by the governme nt of sudan and the janjaweed militia have stalled the

militia activities in all three states of darfur of particular concern are several militia attacks on villages in the yassin area northeast of nyala during the second half of august10 the report notes that to the extent the militias that carried out these attacks were under the influence of the government the wanton destruction of the villages and the killings of large number of civilians constitutes serious breach of the governments commitments highlights of the ceasefire agreement april 8 2004 the parties agreed to find political solution to the problem cease all hostile media campaigns accept 45day ceasefire renewed in may 2004 establish ceasefire commission and joint commission free all political prisoners control their allies and ensure compliance with the agreement facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance some observers contend that there are also serious structural problems in the negotiating process the april ceasefire agreement accepted the sla and jem as legitimate political actors and called for political solution to the problem facing darfur but recent measures by the s ecurity council and proposals by the african union mediators suggest that the sla nd jem would be cantoned and disarmed in similar fashion as the disarmament of th janjaweed security council resolution 1556 imposed arms embargo on nongovernment entities and individuals in darfur the nongovernment armed entities in darfur are the sla jem and the janjaweed the embargo exempts the g overnment of sudan and does not provide mechanisms to ensure that the government of sudan will not continue to arm and support the janjaweed reportedly the government of sudan is inducting the janjaweed into the popular fense force pdf an arab dominated irregular force united nations and african union reports clearly indicate that the government of sudan continues to provide support to the janjaweed and coordinate attacks against civilians the current negotiations observers c ontend treat the slajem in the same fashion as the janjaweed the sla and jem have stated on number of occasions that the april ceasefire agreement is being rewritten to accommodate the government of sudan the rebels argue th at if they are forced to surrender or be cantoned in security zone the government of sudan will have interest in finding political solution to the darfur problem thus political settlement appears unlikely in the immediate future alt hough the rebels lack of experience in negotiations and possible defections c ould lead to temporary agreement moreover recent agreements between the united nations and the government of sudan can be seen as undermining the april 2004 ceasefire agreement andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32643crs10 impeding the work of the african union

kofi annan reported to the security council th at recent actions by the government of sudan armed forces involve level of violence that seems at odds with the principle of restraints it promised to observe under the plan of action the international communitys response the international communitys response to the darfur crisis has been characterized as slow and ineffective in part because of the government of sudans repeated refusal to allow relief workers in to darfur it was not until late 2003 almost one year after the crisis erupted that some members of the international community began to speak about gross human rights buses and widespread humanitarian crisis in darfur according to some analysts the bush administration did not consider the darfur crisis to be priority instead the administration was largely focused on the talks between the government of sudan nd the splm the first statement on darfur by the white house was issued in early april 2004 others point out that us agency for international development usaid officials spoke of growing humanitarian crisis and visited the area in late 2003 administration officials were reportedly concerned that forceful statements

publicly expressed cerns about the deterioratin g humanitarian conditions in darfur by may 2004 the international community was paying greater attention to the crisis in darfur as viol ence against

darfur genocide secretary powell stated that after reviewing evidence collected by the state department team genocide has been committed in darfur and that the government of sudan and the jingaweit bear responsibility and that genocide may still be occurring powell further stated that because the united states is contracting party to the geneva convention washington will demand that the united nations initiate full investigation shortly afte r powells testimony draft us resolution 1564 was adopted the resolution requested the s ecretary general of the united nations to establish an international commission of i nquiry in order immediately to investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in darfur by all parties to determine so whether or not acts of genocide have occurred and to identify the perpetrators of such violations with view to ensuring that those responsible are held accountable the declaration of genocide by the bush administration has not led to major shift in policy nor threat of intervention to end genocide instead bush administration officials continue to support negotiated settlement between the rebels and the government of sudan some observers and government officials have described the atrocities in darfur as ethnic cleansing and reject that genocide has occurred in darfur the term ethnic cleansing originated during the bo snian conflict of the early 1990s evolving from military term meaning to clear the land over time th term has come to be used generally to describe certain ta rgeted acts of violen ce against noncombatantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32643crs15 in conflict situations including their ex pulsion from their homes an act of ethnic cleansing may rise to one of the following charges under international law war crimes crimes against humanity or genocide international law experts assert that proving that group not only destroyed substantial part of another group but intentionally did so makes prosecuting genocide challenging in the case of prosecutor v radislav krstic the intern ational criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia convicted krstic of genocide against bosnian muslims in srebenica stating that it is not only bald numbers that need evaluation within the context of the overall size of the group but also the targ eted portions prominence within the group some human rights lawyers and experts in international law contend that specific part of group can easily qualify as substantial portion of group if that part is emblematic of the overall group or essen tial to its survival in rendering judgment in the case of the pros ecutor v georges anderson nderubumwe rutaganda the international criminal tribunal for rwanda stated that genocide is distinct from other crimes because it requires dolus specialis special intent the perpetration of the act charged therefore extends beyond its actual commission for example the murder of particular person to encompass the realization of the ulterior purpose to destroy in whole or in part the group of which the person is only member the dolus specialis is key element of an intentional offence which offence is characterized by psychological nexus between the physical result and the mental state of the perpetrator to convict an individual of genocide it is necessary to prove the targeting of specific ethnic group or groups and efforts to prevent the group or substantial part of it from surviving in the case of darfur specific groups have been targeted by the government of sudan and its allied militia accord ing to many sudan advocates the target of these attacks have been three african muslim ethnic groups belonging to fur zaghawa and massaleit those who carried out the attacks against these groups come primarily from sudans arab muslim ethnic groups article 2 of the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide states that in the present convention genocide means any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part national et hnical racial or religious group as such killing members of the group b causing rious bodily or mental harm to members of the group c deliberately inflicting on the groups conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part d imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group many observers including the us hous of representatives and the senate contend that the atrocities in darfur meet the criteria outlined in the 1948 convention they argue that members of particular group have been killed serious bodily harm had been inflicted on the group b the groups conditions of life had been deliberately destroyed through burning of villages and poisoning of water wells there has been systematic and wide spread rape of women c and children have been abducted

liberation movement signed three protocols on po wer sharing the nuba mountains and southern blue nile and on the long dis puted abyei area the signing of these protocols resolved all outstanding issues between the parties although the parties must still negotiate and agree on comp rehensive ceasefire and modalities for implementation on june 5 2004 the gove rnment of sudan and the splm signed the nairobi declaration on the final phase of peace in the sudan the declaration restated that the parties have agreed on the following the machakos protocol 7202002 agreement on security rrangements

signing of the nairobi declara tion the talks have b een stalled in part because of the crisis in darfur some obs ervers fear that th peace agr eement may collapse if progress is not made soon both sides are beginning to rearm and violations of the ceasefire agreement have increased in recent months the troika norway britain and the united states have not been not actively engaged in the northsouth negotiations since the sign ing of the nairobi declaration the two principal actors dr john garang and vice president taha have not met since the signing of the nairobi declaration in ear ly june 2004 meanwhile tensions are mounting in eastern sudan with the beja congress poised to launch military offensive against government forces nior commanders in the spla are reportedly also raising questions about the delay and the commitment of the government of sudan others argue that it would be difficu lt if not impossible to work with the current government of sudan af ter what has happened in darfur the splm leader dr john garang argues that swift imple mentation of the igadled naivasha accords will he lp end the violence in darfur13 in his view implementation of the accords will lead to new government of which the splm and other political forces will be part in his view this powersharing deal will enable these forces to check the political power of the current government and prevent military actions against civilians since such measures will require the approval of the splm in coalition government as agreed to in the power sharing and security arrangements at naivasha kenya the splm has also proposed the deployment of 30000 troops to darfur to disarm the janjaweed and provide protection to civilians according to the splm the force will consist of 10000 troops from the spla 10000 from the sudan armed forces and 10000 from the african union the proposal has been re jected by the government of sudanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32643crs17 although the splm and the government had ag reed on the security arrangements for the interim period to set up joint integrat ed units moreover senior government officials see the spla as an ally of the sla the government of sudan s refusal to engage othe r sudanese political groups in an effort to find political solution in darfur raises fundame ntal questions about the governments intent to implement the naivasha accords and its commitment to negotiated settlement of the darfur problem the government of sudan has strenuously resisted outside intervention to deal with the darfur problem and has threatened jihad against such intervention by outsiders an alternative to outside intervention some observers maintain is to bring other sudanese political groups into the process but senior government officials in khartoum see the darfur crisis as conspiracy by the west to overthr ow the government although many in the international community hold the governme nt itself accountable for the crisis in darfur by rejecting splms proposal re sisting international interventions and delaying implementation of the naivasha ccords the government of sudan may risk an allout war since opposition forces including the spla are unlikely to wait indefinitely such scenario may pose not only serious consequences for sudan but also for the entire region many observers believe that the parties could start implementation of the already signed agreements the two remaining issues are finalizing ceasefire agreement and negotiating implementation modalities the parties with the help of igad united nations and the troika have reached agreement on framework for permanent ceasefire what remain unresolved are three issues brought up anew by the government of sudan that had b een settled in the nairobi declaration the status of armed militia had been settled in the security arrangements the parties agreed to disarm all armed elements outside the two principal forces the sudan armed forces and the sudan peoples libe ration army the government of sudan would now like separate agreement for mo re than dozen progovernment armed militia the parties also agreed that th two principal armies would be treated equally and as the national armies of the country in th ceasefire negotiations the government of sudan raised objections cerning central government funding to the spla another issue raised by the government as new during ceasefire negotiation was the status of the joint integrated unit in eastern sudan the parties agreed to discuss this issue during ceasefire negotiations the government of sudan now claims this issue had been settled in the security arrangement agreement policy options on darfur and the northsouth negotiations the united states has number of unilateral and multilateral policy options to consider in dealing with the darfur crisis and the stalled northsouth talks these options are complicated by number of factors members of the international community are divided over sudan since the late 1990s the european union has adopted policy of engagement instead of containment as the united states pursued policy of isolation and containment of the government of sudan sudans neighbors are also divided relations between eritrea and sudan are poor whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32643crs18 ethiopias relations with the nif governme nt have improved significantly over the past several years for the number of th options outlined below to be successful close cooperation and coordina tion between the united stat and the international community especially the security c ouncil and sudans ne ighbors is pivotal engagement one option is engagement with the government of sudan the government of sudan is eager to appease the international community as long as it can avoid punitive sanctions and ensure its own political survival in this scenario engaging the government might yield some positive results shor t of full cooperation and accountability by the government past engagement with the current government however has not succeeded in changing the behavior of the national islamic front government working with moderates another option is working with the socalled moderates within the sudan g overnment us and regional officials assert that the international community should work with the socalled moderate elements in the government by isolating hardliners with in the government there are number officials in the sudanese government who prefer to work with the international community in order to ensure the regimes political survival strengthening the position of these more moderate elements however entails great risks and possible backlash from the extremist elements in the regime sanctions many observers assert that the current regime only responds to real pressure the threat of sanctions in july 2004 by the united nations security council may have led to khartoums relu ctant cooperation in recent weeks the clinton administration imposed comprehe nsive economic and trade sanctions in 1997 the impact of these sanctions are mixe d but targeted sanctions including an oil and arms embargo travel ban and asset freeze might have serious psychological and political impact on the regime but the government of sudan has survived years of sanctions imposed by the united stat and the united nations moreover many countries oppose sanctions against the g overnment of sudan especially those countries with business intere sts in sudans oil sector regime change some observers and sudan opposition leaders argue that the regime is incapable of change they argue that since the nif government came to power in 1989 it has committed war crimes in south suda n the nuba and now in darfur they also point to the regimes known ties to interna tional terrorism and osama bin laden regime change in khar toum they argue could bring swift end to the crisis in darfur help implement the northsouth agreement and end the regimes support to extre mist and terrorist groups some observers argue that opposition forces could topple the nif regime without outside support but 20years of war has led to stalemate mo reover opposition groups are divided along regional and ethnic lines implementing the northsouth agreements sudanese oppos ition leaders and regional officials argue that better alternative to forceful or violent change in government is expedited
