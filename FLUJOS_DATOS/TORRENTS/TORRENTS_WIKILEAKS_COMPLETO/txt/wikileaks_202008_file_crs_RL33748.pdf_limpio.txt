program jonathan medalia foreign aï¬€airs defense and trade division december 3 2007 abstract at issue for congress is how best to maintain the nuclear stockpile so that it will retain for many decades capabilities that political and military leaders deem necessary there are three main options 1 extend the service lives of current warheads without nuclear testing 2 develop build and deploy new generation of warheads without testing to replace the current stockpile or 3 resume nuclear test ing which the united states suspended in 1992 as tool to help maintain existing warheads or develop new oneshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33748g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

during the cold war the national nuclear security administration nnsa maintains them with life extension program lep nnsa questions if lep can maintain them indefinitely on grounds that an accretion of minor changes introduced in replacement components will inevitably reduce confidence in warhead safety and reliability over the long term congress mandated the reliable replacement warhead rrw program in 2004 to improve the reliability longevity and certifiability of existing weapons and their components since then congress has specified more goals for the program such as increasing safety reducing the need for nuclear testing designing for ease of manufacture and reducing cost rrw has become the principal program for designing new warheads to replace current ones the programs first step was design competition the winning design was selected in march 2007 if the program continues nnsa would advance the design of the first rrw assess its technical feasibility and estimate cost and schedule in fy2008 start engineering development by fy2010 and produce the first deployable rrw between fy2012 and fy2016 congressional actions on the fy2008 national defense authorization bills hr 1585 s 1547 and energy and water appropriations bills hr 2641 s 1751 have called this schedule into question for details see crs report rl32929 the reliable replacement warhead program background and current developments which provides background and tracks legislation and developments each year congress would decide whether to fund the program as requested modify it or cancel it and whether to continue or halt lep rrws supporters argue that the competing designs meet all goals set by congress for example they claim that certain design features will provide high confidence without nuclear testing that rrws will work some critics respond that lep should work indefinitely and question if rrw will succeed they hold that lep meets almost all goals set by congress and point to other lep advantages others maintain that the scientific tools used to create rrw designs have not been directly validated by nuclear tests and that the accretion of changes resulting from lep makes the link of current warheads to the original tested designs increasingly tenuous in this view nuclear testing offers the only way to maintain confidence in the stockpile rrw raises other issues for congress is rrw likely to cost more or less than lep how much safety and how much protection against unauthorized use are enough should the nuclear weapons complex be reconfigured to support rrw and what information does congress need to choose among the alternatives this report is intended for members and staff interested in us nuclear weapon programs it will be updated occasionally

will continue to play key role in us security policy for many decades yet the department of defense dod and the nati onal nuclear security administration nnsa the department of energy doe agency in charge of the nuclear weapons program have raised concerns that maintaining current weapons which date from the cold war will become increasingly difficult at issue for congress is how best to maintain the nuclear stockpile so that it will retain for many decades capabilities that political and military leaders deem necessary there are three main options 1 extend the service lives of current warheads without nuclear testing 2 develop build and deploy new generation of warheads without testing to replace the current stockpile or 3 resume nuclear testing which the united states suspended in 1992 as tool to help maintain existing warheads or develop new ones this report focuses on the first two options it co mpares how they respond to congressional goals presenting pros cons uncertainties costs and potential risks and benefits then discusses issues for congress regarding the third option the united states has not conducted nuclear test since 1992 yet has assessed for the past 12 years that current warheads are safe and reliable on the other hand some would resume testing on grounds that that is the only way to be sure that us nuclear weapons remain safe and reliable to validate tools for maintaining weapons without testing and to develop new weapons if needed 1 however the administration and many in congress prefer not to resume nuclear testing so this report does not consider it as separate option but discusses it at various points because testing would provide additional data to help maintain or develop nuclear weapons this report does not consider fourth option abolition of us nuclear weapons as it has garnered support in congress or the administration2 g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 almost all warheads in the current stockpile were built in the 1970s and 1980s they require ongoing surveillance and maintenance because their components deteriorate in the wake of the nuclear test moratorium that the united states has observed since 1992 congress instituted the stockpile stewardship program ssp in 1993 to ensure the preservation of the core intellectual and technical competencies of the united states in nuclear weapons 3 ssp has provided the technical basis for advancing the relevant science in an effort to maintain confidence in us warheads without nuclear testing nnsa requests 65113 million for ssp under the heading weapons activities for fy20084 part of ssp is the life extension program lep which seeks to maintain warheads by replacing certain components as needed with newlyfabricated 1 see for example kathleen bailey

by jonathan medalia which provides background and tracks legislation and developments nnsa is concerned that it will become increasingly difficult to maintain high confidence in current warheads for the long term with lep reflecting this concern congress initiated the reliable replacement warhead rrw program in the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 to improve the reliability longevity and certifiability of existing weapons and their components nnsa executes the rrw program in cooperation with dod the customer for nuclear weapons through the nuclear weapons council joint dodnnsa organization that oversees and coordinates nuclear weapon activities when dod needs new warhead or when nnsa must modify warhead the council establishes warhead project officers group pog to develop draft military characteristics that the warhead must meet such as explosive yield the rrw pog has representatives from key stakeholders office of the secretary of defense nnsa us strategic command navy air force and design teams it spelled out military characteristics for rrw and established rrw program priorities that the council has vetted safety is the first priority securityuse control is the second otherscertifiability cost longevity manufacturability reliability survivability in nuclear environments and yieldare not rankordered 5 nnsa must also meet policy goals in designin g or maintaining warheads congress mainly through fy2006 legislation and committee reports spelled out at least 20 goals for rrw in the following categories reduce the need for nuclear testing improve safety and use control design for manufacturing and maintenance fulfill current mission requirements but not new ones facilitate upgrading the nuclear weapons complex the complex see appendix and reduce the cost of the stockpile and complex rrw designs seek to meet all these goals the nuclear weapons council started competition between new mexico nm design team composed of alamos national laboratory lanl nm and sandia national laboratories nm site and california ca team of lawren ce livermore national laboratory llnl ca and sandias ca site both teams created preliminary warhead designs between october 2005 and march 2006 then did further detailed design work according to december 2006 statement the nuclear weapons council determined that rrw is feasible strategy for sustaining us nuclear weapons without testing 6 it selected the california design in march 2007 as the first rrw or rrw17 this warhead is now called wr18 5 information provided by dr barry hannah ses

for many years from phase 1 concept assessment to phase 7 retirement for fy2008 nnsa requests funds mainly for phase 2a design definition and cost study with some funds for phase 3 development engineering as of july 2007 the navyled rrw pog is conducting phase 2a design definition and cost study the lawrence livermore alamos and sandia national laboratories are working within the pog study to re fine the design review tradeoff options plan the potential development program and estimate costs of the california design9 the choice between lep rrw or some combination is important because it will set the course for us nuclear weapons for decades to come nd each year it is up to congress to decide whether to fund these programs as requested or modify or cancel them crucial decision is whether to move rrw to phase 3 from the current phase 2a while the nuclear weapons council had envisioned completion of phase 2a by the end of december 2007 it appears unlikely that congress will make decision on phase 3 in the fy2008 budget cycle as the defense authorization bills reported by the house and senate armed services committees hr 1585 and s 1547 respectively and the energy and water appropriations bill reported by the senate appropriations committee s 1751 recommended holding rrw in phase 2a in fy2008 further the energy and water appropriations bill as passed by the house hr 2641 provided funds for rrw there are many rrw issues to resolve cost is important to any decision to proceed with rrw yet longterm cost projections are notoriously unreliable there are technical uncertainties such as whether the winning rrw design can be turned into functioning warhead the future complex has yet to be determined along with how it might differ depending on whether the united states pursues lep or rrw and how it would handle transition to an allrrw stockpile stockpile numbers decades out are unknowable yet complex would spend money unnecessarily if sized too large and could not support requirements if sized too small commenter noted that while claims are made that rrw is cheaper safer more reliable etc than lep or vice versa in many cases numbers exist to substantiate the claim the proponents of either approach in many cases while implying measurable effect are really saying believe 10 beyond rrw issues are broader issues of strategic policy accordingly many in congress want nnsa to use fy2008 to perform further phase 2a work and others to study broader issues for example the report on hr 2641 stated it is premature to continue design activities for new nuclear warhead until revised us nuclear weapons strategy is developed that describes the long term nuclear stockpile requirements and demonstrates how new nuclear warhead is necessary to address specific us national security requirements and nuclear nonproliferation commitments 11 the house armed services committee called for congressional commi ssion on us strategic posture in its fy2008 national defense authorization bill hr 1585 it said the committee believes clear policy objectives should be established before congress commits to ambitious new programs12 the

nuclear posture review that among other things would inclu any plans for replacing or modifying warheads the committees report states that the report would be due to congress in december 200913 consistent with that language congress might decide to hold rrw in phase 2a until the next president reviewed us nuclear policy and the possible role of rrw in it the earliest that request to move rrw to phase 3 could be made as part of the regular budget process would then be the budget submitted in february 2010 ie the fy2011 budget in that case phase 3 work could not begin before october 2010 s 1914 nu clear policy and posture review act of 2007 calls for the president to submit to congress nuclear policy review by september 1 2009 and nuclear posture review by march 1 2010 the bill would bar funds for rrw for fy2008fy2010 until these reports have been submitted to congress conversely some recommend proceeding with rd on rrw an article in november 2007 reported that letter to senators jon kyl and pete domenici from former secretary of state henry kissinger said i believe that research nd design of the rrw should continue and that the infrastructure to support our current program should be urgently strengthened the article also cited letter by former secretary of state george shultz and sidney drell professor emeritus of physics at stanford university to kissinger that stated research work on new rrw designs should certainly go ahead such work would make possible the decision to implement the construction phase of the program were that to be desired at some future time the design work itself is relatively small in cost and need not be viewed in any way as an eventual commitment to go ahead 14 the fy2007 national defense authorization act pl 109364 section 3111 sets as an objective having the rrw first production unit fpu the first complete warhead from production line certified for deployment in 2012 and the fpu is scheduled for september 2012 nnsa stated in april 2007 that 2012 fpu remains its target date there is some uncertainty about nnsa s ability to meet that date barry hannah chairman of the rrw pog stated i believe that an fpu of fy2012 for the first rrw is extremely optimistic 15 nuclear weapons council memorandum of march 2007 states given the level of maturity of the rrw design effort to date our planning target for the first production unit is 2014 plus or minus two years 16 any delay in moving rrw to phase 3 would likely retard the fpu date g20g142g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g145g146g153g561g138g150g152g151g144g561g9g152g138g149g156g561 many goals congress set for rrw are interrelated more efficient complex and increased confidence in longterm reliability might let dod retain fewer nondeployed warheads as hedge against reliability problems or adverse geopolitical changes wider performance margins would give dod more confidence in nnsas ability to certify warheads without testing the effort to design and produce an rrw that offers greater resistance to unauthorized use that is easier to manufacture and that increases performance margins should help maintain design and production 13 us congress senate committee on armed

safety and ease of manufacture and facilitate smaller and more modern complex many goals seek to reduce cost over the long term reducing the use of hazardous materials requires less equipment to shield workers and protect the environment permits some work to be done outside of highcost buildings and reduces waste streams moving some work outside of highcost buildings to make space available inside them may permit more production lines to be installed in such buildings increasing their productivity designing warheads for ease of manufacture assembly and maintenance is likely to save money by requiring fewer process steps reducing the equipment and workers to support those steps and permitting more rapid production less rigid tolerances and wider design margins reduce costs by reducing the number of rejected components increasing throughput and reducing waste streams making warhead more resistant to terrorist attack could slow the growth of physical security costs while congress has specified many goals it did not set clear goal on an issue that it has considered for other nuclear weapons whether rrw is to be new warhead congressional language on this point may appear ambiguous for example the program is to improve the reliability longevity and certifiability of existing weapons and their components 17 goal is to develop replacement components for nuclear warheads18 another goal is to ensure that the nuclear weapons infrastructure can respond to unforeseen problems to include the ability to produce replacement warheads 19 any new weapon design must stay within the design parameters validated by past nuclear tests20 and committees qualified endorsement of the rrw initiative is based on the assumption that replacement weapon will be designed only as reengineered and remanufactured warhead for an existing weapon system in the stockpile21 part of the ambiguity is semantic warhead refers clearly to nuclear explosive device but weapon may mean warhead or its delivery system if weapon refers to delivery system then the warhead may be viewed as component of the delivery system if weapon refers to warhead then component would be part of warhead the term new is also ambiguous while neither competing rrw design is exactly like any warhead currently deployed each design contains key components that are similar to those of current warheads whatever the case nnsa could not meet the go als for rrw by modifying current warheads dominant design consideration of these cold war warheads was maximizing yield to weight having the most explosive energy possible within tight weight budget so that more warheads could be placed on missile to pare down weight some warheads used nuclear explosive package nep see appendix designed with parameters close to the point at which the warhead would fail to meet its design requirements nnsa expresses concern about the impact of 17 us congress committee of conference making appropriations for foreign operations export

refers to supporters and critics of rrw while this division may oversimplify matters it permits the report to highlight key points of contention while avoiding tedious discussion of minor differences in general support ers of lep are critics of rrw and vice versa but finer divisions of opinion exist raymond jeanloz professor of earth and planetary science at the university of california at berkeley and longtime adviser to the us government on technical aspects of national and international security said i still dont think of myself as being in the critic of rrw category because i find that many of the objectives motivating rrw are reasonable and its more in the implementation and interpretation of what is needed where i find myself concerned 22 some rrw supporters question aspects of rrw designs and supporters of rrw are not necessarily critics of lep as alamos states we have been asked to study the feasibility of rrwdesign enabled by relaxing yieldweight we have found compelling designs that provide added margin surety and manufacturability in our studies just because this exercise has been successful does not imply that were opponents of lepstrategies at the end of the day we are service providers and advisors we will pursue the course of action decided by the administration congress and the dod if they wish to pursue leps then were fully committed to that path and will provide our best advice and service 23 this report offers two terminological notes first as the rrw program has progressed and congressional goals for it have become clearer the term reliable replacement warhead longer seems appropriate it implies that current warheads are not reliable which ambassador linton brooks the head of nnsa has emphatically denied24 it implies that reliability is the programs goal yet congress has set forth dozens of goals it deemphasizes replacement yet key goal of rrw is to replace existing warheads in such way as to be used on existing aeroshells 25 and missiles second this report distinguishes between competing candidate rrw designs or ccrds which currently exist the rrw program and rrws actual warheads that may be built in the future several external reviews of the program are forthcoming the house appropriations committee directed nnsa to have the jasons group of scientists who advise the government on defense matters

in order to maximize yield to weight warheads were designed close to points at which they would fail but nuclear testing helped provide suff icient confidence that they could be placed in the stockpile the united states has been able to maintain its weapons despite the moratorium on nuclear testing largely because ssp has developed or improved upon many meanssuch as nonnuclear experiments large and small experimental facilities computer simulations and new analyses of data from past nuclear teststo be tter understand warhead performance in order to anticipate identify and fix warhead problems as result there have been 12 annual assessments that each warhead type in the stockpile remains safe and reliable and that testing is not required yet nnsa and its labs have expressed concerns that over the long term minor changes to current warheads through repeated leps and maintenance will decrease confidence in the warheads possibly requiring return to nuclear testing critics counter that careful attention to minimizing changes and advances in understanding of the relevant science should keep existing warheads reliable for many years because of its desire to avoid testing congress has stated that goal for rrw is to minimize the need to return to testing nnsa claims that the rrw program will meet this goal because of steps discussed below to increase confidence leps proponents respond that the lack of nuclear test pedigree reduces confidence in rrws others maintain that certification using ssp has been political assessment rather than technical one since ssp emerged after the moratorium on testing began this position holds that its tools were never validated with nuclear tests done for that purpose so they could lead to false conclusions accordingly in this view nnsa will not know for sure if ssp and thus rrw or lep work until it conducts nuclear tests 33 as former lanl director siegfried hecker stated in 1997 of course if nuclear testing were allowed we would gain greater confidence in the new tools we could validate these tools more readily as well as validate some of the new remanufacturing techniques one to two tests per year would serve such function quite well yields of 10 kt would be sufficient in most cases yields of 1 kt would be of substantial help 34

radiation from any nuclear armed missile defense interceptors and acceleration lifetime is the original lifetime objective as specified at the time of design and proper inputs are arming fuzing and firing signals the designers of the first rrw wr1 have sought to obtain high reliability by maximizing margins building in more performance than is needed see next section the design teams argue that they could do so because the designs were unconstrained by technologies and design choices made decades ago with wide margins they claim material deterioration or design or manufacturing defects are less likely to degrade warhead performance below the minimum required further diagnostic systems that could be incorporated in the designs would help detect deterioration at an early stage in contrast rrw advocates project increasing difficulty in maintaining the reliability of existing warheads sandia stated as systems age and warhead lives are extended changes due to aging or repair creep into the system that make it more difficult to predict performance and repair itself beco mes more challenging as we move further away from the design era 37 leps supporters argue that current warheads are reliable as evidenced by 12 stockpile assessments while problems emerge solutions do as well and lep supporters argue that ssp has been keeping at least even in this race rrw supporters agree with this latter statement an nnsa official stated each year we are gaining more complete understanding of the complex physical processes underlying the performance of our aging nuclear stockpile 38 lep supporters challenge the view that reliability of current warheads must decline richard garwin ibm fellow emeritus said with the passage of time and the improvement in computing tools i believe that confidence in the reliability of the existing legacy weapons will increase rather than diminish just as has been the case with the nuclear weapon pits39 they question if rrw will improve reliability steven fetter dean school of public policy university of maryland said like most other warheads rrw will have or could be expected to have birth defects or reliability problems that would be discovered and corrected soon after the warhead was deployed one can say whether the unreliabilities introduced by these birth defects would be greater or smaller than the unreliabilities that would crop up in the existing warheads due to their age40 the executive summary of the jason rrw report of september 2007 raised questions about the current ability to certify wr1 it stated certification is not yet assured the certification plan needs further development41 supporters and critics viewed the report differently nnsa administrator thomas dagostino wrote the initial rrw phase 2 studies have established that certification without new underground testing while not assured at this point is very reasonable expectation over the next year if we are funded by congress to do so we will complete

representatives visclosky and hobson commenting on the report said once again independent sources have raised serious questions that must be addressed before proceeding with the rrw only when the department of energy has completed the work recommended by the jason report can the nation appropriately consider what role an rrw might play as 21st century nuclear deterrent43 some doubt that either lep or rrw can be assesse d as reliable they contend that stewardship tools should not be relied on and that rrws cannot be assessed as reliable without testing because of questions about how new warheads will function they also contend that leps cannot be assessed as reliable without testing because leps will inevitably introduce small changes into warheads and their cumulative effect will undermine confidence in reliability 44 g344g495g561g11g151g140g155g142g138g156g142g561g153g142g155g143g152g155g150g138g151g140g142g561g150g138g155g144g146g151g156g561 3 7 margins uncertainty and confidence are important for understanding risks of implementing rrw or lep without nuclear testing for given characteristic minimum value is required for warhead to operate as intended margin is the amount by which the design parameter exceeds that minimumthe excess performance built into the design warheads design provides higher value than the minimum for each characteristic to ensure margin and avoid failure uncertainty results from imprecise knowledge of design parameters and of the minimum value required to ensure performance the labs use co mputer models experimental data etc to bound these uncertainties confidence is the ratio of margin to uncertainty if margin is high and uncertainties low confidence is high if both are high confidence is low having margins greater than uncertainties provides confidence against potential failure modes the close relationship of margins uncertainties and confidence is formalized in quantification of margins and uncertainties or qmu an analytic framework that lanl and llnl have developed they are implementing it to assess in the absence of testing confidence in weapon performance since its inception the nuclear weapons program has used the core principle of qmu building margins into warhead designs to assess performance risk such as identifying situations where small changes could cause performance to degrade sharply current missile warheads maximize explosive yield while minimizing warhead weight for example to minimize weight warheads primary stage see appendix has little yield above that needed to make the warhead work as intended while this approach resulted in thin margins nuclear testing helped provide confidence that warheads would work for rrw dod traded off reduction in yield per unit of weight to improve margin as well as safety and use control to gain confidence without testing both teams used metrics that were derived 42 letter from thomas p dagostino administrator national nuclear security

obtained without nuclear testing such as through calculations or hydrodynamic experiments45 using existing nuclear test data the labs found that if these metrics exceed certain values there is very high confidence that the primary will work as intended knowing this designers at both labs adjusted ccrds so that primary margins greatly exceed the minimum required the design teams claim key advantage for the competing designs because the designs start fresh designers can increase margin the teams view added margin as the single most important goal of the designs as it enables confidence without testing by compensating for unanticipated uncertainties in contrast they argue one cannot increase margin in an lep in the many cases requiring changes to the warhead because that would push the warhead beyond the design envelope validated by nuclear testing as result they claim one can only attempt to drive down uncertainty but that path has proven costly and might in some cases be unsuccessful rrws critics hold that ssp the surveillance program and lep can maintain margins through careful remanufacture of nuclear explosive package components to minimize changes they also state to general agreement that primary margin for some warheads could be increased with change to warhead through revised means of dealing with the boost gas 46 critics express concern that rrws would increase uncertainty offsetting the potential gain in margin that advocates claim for rrw precisely because the design is new critics believe rrws are likely to have birth defects while such defects have been wrung out of existing designs critics point to 1996 sandia study of stockpile surveillance that showed that the greatest number of problems requiring corrective action occurred in the first th ree years after fpu lower but still substantial number of such findings occurred in years 411 after fpu and very few occurred in years 12 23 47 there are public data on whether that number remains low or increases after year 23 because the study has not been updated in unclassified form rrws supporters respond that lep can also introduce birth defects the john warner national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 pl 109364 hr 5122 required section 3116 nnsa to enter into an arrangement with the national academy of sciences nas to have the latter prepare study of quantification of margins and uncertainties method to assess the nuclear stockpile the study is to evaluate among other things whether the application of the quantification of margins and uncertainty used for annual assessments and certification of the nuclear weapons stockpile can be applied to the planned reliable replacement 45 these experiments use powerful highspeed xrays and other diagnostic equipment to measure the geometry and density of pit made with surrogate material as it impl odes allowing experimental determination of key values independent of computer models 46 boost gas is mixture of tritium and deuterium gases inj ected into the pit to increase its explosive energy see appendix study found primary yield margins can be increased by appropriate changes specific to each stockpile system these include changes to initial boostgas compositi on shorter boostgas exchange intervals or improved boostgas storage and delivery systems these modifications have been validated by nuclear test data for the appropriate systems and they would not place burdens on the maintenance or deployment of the systems by the military national academy of sciences committee on technical

2 8 the two key issues for the functioning of nuclear weapon are 1 does the primary boost with enough energy to give its design yield and 2 does enough energy transfer from the explosion of the primary to drive the secondary successfully nuclear testing used to provide data to make judgments on these issues in addition to improved margins another basis for confidence in the competing designs was that while both teams explored diverse potential designs they ultimately stayed close to past experience in direct response to congressionallymandated requirements the nm team rejected certain design concepts because they fell outside design parameters validated by prior nuclear testing livermore states all rrwca components or components very similar to the rrwca primary and secondary have been nuclear tested for example the primary uses tested design with modest and very well understood modification of the pit to provide added margin thus there is direct nuclear test proof that the rrwca design will perform properly in addition the rrwca design draws on over 100 other nuclear tests to assure confidence in various materials components and features in the design in addition the rrwca team built on lep and stockpile stewardship to develop certification tools that boosted confidence in its rrw design 49 lep advocates hold that because existing warheads have undergone extensive testing in the course of their development they necessarily stay within design parameters validated by such tests those who would resume testing reply to both positions by noting that ssp on which rrw depends has not been validated by nuclear testing and that changes introduced by leps and by minor modifications during maintenance move existing warheads away from validated design parameters the jason report of september 2007 raised caution about moving beyond tested designs concern remains however that even though codes can reproduce the performance of previously tested weapons it is not yet possible to quantify how well excursions from tested design can be modeled and predicted 50 rrw advocates hold that since rrw draws on tested design and builds in additional margin it avoids excursions while leps inevitably entail slight changes that result in excursions lep advocates claim that changes to existing warheads can be minimized while wr1 is different from the device tested years ago

the certification process and design together forcing greater attention from the outset to potential failure modes in order to increase confidence the ca team states that it made basic design choices that ease certification without testing52 lanl states the nm design began with an exhaustive evaluation and statistical analysis of nuclear test data that led to design choices made to improve the margin for key primary and secondary performance parameters dramatically while avoiding known failure modes these choices insured that rrw would be firmly within our nuclear test experience and provided robust performance even in the event of unanticipated failure modes the resulting high margintouncertainty ratios allow ready certification through our qmu quantification of margins and uncertainties approach 53 in addition the teams used various ssp tools such as hydrodynamic facilities see footnote 35 to provide confidence that the warheads could withstand diverse set of accident scenarios and threats according to lanl hydrodynamic testing provides confidence in certifying that even with new surety features the design will function as intended lanl fired its first hydrodynamic shot in support of its design on september 6 2006 and early data analysis indicates that these features will perform as lanls weapons codes had predicted 54 rrw supporters note that an lep replaces defective or deteriorated components with new ones unlike rrw nep components in an lep must be as close as possible to the originals which often means using the original materials and manufacturing processes certification of warheads that have undergone an lep is difficult it is argued because it involves certification that the current manufacturing process duplicates the original process which can generally be done closely but not precisely the rrw design in st starts with new design that uses modern manufacturing processes that have been selected in part for ease of certification rrw is an attempt to create warhead that can be certified without testing some outside experts question whether it can meet this standard as well as extending the life of current warheads through lep according to one the issue for rrw has simply to do with retaining the same or higher confidence in our warheads performance if some of their parameters are altered from the values built into our current arsenal based on long test pedigree and whose performance over time has been confirmed by the lep surveillancesimulationanalysis programs can we meet that challenge successfully this is the question that has to be addressed with careful analysis and independent scrutiny we must determine how great an interpolation not extrapolation can be made from current design parameters and how many parameters altered at the same time before we may be deceiving ourselves in the end what will it take to convince responsible leader in the white house or the pentagon or at the us strategic command to have 51 major assembly release is statement from nnsa to dod that warhead or major component will meet all military requirements with any exceptions noted 52 information provided by lawrence

perhaps 100 successful yield tests these weapons have benefited from test base of perhaps 1000 yield tests conducted during the 40 or so years when nuclear testing was allowed is the dod really willing to replace tested devices with untested devices why are livermore and alamos designing devices that cant be yieldtested 55 other critics argue that both rrw and lep diverge from reality they believe that confidence in the us nuclear arsenalby the united states its friends and its foes alikeis so central to us security that we must conduct nuclear tests regardless of political concerns because only testing can maintain confidence 56 supporters of lep and rrw respond that most nuclear tests used test devices that differed somewhat from deployed warheads so the link between fielded

farfetched such scenarios as trinity that are used to justify rrw on grounds of reducing the risk of accidental detonation analysts can always develop scenarios in which particular new weapon makes an immense difference but the existence of scenario does not require spending large sums to address it critics note that us warhead has ever detonated accidentally while dozens of accidents have involved nuclear weapons especially in the 1950s and 1960s later warhead designs incorporated lessons learned arguably reducing risk to an extremely low level

2 3 4 5 7 current weapon systems have use control features designed to meet cold war threats these features permit authorized use of warhead in its intended mode of operation and deny unauthorized use an example of use control incorporated into warheads for decades is the permissive action link which requires insertion of code to make the warhead work more generally use control is the entire release system stretching from the president to the warhead the 911 attacks changed use control requirements dramatically as ambassador linton brooks the administrator of nnsa testified in 2005 during the cold war the main security threat to our nuclear forces was from spies trying to steal our secrets today the threat to classified material remains but to it has been added post911 terrorist threat that is difficult and costly to counter we now must consider the distinct possibility of wellarmed and competent terrorist suicide teams seeking to gain access to warhead in order to detonate it in place this has driven our site security posture from one of containment and recovery of stolen warheads to one of denial of any access to warheads this change has dramatically increased security costs for gates guns guards at our nuclear weapons sites if we were designing the stockpile today we would apply new technologies and approaches to warheadlevel use control as means to reduce physical security costs 57 in response to such concerns the design teams were directed to incorporate the maximum safety and use control practical and both designs offer menu of new features to this end llnl states that the ca design provides an unprecedented level of use control that is beyond the best in stockpile58 lanl calls the nm design revolutiona ry in this regard in contrast rrw advocates note new use control features could in general not be backfitted into current missile warheads because their designs are so tight that they could not accommodate even minor changes gravity bombs are less constrained in weight because bombers can carry much more payload than missiles 59 at the same time the new safety and use control features add cost and 57 statement of ambassador linton f brooks

reliability by an amount the labs anticipate would be small some supporters question whether all possible features warrant inclusion enhanced use control is very important to the air force especially because icbm warheads are more vulnerable outside of their silos however such features would not lead the air force to reduce physical security it would be impossible to hide an operation that removes warheads from icbms and transports them back to the base so the air force would use large security force as show of force even with rrws enhanced us control features though would create more options for security forces in dealing with an accident or an attack accordingly the air force would consider such features even though it expects that they would reduce reliability by small amount at issue are the relative costs and benefits of such tradeoff these features can be tested to see how they respond to different events which can provide confidence in their value the air force does not expect these features to affect field operations adversely and the overall design of the rrw may make field operations easier at this point in the development cycle it is too early for the air force to know whether to recomme nd dropping any safety and use control features 60 some critics believe current warheads and external physical security measures provide high use control and question the need for more use control there has never been an unauthorized detonation of us warhead and means to reduce this risk have been introduced continually upgrading physical security or reducing the number of weapon storage sites can improve use control not every threat hypothesis requires response leps supporters see the risk of terrorists penetrating heavilyguarded military base or doe facility and detonating nuclear weapon to be remote some ask if part of the funds to improve us warhead security might increase us security more if spent to secure russian warheads and nuclear materials 61 others feel that safety and use control must be increased as much as possible and would be willing to resume nuclear tests to do so they point to 1997 statement by siegfried hecker then director of alamos with ctbt comprehensive test ban treaty it will not be possible to make some of the potential safety improvements for greater intrinsic warhead safety that we considered during the 1990 time frame62 c paul robinson then director of sandia stated in 1999 as technology advances opportunities will arise for improving the safety design of nonnuclear systems of nuclear weapons and we will of course pursue those opportunities while improvements to safety and security systems for nuclear weapons can be developed and implemented without nuclear explosive testing several attractive technical concepts for enhancement of these features will be foreclosed by the inability to test 63 continued 20 2007 60 information provided by senior air force official interview with the author september 26

than is the conventional high explosive che used on w76 and w88 warheads for submarinelaunched ballistic missiles accidental detonation of ihe or che would almost surely not result in nuclear detonation but ihe would reduce the risk to production workers military personnel and the public from nonnuclear explosion and the plutonium it would scatter the first rrw wr1 would be used in place of some w76s its design seeks to create the w76s military capabilities in larger heavier package and uses some of that extra weight and volume for ihe rrws supporters point to the use of ihe as an advantage of rrw the reduced sensitivity of ihe comes at price ihe is less energetic than che so warhead requires more ihe than che to initiate the nuclear explosion while the designs for the first rrw use ihe the w76 uses che so the w76 lep must also use che as result requirement to use ihe would force switch from w76 lep to rrw lep supporters recognize that ihe would improve safety in some accident scenarios but note that the w76 has not had single accidental detonation of its high explosive since its deployment in 1978 and that the navy has high confidence in the w76 lep accordingly they see the drawbacks of moving to rrw as outweighing the safety benefits of moving to ihe 64

secondary consideration at best while there was some consultation with the plants the priority was physics first in order to minimize weight designers would use materials that were hazardous difficult to machine or that produced massive waste streams and would call for hardtomanufacture components and features with the emergence of ssp in the early 1990s and leps in the mid1990s the labs began to work much more closely with the plants with congressional rrw goals bearing on ease of manufacture cost reduced use of hazardous material and the like both design teams have collaborated intensively with the plants on how to make designs safer and easier to manufacture and have included some such features in the designs more broadly teams and plants considered all aspects of warheads life cycle

manufacturing easier and reducing cost for example some current warheads use beryllium which is toxic and difficult to machine neither rrw design uses beryllium both teams claim that new rrw manufacturing processes will potentially reduce radioactive waste and expect that rrw nuclear explosive packages will reduce hazardous material usage in contrast nep components in leps must replicate insofar as possible original specifications including use of hazardous materials rrws critics recognize that rrw should be able to meet this goal but argue that lep might meet it in other ways leps could retain existing pits reducing hazardous material usage while rrws at least for missiles probably would require new pits nonnuclear components whether for leps or rrws could use equally benign

closely with the plants to minimize the production steps needed both designs are expected to eliminate roughly 13 of these steps through process simplification which in turn is expected to reduce worker radiation exposure and the waste stream dramatically pantex states 10 cfr 830 requires more formal documented safety analysis and documented weapon response from the design agencies safety requirementscontrols have increased at pantex as result tighter safety requirements can restrict throughput the design of both ccrds has from the beginning addressed safety concerns with view to meeting pantex safety requirements and optimizing production 65 the use of ihe in the competing candidate rrw designs ccrds shows how improved safety can facilitate manufacture pantex has bays and cells for assembling and disassembling warheads bays and cells are reinforcedconcrete rooms cells are designed for higher level of containment and therefore for more dangerous operations at pantex 39 assembly bays and 7 cells are authorized to perform nuclear explosive operations so the requirement to use cells for operations involving che and plutonium limits throughput66 because ihe is so much safer to handle work with ihe and plutonium can be done in bays as well as cells rrw advocates state that leps require manufacturing with hazardous materials and complex processes that rrws eliminate llnl states that its new process for fabricating rrw pits reduces radiation waste 1015 percent and worker radiation exposure 1520 percent and that the ca design replaces hazardous materials used in several components with materials that are nonhazardous and commercially available the risk of safety issues in this view is higher for leps than rrws 65 information provided by pantex plant september

improve ease and safety of manufacturing an enormous concern at pantex is that electrostatic discharge esda spark such as from static electricity or lightningcould detonate che in primary potentially killing workers and scattering plutonium this concern has in the past caused pantex to halt operations sometimes for months guarding against it is difficult for example the steps to move che component within pantex take four hours becaus of the need to protect against esd the nm design includes technique called optical isolation which would interrupt direct electrical detonation path to warheads detonators pantex states that this approach if successful would reduce or eliminate the need for esd controls67 kent fortenberry technical director of the defense nuclear facilities safety board68 provided crs with the following comments on safety aspects of rrw although the board can point to areas where significant incremental improvements have been achieved in the safety of ongoing nuclear weapon operations the rrw program represents the potential for substantial step change improvement in safety the board has not reviewed the details of the rrw design proposals it is possible that certain design attributes could introduce new hazards or safety concerns in fact the board is aware of at least one design feature that is undergoing additional development to address potential safety impact however the current rrw design proposals contain attributes that should provide marked increase in the safety of nuclear weapon manufacturing surveillance maintenance and dismantlement examples include design attributes that eliminate hazardous materials reduce and simplify processing steps reduce the required disassembly and inspection operations and reduce waste streams other examples include design attributes that have the potential to miti gate or eliminate the impact of abnormal or accident conditions such as fire electrostatic discharge lightning mechanical impact and other scenarios that might create the potential for high explosive violent reaction or inadvertent nuclear detonation 69 critics hold that lep might also increase safety while all rrw components would have to be manufactured and assembled critics maintain that leps manufacture and replace fewer components on average some leps require complete and others require partial disassembly and reassembly70 further in this view means other than rrw can improve safety safety of manufacture is constantly improving through better building maintenance more worker training and so on pantex states it has improved safety practices for handling high explosives such as by reducing the number of times an explosive component must be lifted by hand and has changed some solvents in response to an accident some years ago in which esd was thought to have ignited small fire in flammable solvent71 because of such steps and an increased focus on safety culture it may be argued the plants have very good and

designs to minimize assembly and disassembly steps both teams treated this as design priority they found that relaxing the requirement for high yieldto weight ratio simplified manufacturing further in past practice manufacturing tolerances of parts were driven to be the best achievable in contrast tolerances for ccrd components are arrived at by simulations that relate tolerances to performance relaxing tolerances makes manufacturing easier reduces the number of units rejected incr eases throughput and reduces waste all of which lower cost alamos provided two examples of how ccrds could facilitate manufacturing 73 in manufacturing pits in the current stockpile pits in process were taken from manufacturing stations to separate work stations to be measured and certified timeconsuming process in contrast the higher margin of ccrds is expected to permit tolerances to be relaxed enough to enable gauging and certification of pits in process on production machines this reduces manufacturing time cost and floor space 74 the new process for manufacturing rrw pits will utilize direct casting process that greatly reduces the required number of subsequent process steps the nm design also makes assembly and disassembly easier in other ways it minimizes the use of adhesives which add time and complexity to assembly because they must be cured for the proper time and at the proper temperature and may prevent nondestructive disassembly the nm design reduces part count assembles nonnuclear components into subassemblies before delivery to pantex and reduces the number of assembly steps that must be performed in cells or bays llnl states that its new process for fabricating rrw pits holds the potential to increase manufacturing efficiency it eliminates some manufacturing bottlenecks it reduces the number of workstations and process steps by about 25 percent llnl has proposed replacing major component that for current warheads was made on milelong production line with new design rrw component that could be manufactured commercially 75 using less hazardous material makes manufacturing easier for example pantex states before work can be done on explosives documented safety analysis must be established for safe operations developing and approving this basis constitutes large portion of the workload at pantex and is simplified by the use of ihe76 critics argue that lep may offer manufacturing efficiencies november 2006 study discussed below under issues for congress has increased the estimate of minimum pit life from 4560 years to 85100 years or more this estimate if used as the basis for stockpile decisions would defer the need for most pit production for leps the vast majority of warhead components are 72 information provided by

for current warheads the practice has long been to remove 11 units of each warhead type per year from fielded weapon systems these units are disassembled at pantex and surveilled throughout the complex imposing burden on the complex this practice also imposes burden on the air force and navy which must remove warheads from storage silos or submarines send them to doe and replace them with spares in contrast both competing designs envision two surveillance removals per year achieving this reduction through improved surveillance and non destructive evaluations and through calibrated shelf life units the latter are identical to deployed warheads but the plants retain them they are calibrated to fielded warheads in that they experience the same environments as fielded units relevant to particular aging phenomena the documentation for each unit from manufacturing onward will also be much more comprehensive than for warheads now in the stockpile 77 laboratory sources indicate that both teams are also considering embedding sensors inside warheads to provide data on warheads environmental conditions such as temperature vibration and hydrogen level which help estimate performance and lifetime and on deterioration such as cracking or corrosion ot her sensors would report on weapons status such as if valves are in their expected configuration they would not replace surveillance but would increase the amount and types of data that can be gathered by nondestructive means and reduce the disassembly required for surveillance decision has been made on using these sensors the competing designs also have characteristics that make disassembly easier such as modular design and minimal use of adhesives warh eads are disassembled not only at the end of their service lives to remove them from the stockpil but also for surveillance repairs and other maintenance so ease of disassembly is important throughout warheads service life critics assert that some rrw techniques for ease of maintenance might be applied to current warheads such as replacing limitedlife components like batteries in current warheads with limitedbutextendedlife components being developed for rrws they note that the current stockpile has calibrated shelf life units so this is not new advantage for rrw they fear that data from onboard sensors may not lead to correct diagnosis of warhead problems commenters pointed to an instance decades ago in which part made of one material was destroyed by vapor normally released by another part forcing change of the material used to fabricate the first part one commenter asks if embedded sensors would have understood the vulnerability of the original component robert peurifoy former vice president of technical support sandia national laboratories albuquerque nm states it is my opinion that the best way of searching for material incompatibilities is by conducting accelerated aging tests 78 the critics greatest concern 77 information provided by lawrence livermore national laboratory july 27 2006 and alamos national laboratory september 15 2006 78 email september 1 2006 these tests subject warheads from the stockpile

warheads each year would reduce the surveillance burden it would also reduce the sample size on which reliability estimates are based reducing confidence in reliability

exotic materials with undesirable aging properties while the competing designs use some materials with longer expected life also making surveillance and disassembly easier should make it easier to detect and repair problems long service life however is not prime concern of the program and does not appear to be an advantage of rrw over lep nnsas vision of the complex of 2030 calls for continuous designdeployment cycle that exercises design and production capabilities 79 under this plan rrws might stay in service for two or three cades comparable to the originallyanticipated service lives of current warheads rendering rrw longevity moot llnl states supporters of rrw also do not claim that rrw will provide significant improvement in warhead longevity current warheads typically last two or three deca des and with lep can be made to last two or three decades longer rrw may make some improvement on that especially for some key hard tomanufacture components but this is not major feature of the program80 nnsa states81 nnsa developed the lep program to extend the stockpile lifetime of warhead or warhead components at least 20 years with goal of 30 years the b61 lep will extend the life of the b61 for an additional 20 years the w76 lep will extend the life of the w76 for an additional 30 years as noted the navy has high confidence in the w76 lep experts on both sides agree that ssp surveillance and leps have extended the life of current warheads and can continue to do so they disagree on how long lep will be able to maintain high confidence in current warheads though the argument is hypothetical on both sides those favoring rrw argue that unexpected degradations might arise that will be beyond the ability of ssp to anticipate and of lep to resolve in timely manner leps supporters feel that as ssp improves the ability to predict problems and maintain warheads will also improve and the range of unanticipated problems that could cause lep to fail will diminish

have concerned some in congress it does not rely on new physical principles for the nuclear explosion and is not designed to produce new nuclear effects such as electromagnetic pulse the design goal for wr1 is to match the yield of the w76 which it replaces wr1 will not be lowyield mininuke nor will it be bunker buster or earth penetrator and the competing designs did not have the ruggedness needed for that purpose leps supporters point out that retaining exis ting warheads through leps would avoid new ones whether existing warheads would be used for new missions would be political and military decision others favor having the ability to modify existing warheads or to develop new ones for new missions in this view the ability to respond to potential future threats is essential and can most surely be met through resumed nuclear testing 83

stockpile so its failure would severely weaken the us deterrent force using rrws life extended w76s and w88s would reduce that risk 2 the w76 is old first deployed in 1978 3 if the current number of w76s is retained production schedules would place wr1 in competition with the w76 lep for complex resources planni ng for wr1 to substitute for some w76 lep production could lessen that competition the rrw designs respond to this goal by packaging the military capabilities of the w76 into design that can be used in the mk5 the designs were required to maintain the same weight center of gravity and other characteristics of the w88 so rrws could be used in the mk5 dod insisted on this approach to avoid the time and expense of building and flight testing new aeroshells or missiles for the navy supporters of lep argue that w88s hedge against failure of the w76 they state that the w76 lep with the first production unit scheduled for fy2007 will provide an slbm warhead with an established pedigree and note that nnsa expects that the lep will extend the warheads life by 30 years 84 they ask why the navy would want to use new untested warhead to replace one that continued committee on

program in terms of technology schedule and cost i believe it meets the navys needs while it makes many changes and some upgrades to components it also includes changes that increase margins in order to compensate for problems or uncertainties that component changes or agerelated degradation might introduce 85

designed with the help of an extensive nuclear test program were designed to meet cold war requirements and have been repeatedly certified without nuclear testing to be safe and reliable but they cannot be modified to meet the many congressional goals discussed here in contrast rrws would not be tested would be designed to meet postcold war requirements arguably could be certified without nuclear testing to be safe and reliable and could as result of using new design meet congressional goals dod nnsa and political leaders could in the future decide to replace current warheads instead of having them undergo leps any such decision would hinge on the success of the rrw program and lep the perceived need for nuclear weapons and the willingness of congress and the administration to support such replacement it is thus premature to speculate on whether rrws will replace current warheads the air force raises questions about the effectiveness of leps and makes the following assertions leps are complicated current warheads were not designed to be refurbished so disassembly is difficult some lep components are made with archaic processes and hazardous materials leps are timeconsuming the air force was convinced by 1992 that the w87 icbm warhead needed certain changes and the secretary of the air force sent letter to the secretary of energy in that year asking doe to make the changes it took until 1999 for doe to deliver the fpu to the air force it is preferable not to rely on old warheads though the first b61 has been in the stockpile since 1968 warheads deteriorate over time and warhead in good condition now might it is argued suffer severe corrosion and become unreliable in 10 or 15 years margins in some current warheads were thin by design and series of changes could erode confidence that the margin remained sufficient 85 information provided by dr barry hannah ses branch head reentry systems strategic systems program us navy telephone

confidence in the ability of the complex to execute leps as longterm sustainment strategy86 critics expect that lep will enable nnsa to maintain current warheads for many years as noted under goal 15 navy official shared this view in the case of the lep for the w76 critics recognize that it may be costly to bring back outofdate processes and hazardous materials but argue that cost must be weighed against the cost of designing producing and deploying perhaps thousands of rrws and against the uncertainties arising because rrws will not undergo nuclear tests

president approves the number of us warheads annually in the nuclear weapons stockpile memorandum the number of deployed warheads depends on perceived military and political needs dod also retains many nondeploy ed warheads to hedge against technical and geopolitical risk the former arises from the prospect that an existing warhead type might develop defect that nnsa would have difficulty remedying geopolitical risk arises from the prospect that the complex could not manufacture new warheads fast enough to respond to such threats as major expansion of an adversarys nuclear forces rrws supporters claim that rrw would permit reduction in nondeployed warheads for several reasons rrws would be less likely to develop defects because of increased margins defects could be corrected more easily because rrws would be designed for ease of surveillance and disassembly modified complex could produce rrws in time to respond to threats because they would be designed for ease of manufacture and fewer types of warheads would be needed as backups regarding the latter point at least two warhead types are currently available for each delivery system this approach hedges against the prospect that failure of one warhead type would render an entire delivery system unusable until the problem was fixed impairing the us deterrent each warhead however is designed for use on only one type of delivery vehicle in contrast rrws designed for one delivery system could be used on another while the first rrw is designed for use on slbms rrw supporters point out that it is designed so it could fit into icbm aeroshells 87 with slight modifications such as adjusting ballast using this approach an rrw intended for slbms could back up icbm warheads and vice versa and an rrw for cruise missiles could back up gravity bombs and vice versa lep supporters reject the argument that many nondeployed warheads are needed to hedge against technical problems in their view surveillance and lifeextension programs have shown continuallyimproving ability to find and fix problems they expect that too few rrws would be built to arm both the intended and alternate delivery vehicles because building enough to arm both would be at odds with the goal of fewer nondeployed warheads but lep supporters believe it makes sense to retain nondeployed warheads to hedge against geopolitical risks not detected in time by intelligence in their view modified complex building rrws could not compensate for that risk if the nondeployed stockpile were to be reduced sharply they also express concern that having fewer warhead types would magnify the consequences of failure of one such type 86 this paragraph is based on information provided by senior air force official interview with the author september 26 2006 87

decades analysts have noted the poor condition of the production plants which have many buildings dating from world war ii secretary of defense donald rumsfeld wrote since the end of the cold war our nuclear infrastructure has atrophied it needs to be repaired to increase confidence in the deployed forces eliminate unneeded weapons and mitigate the risks of technological surprise 88 he noted that the nuclear posture review of 2001 called for responsive infrastructure as part of its new triad general james cartwright commander us strategic command stressed the importance of this proposed upgrade an efficient and more responsive nuclear weapons infrastructure is the essential element needed to ensure our weapons are safe secure and reliable to ensure we can respond to both technological and political surprise and to reduce our current stockpile of nuclear warheads 89 thomas dagostino nnsa deputy ad ministrator for defense programs said we have worked closely with the dod to establish goals for responsiveness that is timelines to address stockpile problems or deal with new or emerging threats for example our goal is to understand and fix most problems in the stockpile within 12 months of their discovery 90 to meet these goals the secretary of energy advisory boards task force on the nuclear weapons complex infrastructure and nnsa in its complex 2030 have proposed alternative plans91 while they differ in specifics both would consolidate fissile material eliminate some redundancies in rd facilities and consolidate elements of the current complex both assume complex reconfiguration completed around 2030 and complexintransition supporting stockpilein transition even if the united states proceeds with rrw the complex would for decades need to support current warheads and rrws simultaneously opinions differ on the link between rrw and responsive infrastructure rrws supporters maintain that rrw would permit more efficient complex they assert that it

at least one hazardous materials production unit enabling fewer and smaller facilities to treat waste from production in contrast supporters claim lep locks the complex into existing designs materials and processes former secretary of defense harold brown and former director of central intelligence john deutch stressed the importance of the infrastructure in making decision on rrw whether rrw is good idea or not the decision should be made on the basis of the infrastructure needed to support the us nuclear force structure and assure its reliability 92 leps supporters note that nnsa routinely upgrades the complex such as by introducing new manufacturing processes to support lep further it has for several years received funds for the facilities and infrastructure recapitalization program with an fy2008 request of 2937 million to improve the complex while rrw might permit more capable complex by increasing efficiency lep might require less new capability and capacity for example leps supporters question the advantage of dismantling thousands of warheads while building facilities able to manufacture large numbers of rrws to respond to threat they ask if it might be more responsive to maintain existing warheads than to add that capacity further they argue if dod needed few newdesign warheads to attack specified targets the laboratories could probably build them using their current facilities some recognize the need to modernize the aging production plants but question if modernizing the complex around rrw is the right approach they argue that narrowing the range of materials that the complex can handle such as by eliminating che and some toxic materials make the infrastructure less capable and thus less responsiv they fear that streamlining the complex with fewer warhead types and modular warhead design reduces the diversity of its workload while increasing the risk of failure affecting much of the nuclear stockpile

imperative to exercise the complete set of skills in the complex in order to maintain them and state that the rrw program will do this while lep does not according to doe the complete set of skills is required to protect against technological surprise as well as to have the capability to design weapon with new military characteristics should it be required the rrw design program looks at the overall weapon design not just those few components that get replaced in an lep additionally the rrw has provided the opportunity to develop safety security and use control features this cannot be done for an lep which is limited to extending the life of the existing design 93 according to sandia by exercising all of the skills and capabilities required to design test qualify and produce complete systems on regular basis those skills are ready and available to address higherpriority problems on moments notice the complex must exercise all of the skills required not just the science

exercise 20 percent of the skill base and expect to function at 100 percent on game day you have to practice all parts of your craft or you will not be able to perform up to expectation when problem arises unexpectedly 94 livermore provided the following response with which alamos concurs one of the central goals of rrw is to enable the nuclear weapons complex to be more responsive to future unforeseen problems because rrws are designed to be easier to manufacture certify and maintain they can make the complex more responsive when problems arise the complex will have the demonstrated capability to replace problem warheads with more reliable and maintainable warheads thus risk mitigation can be borne by the infrastructure rather than by the large inventory of reserves whatever problems arise complex and work force that is experienced and capable of producing and fielding warheads that meet the needs of the day rather than dedicated to perpetuating the designs of another era has better chance of being able to respond 95 nnsa prefers continuous cycle of design and deployment as noted in part to exercise complex capabilities rather than conducting lep s of rrws in the future similarly seab task force argued for an ongoing program of rrw design and production on fiveyear cycles96 in discussions with crs in september 2006 task force member argued that this approach by using the latest design and production methods rath er than sustaining old technologies would aid recruitment retention and capability development in the complex workforce lanl claims that rrw would exercise design skills better than p because rrw is new design designers must confront the full range of tradeoffs simultaneously balancing yield weight ease of manufacture cost use control safety reduction of hazardous material etc in contrast lanl argues an lep constrains choices for the nuclear explosive package because replication is required to minimize divergence from parameters that were validated by nuclear testing leps advocates respond 1 lep exercises skills design expertise is needed to ensure that minor change introduced by an lep will not create problem such as material incompatibility elsewhere in the warhead production expertise is needed in making replacement components and exchanging new for old components certification expertise is needed to ensure that life extended warhead will meet safety reliability and other requirements report by the aaas states although life extension is not equivale nt to executing new design it nonetheless employs many of the same tools processes and disciplines 97 2 most warhead problems they claim will be discovered after several decades and current warheads are very well understood so unforeseen problems are less likely for lep than for rrw 3 retaining and maintaining many inactive warheads provides more timely hedge than counting on complex in transition to produce enough rrws 4 while its supporters claim rrw would be easier to maintain over the long term it is inconsistent for them to argue that rrws will have long service lives yet that rrws should be replaced on an ongoing basis 94 information provided

and produce new warheads by designing new warheads producing them in small quantities and not deploying them thereby avoiding reliability risks and production costs of introducing new warheads into the stockpile rrw supporters respond that it would be costly to design new warheads and develop production and certification processes for small builds as skill maintenance program they see this approach as far less effective than program to deliver actual warheads to dod lep proponents point out that it would be less costly to build small rather than large lots and that large builds would impose on dod the cost to replace many warheads and on doe the cost to dismantle or store returned warheads g5g152g156g157g561

manufacturing and deploying wr1 because the program is in early stages there are many unknowns that will affect cost such as design and production details and the number to be procured nonetheless rrws supporters assert that many aspects of the competing rrw designs are intended to reduce cost the designs emphasize ease of manufacture and assembly and use of safer and less costly materials rrw should lower surveillance costs the legacy stockpile consists of eight basic designs and many modifications within each design surveillance data for each are required an rrwbased stockpile it is argued would have far fewer basic designs and modifications further surveilling each warhead type would be less costly the plan is to withdraw fewer units for surveillance and embedded sensors if used could report on warheads condition without requiring disassembly enhanced usecontrol features would permit modification of physical security practices perhaps slowing the growth of security costs increased design margins should make rrws more tolerant of design or manufacturing flaws or of changes due to aging or other causes as result designers might be able to judge that corrective action was not needed to fix certain problems lowering maintenance cost ease of disassembly and reduction of hazardous materials would reduce cost of final dismantlement and any disposal of components when an rrw is to be retired rrw costs should be more predictable than those of leps because leps must use some archaic technologies that will become increasingly difficult to maintain while rrws would have allnew components rrw by permitting dod to have fewer nondeployed warheads would result in fewer units undergoing leps or routine maintenance lep supporters counter that lep costs are more predictable because lep would maintain warheads with which the complex has considerable experience they argue that extending the

costs of training and equipment needed to handle new warheads and postpone for decades the retirement of thousands of warheads they note that leps consume small fraction of the total stockpile stewardship budget for example 2387 million requested or 37 percent for fy2008 another program stockpile systems involves routine maintenance of warheads its fy2008 request is 3467 million or 54 percent of the stewardship budget lep supporters doubt that rrw could reduce these costs by much especially because they expect the large body of relevant experience to hold down costs for maintaining or lifeextending current warheads advocates of lep wonder when savings that rrw might yield might offset the large investment costs they note an aaas report stating an rrw program would likely add to costs in the near term and it is not yet possible to determine when and whether the rrw could lead to savings in the long term 98 they see any savings from fewer nondeployed warheads as at risk if more rrws must be built to respond to unforeseen threats they note that adjusting costs and savings for net present value taking into account the time value of money by placing heavier weight on costs and savings early in projects life would delay reaching that point99 second lep of current warhead years hence might cost less cost than the first because the certification procedures manufacturing processes equipment and materials needed for the first lep could be used in subsequent leps if the items to be repaired were identical they argue that rrw maintenance costs would be nonnegligible if rr w had birth defects they cite another aaas statement the panel heard quantitative analysis that enhanced surety features in the rrw designs would be sufficient to substantially reduce the current reliance on guns guards and gates for the security that governs the work in most parts of the complex 100 it does not appear that reducing the number of nondeployed warheads in storage would generate large savings for dod in response to crs quest ion to the air force bout the annual cost of maintaining its nondeployed warheads the air force responded most af costs are associated with overall manpower support equipment and facili ties the majority of these overhead costs do not vary directly in proportion to the quantity of weapons on hand101 senior air force official stated that storage of nuclear weapons is fixed cost with the size of the security force driven by storing nuclear weapons not by the number of weapons nor did this individual see rrw resulting in fewer storage sites 102 cost will be critical factor in the decision on lep or rrw yet there are serious questions about the validity of any 30year lifecycle projection especially one with such great unknowns what engineering details must be solved to move from preliminary to final rrw design how many warheads must the complex support how would the complex support mixed force for decades while leps were being phased out and rrws were being phased in and what will the reconfigured complex look like nonetheless cost studies can be of value even if they are preliminary or can provide only relative costs or

more is better variety more reliability more longevity more safety more security more ease of manufacture yet each goal while beneficial imposes costs incorporating multiple safety and use control features into rrws would add costs some goals impose design constraints that make it harder to reach other goals safety and usecontrol features add to the complexity of ccrds which might slightly reduce reliability in some cases the benefits sought may be questioned while the ccrds avoid the trinity exception congress may wish to ask how much weight should be given to that scenario it has never led to an accidental nuclear detonation but past performance does not guarantee future results in other cases benefits might be adequately achieved by means other than warhead design such as features and systems external to the warhead congress may want to review some of the key design tradeoffs and whether current warheads are good enough for example the ccrds demonstrate how much safety and use control can be obtained as separate matter it is up to congress along with nnsa the air force navy and others to decide how much safety and use control they want and what tradeoffs they are

that minor changes from leps may reduce confidence in current warheads over the long term while rrw designs should provide high confidence because they stay well within parameters defined by nuclear test data and have wider margins than current warheads lep advocates respond that current warheads have extensive nuclear test pedigrees ssp has greatly improved understanding of weapons science and nnsa states that leps can extend the life of current warheads by 20 to 30 years in contrast they feel that rrw breaks the link between testing and certification still others maintain that neither lep nor rrw can provide confidence because both break the link to testing lep because of the many changes inevitably introduced and rrw because it will not be validated by testing the only way to have confidence in the stockpile this position holds is to resume nuclear testing fourth possible view is that either lep or rrw despite their differences could maintain weapons for the long term crs is aware of advocates for this fourth position nonetheless mixed rrwlep force would be inevitable for some years if the united states moved to an allrrw stockpile having two types of warheads designed decades apart to meet different requirements would lower the risk that single failure could put at risk much of the stockpile congress may wish to examine competing methods for maintaining reliable stockpile problems that might arise in deploying mixed leprrw force and how they might be addressed and ramifications of maintaining test moratorium or of resuming testing

pit is the fissile core of modern thermonuclear weapon it typically consists of hollow plutonium shell and other metal shells surrounded by chemical explosives the plutonium shell is by far the most difficult and costly pit component to make and is the only one discussed here for many years rocky flats plant co was the only site that made pits certified for the stockpile but it stopped making pits in 1989 nnsa has not made certified pits since then at present the pf4 plutonium facility4 building in lanls technical area 55 ta55 is producing w88 pits at low rate with capacity of 10 pits per year expected by the end of fy2007 105 the first pits are expected to be certified in fy2007 nnsa plans to complete work in fy2012 to increase pf4s rrw pit production capacity to 50 certified pits per year but does not plan to increase pf4s capacity beyond that level106 pit life bears on the choice between rrw and lep plutonium decays radioactively in ways that may eventually impair pit performance until recently nnsas best estimate of pit life was 4560 years however november 2006 study extended that estimate considerably the study by the jason scientific advisory group reviewed an assessment of pit life by lanl and llnl and found the assessment demonstrates that there is degradation in performance of primaries of stockpile systems ie warheads due to plutonium aging that would be cause for nearterm concern regarding their safety and reliability most primary types have credible minimum lifetimes in excess of 100 years as regards aging of plutonium those with assessed minimum lifetimes of 100 years or less have clear mitigation paths that are proposed andor being implemented 107 this pit life extension would seem to favor lep pits of current warheads are difficult and costly to build involve hazardous materials and require elaborate safety and security precautions it is difficult to certify remanufactured pit of current design without nuclear testing for example lanl has spent several hundred million dollars and many years to certify the nuclear performance of the w88 pits that pf4 is manufacturing if existing pits could remain in the stockpile for decades to come then there would be high confidence in them dod could have high confidence in lifeextended warheads and fewer pits would have to be manufactured for many decades reducing lep costs rrws supporters respond that rrw offers many advantages over lep such as in safety use control and skill maintenance as discussed earlier independent of pit life they argue that wide margins will increase dods confidence in rrw pits and that rrw pits will cost less to manufacture than pits for leps 105 statement of thomas p dagostino deputy administrator for defense programs national nuclear security administration

years pit production capacity and the need for new production facility in the fy2006 budget cycle congress deleted funds for modern pit facility with capacity of 125 pits per year nnsa argues that it needs more capacity than pf4 offers to that end its preferred complex complex 2030 includes consolidated plutonium center cpc with capacity of 125 pits per year john harvey director of nnsas policy planning staff explained why that capacity is needed despite the pit life findings first even with longer lifetimes as the stoc kpile ages we will need to replace considerable numbers of pits in stockpiled warheads second even if pits were to live forever we will require substantial production capacity in order to introduce once feasibility is established significant numbers of rrw warheads into the stockpile by 2030 we should not assume that rrw could employ pit reuse and still provide important efficiencies for stockpile and infrastructure transformation finally at significantly smaller stockpile levels than today we must anticipate that an adverse change in the geopolitical threat environment or technical problem with warheads in the operationallydeployed force could require us to manufacture and deploy additional warheads on relatively rapid timescale 108 lep supporters challenge each point 1 the jason study implies that nnsa would not need to replace large numbers of pits of current warheads for many decades 2 lep supporters recognize that the competing rrw designs use pits of new design and would require pits of new manufacture and that production of 50 pits per year would hold deployment of rrws to an extremely slow pace however they see this reasoning as selfjustifying the assumption that rrw will be introduced justifies new pit facility and new pit facility makes it possible to introduce rrws at an acceptable pace in the view of lep supporters lep especially if existing pits are retained permits the united states to delay decision on rrw for decades 3 lep supporters see this argument as circular rrw permits reduction in the stockpile while the possibility of technical or geopolitical problem requires larger pit capacity to build more rrws if needed instead lep supporters would re tain current warheads and maintain them with lep and stockpile systems programs thereby avoiding the need for rrw and new pit facility while hedging against technical risks and geopolitical threats they see these reductions in cost and risk as outweighing any benefits that might arise from having fewer nondeployed warheads rrw supporters advance other reasons for new pit facility more capacity would permit production of more than one pit type at time so nnsa could respond to problems that require rebuilding pits out of the planned sequence and to th reats that require newdesign pits in contrast it would be hard to manufacture several pit types concurrently in pf4 and if problem were discovered in pit type in the stockpile pf4 might be unable to replace pits in time to prevent withdrawing some weapon syst ems from deployment since pf4 was completed in 1978 it might prove less costly to build new facility than to upgrade pf4 as recent example from industry indicates 109 they doubt that pf4 could accommodate increasingly stringent safety and security requirements and note that ta55 has problems meeting current standards110 pit 108

since the first rrw will use new pits production of 50 pits per year would make for slow deployment of rrws converting the stockpile to rrws would take decades rrw supporters argue that using certified pits from retired warheads in rrws would permit faster introduction of rrws whether nnsa uses pf 4 or cpc lanl saw pit reuse as desirable for rrw in theory because it would avoid most problems and capacity limits of pit production and would save large sums nonetheless it ruled out pit reuse for missile warheads because existing pits could not accommodate all the safety and usecontrol features in the rrw designs and because they would be harder to certify than rrw pits pit reuse might however be possible for an rrw bomb because bombs are larger and heavier than warheads they permit wider range of design tradeoffs to improve margin safety and use control reusing pits would make all the limited pit production capacity of pf4 available for the first rrw rather than having to divide it between two warhead types 111 regarding pit reuse thomas dagostino acting administrator of nnsa said and what we would like to do is examine those pits currently in storage from dismantled warheads those small numbers of pits as potential pits that would be used in future reliable replacement warhead concepts for example if we were looking at providing reliable replacement concepts into bomb we would look primarily to one of those pits that we already know has these features and assuming the shape is not problem then we would use that particular pit in that system because it would have again offset further expense warhead on top of ballistic missile is little bit different animal because of the constraints associated with the size and therefore we had to kind of start from the ground up on that particular system and we didnt have enough of those old other pits 112 some opponents of new pit facility hold that pf4s capacity could be increased beyond 50 per year some equipment could be removed including that used to fabricate plutonium238 components for powering deep space probes production equipment now in pf4 was set up as pilot project reconfiguring it and adding new equipment could arguably support largerscale production though pit production would likely have to be suspended to accommodate that effort

have similar experience just as there are recalls with cars and with laptop batteries significant finding investigations sfis illustrate issues that need to be addressed significant findings are defects discovered during surveillance of warhead if defect is serious an sfi is launched by the laboratory responsible for that defect to determine its cause and remedy113 review of sfis completed in the mid1990s showed that significant defects were found one to two decades after the first production unit of warhead entered the stockpile there are two conflicting interpretations one is that the defects arose because of aging such as deterioration of plastics or 111 information provided by senior air force official interview with the author september 26 2006 112 testimony of thomas dagostino

final few percent of significant defects in warhead type that is some flaws may be there all along and it takes time and improved knowledge to discover them congress may wish to inquire about each interpretation regarding rrw why deploy it now after the bugs have been shaken out of current warheads why spend large sums deploying new warhead when it will arguably have reduced reliability with respect to sfitype issues that may take decades to identify might rrw which involves new approach to design introduce new risks and defects into the stockpile regarding current warheads what assurance can there be that sfis and surveillance have wrung out all the defects might serious defects be found in the future because they develop with age or because advances in weapons science reveal them congress might direct nnsa to update the 1996 sfi review to learn how warhead aging and responses have developed in the past decade

weapons design operation and production throughout this appendix describes key terms concepts and facilities as an aid to readers not familiar with them current strategic longrange and most tactical nuclear weapons are of twostage design114 the first stage the primary is an atomic bomb similar in principle to the bomb dropped on nagasaki the primary provides the energy needed to trigger the second stage or secondary the primary has at its center pit hollow core containing fissile material typically plutonium and containment shells of other metals it is surrounded by chemical explosive shaped to generate symmetrical inwardmoving implosion shock front when the explosive is detonated the implosion compresses the plutonium increasing its density so much that it becomes supercritical and can sustain runaway nuclear chain reaction neutron generator injects neutrons into the plutonium the neutrons drive this reaction by splitting fissioning plutonium atoms repeatedly doubling the number of neutrons released but the chain reaction can last only the briefest moment before the force of the nuclear explosion drives the plutonium outward so that it becomes subcritical and can longer support chain reaction to increase the fraction of plutonium that is fissioned boosting the yield of the primary another system injects boost gasa mixture of deuterium and tritium isotopes of hydrogen gasesinto the pit before the explosive is detonated the intense heat and pressure of the fission chain reaction cause this gas to undergo fusion while the fusion reaction generates energy its purpose is to generate great many neutrons and thus boost the fission chain reaction to higher level metal radiation case channels the energy of the primary to the secondary which contains fission and fusion fuel the energy ignites the secondary which releases most of the energy of nuclear explosion the primary radiation case and secondary comprise the nuclear explosive package thousands of nonnuclear components are also needed to make the nuclear explosive package into militarily usable weapon such as an arming firing and fuzing system an outer case and electrical and physical connections linking bomb to an airplane or warhead to missile nuclear weapons were designed tested and manufactured by the nuclear weapons complex which is composed of eight governmentowned

nuclear weapons complex and program nnsa maintains nuclear weapons and associated expertise through the stockpile stewardship program ssp which congress created in the fy1994 national defense authorization act pl 103160 section 3138 the legislation specified that the goal of ssp is to ensure the preservation of the core intellectual and technical competencies of the united states in nuclear weapons through advanced computational capabilities aboveground experiments experiments not requiring nuclear testing and construction of large experimental facilities ssp has three main elements directed stockpile work involves work directly on nuclear weapons in the stockpile such as monitoring their condition maintaining them through refurbishment and modifications rd in support of specific warheads and dismantlement it includes the life extension program and the rrw program campaigns provide focused scientific and engineering expertise in support of directed stockpile work in such areas as pit manufacturing and certification computation and study of the properties of materials readiness in technical base and facilities funds infrastructure and operations at the nuclear weapons complex sites while the legislation did not specify that ssp was not to involve nuclear testing that goal seems clear from the history and has become goal of the program nnsa does not rule out the possible need for testing such as if problem were to emerge in warhead type that could not be remedied in any other way but the united states has been able to maintain its nuclear stockpile without testing since 1992 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33748g16g158g140g149g142g138g155g561g25g138g155g145g142g138g141g156g561 g561

that program originated as funded activity in the conference report on the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act when conferees stated that 90 million is made available for the reliable replacement warhead program to improve the reliability longevity and certifiability of existing weapons and their components115 this was rrws washington debut nnsa had not requested funds for it and the relevant congressional reports had not mentioned it 2 pl 109163 the fy2006 national defense authorization act section 3111 sets seven requirements for the program the text includes quotation marks because the requirements add new section 4204a reliable replacement warhead program to the atomic energy defense act division d of pl 107314 program requiredthe secretary of energy shall carry out program to be known as the reliable replacement warhead program which will have the following objectives 1 to increase the reliability safety and security of the united states nuclear weapons stockpile 2 to further reduce the likelihood of the resumption of underground nuclear weapons testing 3 to remain consistent with basic design parameters by including to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the objective sp ecified in paragraph 2 components that are well understood or are certifiable without the need to resume underground nuclear weapons testing 4 to ensure that the nuclear weapons infrastructure can respond to unforeseen problems to include the ability to produce replacement warheads that are safer to manufacture more costeffective to produce and less costly to maintain than existing warheads 5 to achieve reductions in the future size of the nuclear weapons stockpile based on increased reliability of the reliable replacement warheads 6 to use the design certification and production expertise resident in the nuclear complex to develop reliable replacement components to fulfill current mission requirements of the existing stockpile 7 to serve as complement to and potentially more costeffective and reliable longterm replacement for the current stockpile life extension programs 115 us congress committee of conference making appropriations for foreign operations

goals for rrw those not in the preceding text include the following the committee understands that by designing and replacing components and warheads in our existing arsenal the nuclear weapons complex can take full advantage of modern design techniques more environmentally safe materials and efficient manufacturing processes in way that can make our arsenal more reliable safe and secure the committee encourages the department of defense and the department of energy to focus initial reliable replacement warhead efforts on replacement warheads for submarine launched ballistic missiles second objective of this program is to further reduce the likelihood of the resumption of nuclear testing by increasing warhead design margin and manufacturability sixth goal is ensuring that the human capital aspect is not neglected the nuclear complex is rapidly losing its design and production expertise concern highlighted by several studies in the past decade the reliable replacement warhead program will help train and sustain the weapons designers and engineers whose expertise is essential in ensuring the stockpile remains reliable safe and secure into the future 116 4 the senate armed services committee set goals in its fy2006 report the committee understands from the testimony of the administrator of the national nuclear security administration nnsa that the goals of this program are 1 to increase the security and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile 2 to develop replacement components for nuclear warheads that can be more easily manufactured with more readily available and more environmentally benign mate rials 3 to develop replacements that can be introduced into the stockpile with assured high confidence regarding their effect on warhead safety and reliability 4 to develop these replacements on schedule that would reduce the possibility that the united states would ever be faced with the need to conduct nuclear test in order to diagnose or remedy reliability problem in the current stockpile 5 to reduce infrastructure costs needed to support the stockpile while increasing the responsiveness of that infrastructure and 6 to increase confidence in the stockpile to level such that significant additional reductions in numbers of nondeployed hedge warheads can be made the committee supports these goals and this modest investment 94 million in feasibility studies with the goal of substantially increasing the safety security and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile and with the ultimate objective of achieving the smallest stockpile consistent with our nations security 117 5 most house armed services committee democrats presented their goals for the program in statement of additional views in the committees fy2006 report in our opinion the rrw program is only worthy of support if it truly reduces or eliminates altogether the need for nuclear testing leads to dramatic reductions in the nuclear arsenal including complete dismantlement of the weapons and safe disposal of fissile components 116 us congress house committee on armed services national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 hrept 10989 on

particularly for tactical military purposes reduces the reliance of the us on nuclear weapons and deemphasizes the military utility of nuclear weapons significantly reduces the cost of maintaining our nuclear weapon complex to include avoiding the need to build modern pit facility increases nuclear security and decreases the risk of unauthorized or accidental launch andor detonation and leads to ratification and entry into force of the comprehensive test ban treaty118 6 the house appropriations committee in its report on fy2006 energy and water development appropriations listed various requirements for rrw the committee is supportive of the administration taking an accelerated approach to implement new nuclear weapons paradigm that ensures the continued moratorium on nuclear testing and results in dramatically smaller nuclear weapons stockpile in the near future the rrw weapon will be designed for ease of manufacturing maintenance dismantlement and certification without nuclear testing allowing the nnsa to transition the weapons complex away from large expensive cold war relic into smaller more efficient modern complex more reliable replacement warhead will allow longterm savings by phasing out the multiple redundant cold war warhead designs that require maintaining multiple obsolete production technologies to maintain the older warheads the committees qualified endorsement of the rrw initiative is based on the assumption that replacement weapon will be designed only as reengineered and remanufactured warhead for an existing weapon system in the stockpile the committee does not endorse the rrw concept as the beginning of new production program intended to produce new warhead designs or produce new weapons for any military mission beyond the current deterrent requirements the committees support of the rrw concept is contingent on the intent of the program being solely to meet the current military characteristics and requirements of the existing stockpile 119 7 the senate appropriations committees report on fy2006 energy and water development appropriations stated nnsa is undertaking the rrw program to understand if warhead design constraints imposed on cold war systems eg high yield to weight ratios that have typically driven tight performance margins in nuclear design are relaxed could replacement components for existing stockpile weapons be more easily manufactured with more readily available and more environmentally benign materials and whose safety and reliability could be assured with high confidence without nuclear testing this effort does not call into question the safety or reliability of the current stockpile but acknowledges the longterm sustainab ility of 118 us congress house committee on armed services national
