houses of congress took action to approve the rescission request of the president within 45 days of continuous session not counting recesses of more than three days as experience with the impoundment control act produced growing concern with the existing framework attention came to focus on three different approaches to granting the president greater authority over the spending of funds provided

see table 1 below 1 for historical review of impoundment reform efforts see crs issue brief ib89148 item veto and expanded impoundment proposals by virginia mcmurtry crs2 this impoundment reform effort culminated in the line item veto act of 1996 pl 104130 110 stat 12002 however it was held unconstitutional by the supreme court in 1998 in the aftermath of that decision there has been renewed interest in previous approaches that might pass constitutional muster several measures have been introduced in the subsequent congresses to provide alternative statutory means for conveying expanded rescission authority to the president overview of votes covered review was made of selected votes of interest using congressional research service files and library of congress databases the examination is characterized as selected since the method of review could have missed some relevant instances but the proffered results are thought to be relatively comprehensive some of the votes are on procedural issues as indicated in the table rather than on the proposal itself the votes occurred from the 98th to the 108th congresses covering the period since the enactment of the impoundment control act during the 22year review period 19832004 at least 36 floor votes occurred on selected measures to provide the president with expanded impoundment authority see table 1 the majority of these votes 23 out of 36 or more than 60 dealt with enhanced or expedited rescission proposals eight reflected the expedited rescission approach while 15 incorporated enhanced rescission also counted were two 103rd congress votes on an amendment to the budget resolution for fy1994 containing senseofthesenate provisions in support of expedited or enhanced rescission ten votes listed in table 1 had to do with separate enrollment procedures the mattingly bills in the 98th and 99th congresses providing early examples of this approach required that each item of an appropriations measure ie any numbered section or unnumbered paragraph be enrolled as separate bill with this version of separate enrollment which again became central to the impoundment reform debate in the 104th congress an appropriation bill is broken up into many billets prior to presentation for the presidents signature other measures placed in the separate enrollment category such as the evans amendments in the 100th congress would have broken up omnibus continuing resolutions into components akin to regular appropriations bills while such proposals may not strictly speaking be comparable they were deemed to be within the scope of this report three other votes listed in table 1 are on or relate to measures characterized as item veto proposals per two proposals voted on in the 98th congress contained language

many proposals have been introduced to grant the president an item veto by constitutional amendment but the only floor vote on such measure occurred in 1992 initial efforts at floor votes as indicated in table 1 the first floor vote on an expanded rescission proposal occurred in 1983 less than 10 years after enactment of the impoundment control act additional votes occurred in each succeeding congress until the 105th with the frequency of floor considerations of expanded rescission or item veto proposals increasing markedly after 1991 the discussion that follows highlights these events congress by congress beginning with the 102nd congress however before turning to that review it is useful to note briefly some preliminary developments in the 101st congress in the 101st congress new hybrid version of impoundment reform legislation appeared reflecting features of both enhanced and expedited rescission approaches but classified table 1 according to their predominant components of enhanced rescission the legislative line item veto act of 1989 s 15534 sought to provide the president with enhanced rescission termed item veto authority by amending the ica to allow transmission of special rescission message within 10 days of enactment of appropriations measures or to accompany the presidents annual budget submission budget authority so rescinded remained canceled unless congress disapproved with expedited procedures provided within 20 days twice in the 101st congress the provisions of s 1553 were offered as an amendment during senate floor debate after several unsuccessful attachment attempts in the fall of 1989 senator dan coats sought to incorporate the provisions of s 1553 into november 9 1989 amendment to the conference report for the department of transportation appropriations act for fy19905 however the senate rejected 5140 motion to waive section 306 of the congressional budget act of 1974 which prohibits consideration of budget process legislation not reported by the budget committee and point of order raised against the amendment was sustained second attempt was made to offer provisions of s 1553 as an amendment this time to

as reflecting support at least indirectly for the item veto enhanced or expedited rescission or separate enrollment approaches in the 102nd congress in all but one of these cases the substance of the expanded rescission item veto or separate enrollment provision was offered as an amendment during floor debate on another measure there were two more attempts in the senate to achieve vote on the legislative line item veto act reintroduced as s 196 by offering its provisions as floor amendment both failed on budget act waiver votes on february 26 1992 senator mccain offered the proposal as an amendment during debate on the national cooperative research act extended debate ensued during which the chairman of the senate appropriations committee senator robert byrd spoke at length in opposition to the proposed amendment the following day the senate rejected 44 54 motion to waive section 306 of the budget act subsequently the point of order raised under section 306 was sustained7 senators mccain and coats again tried to offer the provisions of s 196 as an amendment on september 17 1992 during floor debate on the laborhhseducation appropriations bill for 1993 the needed motion to waive section 306 of the budget act failed by vote of 40568 during the 102nd congress six of the seven attempts in the house also involved floor amendments but the contexts varied on june 11 1992 during debate on hjres 290 proposing balanced budget constitutional amendment the house voted on an amendment containing item veto authority for the president representative jon kyl offered the amendment to the proposed constitutional amendment to allow the president to exercise item veto authority when signing any measure containing spending authority broadly defined to limit total outlays for fiscal year to 19 of the gross national product of that year and to require three fifths vote of congress to approve any additional funds the house rejected the kyl amendment by vote of 1702589 three times in july 1992 representative gerald solomon and others attempted to have an amendment to provide legislative line item veto rescission authority made in order during debate in the house on various appropriations measures each attempt occurred as an effort to defeat the previous question on the special rule for considering the measure which did not make consideration of the solomon amendment in order10 as indicated in table 1 the closest vote occurred on july 28 1992 when the previous question was ordered by margin of fewer than 10 votes 207199 although supporters of the solomon amendment sought to characterize the procedural vote as measure of sentiment on the item veto the floor debate indicates that some voted against moving the previous question on the rule for other 7

rescission might have voted for the previous question for reasons unrelated to their position on the item veto on july 21 1992 during debate in the house on hr 2637 to withdraw lands for the waste isolation pilot project representative robert walker offered an amendment which he characterized as an item veto effort but which is listed in the chart as separate enrollment measure the walker amendment sought to provide that the funds authorized by the bill subsequently were to be appropriated only in an act or joint resolution containing other appropriation to carry out any other law the house rejected the amendment by vote of 14424811 on september 30 1992 another effort was made in the house to offer the enhanced rescission provisions as floor amendment to an appropriations measure this time to hjres 553 the shortterm continuing resolution providing fiveday funding extension representative solomon urged defeat of the previous question on hres 580 the accompanying rule however the majority leadership apparently urged those wishing to signify support for the amendment effort to oppose the rule itself rather than attempt to defeat the previous question thus the rule was agreed to by margin of fewer than 10 votes 213204 while the previous question was agreed to by vote of 23118612 shortly before the votes on the previous question and the rule occurred representative butler derrick chairman of the rules subcommittee on the legislative process which had held two days of hearings on expanded rescission and item veto measures spoke concluding he said i think that there is possibility that we might get vote of some sort on this lineitem veto proposal before we get out of here although i cannot say that definitely there are discussions going on about that13 the promised house debate and vote on an expanded rescission proposal occurred before the 102nd congress adjourned in early october 1992 hr 2164 the expedited consideration of proposed rescissions act was viewed as compromise measure with over 220 cosponsors it was called up under suspension of the rules on october 2 1992 on the following day hr 2164 passed the house by vote of 3129714 this version of expedited rescission applied to proposals from the president submitted within three days of his signing an appropriations act the proposed rescission could not reduce program below the budget level of the previous year or by more than 25 for new programs funds would become available again after vote in either house to reject the proposed rescission 11 congressional record daily edition vol 138 july

act reintroduced as s 9 this effort occurred during floor consideration of s 460 the national voter registration act following considerable debate on the amendment the senate rejected 4552 the motion to waive section 306 of the budget act15 the house continued to favor expedited rescission proposals in the 103rd congress although there were votes on proposals reflecting the enhanced rescission approach as well initial action occurred on april 2 1993 when the house briefly considered hr 1578 revised version of expedited rescission which had been reported by the rules committee with an amendment in the nature of substitute the rule hres 149 providing for consideration of the bill was however unexpectedly withdrawn without vote action on the identical rule and bill was scheduled to resume on april 21 however for the second time house leaders hastily pulled the bill from the floor seemingly because of continuing concern that vote on the rule would not pass on april 28 the rule which had generated some controversy again came to the floor was debated and voted upon ultimately passing by only four votes on april 29 1993 the house continued consideration of hr 1578 eventually passing it by vote of 258157 in contrast to hr 2164 in the previous congress hr 1578 as reported by the rules committee allowed the president to propose rescission of up to 100 of any program and also contained section pertaining to expedited judicial review most significantly hr 1578 as reported detailed expedited procedures for vote on an appropriations committee substitute as an alternative to the presidents rescission package during consideration of hr 1578 the castle amendment in the nature of substitute providing enhanced rescission authority was rejected 19821916 meanwhile on march 25 1993 the senate adopted two senseofthesenate amendments relating to rescission reform as part of the budget resolution for fy1994 the bradley amendment regarding separate enrollment for items in appropriations and tax measures and an amendment introduced by senator william cohen supporting expedited rescission authority with regard to items of appropriation tax expenditures and direct spending the former was approved by vote of 7324 after senator byrd chairman of the appropriations committee rather unexpectedly stated his support i know what is in the amendment it would extend the veto to tax expenditures i think we all ought to vote for this amendment17 the conference version retained single senseofthesenate provision in this regard stating that the president should be granted lineitem veto authority over items of appropriations and tax expenditures to expire at the end of the 103rd congress 15 congressional record daily edition vol 139 mar 10 1993 pp s2576s2601 16

on s 1134 the omnibus budget reconciliation measure senator bill bradley again offered an amendment calling for item veto authority by requiring separate enrollment of items in appropriations bills and tax expenditures in revenue bills this time however it was not senseofthe senate language but rather an actual amendment of the impoundment control act to create statutory authority for the new procedures the motion to waive the budget act point of order failed of the necessary threefifths majority by vote of 5345 subsequently point of order was sustained and the amendment fell18 as adopted in may 1994 hconres 218 the budget resolution for fy1995 also contained senseofthecongress provisions including support for expedited rescission this provision was in the resolution as reported by the house budget committee19 the language reiterated that legislation granting the president expedited rescission authority such as hr 1578 already passed by the house should be enacted20 on june 23 1994 the house rules committee reported hr 4600 the expedited rescissions act of 1994 which was identical to hr 1578 as passed by the house on april 29 1993 the report accompanying hr 4600 explained that by considering an identical measure in the second session the house hopes to impress upon the senate the importance of its own support for and action on these budget process reforms21 on july 14 1994 the house passed hr 4600 with an amendment in the nature of substitute by vote of 34269 sponsored by representative charles stenholm this substitute amendment which expanded upon the existing provisions in the bill for expedited rescission eg adding targeted tax benefits was agreed to by vote of 298121 the solomon substitute amendment which sought to give the president enhanced rescission

and candidates endorsed an election platform document called the contract with america which pledged action on number of measures including legislative line item veto within the first 100 days should republican majority be elected when the 104th congress convened with republican majority in both houses of congress action on an expanded rescission measure became high priority in the house hr 2 an enhanced rescission measure was introduced on january 4 1995 and referred jointly to the committees on government reform and oversight and on rules both committees reported the measure as amended in late january house floor debate began on february 2 and the house passed hr 2 as amended by vote of 294134 on february 6 in the senate s 4 an enhanced rescission bill and s 14 an expedited rescission bill were likewise introduced on january 4 1995 both were referred jointly to the committees on the budget and on governmental affairs both committees acted to report both bills without recommendation and senate floor consideration commenced in march 1995 on march 23 1995 the senate passed s 4 as amended by vote of 6929 during floor action an amendment incorporating the separate enrollment approach was approved as substitute for the original enhanced rescission language the amended version provided for the separate enrollment of items of appropriations and items of new direct spending and certain limited tax benefits nearly year elapsed before the conference committee filed its report on march 21 1996 but within week both houses had approved s 4 as reported from conference the conference substitute reflected compromise between the two versions basically incorporating the enhanced rescission approach of the house and the broader coverage of the senate measure on april 9 1996 president clinton signed the line item veto act into law as pl 104 13023 while the new law remained in effect its provisions augmented the rescission authority provided earlier to the president by adding new part at the end of the impoundment control act on line item veto whenever the president signed bill or joint resolution he could cancel in whole 1 any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority 2 any item of new direct spending and 3 certain limited tax benefits under the line item veto act the subject matter of presidents rescission authority expanded moreover with the enhanced rescission framework the burden of action changed rescissions proposed by the president remained permanent unless congress acted to disapprove any bill or joint resolution of disapproval was subject to presidential veto requiring twothirds vote in each house for the override after notifying congress in special message 30day review period followed 23 for summary of its provisions and sources for

the 105th congress and beyond the line item veto act became effective on january 1 1997 the following day six members of congress filed lawsuit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the new law on april 10 1997 judge thomas penfield jackson ruled that the line item veto act was unconstitutional because it violated provisions of the presentment clause of the constitution25 since the line item veto act contained provisions specifically designed to expedite judicial review the district court decision was appealed directly to the supreme court where oral arguments were heard on may 27 1997 on june 26 1997 the supreme court announced its decision in the case of raines v byrd setting aside the judgment of the lower court on jurisdictional grounds by ruling that the senators and representatives lacked legal standing to bring the case however the supreme court confined its decision to this technical matter and did not consider the merits of the underlying constitutional issues 26 shortly after judge jacksons april 1997 decision rescission reform measures were again introduced in the 105th congress on april 15 representative david skaggs introduced hr 1321 the expedited rescissions act of 1997 noting this bill is similar to one that passed the house but was not taken up by the senate in 1993 it will provide very useful tool for getting at wasteful items in appropriations bills 27 the next day senator ernest hollings introduced separate enrollment bill s 592 identical to that passed by the senate in 199528 joint resolutions
