converting the annual budget cycl to biennial one establishing two commissions to examine federal government programs and making various other modifications to the congressional budget pro cess according to senator gregg the purpose of the stop over spending act of 2006 is to at least put procedures in place to allow us as congress to begin to control spending1 this report provides brief summary of the major provisions of s 3521 title 1 legislative line item veto title i of s 3521 would create expedite d procedures for the consideration of rescissions proposed by the president2 under existing law the impoundment control act of 1974 title x of pl 93 344 2 usc 681691f the president may propose to rescind funding in an appropr iations act and may withhold that funding from obligation for 45 days without any action by congress the rescission however may become permanent only by an act of congress if congress does not act on the presidents rescission proposal w ithin 45 days the president must release the funds for obligation under the legislative line item veto in cluded in s 3521 the president could propose to rescind funding in appropriations acts items of direct spending and targeted tax benefits within one year of their enactment he would be limited to four special messages proposing rescissions per calendar year there would be restrictions on the number and grouping of rescissions in each special message but the president would be prohibited from resubmitting rescission proposal rejectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33547crs2 3 discretionary spending is provided in nd controlled by the annual appropriations acts 4 s 3521 provides that the sequestration proce dures could be suspended in the event of period of low economic growth by congress enacting joint resolution suspending such procedures 5 the budget enforcement act of 1990 title x iii of pl 101508 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 104 stat 13885731388630 which amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 commonly known as the grammrudmanhollings act first established statutory discretionary spending limits for fy19911995 the limits were modified and extended through fy1998 in 1993 title xiv of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 and extended through fy2002 in 1997 the budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 prior to the creation of the discretiona ry spending limits as well as the associated payasyougo paygo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 had established annual maximum deficit targets initially declining to zero by fy1991 and then revised in 1987 balanced budget and emergency deficit c ontrol reaffirmation act of 1987 pl 100119 101 stat 754788 to require balanced budget by fy1993 adjustable deficit targets remained in effect through fy1995 but they ffectively were superseded by the other two enforcement mechanisms for background information on sequestration see 1 crs report rl31137 sequestration procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act by robert keith and 2 crs report rs20398 budget sequesters brief review by robert keithby congress under the senate budget committeereported amendment after submitting rescission proposal to congre ss the president could withhold funding in an appropriations act or spend an item of direct spendi ng or targeted tax benefit as proposed to be rescinde d for up to 45 calendar days more significantly s 3521 would establish an expedited process to consider the presidents rescission proposals the new process would require congress to consider legislation containing the pres idents rescission proposals within 10 days of its introduction under proce dures limiting deba and prohib iting amendments under this proposal therefore congress w ould be required to vote on the presidents rescission package with opportunity to modify it title ii deficit reduction title ii of s 3521 would establish statutory discretionary spending3 limits and maximum deficit amounts both limits w ould be enforced by sequestration process by which spending in the amount of any violation of the discretionary spending limits or the maximum deficit amounts would be cancelled4 similar statutory limits enforced by sequestrati on were in place from fy1990 to fy2002 for discretionary spending and fy 1985 to fy1990 for deficit targets5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33547crs3 6 spending designated as an emergency re quirement would be capped at 90 billion for fy2007 50 billion for fy2008 and 30 billion for fy2009 emergency spending has averaged about 96 billion over the past six fisc years 20012006 which includes funding for the military activities in afghanistan and iraq crs calculation based on cbo data 7 the adjustment would be limited to 274 million for fy2007 414 million for fy2008 and 554 million for fy2009 8 along with this endofthesession seque stration withinsession sequestration could occur when an appropriation such as suppl emental appropriation caused spending limit to be breached during fiscal year in this case sequestration would occur seven days after the enactment of the appropriation if violation of discretionary spending limit occurred in the last quarter of the fiscal ear ie july 1 through september 30 the spending limit for the following fiscal year w ould be reduced by the amount of the violation 9 the legislation specifies the following nnual maximum deficit amounts expressed as percentage of gdp 275 fy2007 225 fy 2008 175 fy2009 125 fy2010 075 fy2011 and 05 fy2012 and each fiscal year thereafter the maximum deficit amounts would be calculated by omb presumably using the most recent estimates of gdp at the time omb issues its reportsdiscretionary spending limits s 3521 would establish limits on discre tionary new budget authority for fy2007 8725 billion fy2008 8954 billi on and fy2009 9195 billion it also would require the president to recommend and congress to consider limits for fiscal years thereafter the legislation would allow for adjustments to these amounts for any spending designated by the president and congress as an emergency requirement but limits the adjustment by certain amount for each year6 the limits also could be adjusted for enhanced tax enforcement initiative spending but again limited by certain amount for each year7 the new discretionary spending caps w ould be enforced by sequestration as during the period covering fy1991fy2002 under the budget enfo rcement act the office of management and budget omb would be required to issue final sequestration report i ndicating any breach of the disc retionary spending limit for the budget year 15 days after the end of sessi on of congress if omb determined that the spending limit had been exceeded the pr esident would be required to issue sequestration order cancelling budget aut hority in each discretionary spending account by the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate the breach8 maximum deficit amounts s 3521 also would establish annual max imum deficit amounts expressed as percentage of gross dome stic product gdp dec lining to 05 of gdp by fy20129 these maximum deficit amounts ultimately would be enforced by sequestration similar to the enforcement of the discretionary spending limits omb would be required to issue final sequestra tion report indicating any projected deficit for the budget year in excess of the appli cable maximum deficit amount 15 days after the end of session of congress if om b determined that the projected deficit exceeded the maximum deficit amount the pr esident would be required to issue ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33547crs4 10 section 227 of s 3521 exempts from any seque stration order social security benefits tier i railroad retirement benefits and ot her specific accounts or activities that are not available for sequestration such as interest on the public debt claims against the united states and miscellaneous permanent ppropriations for existing contracts 11 not later than 20 days after omb submits such report house and senate committees could submit information similar to that contai ned in their views and estimates to assist the budget committees in preparation of reconciliation directives reports 12 for further information on bie nnial budgeting see crs report rl 30550 biennial budgeting issues and options by james v saturnosequestration order cancelling budget author ity in each nonexempt direct spending account by the uniform percentage nece ssary to eliminate the excess deficit10 prior to such action however congress would have an opportunity to develop and consider reconcilia tion legislation under expedited procedures in response to an anticipated final sequestrati on report indicating an excess deficit on august 20 of each year omb would be required to i ssue reconciliation re port indicating any projected deficit for the budget year in excess of the applicable maximum deficit amount on september 15 the budget co mmittees would be required to issue reconciliation directiv report specifying the projected excess deficit amount for the budget year the amount by which spending and revenues would need to be changed to eliminate the excess deficit and directives to committees to recommend changes in existing laws within their jurisdiction to eliminate the excess deficit11 the senate budget committeereported amendment would require the amount that each committee would be directed to save throug h legislative change s be proportionate to the amount of direct spendi ng under their jurisdiction committees would be required to sub mit to their respective budget committees their legislative recommendations to meet their reconciliation directives later than 20 days after the directives had been i ssued the budget committees as with the existing reconciliation process then would package these recommendations into an omnibus reconciliation measure and report that measure to their parent chamber the reconciliation measure would be consider ed under expedited procedures that in particular limit debate and amendments in the senate and bar the inclusion of extraneous matter see section reconciliation process below title iii biennial budgeting and appropriations title iii would c onvert the current annual budgetin g and appropriations process to biennial one12 specifically under this proposal in the first session or odd numbered year congress w ould develop and consider budget resolution setting forth sixyear budget plan the upcoming biennium plus the following four fiscal years regular appropriations measures each containing funding for two fiscal years and any reconciliation legisl ation in the second session or evennumbered year congress then would conduct oversight and c onsider authorization measures and any necessary supplemental appropriations billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33547crs5 13 with regard to the national commission on entitlement solvency the senate budget committeereported amendment would prohibit more than two of the three commission members appointed by each person from being affiliated with the same political party 14 any recommendation would have to be approved by at least 10 members of the commissionamong other aspects of converting the ex isting budget process to biennial one under the provisions of s 3521 congress w ould be required to complete action on the budget resolution by may 15 of each odd numbered year instead of by april 15 of each year under existing law in add ition s 3521 would create points of order in the house and senate against the considera tion of any regular ppropriations measure that contained funding for onl the first fiscal year of biennium rather than both years unless funding is needed only for one year and any authorization legislation that did not authorize appropriations for at l east two fiscal years finally as with the current enforcement of the budget resoluti on but reflecting the adoption of biennial budget the budget levels for each fiscal ye ar of the biennium could be enforced through points of order during the c onsideration of budget legislation title iv commissions title iv would create two commissions to examine federal government programs 1 national commission on entitlement solvency and 2 commission on congressional budgetary accountability nd review of federal agencies each commission would be composed of 15 members three members each would be appointed by the president the senate ma jority leader the senate minority leader the house speaker and the house minority leader13 national commission on titlement solvency the national commission on entitlement solvency would be charged with examining the three largest federal entitlement programs 1 social security 2 medicare and 3 medicaid the commissi ons main objective would be to provide by may 1 2007 recommendations to congress to ensure the longterm solvency of these entitlement programs14 under procedures set forth in s 3521 the commissions legislative recommendations w ould be introduced in both chambers referred to the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee reported by such committees with or without amendment and generally considered under expedited procedures on the floor of each chamber in particular consideration on the bill would be limited therefore preventing filibuster in the senate and requiring vote on final passage immediately after debate had concluded and amendments would have to be germane the senate budget committeereported amendment would require that in the senate the bill be recommitted to the senate finance committee or the conference repo rt be recommitted to the conference committee as applicable unless the senate agreed to proceed to final passage the motion to proceed to final passage would re quire the affirmative vote of 60 senatorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33547crs6 15 for further information on similar proposals see crs report rs21980 commission on the accountability and review of federal agencies carfa brief overview of legislative proposals by clinton t brasscommission on congr essional budgetary accountability and review of federal agencies the commission on congressional budget ary accountability and review of federal agencies would be charged with reviewing and possibly modifying the presidents assessment of all federal agency programs15 based on this review the commission could or in some cases would be required to recommend each year over the next four years beginning janua ry 1 2008 the realignment or elimination of any agency program if it is found to be duplicative wasteful or inefficient or outdated irrelevant or failed the commissions legislative recommendations would be considered similarly to the entitlement solvency commissions recommendations described bove including the consid eration limitations with few differences in particular the b ill containing the accountability commissions recommendations would be referred to the appropriate committees but the committees would be prohibited from recommending amendments in addition during the consideration of the bill on the floor of each chamber amendments would be prohibited title v budget process reforms title v of s 3521 makes veral modifications to the existing budget process by amending the congressional budget act of 1974 titles iix of pl 93344 88 stat 297332 specifically the legislati on would make changes related to the budget resolution the reconcilia tion process conference re ports and direct spending legislation in addition s 3521 ame nds 31 usc 1108e regarding agency appropriations reque sts to congress budget resolution the existing budget process requires c ongress to adopt budget resolution each year setting forth aggregate spending and revenue levels and spending levels by major functional categories for at least five fiscal years as mentioned above title iii of s 3521 would require congre ss to adopt budget re solution setting forth budget levels for at least sixyear pe riod ie the upcoming biennium and the following four fiscal years in the first session of each congress title v of s 3521 would make additional changes to the budget resolution and its consideration first s 3521 would require that the budget resolution include the amount of new spending under the jurisdiction of each house and senate committee instead of new spending by major functional category currently the committee spending allocations referred to as 302a llocations are included in the reports accompanying the budget resolution not in the actual text of the budget resolution second under the provisions of s 3521 the consideration of the budget resolutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33547crs7 16 for full discussion of the reconciliation process see crs report rl33030 the budget reconciliation process house and senate procedures by robert keith and bill heniff jrwould be limited in the senate instead of simply the debate with this change once the statutory 50hour limit or the statutor 10hour limit on conference report had expired or was yielded back the sena would proceed to vote on the budget resolution immediately currently because the limitation is on debate only once the 50 hours expires or is yielded back the nate still may consid er amendments and other available motions but without debate leading to what has come to be known as votearama the provisions in s 3521 would prevent votearama finally the proposal would limit consideration of mo tions related to re questing conference with the house to one hour and debate on motion to instruct conferees to 20 minutes equally divided deba on all actions relating to resolving differences with the house on the budget resolution curre ntly is limited to total of 10 hours reconciliation process congress may implement changes to existing law related to direct spending revenues or the debt limit through the reconciliation process under section 310 of the budget act16 the reconciliation process has two stages first congress includes reconciliation direc tives in budget resolution directing one or more committees in each chamber to recommend chan ges in statute to achieve the levels of direct spending revenues debt limit or combination thereof agreed to in the budget resolution second each instructed committee devel ops legislative recommendations to meet its reconciliation directives and reports its legislative recommendations to its respective chamber directly in the case of singlyinstructed committee or transmits such recommendations to its respective budg et committee in the latter case the legislative language r ecommended by committees is packaged without any substantive revision into one or more budg et reconciliation bills as set forth in the budget resolution by the house and senate budget committees the consideration of reconciliation legislation reported in the house or senate is governed by special procedures these procedures serve to limit what may be included in reconciliation gislation prohibit certain amendments and encourage its completion in timely fashion s 3521 proposes to make number of changes to the reconciliation process first under the proposal if committee fa iled to comply with its reconciliation directives the senate budget committee could report amendments within the jurisdiction of the noncompliant committee to achieve compliance as mentioned above the senate budget committee curre ntly may not report any substantive changes to committees legislative recommendations regardless of committee failing to comply with its r econciliation directives second as with the consideration of the budget resolution s 3521 would limit the consideration of reconciliation legislation instead of simply limiting debate thereby preventing votearama at the end of the statutory 20hour limithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33547crs8 17 for detailed information on the byrd rule see crs report rl30862 the budget reconciliation process the senates byrd rule by robert keith 18 the medicare prescription drug improvemen t and modernization act of 2003 pl 108 173 also requires similar medicare funding warning by the board of trustees of each medicare trust fund under procedures specified in title x iii of pl 108173 117 stat 23572364 if medicare funding warning is issued by the trustees the president is required to submit to congress proposed legislation to respond to the warning and such legislation is considered under expedited procedures in the house and senatefinally under the existing byrd rule r econciliation legisla tion or amendments thereto may not contain extraneous matter as defined in section 313 of the budget act17 under the provisions of s 3521 provision that produces budgetary impact which is merely incidental to the nonbudgetary components of the provision would longer be considered extraneous matter not every component of provision therefore would be required to individually have budgetary impact in addition provision increasing direct spendi ng or reducing governmental receipts would be considered extraneous matter if the budget impact of such provision would exceed 20 of the total amount of changes contained in committees directives s 3521 would retain the other current definitions of extraneous matter technical and conforming provisions would not be considered extraneous matter as well conference reports s 3521 creates new point of order agai nst the consideration of conference report unless cost estimate or table by the congressional budget office is available currently section 308a2 of the budget act requires such co st estimate shall be included in the statement of managers if available on timely basis or made available to members as soon as practi cable prior to the consideration of conference report new direct spending point of order tied to medicare spending section 512 of s 3521 would require the senate budget committee chair to submit to the senate notif ication referred to as medicare funding warning when contributions from the general fund of the treasury to medicare would exceed 45 of total medicare outlays within seven years18 the proposal also creates point of order against any legislation that would cause an increase in direct spending net of other changes to direct spending or receipts contained in the measure if notification has been submitted to the senate for two consecutive calendar years motion to waive the new point of order w ould require threefi fths vote 60 votes if there are vacancies the notification would be withdrawn if legislation is enacted that would reduce th contribution of the general fund of the treasury to medicare outlays below the 45 threshold
