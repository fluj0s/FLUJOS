perceived threats and reactions to incidents that required emerge ncy response following world war ii 1939 1946 preparedness evolved from predominantly military concept into joint military and civilian effort to secure the countrys defe nses and protect us citizens activities to prevent or mitigate the consequences of natural disasters resource crises economic disruption industrial or transportation accidents and certain forms of terrorist activity were developed in response to the perceive d threats of the cold war 19451991 between the united states and the soviet union and th eir respective allies disaster preparedness involved the advance planning for coordi nation of public and private resources among federal state territorial local and private ag encies and actors response

significant role in nle events but they typically participate in their capacity as state militia rather than as federal reserve force as such they operate under the control of their state g overnor rather than the department of defense this unique status introduces some ambiguity into methods by which national guard forces are evaluated durin g an nle although they would normally perform their assigned tasks in accordance with the army or air force doctrine91 or joint doctrine if applicable there are certain tasks that would likely be governed or influenced by state guidan ce for example conducting law enforcement or search and rescue activities moreover it is unclear whether participating national guard units would be evaluated by state and local officials using the hseep method by

including 1 whether or how state and local preparedness grows in localities that do not participate in topoffs or future nles and 2 how experiences and knowledge gained from exercises lead to revision of the emergency plans of participating jurisdictions exercises strengthen core functions th at contribute to the success of various preparedness programs95 for example the nations medical and public health systems ability to respond to bioweapons attack has been comprehensively tested through the topoff series and according to some observers s provided several lessons as to how it might respond to future epidemics96 further collaborative relationships which had not existed pr eviously between different levels of government and disparate agencies have developed during topoff exercises for example activities focused on bioterrorism have brought public health officials together with emergency management fire and police department s and medical care providers in active working relationships exercise observers planners and participants generally agree that exercise experiences contribute to overall prepare dness nevertheless the evolution and maturation of emergency pr eparedness doctrine as expressed in nrf nims npg and the hseep method and the emergence of nep may raise number of questions and issues that congress might consider these arise in three broad

private sector actor s is unclear among other concerns the extent to which dhs has implemented the direction set out by congress in the post katrina emergency management reform act as well as whether the nep advances the state of preparedness of the governme nt to respond effectively to emergency management incidents is at issue one challenge is the apparent conflation of authorities requiring preparedness exercises the nep implementation plan attempts to integrate the mandates of two authorities one statute the postkatrina emergency management reform act the other presidential directive hspd 8 while asserting that the nep shall serve as the principal mechanism for 1 examining the preparedness of the usg and its officers and other officials and 2 adopting policy changes that might improve such preparation97 this statement implies the assertion of third executivebased authority either the nep charter or the nep implementation plan itself broadly the focus of the nep implementation plan could bring into question the extent to which the bush administration is implementing exerciserelevant portions of the postkatrina emergency mana gement reform act and hspd 8 the extent to which the nep will become single comprehensive exercise program98 may also be questioned since the nep implementation plan states that the nep is directed at principals of federal agencies and ot her unspecified key officials to link appropriate national and regional exercises but does not explicitly incorporate state territorial local or tribal governme nt participation fina lly the assertion that the nep is the principal mechanism to dopt policy changes raises questions about the role of congress in the evaluation nd development of em ergency preparedness exercise policy further complicating understanding of th nep is the administrationmandated integration of the hspd 8based exercise program and provisions of the post katrina emergency management reform act or some unspecified combination of both as one key pillar of the overarching nep framework called hseep provisions of paragraph 18 of hspd 8 and section 648 of the postkatrina emergency management reform act are similar but some of the exercise parameters mentioned in the statute do not appear to be incorporated into the nep implementation plan for example th postkatrina emergency management reform act

by the postkat rina emergency mana gement reform act implementing preparedness exerci programs which officials the nep implementation plan explicitly ac knowledges the authority of section 648 of the

ability to carry out statutory authority assigned to him by congress to carry out national exercise plan100 for example how does the implementation of hspd8 and the nep implementation plan affect the

exercise pursuant to his postkatrina emergency management reform act authority how might the secretary of dhs balance authorities and mandates conferred by the president with the statutory obligations

common vehicle standards from state to state and the pot ential need to obtain waivers and proper credentials for vehicles traveling through two or more states route to an incident could impair the speed of emergency response134 congress might consider oversight approaches that could define and address the extent of this potential challenge or legislative options that could addr ess concerns that are identified exercise operations exercise realism while goal may be to make an fse as realistic as possible exercises usually must be r without interrupting routine daytoday operations135 or jeopardizing public safety some portions of some exercises must be simulated to replicate the activities decisions policies and procedures of entities that are unable to fully participate while every effort is made to provide realistic environment in which to exercise the necessity of simulating certain events or actions and the incomplete participation of assets that would respond to an actual event may have an impact on the ability to fully prepare participants or to plan corrective actions to incorporate into preparedness plans or future exercises further when exercise participants know that they are conducting an exercise it may be that players do not fully accept the premises of exercise play or that the exercise experience cannot replicate the stress and confusion that likely would accompany an actual event lack of realworld connection in an exercise scenario could alter the actions of exercise players similarly an inability to shut down critical infrastructures such as transportation or communications networks public facilities or geographic regions during exercise play also may further compromise exercise realism and consequen tly the lessons that might be drawn

carry out exercisespecific duties may not have th benefits of exercising their incident response responsibilities137 additionally when agency leadership roles are simulated or played by officials who woul d not lead response to an actual incident the effectiveness of exercises as tools to enhance preparedness among officials with principal response functi ons may be questioned nonotice exercises observers note that nonotice exercises can provide an accurate picture of how well the federal government can both coordinate the actions of its own agencies and work collaboratively with state and local governments in responding to catastrophe138 the postkatrina emergency management reform act requi res that all national exerci ses be carried out with minimum degree of notice to involved pa rties regarding th timing and details139 the nep implementation pla n however requires only one nonotice tier ii federal interagency exercise in each fiveyear strategic exercise cycle since many incidents occur with little or notice it is arguable that failing to incorporate the element of surprise into exercise planning could re duce the ability of response officials to carry out exercises under more rea listic conditions or to depl oy response resources in complex and dynamic incident the inherent challenges to initiating resource intensive governmentwide exercises such as nles however lead many observers to argue that nonotice provisions cannot be met due to the scale of an nle and the extensive staff support required from par ticipating entities over period of many months in particular state territorial local and tribal entities that wish to participate in an nle must allocate resources through their respective budget processes well in advance of their participation or risk disrupting the regular duties of available first responders140 congress might examine the issue of nonotice exercise training in an effort to balance the demands of effective emergency preparedness training on the one hand and the challenges raised by incorporating nonfederal participants into broader exercise programs on the other scale and scope of exercises related to the issue

participants spent more that two years on topoff 4 from initial planning through the pr eparation of aars nd implementation of improvement plans focusing on the fse one exercise participant said we believe exercises can be more effective when they are designed to meet more focused objectives targeted toward fewer participants and shorter in duration government seems to believe that exercises must include everyone and take at least week to conduct we realiz there may be benefits from being allinclusive but the result is less effective training than might be achieved through more frequent smaller exercise s that are focused on specific groups this allows for the development of an exercise with realistic scenario that maximizes the value for the exercise participants142 concerns have also been expressed that exercise scenarios have been adapted to allow some federal participants place to participat within an exercise with little clear connection between thei r response capability and the stated goals or underlying scenario of the exercise143 similar concerns could be raised about the nep in general and nles in particular exercise fatigue the nep was developed in pa rt to address the challenge of exercise fatigue exercise fatigue is said to occur when multiple exercises require ongoing demands on an entitys limited time and resources the nep implementation plan argues that the fatigue factor is exacerbated when exercise activities do not contribute to appreciable improvements in intergovernmental coordination exercise policies plan s or emergency response performance144 exercise fatigue may also be complicated by the perception that some of the 15 national planning scenarios which argu ably have relatively low likelihood of occurring may receive more attention than scenarios based on events that occur with greater frequency but that are arguably less sensational topoff 4 participants noted that the exercise scen ario involving the explosion of radiological dispersion device rdd in the portland oregon area was unrealistic and that floods such as those experienced in oregon after the topoff 4 fse are more likely to necessitate emergency response the transition from the topoff series which congress required to focus on terrorism to nles based on the nps145 which incorporates all hazards may address some of these concer ns on the other hand it could be argued that preparedness training for less likely scenarios is necessary to build public confidence or due to the pot ential scope of disruption nd the high economic social and political costs of not preparing if an incident were to occur some observers and preparedness official s focusing on the process of exercise development argue that exercises and the underlying scenarios may not be as valuable as the planning process in which an exercise is developed observers asserthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34737crs38 146 arjen boin paul t hart er ic stern and bengt

example it is likely that the response to wmd or natural disa ster incident would include first responder services from police fires and emergency medical resources other target capabilities that may be somewhat scen ario neutral include law enforcement and investigation prevention medical services secu ring the scene of an incident intelligence sharing and communications to the public 150 ngb briefing august 5 2008that this is due in part to behavior during an incident wh crisis plans rarely occupy centre stage in the heat of the moment146 during the planning phase of an exercise preparedness officials assert that exercise participants may receive technical assistance critically examine their plans or interact with other entities to develop exercise response operations which could contribute to preparedness147 although the extent of that contribution may be ques tionable if communications processes among exercise participants are problematic some have raised concerns that exercise scenarios based on relatively low likelihood incidents may overpre pare responders for incident s that are rare or have never actually occurred while underprepa ring responders for more frequently occurring events148 at the same time while there are likely differences in the substantive response to an improvised nucl ear device ind or other wmd they are also likely to require some of the same target capabilities as those required to respond to cyber attack or natural disaster149 as the nep is more fully implemented congress might consider the extent to which the nep has incorporated the all hazards orientation of the postkatrina emergency management reform act into its exercise schedule evaluating exercises exercises are designed in part to demonstrate capabilities and to reveal areas of defici ency in emergency response in some military exercises capabilities may be demonstrated or deficiencies identified by exercising to failure150 or thoroughly practicing pa rticular response until all of its weaknesses are identified while most civilian exercises are designed to test and demonstrate response capabilities they do not incorporate exercise to failure despite postkatrina emergency mana gement reform act requirements that some exercises be designed to stress the nps the identification of capabilities on which to build or deficiencies through an evaluation pr ocess and the publication of some findings through public aar as required by th hseep method may raise challenges if exercise participants have not adequately exercised their plans or are concerned about potential consequences as result of negative evaluations as result there may be incentives for some exercise pla nners to understate exercise objectives overstate the extent to which those objectives are met or to downplay or omit deficiencies that are identified any of those approaches arguably undermines the effectiveness of exercises as tools to prepare for an incident or to evaluate an entitys capacity to respond to an incident congre ss might inquire if omissions are occurringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34737crs39 151 zack phillips disaster drills practice doesnt make

the storm see us congress senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs hurricane katrina nation still unprepared 109th cong 2nd sess srept 109322 washington gpo continuedin the exercise evaluation process and the purposes of such omissions if they are occurring another area of potential concern is the nature of the exercise evaluation process the hseep method does not pr ovide common benchmar ks or metrics to apply in the evaluation of an exerci moreover under the hseep method exercises are typically evaluated by the sa group that designs the exercise this approach which extends beyond the nep to any entity that uses the hseep method may be problematic if the evaluators fail to critically assess their own program congress might inquire if lfevaluations inhibit the evaluators objectivity toward the exercise or whether exercises may need to be rigorously evaluated through an external independent evaluati on process to gain more accurate insight into response capabilities and deficiencies151 given the specialized nature of exercise development it is unclear whether qualified external evaluators would be readily available to every entity that exercises it could be argued that the public diss emination of deficiencies through the aar process or the use of external evalua tion may inform adve rsaries of potential vulnerabilities if that is the case then congress could consider methods to secure exercise information and restrict its distri bution to appropriate recipients model of tiered distribution has been used by dhs to provide topoff 4 after action materials this includes three separate quick lookaars including versions for the public152 participants and the broader responder community final draft aar which will be provided to the head of participating entity has not been released at the time of this writing the current pproach may have limited utility as means of communication some state and local to poff 4 participants who developed their own aars have not been provided with dr aft or final copies of the participant version the lack of access to exerci review materials could impair the effectiveness of the hseep method evalua tion process and create challenges for exercise participants who wish to incorporate broad feedback into their exercise improvement programs relatedly congress might question the extent to which deficiencies identified in exercises are addressed and whether corrective actions are integrated into emergency management planning documents and processes for example it has been reported that hurricane preparedne ss exercise known as hurricane pam held in july 2004 identified many of the probl ems that occurred wh hurricane katrina struck new orleans in august 2005153 despite the exercise

they did not have sufficient funding to implement an of the findings from the hurricane pam exercise into standing response plans155 congress might inquire as to the extent to which the findings derived from exercises are being assimilated into emergency planning and the nature and extent of impediments to such actions how national is the nep the development of the nep framework appears to

that staff the nep executive steering committee has not been identified while this precludes their evaluation their participation in the drg ee subpcc sugge sts an awareness of exercise planning matters it is unclear how information nd expectations are communicated to federal agencies that do not participate in the processes described in the nep implementation plan as discussed above the lack of clear connection between the nep and state territorial local and tribal government ex ercise programs may also raise questions about the reach of the program nep opportunity costs for existing agency exercise activities in various nep presentations in 2006 and 2007 it was indicated that agencylevel exercise programs that do not necessa rily fall under the nep framework would continue156 the nep charter asserts that the program shall not replace existing federal executive agency exercise programs but may incorporate agencyspecific exercises as needed157 the nep implementation plan issued in 2008 however appears to provide ambiguous potentially c onfusing guidance nep is intended to provide framework for prioritizing and focusing federal exercise activities without replacing any indivi dual department or agency exercise program nep incorporates hseep exercise program as well as other department and agency exercise programs and all departments and agencies shall have an have an

httpwwwfemagovpdfemergencynrf nrfesfintropdfii events158 the nep implementation plan does not specify what other department and agency exercise programs are incorporated consequently the effect if any it will have on agenci abilities to c onduct exercises in addition to their nep responsibilities cannot be determined possible consequence of mandating agen cy participation in the nep is that existing agency exercise programs may need to shift the focus of their activities to internal exercises that prepare an agency to participate in nep exercises this preparation may come at the cost of other exercise activities that an agency may be required to complete or otherwise deem im portant but that either do not fall within the purview of the nep or that are not exercised regularly through an nle this may be of particular concern in two instances at the federal level in the first instance some agencies may not integrat emergency response training and exercise preparation into their daytoday activities if they are not included in nep activities their capacity to respond to an incident may be impaired in the second instance agencies with emergency support function esf159 responsibility may be limited in their ability to exercise with interagenc partners because th eir tier ii exercise nominations are not incorporated into the ne p or the exercise scenario for an nle does not necessitate response in their area of esf responsibility potential consequence might be that wh ile the nep establishes government wide exercise program the combination of limited governmentwide exercises potential resource transfer from other preparedness or exercise programs to meet nep requirements and the use of exercise scenarios for which some agencies have responsibility
