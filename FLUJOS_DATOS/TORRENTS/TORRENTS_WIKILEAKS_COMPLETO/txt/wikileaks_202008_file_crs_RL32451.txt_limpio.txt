distribution of funding background the legal services corporation lsc is private nonprofit organization created and funded by congress to provide legal assistance to lowincome people in civil matters the lsc is governed by bipartisan 11member board of directors nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate more than six members of the board may be of the same political party authorizing legislation for the legal services corporation lsc was enacted in 1974 pl 933551 in 1977 congress extended the legal services corporation act through fy1980 pl 95 222 although congress has not reauthorized the lsc statute since fy1980 it has continued to fund the lsc every year and has included legislative language affecting lsc activities in annual appropriations laws prohibitions since its inception the legal services program has been controversial and congress has imposed restrictions on the activities of local attorneys the authorizing statute pl 93355 enacted july 25 1974 contains restrictions against lobbying political activities class actions except under certain conditions and cases involving abortion school desegregation and draft registration or desertion from the military additional restrictions have been included in appropriations laws each year under the current appropriations law pl 108199 enacted january 23 2004 lsc grantees may not engage in partisan litigation related to redistricting attempt to influence regulatory legislative or adjudicative action at the federal state or local level attempt to influence oversight proceedings of the lsc initiate or participate in any class action suit represent certain categories of aliens except that nonfederal funds may be used to represent aliens who have been victims of domestic violence or child abuse conduct advocacy training on public policy issue or encourage political activities strikes or demonstrations claim or collect attorneys fees engage in litigation related to abortion represent clients in eviction proceedings if the eviction was based on drugrelated activities represent federal state or local 1 the federal government has administered program of legal services for the poor since 1966 originally the program was administered through the office of economic opportunity nowdefunct agency that had spearheaded the war on poverty in the mid 1960s in 1971 president nixon proposed establishment of separate corporation to deliver legal services to insulate the program from political pressure crs2 prisoners participate in efforts to reform federal or state welfare system2 or solicit clients also lsc grantees may not file complaints or engage in litigation against defendant unless each plaintiff is specifically identified and statement of facts is prepared signed by the plaintiffs kept on file by the grantee and made available to any federal auditor or monitor lsc grantees must establish priorities and staff must agree in writing not to engage in activities outside these priorities federal law prohibits lsc from receiving nonfederal funds and grantees are prohibited from receiving nonlsc funds unless the source of funds is told in writing that these funds may not be used for any activities prohibited by the lsc act or the appropriations law however grantees may use nonlsc funds to comment on proposed regulations or respond to written requests for information or testimony from federal state or local agencies or legislative bodies as long as the information is provided only to the requesting agency and the request is not solicited by the lsc grantee grantees are required to maintain timekeeping records and account for any nonfederal funds received competitive bidding process the primary responsibility of the lsc is to manage and oversee the congressionallyappropriated federal funds that it distributes in the form of grants to local legal services providers which in turn give civil legal assistance to lowincome clients in every county in the united states the district of columbia as well as in the five us territories of american samoa guam puerto rico the virgin islands and micronesia since april 1996 pursuant to pl 104134 lsc grantees ie legal services agenciesproviders have been selected on competitive basis3 under this competitive process legal services providers in every jurisdiction bid to become the lsc grantee for designated service area the number of service areas in each state varies greatly in california there are currently 33 services areas whereas delaware has two service areas and the district of columbia and most of the territories have one service area the exception is puerto rico which has three service areas as noted in the section below entitled reconfiguration state planners and the lsc continue to evaluate the lsc grant structure and thus the number of service areas in any given state including the district of columbia or territory is subject to change 2 on feb 28 2001 the supreme court held in the case of legal services corporation v velazquez 121 s ct 1043 2001 that an lsc funding restriction related to welfare reform violates the first amendment ie freedom of speech rights of lsc grantees and their clients and is thereby unconstitutional the supreme court agreed with the second circuit courts ruling that by prohibiting lscfunded attorneys from litigating cases that challenge existing welfare statutes or regulations congress had improperly prohibited lawyers from presenting certain arguments to the courts which had the effect of distorting the legal system and altering the traditional role of lawyers as advocates for their clients 3 this system supplanted the previous system of presumptive refunding for lsc grantees the lsc is prohibited from granting any preference to current or previous grantees of lsc funds section 503e of pl 104134 enacted apr 26 1996 crs3 during the competition process the lsc evaluates applications according to established quality standards and awards grants to those providers judged best qualified to provide highquality legal services in accordance with applicable legal requirements federal regulations title 45 cfr part 1634 stipulate the procedures to be followed in awarding lsc grants grants are made for one to three years multiyear awardees must submit reports and grant renewal forms as part of the annual grant renewal process in fy2004 of the 212 service areas that received lsc grants 18 had new service providers data are based on comparison of lsc grant awards in fy2000 and fy2004 current funding in fy2004 the lsc distributed 3166 million of its 3353 million appropriation in the form of grants to 143 local legal services programs remaining funds were allocated for management and administration 132 million information technology 29 million and the office of the inspector general 26 million lsc funding accounts for about half of all funding in the us for civil legal services for the poor see discussion of nonlsc funding below in fy2004 approximately 43 million persons were potentially eligible for lscfunded assistance using the 125 of poverty definition grantees the lsc does not provide legal services directly rather it funds local legal services providers which are referred to by the lsc as grantees grantees may include nonprofit organizations that have as purpose the provision of legal assistance to eligible clients private attorneys groups of private attorneys or law firms state or local governments and certain substate regional planning and coordination agencies each local legal services program is headed by its own board of directors of whom about 60 are lawyers admitted to state bar and onethird are eligible clients each local program must spend an amount equal to at least 125 of its basic grant to encourage participation by private attorneys in the delivery of legal services to lowincome clients4 local programs establish their own eligibility criteria which may not exceed 125 of the federal poverty guidelines these local programs provide legal assistance to individuals based on locally determined priorities that meet local community conditions and needs local programs hire staff contract with local attorneys and develop pro bono programs for the direct delivery of legal assistance to eligible clients although the lsc is the main source of funds for legal services to the poor in most states it is not the only source of funding local legal services programs generally supplement their lsc grants with additional funds from state and local governments iolta interest on lawyer trust accounts programs other federal 4 the private attorney involvement pai funds have been primarily used to promote pro bono service with joint sponsorship between local bar association and lsc grantee as result about 130000 private attorneys are now registered as volunteer attorneys in lsc funded pro bono programs currently there are about 350 pai programs crs4 programs such as the title xx social services block grant bar associations united way and other charitable organizations foundations and corporations and individual donors they further leverage federal funds by involving private attorneys in the delivery of legal services for the poor mostly through volunteer pro bono work according to the lsc fy2005 budget request lsc funding makes up about half of all funding for the national civil legal services system for the poor reconfiguration beginning in july 1995 in anticipation of funding cutbacks the lsc started formulating plan to provide states with an array of strategies by which the legal services programs in the state could stretch federal dollars the lscs state planning initiative was formally introduced in 1998 according to lsc special report to congress until the implementation of the state planning initiative determining service areas in given state was more product of geographic and historical happenstance than reasoned judgment about the precise configuration that would yield the best legal services system for the greatest number of clients with fewer resources to expend and growing client base to serve lsc has embraced service area reconfiguration as one important way to insure that grants and contracts are made so as to provide the most economical and effective delivery of legal assistance to persons in both urban and rural areas5 the number of grantees receiving lsc funding decreased from 325 in 1995 to 262 in 1998 to 207 in 2001 to 170 in 2002 to 161 in 2003 to 143 in 2004 the reduction in the number of local programs is due to both cutbacks in funding and lscinitiated reconfiguration of the lsc program in which states were urged to merge reorganize and consolidate local programs into more efficient regional and statewide delivery system of legal services to the poor in congressional testimony the lsc chairman and the lsc president stated that the state planning initiative directed all lsc programs to develop comprehensive plans to coordinate and integrate their work in seven areas expanding client access and efficiency utilizing technology to expand access and enhance services promoting client selfhelp and preventative legal education and advice coordinating legal work and training collaborating with the private bar and other community stakeholders expanding grantees resource development efforts and configuring lsc service areas in more efficient and effective manner to enhance client services and reduce barriers to assistance6 5 legal services corporation special report to congress state planning and reconfiguration sept 2001 pp 23 10 6 testimony in us congress house appropriations subcommittee on commerce justice state the judiciary and related agencies submitted by lsc chairman frank b strickland and lsc president helaine m barnett apr 1 2004 p 8 at httpwwwlscgovpressr pr_t_040104htm hereafter cited as testimony by lsc chairman and president crs5 according to the 2001 lsc special report to congress the lsc has used its competitive bidding process to ensure that grantees improve and expand legal services to clients in their respective states many policymakers and program analysts agree that even with reduced financing grantees have managed to lessen geographic disparities for clients living in remote or underserved areas while simultaneously making the entire legal delivery system for the poor more efficient by merging small legal services programs with larger programs by providing selfrepresented pro litigants with accurate and easily understood legal information by promoting the use of videoconferencing by courts to enable witnesses with transportation challenges to testify and by using technology to improve case management and intake systems in fy2004 143 grantees were serving 212 service areas even though lsc grantees are becoming more efficient in stretching reduced funding the ratio of attorneys to clients has diminished substantially when the lsc was established in 1974 its foremost goal was to provide all lowincome persons with at least minimum access to legal services this was defined as the equivalent of one legal services attorney for every 5000 poor persons the goal of minimum access was achieved in fy1980 and fy1981 currently in most states there is only one legal services attorney for every 11500 poor persons clients legal services provided through lsc funds are available only in civil matters to individuals with incomes less than 125 of the federal poverty guidelines the lsc places primary emphasis on the provision of routine legal services and the majority of lscfunded activities involve routine legal problems of lowincome people legal services cases deal with variety of issues including family related issues divorce separation child custody support adoption spousal abuse child abuse or neglect housing issues evictions foreclosures welfare or other income maintenance program issues access to health care benefit claims consumer and finance issues debt collection and individual rights employment health juvenile and education most cases are resolved outside the courtroom eg via legal advice referrals telephone calls by attorneys which is very costeffective approach to settling legal matters according to testimony before the house appropriations committee on april 1 2004 by the lsc chairman and the lsc president lsc clients represent the diversity of this country encompassing all races ethnic groups and ages they include the working poor veterans family farmers people with disabilities and victims of natural disasters about threequarters of lscs client population are women many with young children almost 11 are elderly about onequarter is africanamerican about 20 is hispanic and approximately 2 are native american and another 2 are asian or pacific islander in origin7 7 testimony by lsc chairman president p 6 crs6 lsc grantees close about 1 million cases annually 935793 cases were closed in 2003 in addition to handling another 4 million legal service matters such as helping selfrepresented ie pro litigants obtain the information they need to pursue their lawsuit disseminating legal services materials in communities referring clients to appropriate services providing mediation assistance etc in 2004 there were approximately 43 million persons who were potentially eligible for lscfunded services using the 125 of poverty definition data from the lsc suggest that only about 20 of persons eligible for lscfunded services actually had access to those services when they needed them based on geographic boundaries service areas funding local priorities etc funding for fy2004 table 1 shows lsc appropriations for selected years from fy1976 first full year of program operations to fy2004 recent funding for the lsc has leveled off but current funding still remains below the lscs highest level of 400 million in fy1994 and fy1995 for more information on lsc appropriations see crs report 95178 legal services corporation basic facts and current status table 1 lsc appropriations history selected years fy fy fy fy 1976 92

million for fy2004 after 059 governmentwide acrosstheboard rescission and 0465 rescission of funding for the commerce justice state judiciary and related agencies appropriation which includes the lsc the lsc appropriation included 3166 million for grants to local legal services providers to provide legal assistance to clients of this amount 3141 million was based on the statutory requirement that lsc grants be distributed on per capita basis with regard to poor persons in the us and territories8 and an 8 the lsc is required pl 104134 section 501 to use the most recent decennial us census data when it distributes federal funds appropriated for the purpose of providing civil legal assistance to the poor the lsc grants for fy2003 were the first to be based on the 2000 census data the 2000 us census reported 575 increase in americas overall poverty population from 1990 to 2000 since lsc distributes basic field grants on per capita basis grantees with client poverty populations that increased by less than 575 lost funding crs7 additional 25 million was distributed to the 10 states9 that faced the largest losses resulting from reallocation of funds based on decennial census 2000 information as table 2 shows in fy2004 the lsc distributed 316604 million of its 335300 million appropriation in the form of grants to 143 local legal services programs which operated in more than 900 neighborhood offices the remainder of the lscs fy2004 appropriation was allocated for management and administration 13160 million information technology 2945 million and the office of the inspector general 2573 million10 as shown in chart 1 the lsc spends less than 4 of its appropriation on management and administration 1 on information and technology 1 on the office of inspector general and the remaining 94 on local legal services programs table 2 also shows lsc spending per poor person in each of the states the district of columbia and the territories for fy2004 the variation occurs because some jurisdictions lost funding because their poverty populations increased by less than the nationwide increase during the period from 19902000 some jurisdictions gained funding because their poverty populations increased by more than the nationwide increase during the period from 19902000 some states were given additional funding to offset losses due to censusbased lsc funding adjustments resulting from the change in poverty population during the period 19902000 and the poverty counts are derived differently for alaska hawaii the republic of palau the federated states of micronesia the republic of the marshall islands and the united states virgin islands table 2 indicates that the average amount of lsc funding per poor person nationwide was 878 in fy200411 the comparable figure in fy1994 was 1260 if adjusted for inflation in 2004 dollars based on the consumer price index for all urban consumers the decline in lsc spending per poor person over the period 19942004 is more pronounced from 1608 in 1994 to 878 in 2004 9 in 2004 the 10 states that received additional funds based on redistribution of the poverty population during the period 19902000 were michigan ohio louisiana mississippi illinois kentucky wisconsin minnesota pennsylvania and iowa 10 the lsc currently employs 94 fulltime staff in addition the lscs inspector generals office currently employs 17 fulltime staff 11 the reader should note that this per capita figure may be somewhat overstated because some states received additional funding based on the redistribution of the poverty population the lsc fy2005 budget request indicates that lsc funding per poor person amounted to 854 in fy2004 crs8 table 2 legal services corporation funding by jurisdiction fy2004 poverty lsc number population
