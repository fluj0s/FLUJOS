auditing by lists lecture given on 16 april 1964 thank you whats the date audience 16th of april sixteenth of april have to make you work for this lecture one way or the other ad 14 saint hill special briefing course how are you today audience all right fine good all right well i havent anything to talk to you today about youre all doing marvelously you just couldnt do better unless you began to audit and all the departments are going well they even tell theres going to be checkout in week or two in practical yes things are looking up looking up there is one good news item which is marvelous is apparently the auditor is going across with smashthe new magazine and we almost never have reader mail on these national magazines and so forth or pabs nobody ever bothers to write they write on other lines you know but they almost never mention these magazines and its very peculiar that the auditor on its first issue immediatelycrash bang you see letters pouring in to the editor and everything going off with bang and crash and thud so we launched that one into an aura of great success so lets hope the whole auditors division goes ahead along that line lets hope they all go along with great success and lot of us were on to that publication and we have the magic key there all right now i hope the situations in class vi are going to remedy anytime now and some of you are going to get brave enough to really go out and confront the tiger ive been swamping up any little odd bit or piece that you might collide with its down to point now where collision with an error or an oddity wouldnt do too much to your pc anyway youd catch it in due course but thats pretty well ready to go thats pretty well ready to go and i want to see some of those class vi students here really moving up becausedont look so palebecause itjust because couple of them got moved back off for inadequate ta division and so forth it just shows you something i had lot of people finding goals on this and they never found out that one of the series is nonexistent very interesting to i mean i do this all the time i mean im working in some particular field and theres some glaring error to be found there and so forth and nobody ever finds it and it drives ahead into zones and areas of greater responsibility and you really bog down with responsibility and so forth because i figure if i made an error youd go along till heck was pup before youd ever turn it up and yeah itsreally saddles with one you know its serious situation as result when i audit i audit the bank and the pc and all the future mistakes youre going to make and it makes my auditing quite difficult but this area is pretty well swamped out now and pretty straight and ive gotten into zone now of overcorrection im now having made one little slipsee i didnt release it i was going to recheck it before i released everything and then before i released it ion the recheck why i found out there was an error and there was also bit of line plot error there was word or so missing out of the line plot but im now into an area where im overcorrecting you see what i mean i mean you do this with pc every once in while you can also do it with piece of research you find out that it was the break of reality which upset the pc you see and then you go on looking see and if you go on looking far enough youll have the pc upset all over again see you get your good indicators back in and then you go looking for something that is wrong ive now done this with some of our upperlevel materials and so forth ive gone so far looking for something wrong dont you see that now all i can find is invalidation of whats right but youre in very good shape this way and things are all fine i want to see some auditing teams going on it and why id say now that we lie about 200 to 300 hours of auditing from ot for about at least 30 percent of the people im looking at right this minuteproviding providing providing you audit thats necessary i want to talk to you todaythose were all just announcements and so forthi want to talk to you today about auditing by lists and im getting so tired of writing somebody in north darwin you know you dont dare go too north in darwin you get your feet wet you know and somebody here and somebody there somebody on course writing down the explicit directions of how you audit by list that i think i had better make it public property i think that might be very good idea im not yet in position where i can release the whole of auditing by lists because we havent you know cleared up and straightened up all the lists by which you audit now sherlock holmes used to turn to dr watson every once in while and say watson the needle you know he used to turn around once in while and hed say this you see and watson was supposed to give him the needle but level iii is the needle level thats the needle level level ii and lower are tonearm levels and your first level that pays any attention to the needleexcept to use it for centering the tone armis iii now thats very important because thats your hcahpa level now as you realize now coauditor can be known by the fact that at this level he has an hca certificate and classified auditor can be known because at this level he has an hpa certificate were separating them right there so you better get your certificates turned in and straightened out anyway very very careful study very careful studyof auditors and auditing lies behind all of these level divisions and with great deal of skilland it does require apparently great deal of skillonce person is accustomed to auditing pc he can then learn how to use needle now very few auditors who are simply monkeying around with the tone arm and so forth are aware of the amount of skill necessary to use needle let tell you some of the difficulties of using needle needle unlike tone arm can be upset by the pcs reaction to the auditing session or questionunlike the tone arm now you cant tell really from the tone arm action whether or not the pc is upset or anything else and the pc might very well be upset but it doesnt reflect in the tone arm action you say well yes and so forth it would go up but im afraid that isnt constant manifestation at all i know pc who whenever she gets mad in session has ta blowdown ive seen pcs blow their tas down by protesting ive seen all kinds of wild things happen to ta so ta is actually not direct representation of the reaction of the pc to the session whether you get ta action or not is but after all thats twoandahalfhour look isnt it well of course you pick it up within twenty minutes or somethinglike that that he isnt getting ta action but it really doesnt say whether or not the process is wrong or theor the pcs reaction is wrong it doesnt really tell you why why youre getting tone arm action in other words the tone arm does not analyze the session beyond saying whether or not the pc is getting gain but it doesnt analyze the session because the pc may not be getting gain because youre running the wrong process so therefore it is not direct indicator on the subject of the sessiona tone arm is notbecause it includes the process the process has great deal to do with it well not so needle you start the action known as cleaning needle and you immediately run into the fact that the needle first and foremost registers the session and secondarily registers the process or reaction of the pc your first needle reaction is session now the only difficult manifestation of needle for an auditor to learn to cope with is what is called dirty needle now lets take this as the crudest manifestationthe dirty needle now theres very few auditors are ever sufficiently selfflagellantish to recognize the source of dirty needle the source of the dirty needle is always the auditor its never anything else its always the auditor if youve got little zzizzzzizz you know your needle is going ticketytick zizzizzzzzzzizzzizzbzzzbzzbzbzbz just little shaky shaky bzzand slow or fastits little shaky bzzzzz its going up and down and so on and so on its not lying there calmly like its asleep its lying there as though its got st vitus dance this thing can only be as wide by the way as an eighth of an inch or something like that but its still dirty needle that dirty needle is always traceable back to the auditors failure to handle the auditing comm cycle one way or the other or to handle an auditing cyclewhich is process or something but the pc is reacting to the auditors disability to audit the auditors done something now dont think every auditor is allis sooner or later going to come out to point where he never has dirty needle this is not an attainable absolute because the auditor varies in his emotional stresses in sessions and the auditor is trying to get something done hes completely out of sympathy with this pc who is just giving him the 5765th problem when all hes trying to do is to find out if the pc has suppressed anything and the pc is going on at mad rate nevertheless it is the auditors reaction that gives the dirty needle you would not get the dirty needle just because the pc is going on endlessly not following the process but when you bring up the pc with dull thud by failing to acknowledge by insisting the pc answer something by chopping his communication in some particular fashion by not accepting his answerany way that you could possibly interrupt the comm cycleyoull see magically appear before you dirty needle in other words the pc could have done the wildest and most incredible things on process level without acquiring dirty needle and gets dirty needle the moment that the auditor gives them bad time or chops them or squares it up or does an unsmooth action so there is little piece of evidence that you yourself will see from time to time if you care to observe it it might be good thing for you to observe it occasionally because you will never do level iv assessment unless you standunderstand the level iii skills of the needle level iii is almost totally devoted to needle if you follow the needle you will get tone arm action if you dont handle the needle you wont get tone arm action now the pclet us say we have question here do birds fly and the pc has charge on this question there isnt anything in this question at alldo birds fly theres nothing to this question the pc doesnt care about birds he hasnt any answer to it he has interest in it of any kind whatsoever so you say do birds fly and the needle registers absolutely nothing its completely smooth flow and at that moment you went slightly crosseyed and you didnt see that it had very smooth flow so you decided to ask the question again and you say do birds fly and thats it youve had it its sort of not handling the pcs answer anyhow its actually not taking the needle reaction which was there to be had you simply didnt see it so you forced this question down the pcs neck even if you say that was equivocal i will have to ask it again well usually that gets you over the hump but not always so we asked this question again do birds fly and at this moment the pc said oh blankto himself and you get that registering on the needle now the uninformed auditor believes at this point that he missed the read the first time and now has read he doesnt bother to clean up the pcs considerations but he assumes that he now has read on do birds fly so he is going to clean this question now remember what i told you the first reaction of needle is to the session and the second reaction of the needle is to the question so the auditor has assumed nowbypassing the possibility that it was session reactionhe has assumed that he has hot question because the needle ticked so he says well it read the pc said i dont have birds flybluaaaaah yeah but it read oh it read oh oh i guess lets see do birds fly i havent got any birds lets see do they fly or not fly and so on oooooooh lets see hmmmmoooooh lets see do birds flyduhdaduhdadada and you get the standard resession reaction that some people like to think of as auditing see youve turned it on right there pcs out of session hes not interested in what youre doing now you could sit there and you ask do birds fly and youre going to get bigger and bigger and bigger reaction to this question every time you ask the question youre going to get more reaction to the question because your needle reacts first to the session and second to the process now the auditor eventually gets into an arc break situation let us say the pc explodes all over the place he eventually gets list 1 and he starts down list 1 and he clears up the arc break and finally and so forth and then he gets smooth needle again but supposing this auditor never had learned anything about cleaning up needle or that the needle reaction was primary to the session and secondary to the process and lets supposing the auditor hadnt any clue about any of this while hes doing the arc break assessment he does the same thing he gets the wrong level or something of that sort and he does it once more therefore you dont let auditors at level iii assess anything this takes senior understanding now if the pc has already been upset it will be because the auditor could not handle the needle to let that auditor now do an arc break assessment on the pc is going to result in multiplication of the arc break because this auditor has already not handled the needle and handling an arc break is process of handling needle thats technique of handling needle you see now even an experienced auditorive seen them goof an arc break something marvelous just wrap it around couple of telegraph poles and leave it there in pile of junk arc break the pc on an arc break assessment pc all of sudden originates and he says well the charge was soandso that was what it was brightens up everything is fine and the auditor goes back to the question he is trying to clean the pc now protests this question because it wasnt that question it was the other question so it makes it seem to the pc that the auditor has not received his communication so he gets dirty choppedup needle the auditor tries to ask this question has communication been ignored and of course this question is being protested by the pc so you get bigger read on it and the auditor insists that the bypassed charge is an ignored communication the pc is trying to insist that it was broken reality and between the two of them they stir up the most gorgeous arc break you ever saw in your life you see how this goes all you have to recognize about needle is that the needle first and foremost reflects the condition of the session and secondarily reflects other things that youre flicking and ticking at now youre very very lucky to have mark v meter early meters were about as sensitive as nazi you got nothing out of them in fact i have seen meters that had been manufactured out from under so lousy so horrible and so on that you practically could short the electrodes now the meters which are beingyou know reactionthe meters which are being used by infantry in vietnam to hand to the communist fellow traveler who has just come from general headquarterswhatever it isthis meter if it isnt copy of the mark v would be complete bust they dont know what this thing is supposed to be all about they have real clue when you get your lie detector buzzards going around and your medics fooling around with thing called the mindthey know what mind is its something you attack with scalpel and sawwhen you get theseits very hard for to use just pleasant language in dealing with it and weve got one down which reg bought at vast expenseand im awfully glad weve got it though its still around the place it is medical doctors emeter marvelous thing i dont know what its supposed to tell but its marvelous there is way you can reduce the sensitivity on the confounded thing and its geared up to read horses or mules or something i dont know what it is but all that needle does is bounce from both sides and so on on body motion it wont give you anything but body motion it has faintest mental reaction traceable on it anyplace if somebody moves his foot across the room from the person handling the electrodes this thing falls three and four dials you think im kidding man but you ought to see that thing it is an absolute beast the medical doctors emeters actually even the sensitivity has nothing to do with it it doesntit isnt how sensitive the meter is that makes it good meter somebody can throw together some old pots and tin cans and so forth and say this is an emeter and you look at it and you squeeze the cans and oh man it flies all over the place that factorthe looseness of the needledoes not establish whether or not your emeter is an operative meter nor the inactivity of the needle as some of these old pots and so forth that were counterfeited up the line in the earlier daysthat doesnt establish it either an emeter must measure mental reaction with minimum of physical reaction and that is the trick and thats the design of the mark v now the mark v will register an analytical and slightly subreaction it is geared up so that if the pc has reality on what youve asked him you will get read on that thing on the meter see thats very beautifully balanced little situation and were very lucky it took years to evolve this meter but its careful balance out of these factors every time somebody says lets get new meter i throw up my hands in horror i remember theresthere is civilization few galaxies over here thatits got spaceships and backpacks and infantry zerp guns and its got this and its got certain types of motorcycles and its got that and so forth probably lot of you are from there because every time it loses battle they ship the people over herethe enemy does they know whatthey know how to get even so anyway this old civilizationthis old civilization is just about the meanest area to try to put an idea into it you ever had you see they worked it out for years and eons and eonsbeen going for billions and trillions and trillions of years with an uninterrupted flowwhich is pretty unusual in civilizations anyhow see and is on complete perfect nochange and you say we got an idea for spaceships their spaceships arent all that good theyre as good as spaceships can be but you could undoubtedly make better spaceship you see but they blow up on occasion and they do this on occasion they do that on occasion they mess up one way or the other and yet to try to get any idea across to them fills the hierarchy of that particular activity with absolute horror because theyve lived with and through all of the areas of innovation and innovation to them is dangerous on departure from the highly workable well thewhat got them into this frame of mind was is the degree of workability which they demanded was fairly flexible wideopen degree of workability you see itd take you thousand years to go from to b well naturally thats unworkable well could you get there in month or two you know from one galaxy to another galaxy or something like that oh yeah yeah oh easy all right well thats workable now when you try to vary off of this level of workability you run into undesirable factors in other words you can get greater quote workability which is much harder to work you see theyve been through this so often that finallyi mean trying to give them any new weapon tool or anything else would be absolutelyyou just might as well bash your head against concrete wall i swear you couldnt even change the design of trigger guard theyve seen it all and so on im afraid were getting that way about the emeter because this has greater degree of workability than you will ever need this is already up in the stars we fought this battle few years ago and it was rough battle to fight but frankly this thing will read almost anything you want to know at sensitivity 16 almost anything you want to know sensitivity 16 will give you just about anything youve got now if you want to expand and magnify the readyouve got on the sensitivity knob youve got 32and if you want to expand and magnify the read youve got 64 and if you want to expand and magnify the read youve got 128 youre going upstairs now from any desirability if this thing simply worked at 16 only with the other knob set at 32 if you could never get it higher than 16 itd still be usable at level iii were in danger of stultification i suppose if theres some new method of containing charge inside battery comes out that might possibly be altered in an emeter you know itd run for ten years without recharge or something like that thatd be desirable but i dont think thered be anything get changed inside the meter because as far as thats concerned ive had it ive fooled with these things for ah dozen years you never saw anybody get as sick of anything as experimental models of an emeter if you want to really see go into screaming fit bring proposed change in the design and circuit of an emeter so that it is easier to manufacture or something like this or something like that what horrible because im afraid well lose the workability weve got and i want to impress upon you that that is poised knifeedge you go pushing around this thing very much and depart from it very far and youll find yourself in horrible situation of having improved yourself out of workability it may have some new desirable factor you may be able to get it inside your pocketbook but it wont read pc you know so this is whats known as holding the line on this now frankly the width and latitude of this emeter is so great that at class vi you have to audit down around 4 and 6 and youre fool if you audit above there and yet when you begin to audit you will do it you will learn this lesson all by yourself all with your own little paws id love to shoot those things down anyhow youll find out that you think you can get better performance or something like that out of your pc or something by carrying it at higher level of sensitivity or to maketo agree with the fact that ron says you ought to get dialwide falls on goal or something then you start jacking up the sensitivity in order to get the dialwide drop dont you see you dont keep sweating it out to try to get the dialwide drop at sensitivity 4 see various odd things but you will eventually come back to the complete boredom of running the thing at 8 and start bringing it back within the levels of practical action which is around 4 or 5 i can tell the difference between setting an emeter at 4 and 5 on class vi material ill accidentally let it drift up just to 5 and all of sudden imsomethings awful live around here whats going on you see and retreat it back to 4 you know kick it with your finger or something like that and it drifts up just one division well look at the highest levels were running this confounded emeter at about what whats sensitivity 4 in relationship to 128 see were something like driving cadillac you seewere driving cadillac along level smooth highway where you have need of its springs you have need of its shock absorption body weight its horsepowernone of these things are necessary for what youre trying to do all right well lets keep it that way because the truth of the matter is the emeter is designed around the needle you could design tone arm meter which you wouldnt need the needle reaction of that would just perform fine at ii weve already done it and you could design meter that would be minimal body reaction at class vi and you probably could get away with it so long as you never had to resort to the needle its the needle that gives you trouble on meter that is the one thing which you got to watch bad meter does not give you needle response itll give you body responses or itll give you something else or it wont respond to thought its whether or not this thing is geared up to thought thats whats important and the needle is what ties it in to thought its its needle responsethat is thought and nowhere is as much demanded of an emeter as at level iii level iii is then the hot meter level and if you can make somebody run meter at level iii and he can really make meter snap and pop at level iii i assure you hes never going to have any trouble in any other level he gets to iv its pipe whats the trouble with assessment iv is your assessment level what do you do at iv why you just go down and see what reads most and then you take it so your assessment has got to be good but what gets in the road of that assessment the phenomena the person should have learned at level iii that is that the needle reacts to the session before it reacts to the subject matter so you got to be hotter than pistol you got to be able to sit there and keep that needle clean and that is the first and foremost skill because it requires that you keep your needle clean that is to say you keep your session good so that at time is the session getting in the road of the needle ticks which youre using to audit the person and all of sudden youve got stray tick or dirty needle or something like that you got to be hot enough to pick up the considerations which gave you that oddball phenomena at iii it is demandedor nobody could really run iii at allthat all of this data about the meterhow it reacts to the session how it reacts to body motion that sort of thingthis has all got to be known and its got to be known terrifically well the things got bzzbzzbzzwhat the devil is that bzzbzzbzz well somebody who doesnt know what the devil that is is not going to be able to straighten out the meter because that is session manifestation the auditor has goofed something has gone wrong with the auditing cycle in this session and hed better jolly well straighten it up right now hes trying to put in rudiment has anything been suppressed well he has clean read now he maybe doesnt know whether he had clean read or not so he thinks he had better ask the question again so he asks the question again but this time it runs into the negative the pc has thought nothing there see so now he has read on suppress which is session read up to that timeup to the moment he got the cleanit was reading the bank you see and then he cleaned clean he saw the needle the needle didnt even quiver in this session has anything been suppressed and the needle didnt even quiver well if he said that read and demanded to know or if he simply really even asked the question again that meter manifestation has passed from process and mind over to session hes moved the meter over from something that is measuring the pcs mind over to something that is now measuring the pcs condition of insessionness the pc was with the session and you were registering his mind you make goof with the needle and youve got pc who is against the session and you are longer reading his mind youre reading his analytical session reaction and youve moved the needle right out of moving in amongst the reactive bank into moving right amongst the session now at iii person has got to be able to tell thats happened hes got to first know that it can happen and second know when it has happened and when that thing has happened not to keep on being complete nitwit about it ive seen some real knuckleheadyou know ive watched lot of tv demonstrations im speaking from thefrom the proud plateau of having made every one of these mistakes myself much worse than you ever made them because i made them with nobody telling it was mistake i didnt have any help see i used to be in condition with meter i supposethe mark vs are very standard now but meters of earlier days used to vary from meter to meter and youd give an auditor new meter itd take himtake him as long as two weeks to get used to this meter well its the same transition you make from iva level ivpardon mark iv meter your mark iv meter shifting to v i saw mary sue do that and frankly her hair was standing on end she uhck she felt like shed been put in jet plane see this thing would barge and bang around like it and so forth and she had to train her thumb into tricks that shed never wotted of youve got to break with your thumb the sweep of mark v meter if youre running it on rudiments that youre really trying to pick up carefully see and youve got to ask the question with certain timing so that the end of your question comes when the needle is still on the dial thats all manual dexterity thats vocal and manual dexterity you dream up certain tricks this can get very tricky you have to know exactly when to start asking the question and when to arrest the needle and get your thumb off in time that your thumb will now longer influence the resulting read that comes at the end of your question complicated huh so its complicated ive had to learn how to do it so can you because if youre running that high man you can pick guys brains you really can pick his brains now needle manifestations do not just consist of ticks there are things called slows and speeded rise well within the last few weeks i dirtied up needle completely unintentionally i was asking suggested as button and i got what might have been sort of slowed speeded rise something funny happened with the needle it was almost imperceptible and i said well im not going to nag the pc about this and went on to the next question and that one was mess and the next question was mess and the next one was mess and i couldnt figure out what was going on now thered been athered been an answer i finally hauled it back rehashing and hauled it back suggestthered been an answer on suggest which then operated thereafterwards as missed withhold see but this fantastically slight manifestation of that needleit was so slight that it was practically guesswork in other words any change of pace of that needle is read much less reverse direction so youre caught between the devil and the deep blue sea because this thing will read all the way south if it reads on the needle itll be real to the pc if it doesnt read on the needle it wont be real to the pc now theyre cut in theyre absolutely side by jowl there and so onitd give you some of the experimental design problems of the meter you know early meters didnt read on some pcs because they were off the bottom and didnt read on other pcs because they were off the top andah wild stuff see well weve covered that whole band now and we have something that exactly compares to if the pcs going to know about it or can know about it youre going to get some manifestation on the needle but very fast swinging needle gives less perceptible reaction see if it were going very slowly you would have gotten the more perceptible reaction but that needle was traveling at the velocity of near light dont you see and it just vaguely changed its pace and the inertia of the needle was sufficient to carry it through the read so it can get that rough but what kind of pc am i talking about now im talking about pc who is passing off the meter anyway what do you mean off the meter well along about vi at level vi when you get them in around auditing actual gpms your meter passes out of this world youve got to start running itif youre going to put in rudiments on pc youve got to run it at much higher sensitivity and the pc is already reading better than clear on meter dont you see you somehow or other got to mesh this meter in against pc who isnt really reading on meter who hasnt got that much reactive mind left dont you see it gets pretty messy and when the pcs postulate made in the session gives you rocket readso that your greatest manifestations are off the thoughts of the pc if you want to see big read atwhen persons had lot of level vi stuff run on him why just have the pc decide somethingpshooooo what was that oh i just thought wed had it you know wed gotten it now pcs postulates are rocket reading you see youre actually auditing somebody who is an electric eel to begin with and what youre mainly reading is reactive material and all of this reactive potential is disappearing because reactive potential is oh trillionth or some infinitesimal fraction of what the person is actually capable of doing by himself it isnt just the plain statement of what you can do reactively you can do better analytically that is an understatement somebody has compulsion to wiggle his ears you see all right so he wiggles his ears well frankly if he didnt have an inhibition on the subject of his ears his ability to wiggle his ears could set up hundred mile an hour breeze dont you see if you do it analytically its not proportionate remark if fellow could paint somewhatwell take rembrandt something or other reactive chaphe could paint somewhat and so forth think of what the guy would have done if he hadnt had any reactivity at all on the subject wow itd just be strictly wow itd be that much better its magnitudinously better it doesnt just pass from reactivity under your control so now you can do it just as well it actually isnt even in the same order of magnitude for instance i didnt get bright about photography until i started chipping around the edges of the gpms about making pictures i started to get real bright about photography i started to get bright on the subject you know id been going along and so forth and i realized just all of sudden i had perfect working system of photography all grooved in so id never noticed it before we had beautiful system of photography on the subject of color transparencies take rollei camera around here and just shoot about anything in the place and do it beautifully and gorgeous and everybody ohs and ahs over the thing what do you do with it it costs you three pounds five shillings to have color negative made so that you can have single print and then the print costs you two pounds five something on the order of about five pounds ten you can get small snapshot see the interruption is the color transparency doesnt cost all this ifs just they cant be made into pictures so last night i was just upsetting reg about it so last night i just all of sudden said hey what do you know and turned on regs big rollei projector and turned it on to big screen and took the land camera and took picture of it the most beautiful color snapshot you ever saw in your life brandnew use for land cameras takes beautiful black and white you can then turn around and get negative made of the black and white by the way for fifteen cents we hadwe had complete system sitting around here and so forth all it needed to do was to be put together and that was that and we had pictures you can almost count on the fact that if youve got rea reactive ability youve got fantastic problems along with it you could just count on that if ability is at all reactive now if you want to know whose ability is reactive well who is having problems with his ability the circus performer has lot of worry about having to so on but he is the wildest cannonhuman cannonball in the world dont you see but he seems to have this and he seems to have that and something well hes reactively being cannonball and so forth well if you cleaned him up on this particular subject he wouldnt have problems on the subject of being cannonball see thats all very interesting from viewpoint of that the problems get added by the reactivity and the reactivity also detakes all the power out of it well this is completely reverse to the way the psychoanalyst thinks that the world works he said be glad youre neurotic because you wouldnt have any skills unless you are neurotic you know dingdingding here comes the wagon well of course he wants everybody to be neurotic thats how he makes his dough they wouldnt sit there that long if they werent so neurotic the scope then of persons ability depends on fishing it out into the analytical realm and the magnitude of performance and so on is some fantastic disproportionate figure youve got grain of sand to the mountain dont you see brahms versus musician you know its good thing for you to know thisim just not riding hobby horse its good thing to know this because every once in while youre going to get pc who is going to balk hehehewhatwhatwhat if he lost his you know whatuhuh theres writers around that just go around cultivating neuroses so they can write you know as though this has something to do with it and so forth and you sometimes actually need the data im giving you now but the softest statement is whatever person can do reactively he can do far better analytically thats the softest statement made but im giving you the actual scope of the situation anything he can do only reactively hes going to have problems with of great magnitude and the difference of proportion of ability and so forth is someone to some unimaginably large figure you knowtrillions to one you know something like that now whats this got to do with the needle well there actually isnt too much of problem at level iii because youve got mostly reactive being hes on the reverse order you got one trillionth of being and the remainder of it is reactivity so at level iii your needle behaves fairly well on reactivity and doesnt get in your face too much on the session thing theres balance between these things you see somebody can still be upset about the session and sometimes still even read bit on the needle do you see at vi this gets reversed now you really see you really see it the wrong way to you ask if this thing is this way and you get little tick and so forth and all of sudden you get rocket read and you say what was that oh that i thought something or other dont you see so your reactive read is getting much tinier and your analytical read getting much larger but at level iii the reactive read is larger than the analytical read got that which is the only thing that saves anybodys bacon at level iii if hes having trouble cuffing around meter but you got to know how to keep needle clean well therefore you have to know to complete an auditing cycle to complete your auditing comm cycle particularly youve got to know when the needleand its just guessworkwhen youve overreached point and youre not getting consistency and the pc seems to be unhappy about what youre doing with the needle youve got to know then that youve got to go into the session part of it and straighten up the session part of it but dont keep straightening up the session part of it with mid ruds to point where you drive the pc out of session thats the beautiful point of balance there you can harass pc who is running all right until he is very aware of the session see you can turn it around the other way to so whats the trick here its maintain the needle in good condition simply by maintaining your session in good condition thats all you have to do to maintain the needle in good condition just keep your session in good condition dont get the pc against the session dont get the pc against you dont start harassing the pc one way or the other about things that are not this way or that way or something of the sort and then above all things for gods sakes never blame the pc because hes not behaving properly on meter all auditors sooner or later do this and then much to their embarrassment they find out they havent been asking the right question its this crazy theyve started from the last sessiontheyve started the new session and theyre not getting the same reads on the needle that they were getting in the last session and they start blaming the pc for having done something between sessions and then much to their embarrassment they look up at last sessions auditors report and find out they were running another question see they never cleaned off their last question they did something weird see theyre not asking the right question thats why the pc isnt reading on the meter or theyve got their session completely awry they havent got the pc insession at all the needle how to handle the needle that is the basic foremost skill of level iii and person to be class iii auditor ought to be able to handle the needle backwards and forward without ever cleaning clean or missing read you clean clean youre going to throw the pc into session awareness hes already given you all hes got now youre asking him for more ach youre going to dirty this thing up hes got an answer you dont ask for ityoure going to dirty this thing up in other words youre going to miss ä read that kind of thing shouldnt go youve got togot to get those things ironed out as far as the auditor is concerned at level iii and he should realize that when hes getting screwball reads of some kind or anotherlike the pc says he hasnt got any answers but hes getting readsit should eventually dawn on the auditor that the pc is protesting or invalidating or suppressing or doing something weird in the session about the session hes got to recognize that the metering has shifted from the reactive to the session and with just that dataand practically other data than thatyou really wrap up needle reading that is needle reading the peculiarities inconsistencies and oddball nonsenses about reads well lets just take body motion so you got big sweeping read all of sudden i had pc every time foot was scraped across the floor an electrostatic current was generated and you got read and yet it was always done completely silently and without any other body motion well thats session reaction isnt it so it doesnt fall beyond that and its simply up to the auditor to find out whats going on thats all what you doing oh i just moved my foot now with that data and knowing just that you can do auditing by lists and if you dont know that data you cant do auditing by lists now auditing by lists is going to confuse people left right and center because theyre going to say this has something then to do with assessment it doesnt have anything to do with assessment at all because on auditing by list you are not interested in which level or item of the list reads that you are not interested in at all you are simply interested in going down the list and making sure that each one in turn is cleaned up if it reads youre not trying to go down list and find one of these levels remember thats the operation of an arc break all right now get thisget this difference assessment means reading down list to find out which item on that list reads more than the other items on the list which is the item we are trying to find the item out of list of itemswhether its listed by the pc or an arbitrary list see thats assessment thats trying to find the item now auditing by list is effort to find any part of the list greater than any other part of the list this is just sawing wood there are this many cords of wood up there and its going to take so much time and action to saw up these cords of wood and thats all he does with the list he just makes sure that each question on the list in turn is longer reading when he leaves it and thats the whole action of auditing by list making sure that each question taken up in turn is longer reading which requires the action of course of reading the question to find out if it reads and then continuing to get actions to the questionget answers to the question until the question longer reads noticing now that the question is longer reading and passing on to the next question along with thatwhat ive just given younoticing that he is getting reads that are session reads which arent associated with the question see thats part of that otherwise hes trying to clean up session reads by reading question you know pcs been protesting for while pc has withhold hes messed up something in this session see so now he continues to get reads on the list which arent from the list this requires the auditor differentiate between these two things and thats all there is to it so we get we get do i see cattick very good i have read here yeowyeowyeow its have you done that yeowyeowyeow yeowyeow all right do i see cat all right that is clean do i see dole that is clean do i see horse that reads yeowyeowyeow yeowyeowyeow do i see horse there is another read there boy shoot the auditor who never learns that trick that is one of the slipperiest tricks in auditing that causes more arc breaks to say that still reads you see what happens is you just told the follow he hasnt answered the question youve given him instantaneous arc break any time somethinga question reads twice in row it is always another read its not the same read ever nothing ever still reads it always has another read it reads again on something else always that is the understanding of the auditors palaver the auditor works that into his patter its always another i have another read here its major auditing error its really gross auditing error to say that still reads because hewhats he done hes just refusedrefuted the fact the guy just cleaned it up and the truth of the matter is he has another read its not the same read that he had before always another read so we just go down this list and we read the question and if it gives meter reaction we get an answer to the question if it doesnt get meter reaction we dont get an answer to the question then we just simply check the question again if the question now has another read on it we get another answer to the question and we keep getting more answers to the degree that the question is more reads you see and eventually unless we clean clean or miss it completely we get null needle on that question and now we go to the next question and we do the same thing with it this is auditing by lists this is all there is to auditing by list you have put in the auditors paws the totality of the process and if youre doing auditing supervision on this and you have bunch of people worrying about this let tell you something you stand back in the corner with sawedoff shotgun in your hand you just wait for the first one to ask some dopey stupid qanda question and just blow his head right off just splatter it all over the other students and they wont do it anymore and let tell you from long experience thats practically what it takes ill show you what i mean have you ever kicked horsethis is the question we are askinghave you ever kicked horse all right that reads pc well actually i kicked cow once uhi know i remember it very vividly very vividly i kicked cow once oh yes well what about kicking cow thats the moment you pull the sawedoff shotgun up cock it and fire it its an incomplete cycle of action the next thing you know this persons needle is going to look like so much jam youre going to have the pc all loused up and arc broke it doesnt matter how happy they look just now all this is going to catch up with him his questionblanketyblankblank itwas has he ever kicked horse an horse horse so he says he kicked cow once okay so he kicked cow all right and you simply let him tell you all about kicking this cow and you give him sort of halfacknowledgment and you say yes yes yes yes oh youre asking about horse oh yeah there were some horses there oh yeah yeah i did kick horse get the idea or if hes answered cow and so forth and you say well all right all right kicked cow now how about horse you kicked horse the question was horse you have to do that very delicately because you arc break the pc again that way youre making him wrong see well he says hmmm hmmm i just never have kicked horse needle oh well now youve got one of your interesting problems havent you youve got needle reading one thing and the pc saying something else what do you do well the one two three of it is you simply make sure that your read isnt coming from session miss see are you protesting the question you invalidating the question are you upset about the question am i cleaning clean whatsomethingsomething gone oh thatdoesnt it all right thank you get that all straight now have you ever kicked horse that reads oh it still reads well oh well hahah guess id better think it over then and youll find out thats about the most serious reaction youll get oh yes and i never told my father either oh man oh that wasyeah yeah and he licked my older brother for doing it had hoofprints all over the horse you know oh yeah all right good enough thank you now let test the question just let check this question now just to make sure its clean have you ever kicked horse all right thats clean thank you very much and go on to the next question get the idea theres nothing really fancy about this its just the one two three and youve got toyour auditor at this point has got to understand the combinations that can go awry see which is to say it can come from reactive to session youve got to get an answer to the question you mustnt qanda with it ive known certain schools of thought on this subject that if he said horseyou said horse and he said he kicked cow then you ask him about the cow but halfway through that he cognited he kicked dog and then halfway through the dog why he cognited he kicked pig and each time the auditor said well how about the pig how about the dog how about the pile zahzahzah zahaaaaaaaaa there they go over there way over theyre going up that rise over there someplace you know heres the session here see and theyre just traveling up over the rise of the hill theyve just left it man thats nowhere they never completed cycle of action q and is simply failure to complete cycle of action whether an auditing cycle or an auditing comm cycle or program cycle he just didnt complete the cycle of action so youve got to complete those cycles of action on auditing by list if you start list 62 dont get sudden wild idea in the middle of the night and start tomorrow on list 65 finish list 62 see what i mean now what are these lists well theyre nothing more than the plusminus misdemeanors and upsets that an individual could have theyre based in various lines and levels lot of technical aspects can go into the manufacture of list now we used to make auditors around here do lists for certain pcs now that was big gag theyd do list for pc and everything would come along fine so an auditor also should be able to do list for pc as well as take canned list but once the list is made it is simplywhether the auditor did it or it was done for him or he something now it is audited by list and is simply taken at question one and is cleaned through to the last question in just that fashion now theres really only hatful of little lists that can be done over and over and over and over again and these are lists like l1 and what weve got as l4 in your mimeograph workl1 and l4 you can clean l1 and then you can clean l4 now actually those are used as auditing by list theyre not used for taking up an arc break because theyre not on an arc break pc they just have all these factors in them so you go ahead and clean them up now whether you vary the question or not is beside the point but is have i _____ would probably not be used by you itd be has anyone ever _____ or something like that you hobsonjobson the question over to be broader scope dont you see you dont have to put time period to it or anything like that you just go on and clean this list well you oddly enough can clean list 1 and list 4 and list 1 and list 4 and list 1 and list 4 and it just goes on almost endlessly thats because of the generality of the list its not particularized or peculiar list to just this one pc it embraces all the actions of life so its repetitive list and you can go over it and over it and over it you could keep on going in other words and using pair of lists alternately one against the other and each time youre doing the same action and its simply auditing by list which is an auditing action which simply consists of what ive just been telling you about reading the needle making sure the needle is clean on that question making sure your auditing cycle was good making sure ifs clean going to the next one making sure that that one was clean and so forth before you left it and just going on down to the last question its as simple as that arguments with the pc or upsets you see about this and that dont monkey around with it pc who is very recalcitrant and so forth it looks like this thing is all going to pieces why you might have missed withhold or something like that crop up and hit you in the face so it becomes part of auditing by list to be able to keep your rudiments in of which missed withhold or fail to reveal is one but look at rudiments in actual fact and look at prepchecking isnt prepchecking really auditing by list its just cleaning the question and then going to the next question and thats actually all youre doing with it its simple action so prepchecking comes in also then and anything we ever knew international idlewild here today i got to get that new machine gun they just advertised it the prepchecking sec checking all of these other types ofof clean up the needle then all come at level iii and if you want to know what is level iii level iii is that level where you clean the needle well that brings us to level iv of course well whats iv well iv takes the list for an entirely different reason and the individual is now totally accustomed to lists so at level iv he takes this for an entirely different reason hes trying to find it so level ivyoure trying to find something on the list you see youre trying to find that one level which you are now going to use and auditthats for service facsimiles and things like that which one of these things is it well it never bothers anybody at level iii you see he doesnt care which one of these things is it or not it he just uses anything that reads you got the difference all right well now this permits you as pc of course very very little width yeah you got very little width of wander so therefore you find out that you have to kind of stick to it and you can get sick of the question but remember that you go up from boredom to enthusiasm now theres lot to know about needle but none of it exceeds anything that ive been telling you and most of its on the basis of familiarity ive done lot of theorizing about why people cant read needles when they cant and so forth i found out that they couldnt see still they couldnt tell when something was still that was what they couldnt tell it wasnt that they couldnt recognize motion it was because they couldnt see still they couldnt see reverse of direction or something like this it had to do with visual acuity and you get somebody whos got comm lag in ordinary living of five or ten seconds and so forth hes going to have an awful time reading needle so it goes over rather easily into case but you know youre only trying to do familiarization deal with training its just the degree with which youll familiarize somebody and you can lick all these things just by getting somebody familiar with the needle itself even if thats as odd as just reach and withdraw from the meter and just meter drills in general is being acoming accustomed to the meter and watching the needle and doing things like this now one of the interesting things that weve had going around here is weve had two or three people standing around watching one person put another person on meter and the twoand two observers and you know the auditor and the two observers are just in wild disagreement as to whether the meter had read or not read your bulletin drills and so forth have all been gauged to overcome these bits and frailties and so forth theres been lot of work on this as you can see the number of drills that exist but there is your toughestyour toughest application is your auditing by list as far as the needle is concerned now if person can get through that then of course person can assess person can assess arc breaks and they can assess prepcheck subjects and they can assess this and assess that and they can take up of course lists of service facsimiles and they can also learn to list and now theyre getting all ready to graduate course into class vi materials which istakes this as matter of course its really easier to read meter at class vi than it is at class iii i think that it probably wouldnt be true if person couldnt read meter at all at class iii hed probably become very alarmed at the degree that meters read at class vi its something to be alarmed about you keep cranking it down and it still reads you know and you an inch read is probably questionable at class vi well it wasnt read i dont know equivocal so forth twoinch read ah probably twoinch read with blowdown well thats probably correct did the meter explode well its probably the right item you know thats the sort of approach to it now this is an entirely different field of area at level iii you missed read read where was it where was it it speeded on that rise there was an acceleration there for period of over quarter of an inch it went little bit faster for that period of quarter of an inch than it did just before and did just after that was speeded rise whats the matter with you cant you read meter thats oh my god speeded rise what kind of thing huuuuh ooh horrors well you get the difference of approach so if person can read meter at level iii he could do most anything because i see even oldtimers have trouble reading at iii but that is auditing by list when i tell you to straighten out pcs arc breaks i really mean auditingthis is you know arc breaky type pcs not now in an arc break you understand but hes had lot of trouble and upset and he sort of feels poor he will answer auditing questions everythings fine its just l1l4 alternately auditing by list fanciness to the question ifyou know just alter the question so its broader you see but dont say in this lifetime if you were or something just give it broad answer clean that line by line ll and then line by line list 4 and lline by line1 lline by line4 this person will come up shining i dont care what hekind of condition hes in sometimes they do even when they dont know the nomenclature which is quite remarkable anyway there is auditing by lists and there is actually very full rundown on what is contained at level iii in scientology i hope itll be of some assistance to you thank you
