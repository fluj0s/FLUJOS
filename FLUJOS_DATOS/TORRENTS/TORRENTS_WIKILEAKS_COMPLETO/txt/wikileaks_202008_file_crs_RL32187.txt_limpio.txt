cooperation in pursuing mutual political economic and strategic objectives in the area1 in hearing before the subcommittee on east asia and the pacific of the house committee on international relations july 23 2002 several key issues were raised regarding us interests in the southwest pacific these include the vulnerability of small pacific island nations and failed states to transnational crime including money laundering and drug trafficking the threat of infiltration by terrorist groups or individuals and environmental problems many analysts have posited link between political instability and poverty in many pacific island nations and their attraction to organized crime and terrorists2 since the end of world war ii the united states has commanded unimpeded military access to the southwest pacific although its involvement in the region with the exception of its military bases on guam and kwajalein atoll marshall islands has been low key the united states diplomatic presence and foreign aid fell during the 1990s except for its economic assistance to the freely associated states of the marshall islands micronesia and palau the united states has increasingly relied upon australia to promote shared strategic interests as well as political and economic stability in the region until recently australia was careful not to intervene directly in domestic political upheavals3 instead it pursued strategy of greater cooperation and regional assistance through participating in pacific island organizations such as 1 for description of the kwajalein missile base see

been forceful advocate of more interventionist strategy in region where political and economic conditions have deteriorated especially after the bali terrorist bombing of september 2002 as part of its effort to promote regional stability and prevent pacific island nations from becoming havens for transnational crime and terrorism australia along with new zealand and other pacific island nations has deployed troops in east timor papua new guinea and the solomon islands other initiatives include heading the pacific islands forum secretariat through an australian diplomat greg urwin financing police training center in fiji that would train officers from the pacific islands for domestic and regional operations5 conditioning bilateral assistance on improved governance and promoting the creation of federation of small pacific island nations that would pool national resources and share governmental responsibilities and services in order to make them viable states6 for the most part pacific island nations reportedly have accepted australias leadership as necessary and agreed to the focus on security adopted by australia and the united states the mutual emphasis on security was reflected in the nasonini declaration on regional security adopted by the pacific islands forum in august 2002 in which members agreed that law enforcement cooperation should remain an important focus for the region7 in october 2003 leaders from 13 pacific island nations and hawaii gathered at the eastwest center in honolulu to discuss regional security issues and meet with president bush president bush told regional leaders that the united states would share intelligence to help them meet their security needs8 the evolving usaustralian strategic relationship in recent years australia has been

24 2003 crs3 to renewed emphasis on the united states alliance under current liberal prime minister john howard who has been in office since 1996 prime minster howard has taken the position that australia does not have to choose between its history and its geography meaning that it can have close ties with europe and america while also enjoying productive relationships with asian states this shift in relative emphasis came about for number of reasons including the reluctance of the australian people to see themselves as asian reluctance of asian states such as malaysia to think of australia as part of asia diminished potential rewards of asian engagement in the wake of the asian financial crisis of 1997 and renewed importance to australia of the strategic relationship with the united states as result of the war against terror the howard governments support of the united states in the war against terror has brought the united states and australia closer together as australia invoked the anzus alliance in the wake of the 911 attacks to help the united states australia maintained its tradition of fighting alongside the united states as it did in wwi wwii korea vietnam and the first gulf war by committing troops to recent united states operations in afghanistan and iraq by doing so in an international environment that was largely unwilling to supply combat troops in support of the united states in iraq australia along with britain drew attention to itself as loyal ally this policy of support for the united states was continued by the howard government despite significant opposition to the war in australia the bush administration recognized australias value to the united states and the asia pacific region in the following statement australia has long been steadfast ally and partner and recent events have only magnified the value of our alliance with it the key role that australias brave forces played in iraq and afghanistan and its commitment to leading role in regional security only demonstrate australias growing importance9 to complement its strong political and strategic ties with the united states australia is seeking free trade agreement fta with the united states10 fifth round of fta negotiations were held in december of 2003 while australia has hosted joint early warning communications and intelligence facilities for decades it may

prime minister howard reportedly has stated that he would consider allowing an additional american military presence in australia in june 2003 australian defense minister hill stated that australia was ready to expand joint exercises allow the united states unilaterally to conduct training in australia and enhance facilities for united states naval crews to rotate through australia15 the opposition labor party views these measures as unnecessary16 the united states and australia conduct many joint military exercises and australia purchases much of its military equipment from the united states us pacific commander adm fargo has pointed to the importance of maintaining interoperability with australia across the full spectrum of contingency operations while describing australia as the southern anchor of our security architecture in the region17 the australian government has also supported american plans to develop missile defense system though this view is not necessarily shared by the labor party opposition18 to meet its expanding military commitments which are in part driven by alliance considerations australia announced in may 2003 that defense spending would increase over the next several years government officials projected defense spending to rise from as133 billion in 20012002 to as15 billion in 2003200419 furthermore the recent appreciation of the australian dollar relative to the united states dollar will increase the buying capacity of the government budget for procurement 12 barbara opall krulak pursues base alternative defense news june 10

referendum for independence from indonesia after the referendum local militias which favored continued association with indonesia attacked proindependence east timorese by leading an international peacekeeping coalition to east timor australia lessened pressure on the united states to become more extensively involved australias subsequent involvement in east timor has helped east timor develop into an independent viable state though negotiations continue for full agreement on how to divide the oil and gas resources that lie beneath the timor sea conocco phillips an american corporation stated in june 2003 that it was moving forward with 15 billion liquefiednaturalgas development in the bayuundan area of the timor sea that separates east timor from australia20 australia along with new zealand continues to play constructive role in the cease fire and peace process on bougainville where the two nations have helped restore order and improve the prospects for lasting agreement between the people of bougainville and papua new guinea australia became involved in the peace monitoring group in 1997 that was intended to support the implementation of the burnham peace process negotiated in new zealand by the bougainville independence movement and the papua new guinea government21 recent events in the solomon islands point to renewed commitment by australia to promote stability in its region that is inspired by the need to prevent failed states in the age of terrorism intercommunal strife in the solomon islands reduced it to virtual failed state by 2003 in response australia along with new zealand fiji papua new guinea and tonga dispatched force of 2300 troops to reinstate the rule of law and good governance as part of the regional assistance mission this was done largely to reduce the prospect that the solomons would become an ungoverned area from which transnational crime and potentially terrorists could operate or draw support22 australia has also proposed the establishment of regionwide police force to more effectively police the region australias renewed activism in the pacific is not universally accepted some in australia and the region are concerned that it could mark return to neocolonial activity by australia in the area23 20 andrew trounson conocophillips agrees to timor sea project asian wall street journal june 16 2003 21 derek

pacific some analysts suggest that its current involvement could result in strategic benefits for china in the long term while the united states does not maintain an embassy in several pacific island countries the peoples republic of china prc has opened embassies in all countries with which it has diplomatic relations and has provided bilateral assistance and highprofile visits with little criticism of their internal policies the prc has provided funding materials labor and technical assistance for infrastructure projects roads airports sports stadiums government complexes hotels mining operations and financed the pacific trade office in beijing to promote trade and investment between china and pacific island states over 3000 chinese state and private companies reportedly have invested 800 million in the southwest pacific24 although china is still not major bilateral aid donor in the region it has become the second largest aid donor to papua new guinea the most populous pacific island nation according to some foreign affairs analysts chinas aims have been twofold first china has attempted to thwart taiwanese diplomatic efforts in the region taiwan has actively courted the region establishing diplomatic relations with four pacific island states at chinas expense palau the solomon islands tuvalu and the marshall islands taiwan has offered these and other pacific island countries economic and development assistance helping to build or provide hospitals airports copra processing equipment ships grants and loans so eager are some states for assistance that they often switch allegiances without warning or threaten to change sides nauru for example which recognized china over taiwan in july 2002 reportedly threatened to renew ties with taiwan year later until china agreed to extend more loans to the island nation25 in november 2003 kiribati established ties with taiwan despite having diplomatic relations with china since 1980 and renting land to the prc for space tracking station26 second some experts argue china has hoped to raise its diplomatic and ultimately strategic influence in the region and its shipping lanes the prc reportedly has occasionally applied diplomatic or economic pressure on pacific island countries to oppose actions of taiwan or australia in the region or to influence voting in the united nations according to one account for example the vanuatu government publicly expressed reservations about the australianled peacekeeping mission in the solomon islands following visit by its prime minister to beijing27

has operated satellite spacetracking station on tarawa atoll in the republic of kiribati some analysts argue that the base could be used for monitoring us missile defense tests at kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands while not opposing the us and australian presence in the region many pacific islands countries have been attracted to china as an anticolonial power welcomed the aid and attention from china and taiwan and appreciated chinas relative support on some issues such as the global warming treaty kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse emissions some regional analysts members of congress and leaders of australia have advocated stronger roles for the united states australia and japan in the southwest pacific as counterweights to growing chinese influence28 figure 1 map of the southwest
