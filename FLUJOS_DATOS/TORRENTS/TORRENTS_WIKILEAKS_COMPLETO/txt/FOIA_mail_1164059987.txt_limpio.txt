from malcolm hughes mhughesltrrarizonaedu to martin juckes mnjuckesrlacuk subject re bristlecone pines date mon 20 nov 2006 165947 0700 cc keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk xflowed martin juckes wrote hello prof hughes im involved in discussion with stephen mcintyre about bristlecone pines which i have used as temperature proxies in recent work httpwwwcopernicusorgegucpcpd21001cpd21001htm ive read the nas report section on this issue and most of the references cited in the paragraph about bristlecones im unimpressed by the evidence presented to support the idea that these valuable records of past climate should be discarded in particular the most relevant study appears to be that of bunn et and this clearly shows anomalous stripbark growth occurring well before significant atmospheric co2 rises their study used whitebark pine which is clearly not the same as bristlecone but perhaps closer than the orange trees cited by graybill and idso im looking for further literature and if possible data on the issue do you know of any data on anomalous growth in bristlecone stripbark pines which is available for analysis sincerely martin juckes dear dr jukes im afraid that apart from the bunn et 2003 paper you mention i know of other recent literature or data directly relevant to this question there is graduate student here working on dissertation related to this but neither their data nor any publications on them are available at the moment two points concerning graybill and idso 1993 1 i dont think the sour orange trees used in sherwood idsos experiments were stripbark where did this idea come from 2 when considering the use of upper forest border bristlecone pine eg sheep mountain campito mountain and similar sites mainly above 3100m in the relevant region as temperature proxies it would be mistake to discount figure 3 in graybill and idso 1993 which is comparison of ufb bristlecone pine chronology with smoothed gridpoint reconstruction from maximum latewood density in quite different trees provided by keith briffa one of your coauthors i read this graph as confirmation of lamarches interpretation of the ufb bcp records as having bidecadal temperature signal combined with an interannual precipitation signal at least before the 20th century this is referred to hughes and funkhouser 2003 i hope this helps malcolm hughes xflowed
