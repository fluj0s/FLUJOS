finance division summary renttoown arrangement provides an alternative to purchasing merchandise in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21467 renttoown transaction also known as rentalpurchase the consumer agrees to selfrenewing weekly or monthly lease to rent merchandise item the terms of the lease include an option to purchase the item dealers in the renttoown industry typically offer high cost durable household items such as furniture appliances and home electronics the industry attracts consumers who may have hard time qualifying for credit do not have enough cash for purchase and are unable or unwilling to wait and save for an item the major downside to these arrangements is the final purchase price of the renttoown merchandise is much greater than the price of the same item bought from retail store or financed over time currently rentalpurchase transactions are not specifically regulated by federal law for more than decade there has been considerable debate over the need for regulation of the renttoown industry recent federal trade commission ftc survey provides insight into the experience of renttoown customers and consumer protection issues renttoown laws providing varying degrees of consumer protection have been enacted in 47 states legislative proposals for various forms of federal regulation have been introduced in the last several congresses in the 110th congress legislation hr 1767 addressing rentalpurchase transactions has been introduced hr 1767 would define these transactions as lease agreements in addition the bill mandates disclosures and provides for federal regulation the industry has been generally supportive of federal legislation that would provide uniform regulatory framework and preclude states from applying credit laws to rentalpurchase transactions consumer advocates have backed strong consumer protection proposals on both the federal and state level they argue that rentalpurchase transactions should be treated as credit sales this report gives background on the renttoown industry and the issues raised by rentalpurchase agreements information on the ftc survey and the status of federal regulation and legislation is discussed this report will be updated as warranted crs2 background the renttoown industry provides service directed toward consumers who do not have the cash to purchase high cost household products and who may be unable to get traditional credit credit cards or store accounts the renttoown industry can trace its origins to the 1960s and has grown rapidly the association of progressive rental organizations apro estimated that in 2005 there were 8300 renttoown stores in the united states serving 27 million households the industrys annual revenue was approximately 66 billion1 the rentalpurchase business was initially characterized by small regional chains and independent retailers that were facing increased competition from large electronic dealers and discount stores there has been significant consolidation in the industry most recently in august 2006 the nations largest operator rentacenter inc announced merger with another national chain rentway inc in 2001 and 2002 rentacenter was on fortune magazines list of the 100 fastest growing companies renttoown arrangement provides consumer with an alternative to buying httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21467 merchandise rentalpurchase items are typically highcost household products such as furniture large appliances televisions vcrs stereos and computers rentalpurchase transactions are shortterm weekly or monthly selfrenewing leases the consumer is not obligated to extend the lease beyond the current monthly or weekly period if the agreement is not renewed the item may simply be returned in addition the consumer is provided with the option of purchasing the merchandise by either continuing to pay rent for specified period of time usually 12 to 24 months or by early payment of specified portion of the remaining lease payments renttoown is popular with lower income cashstrapped consumers these consumers may not qualify for credit or stores layaway plan the benefits of rentto own are immediate perhaps otherwise unattainable access to needed or desired product the transaction typically does not require down payment or credit check the weekly or monthly installment payments are relatively low when compared to the cost of the item in addition these arrangements provide flexibility that may also be appealing to consumers wanting to test product before purchase or those with transient employment renttoown agreements usually include delivery setup pickup and repair service the costs of these free services are reflected in the renttoown prices the largest drawback to these arrangements is the final purchase price of an item bought through renttoown the total of the installment payments can be two to three times sometimes more the retail price of the item consumer advocates state one way to clearly see the high final cost of rental purchase item is by calculating what the effective annual percentage rate apr for the transaction would be the difference between the cash price of an item and the sum of all payments included in rental purchase agreement would represent the finance charge testimony at recent hearings provided table presenting effective aprs the retail price of an item and the total rental purchase price one example was 19inch color television with retail price of 300 1 industry statistics can be found on the apro website at httpwwwrtohqorg crs3 the renttoown agreement was for 16 per week for 52 weeks resulting in total purchase price of 832 the apr for this transaction would be about 2542 consumer advocates warn of other potential problems in renttoown arrangements they indicate that consumers need to make sure they know if the renttoown item is new used or previously rented in addition they recommend that the consumer inquire if there is grace period for missed payment and if penalty is charged they call for discussion of other fees such as insurance and home pickup as well as any taxes from their perspective the agreement should address what happens if the merchandise is broken lost or stolen consumer advocates also argue reinstatement rights should be part of renttoown agreement this protection would allow customers that miss payment to be reinstated in the agreement with credit for past payments if overdue amounts are paid in timely fashion ftc survey httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21467 the federal trade commission ftc conducted nationwide survey of renttoown customers in the late 1990s to provide an independent body of information on the typical renttoown customer and their experience with the industry the ftc published report on the surveys findings to help inform the ongoing debate over proposals for national regulation the report gives an overview of the industry presents the results of the survey and provides discussion of public policy issues3 three primary goals of the survey were identified 1 to examine who uses renttoown transactions and how they differ from consumers who do not 2 to determine whether renttoown transactions typically result in the purchase of the rented merchandise and 3 to determine whether abusive collection practices are widespread in the industry the major findings of the survey include the following in general renttoown customers compared to consumers who had not made renttoown transactions have lower incomes have less education rent their residence and live in nonsuburban areas the survey found that 70 of renttoown merchandise was purchased by the customer the average rental period for items purchased was 14 months items returned to the store were rented for an average of five months the reason given for over half of the returns was that the item was longer needed about 24 of the returns were for financial reasons the great majority 75 were satisfied with their rentalpurchase experience the survey found that over onethird of renttoown customers had rented merchandise on more than one occasion in the last five years the most cited reason for an unsatisfactory experience was the high price of rentalpurchase almost 50 of the rent toown customers surveyed had been late with payment twothirds of the late customers indicated that they received good or very good treatment from the store when they were late with payment poor treatment was reported by 15 of these customers 2 us congress house committee on financial services subcommittee on

economics survey of renttoown customers staff report by james m lacko signemary mckernan and manoj hastak april 2000 150p crs4 and 11 of late customers described treatment that indicated possibly abusive collection practices chapter seven of the ftc report provides an overview of some of the major policy issues addressed by various states and proposed in federal legislation the report focuses on five areas of concern disclosure of total cost and other purchase terms apr disclosure price restrictions regulation of payment collection practices and regulation of reinstatement rights this section of the report includes discussion of policy options and issues related to these areas of concern the report strongly supports clear and accurate disclosure of cost and other purchase terms at the point of sale in advertising and in agreements the survey found most rent toown merchandise was purchased and therefore consumers need information on the total cost of an item to compare rental purchase to any alternatives the report recommended that the total cost numbers include the sum of all weekly or monthly rental payments and all other mandatory fees and charges the report recommended disclosure of this information at the store on product labels or tags on all displayed merchandise other basic terms of purchase such as the amount of the periodic payment and whether the item httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21467 was new or used were also recommended for inclusion on the label it was urged that total cost and other basic terms of purchase also be disclosed in advertising and that agreement documents disclose all of the terms and conditions of the renttoown transaction the report suggests that potential costs and benefits should be thoroughly examined before regulatory policies addressing the other four areas of concern are adopted and that regulation of the renttoown industry should attempt to balance two priorities 1 ensuring that renttoown consumers have the information and protections needed to make informed decisions and 2 avoiding prohibitive industry costs that could substantially reduce the availability of rentalpurchase transactions the report acknowledges that rentalpurchase transactions can be an expensive method of purchasing merchandise and concludes that consumers should be made aware of the costs of purchasing through rent toown transactions at the same time the survey found relatively high level of customer satisfaction with rentalpurchase transactions suggesting that the renttoown industry does provide service that meets the needs of certain consumers regulation and legislation currently federal consumer protection laws do not specifically regulate renttoown transactions the disclosure requirements of the truthinlendingact tila4 and the consumer leasing act cla5 do not apply to the renttoown industry tila is disclosure law implemented by federal reserve regulation z tila requires consumer creditors to disclose an apr and other loan terms renttoown transactions are not covered because regulation z excludes leases that are terminable without penalty by the consumer cla requires disclosures concerning the terms of personal property leases 4 pl 90321 tit1 82 stat 146 15 usc 1601 et seq 5 pl 94240 90 stat 257 15 usc 1667 crs5 cla is implemented by federal reserve regulation m to be covered lease must be in excess of four months since renttoown agreements are shortterm monthly or weekly selfrenewing leases they are not covered by regulation m renttoown transactions are addressed by state law by the summer of 2001 47 states had laws governing rentalpurchase transactions the laws vary from state to state but generally treat renttoown transactions as leases variety of disclosures are required by the state laws but only 18 states provide for cost disclosures on merchandise tags or labels6 consumer groups have worked to strengthen state laws criticizing most of the laws for providing inadequate protection generally consumer advocates support federal legislation that would subject these transactions to existing federal credit laws and address policy issues discussed in the ftc report these groups also argue against proposals that would preempt more protective state law the renttoown industry has generally supported federal legislation as means of creating uniform regulatory framework however industry representatives have fought httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21467 proposals that would define these transactions as credit sales generally the industry has supported the various state actions because the state laws viewed renttoown transactions as leases and provided for disclosures the industry considered reasonable legislation has been introduced in each congress during the last decade dealing with the rentalpurchase industry the proposals have not been uniform some defined rent toown transactions as leases and others would have subjected the industry to federal credit laws and state usury laws variety of disclosures have been proposed in addition legislation has addressed abusive payment collection practices and the issue of reinstatement rights currently one bill hr 1767 has been introduced in the 110th congress the bill would provide for uniform disclosure requirements including total costs the amount and timing of the payments and the consumers right to terminate the agreement in addition the bill would require consumer protections governing account statements renegotiations and extensions disclosures at the point of sale and advertising disclosures hr 1767 would also define renttoown transactions as lease agreements and it would prevent states from characterizing rentalpurchase agreements as credit transactions the legislation was introduced on march 29 2007 and referred to the committee on financial services 6 us congress house committee on financial services subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer credit the consumer rental purchase
