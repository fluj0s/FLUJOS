fundsavailable to review human drug applications 3 the pdufa program has beensuccessful should be reauthorized for five years and the agency should improve its regulatory processes and 4 the fees authorized by this amendment should be usedto expedite both human drug development and application review processescongress also require the fda to publish in the congressional record goals to approve or act upon certain numbers of human drug applications within constrainedtimes the goals will be set forth in letters from the secretary of health and human services to the chairmen of the h ouse committee on commerce and the senate committee on labor and human resources sec 102 definitions previous law or policy section 735 of the 1992 pdufa defines the applications products and

product is exempt from fees and clarifies and upda tes other key factors biological product applications are exempt from user fee assessments if they will be used only forfurther manufacturing drugs that are not distributed commercially and are the subject of an application from state or federal government entity are also exempt fees can be assessed on large volume biological products intended for single doseinjection for intravenous use or infusion fees can now be used to pay the salariesof contractors of the fda the new ad justment factor for calculating user fee rates will be based on the great er percentage change of either the consumer price index for all urban consumers for april of the preceding fiscal year fy divided by the april 1997 index or the total percentage pay change for that fy for federal employees as adjusted for any locality based payment for employees of the districtof columbia the term business affilia means business that has direct or indirect relationship

application it submitted but coulddefer payment for one year the 1992 pdufa statute also allowed the fda toincrease total revenue from fees to reflect the greater percentage increase of eitherthe consumer price index or the civil serv ice base pay for federal employees in the district of colombia to keep the value of total fee collections on par with inflation the total amount of collected fees was adju sted annually to reflect the total costs of reviewing drugs and the adjustment wa s to be cumulative and compounded annually starting in 1997 the fees could be waiv ed if certain conditions were met an application would be considered incomple unless the fees were paid the act prohibited the fda from collecting fees unl ess its appropriations were equal to or greater than the

require specific labeling requirements providing information about th use of drugs in this age group drug manufacturers are required to examine existing data and determine whether thepediatric use section on the labels of thei r products can be modified on the basis of results of wellcontrolled studies in adults in august of 1997 the administrationproposed new rules 62 fr 43900 aug 15 1997 to further address the problem of certain drugs and biological products not ving sufficient pediatric use information on their labels fdama97 the act provides additional incentives for drug manufacturers to explore pediatric applications of their dr ugs prior to the approval of new drug if the secretary determines that informati on about the drug will produce health benefits in pediatric population and makes written request for pediatric studies including time frame for completing the studies and the studies are completed and acceptedthen the sponsor or manufacturer can qualif for up to six months of extended market exclusivity if the secretary makes wr itten request for pediatric studies of an already marketed drug and those studies are completed then the manufacturer may be granted up to six months of extended market exclusivity as well sponsors of socalled orphan drugs who complete pediatric studies can have their marketingexclusivity extended by six months within 180 days of enactment the secr etary after consultation with experts must develop and publish list of approved drugs for which additional pediatricinformation may produce health benefits when the secretary has formally requested pediatric studies those studies must be conducted by written protocol agreed to by the sponsor the patent holder and the secr etary more than 60 days after the pediatric studies have been submitted the secretary must determine whether thestudies were done properly and must notify th sponsor or patent holder if written protocol agreement is not reached the secretary may still

on patients includi ng those with lower income levels the report must include any suggestions for the programs modification sec 112 expediting study and approval of fast track drugs previous law or policy over the past decade the fda has initiated several regulatory policies to address the issue of earlier patient access to investigationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98263crs8 therapies currently there are regulations pertaining to treatment investigational drugs allowing patients with serious and lifethreatening conditions to obtainexperimental drugs for treatment purposes parallel track allowing patientssimultaneous access to certain therapies unde rgoing clinical trials and accelerated approval speeding the approval of drugs or biologics that promise significant benefit over existing therapies the fda has maintained that under these collective policies it has generally granted the highest approval priority to socalledbreakthrough drugs that offer significant therapeutic advantages fdama97 the act grants statutory authority to the secretary at the request of new drug sponsor to facilitate the velopment and expedite the review of new drug if it is intended for treating serious or lifethreatening condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need sponsors may request that the secretary designate drugs for fa st track consideration and the designation may be made concurrently with or at ny time after the submission of the drugs investigational application within 60 calendar days of the request the secretarymust determine if the drug meets the fast tr ack criteria and if so designate the drug as fast track drug and take action to expedite its development and review the secretary may approve fast track drug based on determination that the product has an effect on clinical or surrogate endpoint that is likely to be beneficial such an approval may obligate the manufacturer to conduct postapproval studies forvalidation in addition sponsors may be as ked to submit copies of all promotional materials about the fast track drug during the preapproval review period andfollowing approval for as long as the secretary finds appropriate at least 30 daysprior to the dissemination of the materials the approval of fast track drug may be withdrawn using xpedited procedures including an informal hearing if the s ponsor fails to diligently conduct the post approval studies postapproval study fails to verify clinical benefit otherevidence demonstrates that the drug is not safe or effective for its intended use or the manufacturer disseminates false or misleading promotional materials the act also provides for the review of incomplete applications for the approval of fast track drugs if early evaluation of clinical data for fast track drug shows evidence of effectiveness the secretary will evaluate an application for product approval for filing before the complete application is submitted the secretary mayalso start review of portions of that pr oduct approval applications the review will begin only if the sponsor provides schedule for submitting the informationnecessary for complete application and any required user fee in situations where the application is incomplete the review period agreed to under the drug user feeauthority will not apply until completed application is submitted the secretary must develop and widely distribute to physicians patient organizations and pharmaceutical and bi otechnology companies comprehensive description of the provisions applicable to fast track drugs and establish an ongoing program to encourage the development of surrogate endpoints that are reasonablylikely to be beneficial within one year of enactment the secretary must issueguidance on the fdas policies and procedur required to implement this provisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98263crs9 sec 113 information program on clinical trials for serious or life threatening diseases previous law or policy the national institutes of health nih primarily through its national cancer institute nc i currently provides access to databases that can provide physicians and patients w ith information about cancer drugs being used in clinical trials around the countr examples include the physicians data query database and cancernet an internet site dedicated to uptodate peerreviewed information on virtually ev ery common type of cancer similar information is available via cancerfax in addition nci pr ovides tollfree telephone numbers to offer patients or their physicians additional referral information fdama97 the act codifies programs to pr ovide information about clinical trials for drugs to treat serious or lifethreatening diseases the secretary actingthrough the director of nih is directed to establish maintain and operate database on such clinical trials the program is to be coordinated with other databasescontaining similar information and developed after consultation with the fdacommissioner the nih including the national library of medicine and thedirector of the centers for disease c ontrol and prevention the secretary must disseminate this database through inform ation systems including tollfree telephone numbers made available to individuals with serious or lifethreatening diseasesmembers of the public health care providers and researchers the database must include registry of clinical trials that describes the purpose of the experimental drug either with the consent of the trials sponsor or when an effectiveness test begins the information provided must include eligibility criterialocation of the trial sites and points of contact for those wanting to enroll the information must be provided in form that can be understood by the general publicand it must be forwarded to the database not later than 21 days after the trials for clinical effectiveness begin the database must also have informati on pertaining to experimental treatments for lifethreatening diseases that may be available under treatment investigational new drugs application or as group c cancer drug as defined by the nationalcancer institute the database may also include results of clinical trials of suchtreatments with the consent of the sponsor including information concerningpotential toxicities or adverse effects the database must not include informationabout an investigation if the sponsor has provided detailed certification to thesecretary that its disclosure would interf ere with the enrollment of subjects unless the secretary after receiving the certifica tion provides the sponsor with written determination that the disclosure would not interfere to carry out this section there are aut horized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary however fees collected under section 736 drug user fees of theffdca are not to be used to impliment this subsection further the secretary thenih director of nih and the fda commissioner must collaborate to determine the feasibility of including investigations of dical devices within the scope of the data bank in addition later than two ears after enactment the secretary must prepare and submit to congress report about inclusion of device investigations the adverse impact if any on device innovation in the us if information relating tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98263crs10 such device investigation is required to be publicly disclosed and such other issues as the secretary may deem appropriate sec 114 health care economic information previous law or policy the fda was in the process of developing policy on economic claims of drugs when fdama97 was being considered by congress fdama97 the act codifies criteria for judging the validity of healthcare economic claims made about drug hea lth care economic information provided in the course of selecting drugs for managed care or other similar organizations by aformulary committee or similar entity is not be considered false or misleading if theinformation directly relates to use of the drug as approved under provisions of theffdca and phsa the information must also be based on competent and reliablescientific evidence information that helps substantiate the health care economic information presented in accordance with this section must be made available to the secretary upon request health care economic information is defined to mean any analysis that identifies measures or compares the ec onomic consequences including the costs of the represented health outcomes of the us of drug to the use of another drug to another health care interven tion or to intervention the general accounting office is to conduct study of the implemen tation of this sections provisions and submit report to congress not later than four and onehalf years after enactment sec 115 clinical investigations previous law or policy under current law eviden ce of drugs effectiveness is based on substantial evidence consisting of data derived from adequate and wellcontrolled investigations including clinical investigations although the number ofclinical investigations required is not sp ecified by statute the fda has historically interpreted the language to mean that effectiveness should be confirmed andverified by at least two wellcontrolled clinical trials in 1993 the fda issued guideline 58 fr 39406 july 22 1993 regarding its expectation that drug manufacturers should include both males and females clinical testing undertaken in drug development the agency further stated that drugmanufacturers should analyze their clinical data by gender assess pharmacokineticdifferences between genders and conduct specific additional studies in women ifappropriate in 1997 the fda issued propos rule 62 fr 49946 stating that the agency is considering placing clinical hold on studies of drugs intended to treat lifethreatening disease if men or wome n with reproductive potential who have the diseaseand are otherwise eligibleare ex cluded from participation in the clinical trial the guideline and the proposal do not make specific references to minorities fdama97 the act addresses issues about the number and makeup of clinical studies needed for drug approval if the secretary determines that data from one adequate and wellcontrolled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidenceobtained prior to or after such investiga tion establish the drugs effectiveness the secretary may consider such data and evidence sufficient for drug approvalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98263crs11 additionally the secretary in consultation with the nih director and representatives of the pharmaceutical industry is directed to review and developguidance on the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical trials sec 116 manufacturing changes for drugs previous law or policy since 1995 the fda has instituted new policies to reduce the number of manufacturing changes that would require prior approvalsubsequently the agency issued severa l guidance documents specifying when drug manufacturers need not submit supplemental applications and instead file onlyperiodic reports year later the fda proposed extending those regulatory changes to biological products fdama97 the act codifies guidelines for accounting for changes in manufacturing processes it characterizes when certain types of manufacturingchanges made by drug manufacturers re gulated under the ffdca or the phsa require supplemental applications when pr oduct distribution can occur after changes are made and the circumstances where ma nufacturing changes require report filing in situations where change is made from the manufacturing process approved in the products original application an approved drug or licensed biologic may be distributed if the holder of the approved pplication or license properly validates the effects of the change or in the case of major manufacturing change files supplemental application before distribu ting new drug or biologic made after manufacturing change whether major manufacturing change or otherwise theholder must validate the effects of the change on the products identity strengthquality purity and potency as related to the drugs safety or effectiveness major manufacturing changes are characterized as changes the secretary determines have substantial potential for adversely affecting the identity strengthquality purity or potency of the drug such changes include qualitative orquantitative changes in the drugs formulation or changes in the specifications fromthe original approved application other ma jor changes include those as determined by the secretary that require clinical study to demonstrate that the drugmanufactured after the change is equivalent to the drug manufactured before thechange and changes that might adversely affect the drugs safety or effectiveness the secretary may regulate in any one of several ways drugs made with manufacturing changes that are not major the secretary may authorize distribution of such drugs with or without supplemental application and may establishcategories of changes and designate when supplement will or will not be needed for manufacturing changes that are not major sponsors must submit report to the secretary containing appropriate in formation on the change if drug sponsors or licensees make more than one such manufacturing change the secretary mayauthorize submission of single report on all the changes made for the year supplemental applications filed for manufacturing change that is not major must include information that the secretary determines to be appropriate and that hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98263crs12 been developed in validating the changes effects manufacturers making such changes may begin distribution of the drug 30 days after the secretary receives the application unless they are issued notifi cation that prior approval is required the secretary may designate category of changes that will permit manufacturer to distribute the drug when the secretary recei ves the supplemental application for the change if the secretary disapproves the application the manufacturer can beordered to cease such distribution this provision contains transition rul that states that the amendment made by this section takes effect upon the effectiv date of regulations promulgated by the secretary or two years

authority to issue clinical holds halting clinical research trial in 1995 the agency introduced new policy of reviewing and responding to ind submissions within 30 days fdama97 the act revises and clarifies certa in procedures and requirements of the clinical research process used in the drug development process it providesflexibility to reduce the amount of inform ation required by the fda from the drug sponsor before clinical investigations can begin and establishes what informationis needed for clinical investigation submission to the fda and the terms and conditions under which the agency may request additional information to protect the health of research subjects clinical investigation may begin 30 days after the fda receives submission containing inform ation about the drug and the clinical investigation the submission must contai n the following 1 information about the design of the investigation and adequate re ports of basic information certified by the applicant to be accurate necessary to assess the drugs safety in clinical trial and 2 adequate information on the chemistr and manufacturing of the drug controls available for the drug and primary data ta bulations from animal or human studies the secretary may issue clinical hol d confirmed in writing prohibiting the sponsor from continuing with the research trial the hold may be based on

best interests of the subjects involved clinical investigators will not be required to submit directly to the secretary reports on theinvestigational use of the drugs sec 118 data requirements for drugs and biologics previous law or policy current law requires drug manufacturers when submitting new drug applications for mark eting approval to provide the fda with full reports of investigations which have been made to show whether or not such drug is safe for use and whether such drug is effective in use fdama97 the act establishes procedures for reducing data reporting requirements for clinical investigations the secretary acting through thecommissioner of the fda within one year of enactment is directed to issue guidance that describes when manufactur ers will be permitted to submit certain abbreviated study reports instead of traditional full reports with their new drugapplications under the ffdca and biologics license applications under the phsa the guidance must

several regulations encouraging manufacturers to meet with agency officials throughout the clinical investigation process fdama97 the act codifies certain procedures about the review and content of applications the fda must issue guidance for employees who reviewapplications the act also establishes th at manufacturers can meet with officials to resolve controversial scientific issues and reach agreements on clinical trialprotocols the secretary is directed to issue guidance to reviewers of applications about promptness in conducting the review t echnical excellence lack of bias and conflict of interest and knowledge of regu latory and scientific standards such guidelines must apply equally to all who review applications the secretary is required to meet with investigational drug sponsors or approval applicants if they make reasonable re quest for meeting to reach agreement on the design and size of clinical trials to tablish effectiveness claims minutes of the meeting must be prepared any agreement between the secretary and the sponsorabout the parameters of the design and size of the clinical trial must be in writing and may not be changed after testing begins unle ss the sponsor

manufacturing practices procedures and facilitiesused in the smallscale production of li quid injectable positron emission tomography pet radiopharmaceuticals are in compliance with the agencys current goodmanufacturing practice gmp regulations in 1997 the fda published final rule to permit the agency to approve requests from manufacturers of pet drugs for exceptions or alternatives to its gmp regul ations the agency maintained that the action was necessary to relieve manufacturers from regulations that might result inunsafe handling of those products that were inapplicable or inappropriate and that did not enhance pet drug safety fdama97 the act establishes new statutory framework for the fda to oversee the regulation of pet products and nullifies the agencys earlier efforts so the ffdca is amended to include the regulation of compounded positronemission tomography pet drugs compounded pet drug is defined as drugthat exhibits spontaneous disintegration of unstable

the safety requirements of the ffdca the drugs will be deemed by the fda to be dulterated if procedures and facilities used for compounding do not conform to pet sta ndards and the official monographs of the u s pharmacopoeia additionally pet drugs must have the identity and strength and meet the quality and purity char acteristics that they are represented to possess these criteria will longer apply four years after the enactment date ortwo years after the secretary establishes new procedures whichever is later two years after enactment the secretary must establish approval procedures and good manufacturing practicesgmps for pet drugs in doing so the secretary must take due account of any relevant differences between commercialmanufacturers of the drugs and notforpro fit institutions that compound the drugs for their patients before establishing these procedures the secretary must consultwith patient advocacy groups professional associations manufacturers andphysicians and scientists licensed to make or use pet drugs for period of four years after enact ment or two years after establishing procedures whichever is longer the secr etary will longer require the submission

definition also includes any nonradioactive reagent kit or nuclide generator that is intended to be used in its preparation sec 123 modernization of regulation previous law or policy the fda regulates biol ogical drug products under the phsa historically both the biological product and its manufacturing establishment required licensing the fda recently announced that establishment licenseapplications would be eliminated for wellcharacterized products fdama97 the act codifies procedures for the regulation of biological products that are designed to streamline product review and approval biological product may not be introduced into interstate commerce unless it has biologicslicense and each package is marked with the products name the manufacturersname address and license number and th products expiration date by regulation the secretary must establish requireme nts for the approval suspension and revocation of biologics licenses approval of license will be based on ademonstration that the biological product is safe pure and potent and that the facility where the product is manufactured processed packed or held is designed to assure those standards also the application will be approved only on the condition that the licensee agrees to perm it inspection of its production facility the secretary must prescribe certain licensing and labeling exemptions for productsundergoing investigation falsifying the labeling or marking of ny package or container of biological product is prohibited and the requirement that biologics manufacturers obtainestablishment licenses is eliminated in addition biological product are defined to mean virus therapeutic serum t oxin antitoxin vaccine blood blood component or derivative allergenic product analogous product or

discretion of the secretary the ffdca provides that the effectiven ess of device may be determined on the basis of multiple wellcontrolled i nvestigations including where appropriate clinical studies regulations are codi fied at cfr 81439 for actions on pma supplement and the fda operates pilot program for expedited approval of such supplements general requirements under the ffdca for the labeling of device apply to all submissions neither law nor policy suggest reliance on postmarketcontrols during premarket review to determine whether device is substantiallyequivalent in its safety and effectiveness to one already on the market fdama97 the act codifies procedures for enhancing collaboration between the fda and device manufacturers during the approval process and for expediting review the secretary must take into consideration the possibility that reliance on postmarket controls can expedite the review and classi fication of devices upon written request from premarket approva l applicant the secretary must meet with the applicant to determine the type of valid scientific evidence needed to establish safety and effectiveness for the proposed use of the device following the meeting the secretary has 30 days to specify in writing the type of evidence thatwill provide reasonable assurance that th device is effective for its intended use any clinical data including those from one or more wellcontrolled investigations that are determined by the secretary as necessary to demonstrate thereasonable assurance of effectiveness of device must be requested from theapplicant in writing in such case the s ecretary must consult with the applicant to determine the least burdensome means of evaluating effectiveness that would bereasonably likely to result in approval the act adds new requirements for determining whether device is substantially equivalent to one already on the market the secretary must take into consideration the extent to which reliance on postmarket controls may expediteclassification of device determinations for the intended use of device must bebased on the proposed labeling submitted with the premarket notification indetermining whether device is substantially equivalent to one on the market thedevice review director may require statement on the device label that givesinformation about possible uses in ways that were not originally identified on thelabel if those uses were likely and poten tially harmful the device review director may not delegate this responsibility the requirement for unintended useidentification is effective for five years from the date of enactmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98263crs25 in deciding to approve or deny premarket approval application the secretary must rely on conditions of use that have been included in the proposedlabeling as the basis for determining whether there is reasonable assurance of safetyand effectiveness to determine whether the proposed label is false or misleadingthe secretary must evaluate all material facts pertinent to the proposed labeling premarket approval supplement must be required for any changes to device that affect its safety and effectiven ess unless the change is modification in the manufacturing process for the latter the applicant must submit to the secretary written details of the change summary of supporting data and notice that the change conforms with the ffdca the pplicant may distribute the device 30 days after notification unless the secretary notif ies the applicant within that period that additional information is needed the secr etary must review that supplement within 135 days of receiving it incremental device changes that affect safety oreffectiveness shall be approved if nonclinical data show that such changes enhance the device as intended and if clinical data provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness when necessary the secretary may require additional clinical data sec 206 premarket notification previous law or policy each manufacturer must report to the secretary intentions to market device by way of the premarket notification process thesecretary has the sole responsibility for the review and subsequent approval or denialof clearance for premarket notification the ffdca sets forth the process bywhich the devices may be exempted from premarket notification requirements fdama97 the act establishes statutory authority for procedures exempting class ii devices from premarket notification when the safety and effectiveness ofsuch devices is clear the act clarif ies an existing provision in the ffdca to exempt from premarket notification all cla ss i devices except those that will be used to prevent illness or that have high risk of injury or illness the act requires the secretary to publish within 60 days of enactment list of each type of class ii device that does not require premarket notification thoseexemptions are to become effective as of the date of publication in the federal register after that date the secretary may exempt class ii device or may grant an exemption in response to petition from an interested party notice of intent to exempt device from premarket notificati on requirements must be published in the federal register followed by 30day comment period within 120 days of issuing the notice in the federal register the secretary must publish final regulations for the device under consideration if the s ecretary fails to respond to petition to reclassify device within 180 days of receiving it the petition shall be granted the act prohibits the secretary from withholding the classification of device because of the applicants failure to comply with provisions of the ffdca unrelated to decision for substantial quivalence also decision to classify device may not be withheld if the facility in which the device is manufactured is notin compliance with good manufacturing practiceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98263crs26 the act clarifies that information to support claims of substantial equivalence may include appropriate clinical or scientific data that may be submitted to eitherthe secretary or an accredited person for consideration the term effectivenessreplaces the term efficacy of device that is being compared to another fordetermination of substantial equivalence also for determinations of substantialequivalence the secretary must issue guidance within 270 days of the acts enactment listing the criteria to be used to determine if specific intended use of device is different from general use sec 207 evaluation of automatic class iii designation previous law or policy the ffdca requires that all new devices not substantially equivalent to device already on the market must be automaticallyclassified into class iii fdama97 the act expedites procedures for reclassifying medical devices that were initially given class iii designa tion applicants who submit premarket notification for device that has been automatically assigned to class iii may now request the secretary to reclassify the device without waiting for the secretary to initiate actions for such requests the s ecretary must act upon the request within 60 days of its submission vices classified under this provision shall be considered predicate devices for the purpose of determining substantial equivalence sec 208 classification panels previous law or policy the ffdca requires the secretary to establish panels of experts to make recommendations for device classification classification panels are exempt from those requirements of section 14 of the federal advisorycommittee act that relate to duration of the panel also the ffdca states requirements for composition of classification panel and its operation fdama97 the act establishes schedule and procedural requirements for the classification panels classification panel must schedule its review of anapplication so that statutory deadlines for application review are met further the act clarifies the rights and privileges of the applicant to have equal access to data and information that have been submitted to the classification panel the opportunity to submit certain information to the panel and to participate in the meetings to the same degree as the secretary the panel meetings must provide adequate time

or final until it had undergone the full process ofinformal rulemaking notice and comment on proposed regulatory language andpublication of the final rule including provision of an effective implementation date fdama97 the act allows the secretary to make proposed regulations effective upon publication pending considera tion of public comment and publication of final regulation such action would be warranted to allow prompt action onpetitions that would provide consumer in formation that enables healthy dietary practices results in prompt and effectiv communication of important nutrition and health benefits or ensures that scientif ically sound nutrition and health information is available as soon as possi ble the secretary also would be able to use this procedure to act promptly to ban or m odify claim such proposed regulations would be considered final agency action for purposes of judicial review sec 302 petitions for claims previous policy or law under the previous policy when claim was submitted the secretary had to issue final decision either denying the claim or filing the petition within 100 days following its submission if petition was filed the secretary had an additional 90 days to deny or propose regulation based on the action requested by the petitioner historically until regulation is proposedinformation contained in the petition has not been made publically available fdama97 the act requires that petiti on not acted upon in 100 days will be considered denied unless an extensi on is agreed upon by the secretary and the petitioner if the petition is denied it would not be made publically available if the petition is filed but not acted upon within 90 days it will be considered to be denied unless there is mutually agreed upon

authoritative statement the claim must enable consumers to unders tand the relative significance of the information in the context of total daily diet the statement will be considered to be authoritative only if it is published by the scientific organization and not thestatement of an individual employee claim is allowed to be made under the requirements of this provision until the secretary by regulation prohibits or modifies the claim or determination ismade by either the secretary or us di strict court in an enforcement proceeding that the requirements for making the claim have not been met sec 304 nutrient content claims previous policy or law under the existing provisions specific nutrient content claim can be made only if it is allowed under an existing regulation anutrient content claim is claim that eith er expressly or by implication characterizes the level of nutrient contained in the food it would appear on the principle display panel and is required to be

nutrient required to be present to make given cont ent claim is based in part on the existence of daily value for the nutrient to which the amount of the nutrient present in the food can be compared fdama97 the act creates an alternative mechanism for allowing nutrient content claims on food products when nutrient content claim is not authorized under an existing regulation it can be author ized if the claim is based on current authoritative statement that identifies the relevant nutrient level statement willbe considered authoritative if it is published by scientif ic body of the us

proceeding that the requirements for making the claim have not been met sec 305 referral statements previous policy or law under the previous policy food product that contained nutrient at level that increases the risk of dietrelated disease or other adverse health condition is not allowed to make claim for that product in mostcases however nutrient content claim could be made for food containing possible riskincreasing nutrient as long as the presence of riskincreasing nutrient is disclosed on the label under the policy food was prohibited from making nutrient content claim if it contains more th an certain level of fat saturated fat cholesterol or sodium fdama97 the act clarifies how informati on about possible health risks of nutrient is conveyed on the label when nutrient claim is made about food andthe secretary determines that the food contai ns nutrient at level that increases ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98263crs35 dietrelated health risk to the general population the labeling must contain prominently and in immediate proximity to the claim the following statement see nutrition information for conten t where the blank id entifies the nutrient associated with the increased health risk in determining that an increased risk may exist the secretary must take into account the significance of the food in the total daily diet sec 306 disclosure of irradiation previous policy or law under the existing regulations there are several labeling requirements for irradiated foods for packaged foods the fdas rulesrequire both labeling statement and the internationally accepted logo the labelmust state that the food has been treated with irradiation or treated by radiation the labeling statement was originally included to inform consumers that the foodhad been treated with radiation because th ey were not familiar with the logo if it appeared alone on the label after an in itial twoyear period of using the statement only the logo was to be required the agen cy was to assess the labeling issue during that period if the fda determined that consumers still did not understand themeaning of the logo after the twoyear peri od then it was to propose extension of the wording requirement through regulation subsequently the fda amended theregulation on labeling of retail packages to extend for an additional two years therequirement that placed the wording with the irradiation logo and continue to appearprominently on labels labeling or at the poi nt of purchase display for all foods that are irradiated to date few foods had been introduced into interstate commerce that are irradiated so the use of the prominent wording along with the logo has beenextended indefinitely until it is determined that consumers understand it fdama97 the act prohibits any requirement of separate radiation disclosure statement on labeling that is more prominent than the declaration ofingredients on the food package the term radiation disclosure statements means written statement that discloses that food or component of it has been intentionally exposed to radiation sec 307 irradiation petition previous policy or law at the time of passage of fdama97 petition for red meat irradiation had been pending befo re the fda for three years the agency published the final regulation approving the pe tition for the application of irradiation to red meat on december 3 1997 before the process can be used to treat red meat however usda must also approve its use through regulation fdama97 the act requires that within 60 days of enactment the secretary is to make final determination on any petition pending before the fda that would permit irradiation for red meat if such determination is not made within that period then the secretary must provide the house committee on commerce and the senate committee on labor and human resources with an explanation of theprocess followed by the fda in reviewing the petition and the reasons action

agreement with the industry to endtest the lead content of glasscontainers in acetic acid solution in 1997 newly identified problems related to leadpaint led the agencies to decide that th old voluntary agreement was not stringent enough given advances in understanding the eff ects of lead in children as result the agencies convened meeting with industry and announced that the voluntary agreement was revoked fdama97 the act prohibits the secretary from implementing any requirement that would ban as an unapproved food additive lead and cadmiumbased paints in the lip and rim area of gla ss and ceramic ware before one year after the regulation is published lead and cadmiumbased paint may not be banned asan unapproved food additive if the paint is on glass or ceramic ware that has lessthen 60 millimeters of decoration below the exte rnal rim or is on an object that is not intended for use by children unless the secret ary determines that it is unsafe the secretary may not take any action before january 1 2003 to ban lead and cadmium based enamel on glass and ceramic ware any action taken after that date to bansuch enamel on those containers must be done by regulation and cannot be prohibited on those products before one year after the final regulation is published sec 309 food contact substances previous policy or law since passage of the food additive amendment of 1958 food contact substances fcs have been regulated in the same manner as food additives the manufacturer wishing to use the fcs was required to submit petition to the fda for approval if the fc s migration into th food was at high level alternatively the substance could be classified as generally recognized assafe prior sanctioned or used under an existing regulation fdama97 the act allows an fcs to be used in food products under either regulation or notification and the substance cannot be considered to beadulterated while either is in effect u nder the notification process at least 120 days prior to its introduction into interstate co mmerce the manufacturer or supplier of an fcs may notify the secretary of the name of the person identity and intended use of the fcs and the determination that it is safe the notification must contain the basis of the safe determination and all the information required to be submittedas outlined in regulations promulgated by the secretary the notification will become effective 120 days after it is submitted and the substance may then be introduced into inte rstate commerce unless within that period the secretary has determined that based on the information submitted its use isunsafe the manufacturer or supplier must be informed of an unsafedetermination decision by the secret ary to object to notification would constitute final agency action for purposes of judicial review the term food contacthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98263crs37 substance means the substance that is the subject of tification and does not include similar or identical substances manufactured or prepared by someone else the notification process can be used fo r marketing authorization for an fcs except where the secretary termines that submission and review of petition is necessary for adequate assurance of safety or the secretary and any manufactureror supplier agree that petition should be submitted the secretary is authorized to promulgate regulations to identify the circum stances in which petition is to be filed including such criteria as the probable c onsumption and potential toxicity of the fcs for 120 days after receipt the secret ary is to keep confidential any information provided in notification except for any trade secrets or confidentialcommercial information the material may then be made available to interestedparties the notification program will not opera in any fiscal year unless an appropriation of at least 3 million is specifi cally made for that program that fiscal year in addition the secretary is to certify that the amount appropriated for the fdas center for food safety and applied nutrition for each fiscal year is the same as or greater than the amount appropriate d for the center for fy1997 by april 1 1999 the secretary is to begin accepting and reviewing notifications if specific appropriation is made for the last six months of fy1999 and certified by thesecretary the necessary sums are to be appropriated for each fiscal year from 1999 through 2003 authorization of these appr opriations however cannot be made for fiscal year for any amount below that specified by the act not later than april1 of fy1998 and february 1 of each subse quent fiscal year the secretary must provide an estimate of the costs of operating the notification program for the nextfiscal year to the house and

reflect properly the medical use or application for which they have been approved by statute drug and device manufacturers must provide evidence that their products are safe and that they w ill have the effect prescribed recommended or suggested in their labeling the ffdca defines labeling to mean all labels and other written printed or graphic matter upon any article or any of its containers orwrappers or accompanying such article further any drug or device whose labeling is false or misleading in any particular is considered misbranded underthat act under its longstanding policy the fda considers virtually any materialpromoting drug or device to be construed as part of its labeling manufacturerstraditionally have been allowed to disseminate information or make promotionalclaims about product as long as the information or claims are consistent with theproducts official labeling fda modified its policy somewhat in 1996 when it published two guidance documents 61 fr 52800 oct 8 1996 entitled guidance to industry ondissemination of reprints of certain pub lished original data and guidance for industry funded dissemination of reference texts those documents coversituations where drug and device sponsors ma wish to distribute journal articles and reference texts containing information that may be inconsistent with the productsapproved labeling in december 1997 62 fr 64074 dec 3 1997 the fda issued another guidance document covering the dissemination of information about drugor devices unapproved offlabel use at industrysupported scientific andeducational activities that document describes how industry may support thoseactivities without being subjected to regulation under the ffdca fdama97 the act provides means for health care practitioners to obtain scientific information about offlabel uses of drug or device when those uses arenot included in the products approved beling the act also creates new regulatory mechanism for filing supplemental pplications for such uses if specific requirements are met manufacturers may distribute written information about thesafety effectiveness or benefit of use not described in products approvedlabeling before offlabel use information about drug can be distributed new drug application filed under section 505b of the ffdca or biologics license issuedunder section 351 of the phsa must be in effect offlabel use information abouta device can only be disseminated if the product is in commercial distribution andcomplies with specified classification and premarket approval regulations the off label information must meet the requirements of section 552 authorized informationdissemination and cannot be based on clinical research conducted by anothermanufacturer without their authorization to the results of such research to disseminate the information the manufacturer must 60 days before distributionsubmit to the secretary copy of the information including clinical trials andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98263crs39 experience about the safety and effectiveness of the unapproved use and must comply with the requirements for filing supplemental application manufacturers must include prominent statement showing that the information if applicable concerns an pproved use of drug or device that the disseminated information if applicable is being paid for by the manufacturer the names of any authors who have financial ties with the manufacturer the officiallabeling for the drug or device statemen t if applicable that there are other approved products or treatments for the use for which the information is beingdisseminated the identification of all pe rsons funding any study about the offlabel new use and bibliography of publishe d articles about the unapproved use from scientific or medical journals if the secretary determines after providing notice and meeting opportunity that the offlabel use information fails to provide data analyses or other objective material dissemination of additional objective and scientifically soundinformation can be required along with statement of the secretary based onscientifically valid data about the safety and effectiveness of the drugs unapproved use manufacturers may disseminate information about an unapproved new use only it the information is in the form of an unabridged reprint or copy of an article peer reviewed by experts the article mu st be from medical journal and describe scientifically sound clinical investigation or else it must be from an unabridgedreference publication that includes such in formation reference publication is one that has not been written edited or pub lished specifically for or significantly influenced by manufacturer is generally available where medical texts are sold does not focus on any particular manufacturers drug or primarily on unapproveduses of drugs from manufacturer supporting the dissemination and does notpresent false or misleading material in addition to disseminate offlabel use information manufacturers must prepare and submit biannually to the secretary list of articles and referencepublications that are about their drugs pproved uses and that were disseminated for the sixmonth period prior to the submission of the list additionallymanufacturers must submit lists that identify the categories of providers that receivedthat material for the same period manufact urers that distribute offlabel information must keep records that may be used in situations where the secretary requirescorrective action be taken the records must be made available to the secretaryupon request for ensuring or taking correctiv action at the secretarys discretion the records may identify the recipient of the information to disseminate offlabel use informa tion manufacturers must also submit supplemental application to the secretar be certified that they will file supplemental application based on completed or planned studies or be granted anexemption from submitting such an application in the case of completed studies manufacturers can submit certification that the necessary studies have been comple ted and the supplement will be submitted later than six months after the initial information dissemination httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98263crs40 in the case of planned studies manufacturers must submit an application with proposed protocol and schedule for the studies needed for the supplementalapplication and certify that it will be subm itted later than three years after the initial information dissemination or as appli cable not later than date the secretary may specify the secretary must determine whether the proposed protocol isadequate and whether the schedule is reas onable manufacturers must also submit periodic status reports if the secretary determines that the studies cannot becompleted and submitted within three years and that the manufacturer has diligently conducted the studies an extension of up to two years may be provided to obtain an exemption from submitting supplemental application the manufacturer must submit an application for an exemption it must be approved by the secretary and it must not be terminated due to corrective action exemptionsmay only be approved if the secretary determines that the supplemental applicationwould be economically prohibitive in making that determination the secretarymust consider the size of the patient p opulation expected to benefit from the exemption approval and whether the manuf acturer would be entitled to any periods of exclusive marketing rights in addition an exemption may be granted if thesecretary determines that it would be unethical to conduct the necessary studies the secretary must approve or deny an application for an exemption within 60 days or the application is deemed pproved the secretary however may at any time terminate such approval and order the manufacturer to cease distributing theinformation the secretary may prescribe the form and manner of applicationssubmitted under this section if the secretary determines that th unapproved use may not be effective or may present significant risk to the public health corrective action can be ordered manufacturers are responsible for reporting results of additional clinical researchabout the safety and effectiveness of the unapproved use involved the extent ofthose responsibilities is to be set by regulation by the secretary the secretary after notification may order manufacturer to stop dissemination of information if it is not in compliance this order may be issuedonly after the secretary provides notice to the manufacturer and an opportunity for meeting if the compliance failure is nor the secretary must delay the order and provide to the manufacturer an opportunity to correct the violation manufacturers can be ordered to stop dissemination when the supplemental application does not contain adequate information the manufacturer aftercertification has not submitted the necessary supplemental application within sixmonths or the manufacturer after certifica tion has not acted with due diligence to complete the required studies in situations where the secretary terminates anapproved exemption an order to stop disse mination will be made and complied with within 60 days manufacturers can be ordere d to correct the information only if the unapproved use would pose significant risk to human health disseminating offlabel use information to an unsolicited request from health care practitioner is not prohibited by this act information disseminationabout offlabel uses as defined in this pr ovision is not to be considered evidence ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98263crs41 new intended use of drug or device th at is different from the intended use described in its official labeling the disseminated information may not beconsidered by the secretary as labeling adulteration or misbranding under theffdca nothing is this provision may aff ect patent rights

has implemented several regulatory policies to make it easier for patients to ga in access to experimental therapies in 1987 the agency promulgated its treatment investigational new drug regulations which authorized the use of an experimental drug or biological product to treat alifethreatening or seriously debilitating disease if that use is under clinical investigation in 1990 the us public health service in response to the aidsepidemic initiated its parallel track policy allowing patients who could notparticipate directly in clinical trials to receive experimental drugs for treatment purposes while the drugs were being evalua ted in clinical trials in 1992 the fda implemented its accelerated approval policy that speeds the review and approvalprocess for drugs and biologics that may provide significant benefit over existing therapy fdama97 the act codifies and expands upon existing fda policy to facilitate access to experimental drugs and devices it gives the fda the authority to broaden existing regulations to streamline drug accessibility so that they cover alllifethreatening diseases and conditions patients are allowed expanded access toinvestigational therapies and the secretary has the authority in medical emergenciesto allow the shipment of investigational drugs or devices for diagnosis monitoring or treatment any person acting through physician can request from and be provided by any manufacturer or distributor an inves tigational drug or device for the diagnosis monitoring or treatment of serious disease or condition the physician must determine that the patient has comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy andthat the risk from the investigational product is greater than from the disease orcondition there must be fficient
