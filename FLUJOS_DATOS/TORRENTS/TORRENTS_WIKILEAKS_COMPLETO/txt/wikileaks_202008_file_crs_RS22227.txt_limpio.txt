whose current dominance she helped to establish the remainder of the report reviews her takingsrelated writings for the court beginning in 1978 the supreme court embarked on an effort continuing to this day to lend some doctrinal clarity to the takings clause of the fifth amendment1 since the appointment of sandra day oconnor as supreme court associate justice on september 25 1981 the court has decided by written opinion about 35 takings cases cases in which property owners asserted that government action had taken their property within the meaning of the clause in another five written opinions during this time the court decided claims arising out of direct condemnation2 this report offers an overview of justice oconnors views as to the proper application of the takings clause it then summarizes the majority opinions she herself authored plus important concurrences and dissents that she authored or joined 1 the takings clause states nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation 2 both takings cases and direct condemnation cases are premised on the governments power of eminent domain the difference between the two is that takings case is brought by the property owner who argues that government action has effectively taken his property by eminent domain as by excessive regulation even though the government has not formally invoked the power by contrast direct condemnation suit is brought by the government and expressly acknowledges that the government is invoking eminent domain to take property and must compensate congressional research service the library of congress crs2 overview having been appointed by president reagan who explicitly championed property rights agenda many expected justice oconnor to tilt reflexively toward the property rights side of the takings clause cases that came before the court this did not happen instead on this issue at least she established her place at the ideological center of the court often with justice kennedy acting as swing vote between the liberalmoderate bloc justices stevens ginsburg souter and breyer and the socalled core conservatives justices rehnquist scalia and thomas of the 40 takings and direct condemnation decisions during her tenure justice oconnor voted on the winning side in 35 in doing so she voted for the propertyowner side in 15 of the 40 cases roughly the number of cases in which the propertyowner side won notwithstanding her center position on the court justice oconnor is associated with many statements sympathetic to property owners in preseault v icc3 she wrote in concurrence that federal programs cannot redefine property interests created under state law and thereby deprive property owners of their takings claims in two dissents from denials of certiorari she was the only justice to join core conservative justice in questioning prior governmentfriendly takings httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22227 rulings4 in suitum v tahoe regional planning agency5 she famously exclaimed during oral argument on the question whether plaintiffs taking claim was ripe why not give this poor elderly woman the right to go to court and have her takings claim heard and most recently in kelo v city of new london6 she vigorously dissented from the majoritys holding that the takings clause poses obstacle to the condemnation of private homes for transfer to private developers solely in the name of economic development justice oconnor however did not translate this asserted empathy for the property owner into espousal of bold doctrinal changes to takings law perhaps the only explanation for this and it is certainly not complete one is that in takings law as elsewhere she favored an ad hoc factintensive casebycase resolution of constitutional claims and was hesitant to endorse broad per rules7 thus she favored the ad hoc analysis of regulatory takings claims embodied in the courts penn central test under which courts are to balance variety of amorphous factors with so far little guidance from the supreme court8 indeed an oconnor concurrence in 2001 played pivotal role 3 494 us 1 1990 4 stevens v town of cannon beach 510 us 1207 1994

us 725 1997 6 125 s ct 2655 2005 7 outside the takings area justice oconnors preference for flexible ad hoc rules is most closely associated with her undue burden criterion for discerning unconstitutional government restrictions on access to abortion see planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey 505 us 833 874 1992 adopting undue burden standard and collecting her prior opinions on the criterion 8 penn central transp co v new york city 438 us 104 124 1978 crs3 in the resurrection of the penn central test9 in any event the property rights bar certainly did not regard her as reliable vote majorityplurality opinions authored by justice oconnor justice oconnor authored five majority or plurality opinions in the takings field while on the court two ruling for the property owner three for the government hawaii v midkiff 198410 hawaii statute sought to lessen the highly concentrated pattern of land ownership in the state it did this by allowing state agency to condemn qualified lands at the behest of the lessees of such lands whereupon the agency could sell the lands to the former tenants landowners claimed that the privateto private transfer of their lands did not satisfy the takings clause requirement that eminent domain be exercised only for public use on behalf of unanimous court justice oconnor disagreed the public use requirement she said is coterminous with the scope of sovereigns police powers and reducing the evils caused by land oligopoly is classic exercise of such powers the court will not substitute its judgment as to what constitutes public use for that of the legislature unless the use is without reasonable httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22227 foundation and the mere fact that the condemned property is transferred to private beneficiaries does not mean the taking has only private purpose hodel v irving 198711 federal statute required that small fractional interests in allotted indian lands not descend to heirs by intestacy or devise but instead escheat to the tribe writing for unanimous court justice oconnor held that the statute effected taking it amounted she wrote to complete abrogation not just regulation of the right to pass on property to ones heirs right that is basic to the concept of property yee v city of escondido 199212 mobile home park owners claimed taking through the combined effect of mobilehome rent control ordinance and state law forcing mobile home park owners to accept purchasers of mobile homes in the park as new tenants writing for unanimous court justice oconnor disagreed she discerned physical taking by the tenants who could not be rejected because neither the state nor local laws required the landowner to dedicate his land to mobile home park use nor overly limited his ability to terminate such use because the physical occupation by the tenants was not coerced there could be physical taking and the owners regulatory takings argument was not properly before the court eastern enterprises v apfel 199813 the coal industry retiree health benefit act of 1992 required certain companies to fund the health benefits of miners who had once worked for them even if the company left the mining business before 1974 when the promise of lifetime benefits in collective bargaining agreements became explicit in her 9 see note 18 infra and accompanying text 10 467 us 229 11 481 us 704 12 503 us 519 13 524 us 498 crs4 fourjustice plurality opinion justice oconnor found taking because the statute imposed severe retroactive liability on limited class of parties that could not have anticipated the liability and the extent of liability was disproportionate to the companys experience in the mining field justice kennedy provided the fifth vote for the majority though he supported invalidating the statutes application to the petitioner based on due process not takings law the four dissenters also thought that due process was the applicable theory but unlike justice kennedy would have found violation here lingle v chevron usa inc 200514 an oil company asserted taking based on state statute limiting the rent that oil companies may charge service station operators who lease stations owned by oil companies the stated purpose of the statute was to hold down retail gas prices in an opinion by justice oconnor unanimous court saw taking because the oil companys only claim before the court that the state regulation failed to substantially advance legitimate state interest holding down prices invoked an improper takings test the court admitted its error in inserting the substantially advance test into takings law quarter century previously takings law properly understood focuses on the burdens regulation imposes on property by contrast the substantially advances test targets regulations effectiveness dueprocesslike httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22227 inquiry important concurrences and dissents writing in concurrences and dissents as opposed to majority opinions justice has greater freedom to offer his or her unvarnished views since there is need to make the compromises often required to attract the votes of at least four other justices in justice oconnors concurrences and dissents those she wrote and those she joined her sympathy for the propertyowner side of the argument is more evident connolly v pension benefit guaranty corp 198615 federal statute required that an employer withdrawing from multiemployer pension plan pay fixed debt to the plan in the amount of the employers proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested benefits though joining the majority opinion in rejecting the facial taking claim justice oconnor wrote separately to emphasize the possible harsh impacts of the withdrawal liability and the appropriateness of the court considering those impacts in future as applied challenge note seven years later when an asapplied taking challenge to the statute did come before the court justice oconnor joined the courts unanimous opinion that taking had occurred pennell v city of san jose 198816 rent control ordinance allowed landlords to automatically raise rents by as much as eight percent annually if tenant objected to greater increase hearing was required to see whether the increase was reasonable allowing the hearing officer to consider hardship to tenant the majority opinion found 14 125 s ct 2074 15 475 us 211 16 485 us 1 crs5 the facial taking claim against the hardship provision to be premature since the hardship provision had never in fact been relied upon to deny rent increase justice oconnor was the only one to join justice scalias dissent in which he argued that the claim was not premature and that on the merits the ordinance effected taking preseault v icc 199017 under the federal railstotrails statute unused railroad rightsofway can be converted into recreational trails despite any reversionary interest that the holder of the underlying title might have under state law justice oconnor joined the courts unanimous opinion that if taking occurred compensation should be sought in the us court of federal claims which the title owner had not done she also wrote separately however to reject the view of the court below that the icc by certifying trail conversion merely defers the vesting of the title holders interest rather than defeats it she stressed that the icc could not redefine statelaw property interests so that where conversion defeated the title holders reversionary interest taking occurred palazzolo v rhode island 200118 in the context of taking challenge to state wetlands restriction the majority opinion addressed the notice rule this rule adopted by several state supreme courts asserts that regulatory taking claim is absolutely barred httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22227 when based on landuse restriction imposed under regulatory regime that existed when the land was acquired the majority opinion rejected the rule as an absolute bar but failed to say what role the preexisting regulatory regime did have in the takings analysis even if short of dispositive justice scalia in his concurrence said none at all justice oconnors concurrence by contrast asserted her usual distaste for such absolute views insisting that the preexisting regime was still relevant and that the weight to be given it depended on the particular facts note year later in the takings case of tahoesierra preservation council v tahoe regional planning agency 200219 the courts majority opinion quoted at length from justice oconnors concurrence in palazzolo since then lower courts have displayed little doubt that her view not justice scalias is the reigning legal principle kelo v city of new london 200520 this muchpublicized decision involved the citys use of condemnation to further its economic development plan and thus relieve its depressed economy slim 5justice majority found that the condemnations were for public use as the takings clause requires notwithstanding that private land would be transferred to private developers in an impassioned dissent for herself and three other justices justice oconnor rejected the view that condemnations solely for economic development satisfy the public use requirement under the banner of economic development all private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner so long as it might be upgraded the kelo dissent in particular is revealing two decades earlier justice oconnor had penned one of the courts major public use decisions in hawaii v midkiff recall from page 3 that justice oconnors views there were highly accommodating of the 17 494 us 1 18 533 us 606 19 535 us 302 20 125 s ct 2655 crs6 governments interests the public use requirement she had said is coterminous with the sovereigns police powers the court should not substitute its judgment as to what constitutes public use for that of the legislature and the mere fact of privatetoprivate transfers need not be constitutional problem in kelo by contrast she endorsed much narrower concept of public use requiring her to rethink her midkiff discussion as wrong or at least overbroad what was the reason for the narrower view in kelo justice oconnor attempted to distinguish the two cases saying that midkiff involved affirmatively harmful uses of land while in kelo the homes to be condemned were wellmaintained that is there was blight but her effort seems less than convincing another hypothesis admittedly speculative is that her analysis was affected by the fact that the oligopolistic landowners in midkiff were presumably affluent while those in kelo appeared to be of modest means indeed she stressed in kelo that the beneficiaries of the majority opinion are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power as for the victims the government now has license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more in her view the founders cannot have intended this perverse result justice oconnors differing conclusions in midkiff and kelo thus seemingly exemplify httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22227 her general sensitivity to the facts of case and her resistance to hardandfast rules
