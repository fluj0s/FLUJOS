fy2008 would be 155 billion1 since fy1991 high value exports intermediate products such as wheat flour feedstuffs and vegetable oils or consumerready products such as fruits nuts meats and processed foods have outpaced such bulk commodity exports as grains oilseeds and cotton in fy2008 high value agricultural exports are forecast to account for 60 of the value of total agricultural exports2 much of the growth in us agricultural exports in 2007 and 2008 is expected to come from strong demand for bulk commodities such as wheat feed grains oilseeds and cotton figure 1 us agricultural exports

crs2 agricultural exports are important both to farmers and to the us economy production from almost third of us cropland moves into export channels according to usda usda estimates that from 21 to 23 of us agricultural production crops and livestock is exported3 exports account for almost half of wheat production more than onethird of soybeans and fifth of corn the share of exports of specialty crops such as almonds is 70 while for other specialty crops such as walnuts or grapefruit the export share is as high as 40 export share of livestock products is lower than for crops as most meat and dairy products are consumed domestically us agricultural exports generate employment income and purchasing power in both the farm and nonfarm sectors according to usda each 1 received from agricultural exports stimulates another 164 in supporting activities to produce those exports recent data show that agricultural exports generate an estimated 806000 fulltime civilian jobs including 455000 jobs in the nonfarm sector4 many variables interact to determine the level of us agricultural exports income population growth and tastes and preferences in foreign markets us and foreign supply and prices and foreign import barriers and exchange rates us domestic farm policies that affect price and supply and trade agreements with other countries also influence the level of us

to carry out its obligations net losses from its operations subsequently are restored through the congressional appropriations process crs4 the gsm102 program guarantees repayment of shortterm financing six months to three years extended to eligible countries that purchase us farm products9 the gsm103 program guarantees repayment of commercial financing up to 10 years to buyers in eligible countries to purchase us farm products the supplier credit guarantee program scgp guarantees payment by foreign buyers of us commodities and products that are sold by us suppliers on shortterm deferred payment basis the duration of the credit is short generally up to 180 days although the 2002 farm bill permits guarantees of up to 360 days the facility guarantee program fgp guarantees financing of goods and services exported from the united states to improve or establish agriculturerelated facilities in emerging markets that will improve the handling marketing storage or distribution of imported us agricultural commodities and products the 2002 farm bill authorizes export credit guarantees of 55 billion worth of agricultural exports annually through fy2007 while giving fas the flexibility to determine the allocation between short and intermediateterm programs the actual level of guarantees depends on market conditions and the demand for financing by eligible

operating the export credit guarantee programs crs5 export credit guarantee program issues export credit guarantee programs have become an issue in wto dispute settlement as result of dispute raised by brazil against certain aspects of the us cotton program10 the wto dispute panel in the cotton case ruled in 2005 that three us export credit guarantee programs gsm102 gsm103 and scgp were prohibited subsidies because the financial benefits returned to the government by these programs did not cover their longrun operating costs this ruling by the dispute settlement panel applied not only to cotton but to other commodities as well the panel recommended that the united states take steps to remove the adverse effects of these subsidies or to withdraw them entirely the administration suspended operation of gsm103 in 2006 and asked congress to repeal the legislative authorization for the program and make other changes in the presidents fy2007 and fy2008 budget requests the effectiveness of the credit guarantee programs also has been an issue the office of management and budget omb reviewed the programs and found that export credit guarantees were only moderately effective in meeting program goals11 omb noted also that there were substantial defaults particularly in the sgcp program situation that led usda to suspend operations of scgp in 2006 administration proposals the administration in its farm bill trade proposals recommended changes in ccc export credit guarantee programs that would bring them into compliance with the findings of the wto dispute resolution panel in the brazil cotton case to accomplish this the administration asked congress to remove the 1 cap on fees that can be collected under the shortterm credit guarantee program gsm102 and to eliminate specific legislative authority for the intermediate export credit guarantee program gsm103 and the sgcp usda also proposed repeal of the sgcp because of approximately 227 million in defaults and evidence of fraudulent activity the administration proposed to change the facility guarantee program fgp to attract users who commit to purchasing us agricultural products fgp funds have been allocated under the current farm bill congressional action both versions of the f arm bill make the changes in usdas export credit guarantee programs recommended by the administration repeal of gsm103 and the sgcp and removal of the 1 cap on origination fees for gsm guarantees the gsm102 program is extended through fy2012 export subsidies the current farm bill authorizes direct export subsidies of agricultural products through the export enhancement program eep and the dairy export incentive program deip the last year of substantial eep activity was 1995 and there has 10 for

farm bill farm bill average fy2006 program purpose millions million fy2002fy2006 eep direct subsidies of 0 0 agricultural products deip direct subsidies of 18 0 dairy products source usda annual budget summaries eep and deip eep was established in 1985 first by the secretary of agriculture under authority granted in the commodity credit corporation charter act and then under the food security act of 1985 pl 99198 eeps main stated rationale at its inception was to combat unfair trading practices of competitors other subsidizing countries such as the european union in world agricultural markets the general sales manager administers eep most eep subsidies have been used to assist sales of wheat many exporters have received subsidies but from 1985 to 1995 three exporting firms received almost half the total of all eep subsidies which totaled more than 7 billion the united states agreed to reduce its agricultural export subsidies under the 1994 wto uruguay round agreement on agriculture and in ongoing multilateral trade negotiations advocates that all agricultural export subsidies be eliminated deip most recently reauthorized in the commodity program title not the trade title of the 2002 farm bill was established under the 1985 farm act to assist exports of us dairy products its purpose was to counter the adverse effects of foreign dairy export subsidies primarily those of the european union wto export subsidy reduction commitments apply also to deip export subsidy program issues eep has been controversial since its inception many oppose the program outright on grounds of economic efficiency eep they argue like all export subsidies interferes with the operations of markets and distorts trade others noting that the uruguay round agreement on agriculture restricts but does not prohibit agricultural export subsidies point out that as long as competitors such as the european union use export subsidies the united states should also be prepared to use them the effectiveness of eep also has been an issue several studies of the use of eep found that wheat exports would have declined if eep were eliminated suggesting that the eep program increased wheat exports other analysts however found that subsidizing wheat exports under eep crs7 resulted in displacing exports of unsubsidized grains12 while many oppose subsidizing dairy products for reasons similar to those held by eep opponents deip has strong support in congress omb also has evaluated the effectiveness of eep and deip13 omb found that the export subsidy programs were only moderately effective in meeting program goals of countering export subsidies or unfair trade practices of other countries in ombs judgment the export subsidy programs have not been able to demonstrate an ability to permanently expand exports or build us market share in targeted countries the agency does note that deip was successful in offsetting eu export subsidies for dairy products to mexico which permitted the united states to develop and maintain market for dairy product exports to that country administration proposals the administration proposed the repeal of eep because it argued eep is not useful tool for us agricultural exports it has been inactive for many years and eliminating it would not materially affect us agricultural exports the administration notes also that using eep would be inconsistent with the us goal of eliminating export subsidies in the wto doha round of multilateral trade negotiations14 the administration made proposals for either eliminating or reauthorizing deip however congressional action the senate version of the farm bill calls for the repeal of eep while the house bill extends authority for eep through fy2012 both the senate and house farm bills also extend the authorization for deip in title i the commodity title through fy2012 export market development programs the 2002 farm bill authorizes mandatory funding for four programs to

fmdp the 2002 farm bill also reauthorizes ccc funding for fmdp through fy2007 at an annual level of 345 million the program which began in 1955 is similar to map in most major respects its purpose is to promote us agricultural exports by undertaking activities such as consumer promotions technical assistance trade servicing and market research in contrast to map fmdp mainly promotes generic or bulk commodities as with map projects under fmdp are jointly funded by the government and industry groups and the government reimburses the industry organization for its part of the cost after the project is finished like map fmdp is exempt from wto export subsidy reduction commitments emp emp provides funding for technical assistance activities intended to promote exports of us agricultural commodities and products to emerging markets in all geographic regions consistent with us foreign policy an emerging market is defined in the authorizing legislation as any country that is taking steps toward marketoriented economy through food agricultural or rural business sectors of the economy of the country additionally an emerging market country must have the potential to provide viable and significant market for us agricultural commodities crs9 or products eligible countries must have per capita incomes of less than 10065 in 20052006 and population greater than 1 million funding for the emp is set at 10 million each fiscal year through fy2007 in the 2002 farm bill tasc tasc aims to assist us organizations by providing funds for projects that address sanitary phytosanitary sps and technical barriers that prohibit or threaten us speciality crop exporters the 2002 farm bill defines specialty crops as all cultivated plants and the products thereof produced in the united states except wheat feed grains oilseeds cotton rice peanuts sugar and tobacco the types of activities covered include seminars and workshops study tours field surveys pest and disease research and preclearance programs the 2002 farm bill authorizes 2 million of ccc funds each fiscal year through fy2007 for the tasc program export market development program issues basic issue raised by map and fmdp and in some cases all the export programs is whether the federal government should have an active role in helping agricultural producers and agribusinesses market their products overseas some argue that map and fmdp are forms of corporate welfare in that they fund activities that private firms would and could fund for themselves others argue that the principal beneficiaries are foreign consumers and that funds could be better spent for example to educate us firms on how to export program supporters counter that foreign competitors especially eu member countries also spend money on market promotion and that us marketing programs help keep us products competitive in thirdcountry markets ombs reviews of the effectiveness of the market development efforts determined that the programs were moderately effective but that the programs did not necessarily serve clear need15 many of the groups that receive market development funds it reported receive at least some corporate funding and could afford to support their own export promotion efforts omb did note that the tasc program has helped to reduce barriers to us agricultural exports citing the example of tascfunded efforts to open taiwans apple market to us apples administration proposals the administration proposed an increase in mandatory funding for map by 250 million over 10 years the additional funds would be used to address perceived inequities between farm bill program crops grains oilseeds and cotton and nonprogram crops especially specialty crops organic agriculture would be allowed to compete for map funding to help develop the export of organic products in addition the administration proposed to increase mandatory funding for tasc to 68 million over 10 years and to increase the maximum allowable project award to 500000 to address sps issues generally the administration called for the establishment of new grant program of 20 million over 10 years to further focus resources on international sps barriers for all agricultural commodities to enhance usda participation in international standardsetting bodies such as the codex alimentarius the international plant protection convention and the world animal health organization the 15 httpwwwwhitehousegovombexpectmoresummary100030122005html crs10 administration requested the authorization of longterm mandatory funding of 15 million over 10 years congressional action both the senate bill and the house bill reauthorize usdas agricultural export promotion programs through fy2012 the senate bill increases map funding by 100 million over the five fiscal years fy2008fy2012 while the house bill increases map funding by 125 million both bills specifically authorize map to promote exports of organically produced commodities the house bill authorizes ccc funding for fmdp through fy2012 with change in the funding levels authorized in the 2002 farm bill ie 345 million the senate bill reauthorizes fmdp through fy2012 but increases its funding by 22 million over five fiscal years hr 2419 also increases funding for tasc which the 2002 farm bill authorizes at 2 million of ccc funds per fiscal year total funding for tasc in hr 2419 over five years would amount to 38 million the senate bill provides total of 292 million for tasc over five years other farm bill trade title provisions both bills authorize discretionary appropriations such sums as necessary to assist limited resource persons and organizations associated with agricultural trade to address unfair trade practice of foreign countries and to reduce trade barriers included among trade title proposals from the administration this measure would help smaller groups and industries who want to challenge trade practices of other countries but lack the technical and analytical expertise to successfully mount challenge the housepassed bill also authorizes discretionary appropriations to enhance us participation in international standardsetting organizations such as the codex alimentarius commission or the world organization for animal health the intent of this measure also proposed by the administration is to help bring us interests to bear in standardsetting organizations when sanitary phytosanitary or technical trade are on the agenda for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34227
