department of antioquia uribe has built much of his public career there antioquia has the second largest popula tion in colombia after the federal district of bogotá it is noted for distinct entrepreneurial spirit business acumen and social mobility that made it leader in coff ee production commerce manufacturing and finance2 and some would suggest contributed to the rise in the 1980s of the cocaine trafficking cartel centered in medellín the department capital3 uribe began his career in appointed posts serving first as an administrator in medellin city office dealing with public work s 1976 he then moved to bogotá when he was appointed general secretary at the labor ministry 19771978 and served in second national post as director of civilia n aeronautics 19801982 he returned to antioquia when he was appointed the mayor of medellín in 19824 in 1983 his father was killed allegedly by members of the leftist guerrilla revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc during an attempted kidnapping noted as crime buster while mayor5 uribe subsequently served from 19841986 on the medellín town council he was next elected to two fouryear terms as national senator 19861994 and then to threeyear term as governor of antioqui province serving from jan 1 1995 december 31 1997 during his years as senator and governor according to one news report he established reputation for fiscal skill and honestybut also for having prickly authoritarian streak6 in the course of his career uribe has been viewed as both social reformer and lawandorder politician while governor he explained this duality as student i thought all the problems were caused by social inequalities now i rea lize that if we dont fight crime we cannot improve the standard of living and so i made decision to strengthen the state and the social structure7 thus during his term as senator uribe was one of the primary proponents of national health legisl ation and as governor he emphasized education providing subsidies to encourage school attendance according to two colombian analysts he also achieved successes in carrying out public works projects and new social spending according to newspaper report8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21242crs3 9 according to the state departments country reports on human rights practices for 1996 an escalation in paramilitary killings in antioquia and other regions reflects the intensified competition between paramilitary and guerrilla organizations for control across broad sweep of territory the victims of paramilitary killings however were

establishm ent in antioquia of statesponsored convivir civilian rural defense organizations which were intended to provide intelligence to local police and military commanders and were authorized by national law in 1994 uribe strongly defended them in july 1997 stimony before the human rights commission he stated they were legal manifestation of th civilian populations legitimate right to selfd efense in the face of rising guerrilla violence10 by that time the convivir groups had became controversial nationw ide and were dismantled in the late 1990s because of human rights abuses reputation of secrecy and perceived unaccountability to civilian authorities and b ecause some were belie ved to have served as fronts for or were otherwise linked with the illegal paramilitary groups at least four convivir groups in antioquia province are cited by human rights watch for massacres or murders during the period that uribe wa s governor uribe shut down one of them11 uribe also was willing to try other ways to end the conflict in his department he invited team from the harvard negotiation pr oject to antioquia to train peasants in conflict resolution techniques he also as ked the national govern ment to invite the united nations to send b lue helmet peacekeepers to antioquia to intervene in the conflict which the national g overnment rejected such experimental approaches were admired by some analysts but consid ered quixotic or naive by others the may 26 2002 elections dissident member of colombias liberal party uribe ran as an independent on the colombia first ticket in the may 26 elections he obtained just over 53 of the vote in an elevencandidate field after surviving three attempts on his life by the farc in the six months before his victory some analysts believe that his vict ory was due in part to the ruptures within colombias two tr aditional parties the liberals and the conservatives one of whose candidates has won every co lombian elections since 1958 the

about 6 of the vote some 21 less than her take in the 1998 first round surprise to some analysts was the 6 of the vote won by the candidate of new democraticleft party luis edua rdo garzon former labor leader during the campaign uribe was generally perceived according to one analysis as emphasizing citizen security and state authority political reform and the fight against corruption in contrast to his major opponents emphasis on social equity political reform economic recovery and reform and negotiated or political end to the armed conflict12 the most widely reported elements of uribes campaign message were his promises to increase colombias military budget approximately double the size of the military to 100000 at which point he would liminate obligatory military service for all males and create onemillion man civilian militia to aid the colombian military there has been conflicting information as to whether this militia would be armed or not nevertheless uribes 100poi nt program contains br oad social political and economic agenda13 his proposal starts by outlining his vision for new colombia where instead of 60 of the population living in poverty most would be counted as middle class he envisions country of politi cal and economic democracy with legitimate government authority and zero power for those who foment vi olence colombia without guerrillas and without paramilitaries his colomb ia would be inhabited by citizens who enjoy opportunity for all and w ho respect the environment his 100 point program explicitly rejects some aspects of the classical neolib eral economic model which he says leaves social welfare to ch ance market forces while increasing misery and social injustice elsewhere however he has assured businessmen that his administration would strive to put in place clear and correct macroeconomic policy public order and stable business environment designed to make colombia attractive to foreign and domestic investors alike14 he also proposes series of government reforms to reduce the size of the state and bureaucracy including the elimination of one of colombias two legislative chambers in order to cut government spending during his campaign one of uribes oppone nts liberal party candidate horacio serpa and others accused uribe of supportin g the paramilitaries and others rumored

substantiated although they continue to taint perceptions of uribe and his future presidency part of the allegations of ties to drug traffickers sprang from his fathers friendship with fabio ochoa head of cocainetrafficking family friendship which uribes defenders stated was based on mutual interest in horses the allegations of sympathies towards paramilitary groups may st em in part from l ongstanding differences between uribe and serpa on the convivir groups and the links of some of those groups with paramilitary forces15 some analysts also claim that the accusations have persisted despite the lack of evidence because of spicions about some of uribes friends and associates16 in addition paramilitary groups were viewed as supporting his candidacy challenges facing uribe and congressional concerns uribes election comes at time of ever intensifying conflict in colombia farc is increasingly carrying the conflict into bo gotá and other urban areas with sabotage of infrastructure and bombings it holds hosta ge many colombian government officials including the current governor of antioquia and six national legisl ators and since the elections it has threatened the lives of mayors in towns which voted for uribe for us policymakers uribes election and inauguration come in the midst of congressional debate over whether to provide us military assistance to colombia for purposes other than counternarcotics from the pe rspective of current us policy17 uribe faces three major challenges one is to curb drug production in colombia including making more efficient the plan colombia counternarcotics programs second is to stabilize and improve the economy third is to strengthen the state in order to curb the violence perpetuated by leftist guerrillas and the rightist paramilitaries reflecting the divergence of opinion between the united states and colombia as to the relative urgency of problems facing colombia counternarcotics was not topic addressed by uribes campaig n there is little on the public record on uribes planned counternarcotics policy his 100 point program calls for the elimination of drugs and the improvement of the plan colomb ia program some analysts state that uribe endorses the concept at the heart of us counternarcotics policy which is that one fundamental means to combat the guerrillas is to deprive them of the profits they earn from illegal drugs one news report indicated that he views commitment from the us to provide colombia with the technical and financial assistance it needs to fight drug trafficking as central to his plans for governing and wants th united states to resume sharing radar surveillance information with colombia for the interdiction of drugtrafficking

financial institutions 20 taxi drivers to join uribes new army of informers pais english edition may 30 2002some analysts also expect him to insist on placing more emphasis than in the past on providing social support to t hose involved in coca cultivation uribes campaign stress on fiscal conserva tism and his choices for his economics team suggest that his yettobedelineated economic policy will not be problematic to us policymakers19 some analysts question however uribes ability to fund all his goals in particular some wonder where he w ill get the money to provide for an expanded army and to increase social welfare programs despite news articles that uribe will succeed in forming working coalition in c ongress some wonder whether uribe will be able to secure the support nece ssary to pass economic reforms one problematic issue for us policymakers has been uribes alleged sympathies for the selfdefense paramilita ry forces although these allegations may in part be attributed to campaign rhetoric mary r obinson head of the united nations human rights commission has stated that uribe is tolerant toward paramiliatary groups20 us policy has regarded the rightist paramilitary forces as just as problematic for colombian security as the leftist guerrillas viewing their extensive human rights abuse and their selfacknowledged involvement in drug pr oduction as undermining the legitimacy of the state the fy 2000 supplemental plan colo mbia legislation pl 106246 and the fy2002 andean regional in itiative pl 107115 legislation have placed conditions on us assistance to colomb ia designed to encourage the arrest and prosecution of members of th paramilitary groups and to cut ties between them and members of the colombian security forces thus far uribe has indicated that he in tends to treat the rightist paramilitary groups on par with the leftist guerr illas although in doing so he has departed to some extent from the pastrana policy in his victory speech on may 26 uribe stated that he would seek dialogue with those groups operating outside the law on the condition that they give up terrorism and agree to ceasefi re although the past rana administration engaged in negotiations with the two majo r leftist guerrilla groups breaking off negotiations with the farc in february 2002 and with the national liberation army eln in may 2002 pastrana has not been w illing to enter into negotiations with the paramilitaries uribe has also indicated his intention to request that the united nations play role in new conf lict reduction and resolution measures in colombia another topic many us analysts find troubling is uribes millionman militia proposal some analysts object that it draws civilians into the conflict putting them in harms way some express concern that ur ibe has yet to demonstrate that he understands the serious problems raised by the convivir experience particularly the lack of state control or that he has deve loped ideas for mechanisms to prevent their reoccurrence
