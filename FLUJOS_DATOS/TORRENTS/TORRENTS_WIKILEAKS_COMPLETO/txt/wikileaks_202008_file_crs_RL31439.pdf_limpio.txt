the context of school choice summary some believe that compre hensive reform of elementary and secondary k12 schools and districts is needed to improve the quality of education provided to the nations children proponents of reform have called for among other things policies to encourage parents to select the pub lic or private schools they deem most appropriate for their children with fe deral assistance provided through school vouchers or education tax subs idies for some the author ization of tax benefits for k12 education expenses beyond those alread included in the fede ral tax code eg coverdell education savi ngs accounts and the deduction for contributions to charitable organizations including schools and scholarshipgranting organizations would be way of expanding school choi ce while minimizing some of the concerns that have inhibited the expansion of vouche rs eg churchstate entanglement and regulation of private schools some proponents have furt her argued that new k12 education tax benefit would be more effective than previously tried school reforms at providing students with better educa tional opportunities and at reducing existing inequities some opponents of expande d k12 education ta x benefits and of unregulated school choice have argued that if enacted such policies might undermine the current state of public education and might exacerbate existing inequities in the quality of education available to children of different segments of society legislation was introduced in recent congresses to provide nonrefundable and refundable credits for families k12 education expenses the latter approach would allow eligible families with schoolage children to receive tax benefit even if its value exceeded their income tax liability the difference being provided to the family via tax refund bills also have been introduced to offer nonrefundable credits to those who make contributions to school tuition organizations stos which in turn use the funds to award k12 education scholarships tax credit available to families incurring k12 education expenses or credit dedicated to funding stos potentially w ould provide families with an incentive to send their children to private schools including those who might have done so anyway in order to target the tax benefit to families who might otherwise not have been able to exercise school choice some bills have included an income ceiling for claimants or restricted the credit to fa milies with children assigned to failing public schools while such bills likely woul d encourage school choice because tuition would be among the many qua lified education expenses th ey also could make k12 education in general more affordable for families by broadly defining qualified expenses to include such things as computer hardware and software academic tutoring and educational supplies this report will be updated as warrantedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31439contents background on k12 education reform

disparities evident across regions and locales and between st udents of different backgrounds in the resources provided for k12 education nd the resultant outcomes some have questioned whether the current system of publicly funded k12 education is optimal and have called for range of reforms including policies that seek to equalize available resources across schools and loca l educational agencies leas policies that provide additional funding for the edu cation of more costly to educate students and marketoriented policies that would courage parents to select the school they deem most appropriate for their children with funding to fully or partially offset the costs of tuition and fees provided throug h vouchers or reimbursed through the tax system in the past decade congress

elementary and secondary education reform efforts have been pr oposed with many of them having been implemented either nationwide or within selected states efforts at reform have included courtordere d school desegregation plans federally funded education programs aimed at serving disadvantaged children in distressed communities the restructuring of state educa tion finance systems and va rious forms of school choice recently policymakers have focused their attention on number of school choice proposals as one means of eff ecting k12 education reform2 while many school choice re form proposals have garnered broadbased support and several have been enacted and impleme nted by various states or the federal government others have lang uished amid controversy public school choice reforms that have been implemented successfully in majority of the states include open enrollment policies either intr adistrict or interd istrict magnet sc hools and charter schools only few states have adopted policies supportive of private or comprehensive school choice such as tuition vouchers and tax subsidies3 the federal government currently assists families who opt to send their children to private schools through fa vorable tax treatment of scholarships among other provisions in the internal revenue code irc which are discussed later in this report the federal government also

parents the opportunity to select public or private entity to provide publicly funded educational services to their children among the issues that make choicebase d education reforms controversial are the locus of control over education policy d ecisions and the separation of church and state many people are suspicious of school choice proposals that would limit leas or state educational agenci seas autonomy over ducation governance issues such as the establishment of curriculum requirements and criteria for enrollment including the boundaries of attendance areas the authorizing or chartering of schools and the control of locally generated revenue others are concerned about the possibility of states and localities either being permitted or required to allow the use of public funds to pay for the cost of st udents attendance at private or religiously affiliated school still others are cerned about the potential for increased government oversight of pr ivate schools and home schools while churchstate entanglement issues are complex and have comprised much of the debate over public f unding of private school choi ce the supreme court added degree of clarity to this debate in its ruling on zelman v simmonsharris in zelman the court ruled that the constituti on allows publicly funded school vouchers to be used to support the attendance of children at religiously affiliated schools in instances where parents have the opportunity to select from options that also include public and private secular schools7 the ruling permits rather than requires public funding of religiously aff iliated schools such as thr ough vouchers despite the courts ruling all but three state constitutions contain either blaine amendments andor compelled support clauses that generally prohibit the provision of public funds to religiously affiliate d institutions such as schools8 debate thus remains over the desirability and feasibility of expanding private school choice programs including those th at might involve re ligiously affiliated schools supporters of public funding fo r religious schools continue to offer arguments that mirror those espoused by proponents of providing public funding to private schools in general these include the prospect of such schools being morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31439crs5 9 for example recently released data from the national assessment of education progress naep show that 4th 8th and 12th grade students in private schools had higher average scores in reading mathematics science and writing than their counterparts in

schools has been upheld under the us constitution some opponent s still object to allowing public funds to be directed to religiously affiliated schools and are loathe to support such policies others who support religi ously affiliated schools often object to the prospect of government funding out of concern that too many strings might be attached for instance the government might attempt to regulate such things as hiring practices criteria for enrollment and curriculum requirements some believe that the authorization of additional tax subsidies for k12 education expenses would avoid some

lowincome children to attend priv ate k12 schools in 2001 typically the scholarships go to elementary and s econdary school stude nts in families with incomes below specified levels who live in certain geographic areas the programs generally provide partial tuition assistance families typically are selected either through lotteries or on firs tcome firstserved basis10 the childrens scholarship fund csf is the largest source of pr ivate school scholarships offered on nationwide basis to lowincome families11 proponents of school choice sometimes use the terms scholarships and vouchers interchangeably as they both are intended to help families pay for their childrens education costs others sometimes make distinction between the two based on the funding source with vouchers being associ ated with public funding and scholarships being associated with private funding tuition reduction educational institutions may reduce the tuition of dependent children of current employees or of former employees who retired or left due to disability and the benefit is not taxable to the child or employee12 the tuition reduction can occur at school other than where the employee works but the subsidy must be remitted by that school rather than the employees school eg school provides reduced tuition to the nine year old of secretary employed at school b information on the

lower income individuals could contribute the maximum amount to accounts of children in families whose incomes fall within the phaseout range childrens assets per haps obtained through gifts could be deposited in of which they are the beneficiaries for example earnings on contributions generally grow on taxdeferred basis the deferral confers greater benefits on more affluent families because of their higher marginal tax rates if for example two families pay 2000 annually into an investment for 15 years that earns 6 per annum the balance would have increased to 46552 if earnings accumulated taxfree by about the time their children begin secondary school17 if the families instead had to pay federal income tax on the earnings each year the family in the 28 federal ta x bracket would have amassed 41013 while the family in the 15 tax bracket woul d have ama ssed 43 483 thus the tax deferral in this example is worth noticeably more in additional earnings to the family in the higher tax bracket than it is to the family in the lower tax bracket if states follow the federal law the tax deferral benefit is even greater when funds are disbursed from the acc ounts those applied toward qualified expenses are not subject to federal inco tax earnings withdrawn for other purposes count as taxable income to the beneficiary with so exceptions see tax consequences of transferring funds

beneficiary or certain of their family members is not taxable20 rollovers are useful for number of other reasons by making samebeneficiary rollover the type of investment can be changed in additi on amounts transferred between accounts are excluded from the annual contribution limit the transfer of account funds to younger family member extends the period during which deposits can be made and taxdeferred earnings can accumulate thus while the original beneficiarys account balance might be too low to offs et much private school tuition room and board etc the transferred funds could immediately bolst er the account balance and thereby be of greater use to other family members eg the original beneficiarys younger sibling balances remaining in when beneficiaries reach age 30 or die whichever is earlier generally must be distributed nd the earnings included in the beneficiarys or the estates income21 if however account balances of beneficiaries under age 30 are rolled into accounts of other family members or if account balances are transferred to other family members upon the original bene ficiaries death there are tax consequences rather than transferring funds between as of the same beneficiary or to other family members the beneficiary of an may be changed the particular trust or custodial account must permit this action to be taken as in the case of rollovers the new beneficiary must be member of the original beneficiarys family interaction with qualified tuition plans qtps starting after december 31 2001 contributions can be made to an and to qtp on behalf of the same beneficiary qtp allows c ontributions to grow taxdeferred and funds to be withdrawn taxfree if used to pay qualified higher education expenses22 thus funds may now accumulate simultaneously in an and qtp with family perhaps using the former for k12 expens and the latter for higher education expenses if funds from an are used to pay k12 expenses and the beneficiaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31439crs10 23 with taxfree treatment the investment w ould have grown by 1951 if family with 15 marginal tax rate instead had to pay tax annually on the investment the gain would have totaled 1638 for family with 28 tax rate 1373 the calculation assumes that the entire 2000 contribution is deposited into th at the end of each year starting in the year the child is born through the year the child reaches age 5goes to college any balance remaining in the account could be used toward the beneficiarys higher education expenses or transferred to the beneficiarys qtp some have suggested that rather than drawing upon collegebound students to pay k12 expenses the account shoul d be allowed to continue to grow about the time child starts elementary school for example 2000 contribution made each year for six years to an that earned 6 per year would have grown to just 13951 with the great majority of the balance accounted for by contributions the preferential tax treatment accorded would produce only 313 in additional interest for family in the 15 tax brack et and only 578 in additional interest for family in the 25 tax bracket23 thus the expansion of the tax deferral to saving for k12 expenses generally and elementary school expenses pa rticularly appears to be of limited immediate value to families observations because the preferential tax treatment of is worth more to higher income families they may be more likely to establish them than lower income families higher income families also may be more likely to set up because they have greater propensity to save than do lower income families the 220000 income ceiling on contributions by joint tax filers suggests that very affluent families would not be subsidized however as previously noted others may contribute the full 2000 annually to the as of dependent children in families whose income is in the phaseout range in contrast the tax provi sion is of benefit to families with such low incomes that they are unable to save or b do not pay tax on savings because their incomes are completely offset by the standard deduction and personaldependent exemptions it thus appears that expansion of to k12 school expenses will be of more assistance to higher than to lower income families although the taxdeferred savings acc ounts will enable families to accumulate more money for k12 education expenses than they otherwise would have the amount of the tax benefit is probably too small to aff ect familys decision about whether to send their children to public or private school the influence of the on familys choice of school will be even less significant if the account is drawn upon for elementary school expenses and if less than the maximum is contributed each year in terms of school choice the n the main outcome of extending the to pay for k12 education expenses may be to slightly subsidize higher income families who might have nt their children to

lowers income tax liability depends on taxpayers marginal tax rate as in the case of nonrefundable credit taxpayers without income tax liabilities could not claim deduction either aboveth eline or itemized among those taxpayers with liabilities generally the higher the individua ls marginal tax rate ie the higher their agi the larger the tax savings conferred by deduction 32 an abovetheline k12 education deduction also could eliminate or reduce tax liability against which to apply existing nonrefundable creditsanalysis of proposals for tax subsidies to expand school choice those who would use the federal tax c ode to give more families the opportunity to exercise school choice face several interre lated issues first they might want to design the tax benefit to enable families who would not otherwise have done so to send their children to public school alternatives as pr eviously noted concern about the education savings approach embodi ed in the coverdell is that families with limited resources have to use much of their current earnings for consumption rather than putting aside money for their childrens future education second the value of the subsidy would need to be large enough to make private schools truly affordable for families on tight budgets but not so large that the provisions cost to taxpayers is prohibitive and third the question arises as to whether creating new tax benefit to encourage school choice ac tivates the same concerns that have hampered other initiatives to author ize federally f unded voucher program equity windfalls and the affordability of private schools equity refundable tax credit would ta ke the incidence of income tax liability out of the equation in determining which families may claim the benefit all families with qualified k12 ex penses would be entitled to claim the full amount of the credit regardless of how much or how little income tax they owe the government the government would forgo revenue from families whose tax liabilities equal or exceed qualified k12 school expenses it would draw upon the us treasury to pay families the amount by which their eligible education expenses exceeds their income tax liabilities the refundab ility feature thus provides lowincome families the same opportunity as other families to make use of k12 education credit nonref undable credit mig ht not be of much help to lowincome families because one must have an income tax liability against which to apply eligible expenses as nonrefundable credit could able all taxpayers regardless of their marginal tax rates to ge t the same tax savings from the same amount of qualified expenses it might be considered more equitable than deduction31 the overall limitation on nonrefundable credits in the tax code could reduce the usefulness of nonrefundable k12 education credit for those families with small ta x bills and large competing credits however if the tota l of such nonrefundable credits eg the hope scholarship and lifetime learning credits meets or exceeds familys income tax liability the family would be unable to make use of k12 education credit32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31439crs15 33 according to federal regulation an organization is not operated solely for charitable purposes if it benefits private interests such as designated persons or the organizations founder andor family members this is referred

targeting tax benefits to certain families depending upon its design k12 education tax benefit could be made available to all families that incur qualified expenses or primarily to those families who would otherwise have had difficulty enrolling their children in the schools of their choice some of the proposals for tax benefits would limit windf alls ie subsidizing individuals for actions they would have undertaken anyway by limiting eligibility to individuals with incomes below specified amount to individuals with children otherwise eligible for particular meanstested government programs or to individuals with children currently or recently enrolled in certaintypes of public schools to target the tax benef it on families that would enc ounter financial difficulties if they were to send their children to private schools some proposals would limit eligibility to claim the benefit or to recei ve scholarships funded by the benefit to families with incomes below threshold am ount or whose children receive or are eligible to receive free or reducedprice sc hool meals the income limits for eligibility to receive free or reducedprice meals generally are lower than the income limits contained in many ta x credit proposals that directly include an income criterion one proposal for example would have focused eligibility on families whose children in the previous year attended t itle ia school that has been identified for improvement under esea title ia and w ho would be assigned to the same or another school so identified for the current academic year the credit thus would have been available only to those families whose children were assigned to schools not meeting specific educa tional accountability requireme nts some view this targeting mechanism as proxy for income based on the assumption that few higher income families will be eligible for the credit because they may be less likely than poorer families to have childre n in title ia schools especially those that fail to meet esea title ia accountability requi rements others suggest that as implementation of the ea title ia accountability requirements proceeds increasing numbers of title ia schools w ill be identified for improvement and such tax credit proposal could have somewh at broader focus than relatively low income familieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31439crs16 34 according to csf the typi cal

scholarship of 1246 were to be viewed as indicative of the value of scholarships that initially might be funded through credit for charitable contributions to stos then such scholarship might fall short of typical private school tuition34 however the value of scholarships awarded by stos cannot be estimated from the amount contributed because stos presumably would have the flexibility to balance the value of scholarships against the number granted among private schools ca tholic schools often have comparatively lower ition levels data for the 2004 2005 school year show that the

short of familys total annual cost however subsidizing portion of k12 education expenses could be sufficient for families on the margin of affording private school edu cation to decide to transfer their children from public to private schools or to retain their children in private schools also some believe that having families pay portion of priv ate school costs might have the advantageous

families select catholic and othe r religiously affilia ted sc hools ge nerally charge lower tuition than other private sc hools religiously ffiliated schools often are able to do so because many of thei r operating and facilities costs are subsidized by charitable contributions and because some staff may work for comparatively lower wages out of devotion to serve the faith or may have portion of their salaries paid by the church rather than by the sc hool for example the national catholic educational association n cea reports that averag catholic school tuition represented only 61 of act ual perpupil costs of 3998 at elementary schools in school year 20042005 whereas average freshmen secondary school tuition represented 82 of perpupil costs of 720038 other private schools also subsidize tuition with funds provided from endowments although ty pically to lesser extent than catholic schools for example in 20042005 median tuition at independent day schools represented 92 of total expenses39 nonetheless the typically lower tuition of religiously affilia ted schools might make them more attractive to families compared with either nonsectarian privat schools or outofbou ndary public schools which also usually charge comparatively high tuition while some of the proposals for k12 education tax credits have called for reimbursing families for thei r educational expenses on dollarfordollar basis up to specified limit others call for offsetting share of expenses incurred under some proposals for example family would n eed to have incurred 5000 in expenses to claim the maximum benefit of 2500 per child given th requirement that families absorb large share of education costs pr oposals of this design likely would benefit families with higher incomes who have greater

credit could ve receipt and outlay effects of 33 billion over the same period40 joint committee on taxation jct estimated that the presidents proposal would cost 372 million through fy2008 in the form

proportion of families with eligible students that will claim the credit about 95 cents of every dollar the treasury department estimated the credit would cost the government is expected to be in refunds to families with little or income tax liability which reflects the expectation that substantial share of lowincome families will be fina ncially able to pay up to 5000 in qualified expenses in order to later get back up to 2500 the jct appear s less persuaded that very many families with children in failing schools possess the financial resources that would enable them to incur educational expenses for which they would only be partially reimbursed sometime later the other proposals would condition elig ibility for k12 education credit on the school that child initially attended that is to say families with children in public and private schools including in some cases homeschools also would have been eligible for tax benefit if they purchased computers or employed the services of academic tutors among other things the sheer number of ligible families could result in much larger tax expenditu re on the part of the government the bills that would not have conditione d eligibility for k12 education credit on the type of k12 school attended c ould nonetheless encourage school choice because their definitions of qualified expens include tuition the bills very broad definitions also could have made k12 education more affordable for families with children between about 5 and 18 years old in addition they could promote greater educational equity among those familie s whose children are enrolled in public schools for example as result of th tax benefit more lowincome families of public school students might be able to afford computer for their children to use at home however the availability of tax benefit with many types of qualified expenses beyond tuition might prompt some higher income families to buy faster computer with more memory larger monitor and better speakers than their children actually need for educational purposes this unintended behavior and the heightened cost to government that would accompany it could be greater in the case of credit or deduction than in the case of the coverdell where people are largely spending the money they c ontributed to the savings vehicle new k12 education tax benefit could well impose costs that extend beyond the federal budget it might place an adde d burden on the irs including the drafting of new or amended tax forms and the issu ance of regulations the design in some bills could be more onerous than others if administered properly for example the administrations proposal would limit use of the credit to students in failing schools presumably the irs would have to verify th at schools fit the definition to ensure that only legitimate claims were paid similarly some proposals would target students eligible for free and reducedprice school meals for scholarships here the educational investme

leas provide families with documentation of their childrens eligibility for submission to stos and inclusion with their tax forms not all leas currently provide documentation k12 education tax benefit

benefit for k12 school expenses is viewed by its proponents as way to avoid some of the controve rsies associated with vouche rs including federal funding and regulation of private sectarian and nonsectarian schools whether tax credit has these advantages over voucher coul d depend upon whether it is refundable or nonrefundable from an economic persp ective both refundable credit and voucher redistribute public funds ither through tax expenditures or appropriations to lowincome families thus some might assert that the federal government could use the issuance of re fund checks drawn on revenue collected from all taxpayers as justification for expanding its oversight of elementary and secondary education to private schools the govern ment might for example take steps to ensure that lowincome and minority children are afforded adequate access to private schools it also might impose on priv ate schools accountability requirements similar to those recently required of all public schools under the esea and of private school students served under title ia proponents of nonrefundable k12 education tax credit argue that it should be regarded as taxpayers retaining their own money because claim is made on someone elses wallet it allegedly would not provide the government an opportunity for further regulation of elemen tary and secondary education43 similar logic often is applied to nonrefundable credits and churchstate sepa ration because nonrefundable credit allows taxpayers to keep some of their own income the money does not enter the public coffer and thus does not reflect government support of religion44 others do not support this in terpretation of tax expenditures the impact on public and private k12 education some contend that authorization of k12 education

cover the full cost of tuiti on and expenses might keep private schools beyond the reach of lower income students marketoriented competition it is argued that providing families with tax benefit that allows them to enroll thei r children in the school of their choice will stimulate competition among public nd private schools that will lead to improvement in overall quality45 for example schools that prove attractive to parents because they offer higher qua lity education per dollar of spending would be expected to draw students away from less productive schools as result either lower achieving schools would close their doors replaced by the more efficient schools or they would succeed by increasin g their productivity and maintaining their student bodies either way the reasoni ng goes school choice could improve the quality of k12 education fo r all students whether enro lled in public or private schools46 to degree competition and choice already exist in the k12 education marketplace some metropolitan areas are rved by multiple school districts and private schools exist along side regular pub lic schools wealth ier families and those who place premium on education thus can determine which are the best schools for their children and send them there either by residing in the attendance area of the selected public school or by paying tuition to enroll their children in private school those with fewer financial resources are less likely to be able to locate in district with highquality public schools or to send their children to alternatives to regular public schools some proponent s of marketbased reforms believe that providing new tax benefit for educational expenses will create more level playing field among families others dispute the idea that market competition would lead to more equitable k12 education markets47 some assert that tax credit or deduction that is not well targeted for instance on lowincome fa milies could induce additional middle and upper income families to enroll their children in private schools this in turn could shut out lower income students access to the available spaces especially if the tax benefit does not cove r

of new tax benefit thus believe it would exacerbate rather than ameliorate inequities in the quality of education available to childre n of different segments of society others suggest that education markets operatin g under voucher program could lead to decreased residential segregation and u ltimately to increased equity48 not only do students compete for schools but schools also compete for students at present nonpublic schools may selectivel admit students giving preference for example to those who score well on admissions exams whose siblings currently are enrolled in the schools or who are member s of particular re ligious denomination many private schools do not offer costly prog rams that serve special needs students nor are they required to private school s also can dismiss students for unruly behavior more easily than can public schools different types of schools vary in their admissions policies memb er schools of the nais for example currently accept approximately 53 of all applicants49 conversely nearly all catholic schools are open admissions though many are overs ubscribed small number of public schools admit students on competitive basis the increased competition that new ta x benefit could foster might according to some observers lead to sorting among schools based on the characteristics of the students they serve if it were more efficient for schools to tailor their academic programs to fairly homogeneous student body eg with like ab ilities or interests they might limit the programs offered w ith different schools targeting different students for example some schools mig ht offer internati onal baccalaureate and advanced placement programs while others might focus on basic skills or vocational programs priv ate schools might opt to ad mit the easiest to educate students ie skim and defe r to public schools the obligation to serve those who are more costly or difficult to educate g disadvantaged students students with disabilities and students with behavioral problems others suggest however that private schools would accept dive rse student bodies out of service to the community some of these potential market effects likely would vary according to the characteristics of the new k12 education tax benefit for example if credit or deduction were large enough to cover nearly all the costs of attending private

impact of competition could be further mollified by limiting eligible schools to those that do not disc riminate among students in admissions and by requiring that students be admitted on the basis of lottery when schools are oversubscribed while the imposition of additional statutory limitations on the eligibility of families might buffer some of the potential negative consequences of market competition it also might impede some of its anticipated benefits50 supply and demand effects as noted earlier new k12 education tax benefit would allow families to apply portion of their income toward educational expenses that they otherwise would have applied toward taxes consequently the demand for private school ducation could increase in the shortrun and produce an increase in the supply of private school ducation in the long run priv ate schools could accommodate the immediate demand shoc k fairly easily in areas with excess capacity as happened with th voucher programs in clev eland and milwaukee in those areas in which the initial spike in demand surpasses the currently available supply families potentially could face waiting lists sustained demand for private school educa tion eventually could be expected to lead to the opening of more private schools51 tuition in new private schools might be somewhat higher than currently charged because as previously noted many private schools use charitable contribu tions and endowments to set tuition substantially below the cost of the educa tion they provide if more private schools opened however they could dilute these funds and consequen tly raise tuition to some degree
