6106c09 shspec11 reading emeter reactions auditing latent reads is auditing the analytical mind it is the reactive mind that we are interested in auditing the reactive mind is mind that acts without inspection on the basis of stimulus it puts into action solutions to problems it fancies must exist which may never have existed or which havent existed for billions of years put in any part of the problem and the reactive mind goes into forming the solution thetan is trying to survive who has necessity for trying to survive at all which is the first idiocy so the mind is trying to solve nonexistent problem then it addresses itself to the survival of form the perpetuation of an existing state which would take out all the mest in sensible state and garbleize it the reactive mind is the individuals accumulated goals for the survival of forms the reason it destroys is to get something to survive it creates to get form to survive the reactive mind is the part of the cycle of action that will never move because its keynote is survival of form so it is trying to make something survive that is already dead old bodies identities etc you could remember it if you werent trying so hard to make it survive but because of the survival effort when you try to remember it you get restimulation as if you were still in the period because all the impulse to survive has been trapped and rides up to pt all of these forms have nothing to do with pt but here they are so the reactive mind has starvation for the other parts of his old games eg the opponents and it acts without inspection and very fast to get form to survive you cant take time for inspection this leads to such idiocies as people attacking their own planes or ships in war when theyd gotten used to attacking enemy ones the safe thing to do is not to inspect under battle conditions the jam of the time not taking time to inspect results in noinspection when you speed up things in the physical universe to too great degree on the false basis that you are prone to nonsurvival but in the interest of keeping something surviving youll run into the timeless reactivity of action without inspection so therefore what you are after is instant reads your auditing target is the reactive mind not the pc the only thing wrong with the pc is the reactive mind and there is inspection involved there so he cant see what is wrong with him if he could see it it wouldnt be wrong this is also why the reactive mind is more in control of the auditor than the pc the noinspection factor he cant think on the reactive subjects you can so if you take his instructions on what to do or handle youll always do the wrong things one of the pcs goals is to make his reactive mind survive so he wont let you near any part that should be audited it dictates to you that it must survive it throws you red herrings when you turn around and look when youre running from battle that youre losing you normally get speared therefore its very very bad to look at the things that are pursuing you so you mustnt so you had better prevent the auditor from looking at the things that are pursuing you there is another obscuring element withholdingness is the comm bridge between the pc and the reactive mind when withhold comes out of the reactive mind the pc will do what the reactive mind tells him to do which is to withhold it withholdingness is part and parcel of survival it is protection of forms from attacks and destruction its nonduplication too you withhold your form from duplicating the form of someone youve killed this sets the mechanics going for survival its actually prior to the actual idea of survival so the pc gets into withholding thought the withholding of form is superbasic to all sorts of other things eg individuating the pc also withholds his body from destruction when the pc gives up withhold hes conquered dictate of the reactive mind by being controlled by being the auditor rather than by his bank this is the mechanics by which he feels better when he gets the withholds off because withholds add up to keeping him separated from the human race he can always be counted upon to dramatize the withhold when it comes up on the meter theres first tick then fall as the pc spots it the secondary action is not to get the withhold off the pc but to keep the pc from dramatizing his reactive bank so we say what was that when withholding the pc is reactive he is dramatizing otherwise hes talking to you analytically or at the dictates of the reactive mind early in the case auditing the pc is like auditing the light bulb to fix the generators in the power plant the emeter helps you locate all the parts in the generator if the pc is left with withhold in session hell arc break half an hour later what youre trying to do is to keep the pc from being fooled about himself if you avoid the reactive mind youre just doing q and with the pc
