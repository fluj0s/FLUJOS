governing wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping it also appends citations to state law in the area and contains bibliography of legal commentary as well as the text of the electronic communications privacy act ecpa and the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa it is federal crime to wiretap or to use machine to capture the communications of others without court approval unless one of the parties has given their prior consent it is likewise federal crime to use or disclose any information acquired by illegal wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping violations can result in imprisonment for not more than five years fines up to 250000 up to 500000 for organizations in civil liability for damages attorneys fees and possibly punitive damages in disciplinary action against any attorneys involved and in suppression of any derivative evidence congress has created separate but comparable protective schemes for electronic communications eg email and against the surreptitious use of telephone call monitoring practices such as pen registers and trap and trace devices each of these protective schemes comes with procedural mechanism to afford limited law enforcement access to private communications and communications records under conditions consistent with the dictates of the fourth amendment the government has been given even more narrowly confined authority to engage in electronic surveillance conduct physical searches install and use pen registers and trap and trace devices for law enforcement purposes under the electronic communications privacy act and for purposes

electronic means of capturing ongoing communications other than wiretapping tapping into telephone conversations in previous ve rsions of this report and other earlier writin gs it was common to use more neutral and consequently preferred term electronic surveillance at least when referring to law enforcement use unfortunately continued use of the term electronic surveillance rather than electronic eavesdropping risks confusion with forms of surveillance that either have individualistic definitions eg electronic surveillance under the foreign intelligence surveillance act 50 usc 1801f that involve surv eillance that does not capture conversation eg thermal imaging or electronic tracking devices or that may or may not capture conversation eg video surveillance which when it does capture conversation is covered by the law governing electronic eavesdropping see united states v williams 124 f3d 411 3d cir 1997 related developments are discussed in crs report rl30465 the foreign

too few decisions upon it to enable an author to define it with confidence it never occupied much space in the law and it has nearly faded from the legal horizon 1 b ishop commentaries on the criminal

g344g561the invention of the telegraph and telephone however state laws outlawing wiretapping or indiscretion by telephone and telegraph operators preserved the spirit of the common law prohibition in this country congress enacted the first federal wiretap statute as temporary measure to prevent disclosure of government secrets during world war i3 later it proscribed intercepting and divulging private radio messages in the radio act of 19274 but did not immediately reestablish federal wiretap prohibition by the time of the landmark supreme court decision in olmstead however at least fortyone of the fortyeight states had banned wiretapping or forbidden telephone and telegraph employees and officers from disclosing the content of telephone or telegraph messages or both5 olmstead was seattle bootlegger whose prohibition act conviction was the product of federal wiretap he challenged his conviction on three grounds arguing unsuccessfully that the wiretap evidence should have been suppressed as violat ion of either his fourth amendment rights his fifth amendment privilege against selfincrimination or the rights implicit in the washington state statute that outlawed wiretapping for majority of the court writing through chief justice taft olmsteads fourth amendment challenge was doomed by the absence of an official search and seizure of his person or such seizure of his papers or his tangible material effects or an actual physical invasion of his house or curtilage 6 for the purposes of making seizure 277 us at 4667 chief justice taft pointed out that congress was free to provide protection which the constitution did not8 congress did so in the 1934 communications act by expanding the radio acts 3 40 stat101718 1918whoever during the period of governmental operation of the telephone and telegraph systems of the united states shall without authority and without the knowledge and consent of the other users thereof except as may be necessary for operation of the service tap any telegraph or telephone line or whoever being employed in any such telephone or telegraph service shall divulge the contents of any such telephone or telegraph message to any person not duly authorized or entitled the receive the same shall be fined not exceeding 1000 or imprisoned for not more than one year or both 56 congrec 10761765 1918 4 44 stat 1172 1927 person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any message and divulge or publish the contents substance purpose effect or meaning of such intercepted message to any person 5 olmstead v united states 277 us 438 47980 n13 1928brandeis j dissenting olmstead is remembered most today for the dissents of holmes and brandeis but for four decades it stood for the view that the fourth amendments search and seizure commands did not apply to government wiretapping accomplished without trespass onto private property 6 curtilage originally meant the land and buildings enclosed by the walls of castle in later usage it referred to the barns stables garden plots and the like immediately proxim ate to dwelling it is understood in fourth amendment parlance to describe that area which harbors those intimate activities associated with domestic life and the privacies of the home united states v dunn 480 us 294 301 n4 1987 7 olmstead had not been compelled to use his phone and so the court rejected his fifth amendment challenge 277 usc at 462 any violation of the washington state wiretap statute was thought insufficient to warrant the exclusion of evidence 277 us at 46668 justice holmes in his dissent tersely characterized the conduct of federal wiretappers as dirty business 277 us at 470 the dissent of justice brandeis observed that the drafters of the constitution conferred as against the government the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men to protect that right every unjus tifiable intrusion by the government against privacy of the individual whatever the means employed must be deemed in violation of the fourth amendment 277 us at 47879 8 congress may of course protect the secrecy of telephone messages by making them when intercepted inadmissible in evidence in federal criminal trials by direct legislation 277 us at 465 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98326g18g155g146g159g138g140g162g561 g561

as to include intercepting and divulging radio or wire communications9 the federal communications act outlawed wiretapping but it said nothing about the use of machines to surreptitiously record and transmit face to face conversations10 in the absence of statutory ban the number of surreptitious recording cases decided on fourth amendment grounds surged and the results began to erode olmstead s underpinnings11 erosion however came slowly initially the court applied olmstead s principles to the electronic eavesdropping cases thus the use of dictaphone to secretly overhear private conversation in an adjacent office offended fourth amendment precipes because physical trespass into the office in which the conversation took place had occurred goldman v united states 316 us 129 1942 similarly the absence of physical trespass precluded fourth amendment coverage of the situation where federal agent secretly recorded his conversation with defendant held in commercial laundry in an area open to the public on lee v united states 343 us 747 1952 on the other hand the fourth amendment did reach the governments physical intrusion upon private property during an investigation as for example when they drove spike mike into the common wall of row house until it made contact with heating duct for the home in which the conversation occurred silverman v united states 365 us 505 1961 silverman presented something of technical problem because there was some question whether the spike mike had actually crossed the property line of the defendants town house when it made contact with the heating duct the court declined to rest its decision on the technicalities of local property law and instead found that the governments conduct had intruded upon privacy of home and hearth in manner condemned by the fourth amendment 365 us at 51012 12 9 48 usc 11034 1934 47 usc 605 1940 ed the act neither expressly condemned law enforcement interceptions nor called for the exclusion of wiretap evidence but it was read to encompass both nardone v united states 302 us 379 1937 nardone v united states 308 us 321 1939 10 section 605 did ban the interception and divulgence of radio broadcasts but it did not reach the radio transmission of conversations that were broadcast unbeknownst to all of th parties to the conversation late in the game the fcc supplied partial solution when it banned the use of licensed radio equipment to overhear or record private conversation without the consent of all the parties involved in the conversation 31 fedreg 3400 march 4 1966 amending then 47 cfr 2701 1511 the fcc excluded operations of any law enforcement offices conducted under lawful authority id 11 the volume of all fourth amendment cases calling for supreme court review increased dramatically after mapp v ohio 367 us 643 1961 acknowledged the application of the fourth amendment exclusionary rule to the states 12 the absence of physical invasion of the petitioners premises was also vital factor in the courts decision in olmstead v united states in holding that the wiretapping there did not violate the fourth amendment the court noted that the insertions were made without trespass upon any property of the defendants they were made in the basement of the large office building the taps from house lines were made in the streets near the houses 277 us at 457 there was entry of the houses or offices of the defendants 277 us at 464 relying upon these circumstances the court reasoned that the intervening wires are not part of the defendants house or office any more than are the highways along which they are stretched 277 us at 465 here by contrast the officers overheard the petitioners c onversations only by usurping part of the petitioners house or office heating system which was an integral part of the premises occupied by th petitioners usurpation that was effected without their knowledge and without their consent in these circumstances we need not pause to consider whether or not there was technical trespass under the local property law relating to party walls inherent fourth amendment rights are not inevitably measurable in terms of ancient niceties of tort or real property law the fourth amendment and the personal rights which it secures have long history at the very core stands the right of man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion this court has never held that federal officer may without warrant and without consent physically entrench into mans office or continued

of these cases focused upon whether warrantless trespass onto private property had occurred that is whether the means of conducting search and seizure had been so unreasonable as to offend the fourth amendment yet in each case the object of the search and seizure had been not those tangible papers or effects for which the fourth amendments protection had been traditionally claimed but an intangible conversation this enlarged view of the fourth amendment could hardly be ignored for it follows from u u u silverman u u u that the fourth amendment may protect against the overhearing of verbal statements as well as against the more traditional seizure of papers and effects wong sun v united states 371 us 471 485 1963 soon thereafter the court repudiated the notion that the fourth amendments protection was contingent upon some trespass to real property katz v united states 389 us 347 1967 katz was bookie convicted on the basis of evidence gathered by an electronic listening and recording device set up outside the public telephone booth that katz used to take and place bets the court held that the gateway for fourth amendment purposes stood at that point where an individual should to able to expect that his or her privacy would not be subjected to unwarranted governmental intrusion 389 us at 353 13 one obvious consequence of fourth amendment coverage of wiretapping and other forms of electronic eavesdropping is the usual attachment of the amendments warrant requirement to avoid constitutional problems and at the same time preserve wiretapping and other forms of electronic eavesdropping as law enforcement tool some of the states established statutory system under which law enforcement officials could obtain warrant or equivalent court order authorizing wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping the court rejected the constitutional adequacy of one of the more detailed of these state statutory schemes in berger v new york 388 us 41 1967 the statute was found deficient its failure to require particularized description of the place to be searched particularized description of the crime to which the search and seizure related continued home there secretly observe or listen and relate at the mans subsequent criminal trial what was seen or heard distinction between the dictaphone employed in goldman and the spike mike utilized here seemed to the court of appeals too fine one to draw the court was unwilling to be lieve that the respective rights are to be measured in fractions of inches but decision here does not turn upon the technicality of trespass upon party wall as matter of local law it is based upon the reality of an actual intrusio n into constitutionally protected area what the court said long ago bears repeating now it may be that it is the ob noxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form but illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footin g in that way namely by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure boyd v united states 116 us 616 635 we find occasion to re examine goldman here but we decline to go beyond it by even fraction of an inch 365 us at 51012 internal quotation marks omitted 13 we conclude that the underpinnings of olmstead and goldman have been so eroded by our subsequent decisions that the trespass doctrine there enunciated can longer be regarded as controlling the governments activities in electronically listening to and recording the petitioners words violated the privacy upon which he justifiably relied while using the telephone booth and thus constituted search and seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment the fact that the electronic device employed to achieve that end did not happen to penetrate the wall of the booth can have constitutional significance later courts seem to prefer the expectation of privacy language found in justice harlans concurrence my understanding of the rule that has emerged from prior decisions is that there is twofold requirement first that person have exhibited an actual subjective expectation of privacy and second that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable 389 us at 361 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98326g18g155g146g159g138g140g162g561 g561

limitations to prevent general searches termination of the interception when the conversation sought had been seized prompt execution of the order return to the issuing court detailing the items

1968 87 stat 197 18 usc 2510 2520 1970 ed comprehensive wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping statute that not only outla wed both in general terms but that permitted federal and state law enforcement officers to use them under strict limitations designed to meet the objections in berger decade later another supreme court case pers uaded congress to supple ment title iii with judicially supervised procedure for the use of wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping in foreign intelligence gathering situations when congress passed title iii there was some question over the extent of the presidents inherent powers to au thorize wiretaps without judicial approval in national security cases as consequence the issue was simply removed from the title iii scheme 14 after the court held that the presidents inherent powers were insufficient to excuse warrantless electronic eavesdropping on purely domestic threats to national security united states v united states district court 407 us 297 1972 congress considered it prudent to augment the foreign intelligence gathering auth ority of the united states with the foreign intelligence security act of 1978 92 stat 1783 50 usc 18011862 the act provides procedure for judicial review and authorization or denial of wiretapping and other forms of electronic eavesdropping for purposes of foreign intelligence gathering in 1986 congress recast title iii in the electronic communications privacy act ecpa 100 stat 1848 18 usc 2510 2521 the act followed the general outline of title iii with adjustments and additions like title iii it sought to strike balance between the interests of privacy and law enforcement but it also reflected congressional desire to avoid unnecessarily crippling infant industries in the fields of advanced communications technology hrept 99647 at 189 1984 srept 99541 at 5 1986 ecpa also included new protection and law enforcement access provisions for stored wire and electronic communications and transactional records access email and phone records 18 usc 2701 2710 and for pen registers as well as trap and trace devices devices for recording the calls placed to or from particular telephone 18

deems necessary to protect the nation against actual or potential attack or other hostile acts of foreign power to obtain foreign intelligence information deemed essential to the security of the united states or to protect national security information against foreign intelligence activities 15 these provisions were also grounded in supreme court jurisprudence in united states v miller 425 us

g11g151g157g142g155g140g142g153g157g146g152g151g561 interception means the aural or other acquisition of the contents of various kinds of communications by means of electronic mechanical or other devices 22 the definition raises questions of where when what and how althoug h logic might suggest that interception occurs only in the place where the communication is captured the cases indicate that interception occurs as well where the communication begins is transmitted or is received 23 once limited to aural acquisitions ecpa enlarged the definition by adding the words or other acquisition so that it is longer limited to interceptions of communications that can be heard24 the change complicates the question of whether the wiretap stored communications or trap and trace portions of the ecpa govern the legality of various means of capturing information relating to communication the analysis might seem to favor wiretap coverage when it begins with an examination of whether an interception has occurred yet there is little consensus over when an interception occurs that is whether interception as used section 2511 contemplates only 20 subparagraph establishes blanket prohibition against the interception of wire communication since the facilities used to transmit wire communications form part of the interstate or foreign communications network congress has plenary power under the commerce clause to prohibit all interception of such communications whether by wiretapping or otherwise the broad prohibition of subparagraph is also applicable to the interception of oral communications the interception of such communications however does not necessar ily interfere with the interstate or foreign commerce network and the extent of the constitutional power of congre ss to prohibit such interception is less clear than in the case of interception of wire communications therefore in addition to the broad prohibitions of subparagraph the committee has included subparagraph b which relies on accepted jurisdictional bases under the commerce clause and other provisions of the constitution to prohibit the interception of oral communications srept

whether an extension phone has been installed and is being used in the ordinary course of business or in the ordinary course of law enforcement duties so that it longer constitutes an interception

on the facts in given case31 when the exemption is claimed as practice in the ordinary course of business the interception must be for legitimate business reason it must be routinely conducted and at least in some circuits employees must be notified that their conversations are being monitored32 similarly congress most likely carved out an exception for law enforcement officials to make clear that the routine and most universal recording of phone lines by police departments and prisons as well as other law enforcement institutions is exempt from the statute adams v battle creek 250 f3d at 984

violation of ecpa if the conversation or other form of communication intercepted is among those kinds which the statute protects in over simplified terms telephone wire face to face oral and computer electronic congress used the definitions of the three forms of communications to describe the communications beyond the acts reach as well as those within its grasp for example oral communication by definition includes only those face to face conversations with respect to which the speakers have justifiable expectation of privacy 36 similarly wire communications are limited to those that are at some point involve voice communications ie only aural transfers37 radio and data transmissions are generally electronic communications the definition includes other forms of information transfer but excludes certain radio tr ansmissions which can be innocently captured without great difficulty38 although it is not federal crime to intercept radio communications under any number of conditions the exclusion is not matter of definition but of special general exemptions 18 usc 25112g discussed below g7g151g141g142g138g159g152g155g146g151g144g561g157g152g561g11g151g157g142g155g140g142g153g157g561

history all their own the early bans on divulging telegraph or telephone messages had consent exception the supreme court upheld consent interceptions against fourth amendment challenge both before and after the enactment of title iii39 the argument in favor of consent interceptions has always been essentially that speaker risks the indiscretion of his listeners and holds superior legal position simply because listener elects to record or transmit his statements rather than subsequently memorializing or repeating them 40 wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping by either the police or anyone else with the consent of at least one party to the conversation is not unlawful under the federal statute41 these provisions do more than shield consent interceptions from the sanctions of federal law they afford protection from the sanctions of state law many of the states recognize comparable exceptions but some only permit interception with the consent of all parties to communication42 under federal law consent may be either explicitly or implicitly given for instance someone who uses telephone other than his or her own and has been told by the subscriber that conversations over the instrument are recorded has been held to have implicitly consented to interception when using the instrument43 this is not to say that subscriber consent alone is 39 on lee v united states 343 us 747

activities from civil liability185 179 section 1805ba2 simply called for determination that the acquisition does not constitute electronic surveillance but section 1805a had declared that nothing in

pl 110261 repeals the protect act186 yet like the protect act it establishes temporary set of three procedures to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information by targeting an individual or entity thought to be overseas187 one 50 usc 1881a applies to the targeting of an overseas person or entity that is not us person188 another 50 usc 1881b covers situations when the american target is overseas but the gathering involves electronic communications or stored electronic communications or data acquired in this country189 the third 50 usc 1881c applies to situations when the american target is overseas but section 1881b is not available either because acquisition occurs outside of the united states or because it involves something other than electronic surveillance or the acquisition of stored communications or data eg physical search190 in the case of targets who are not us persons section 1881aa declares upon the issuance of an order in accordance with subsection i3 or determination under subsection c2 the attorney general and the director of national intelligence may authorize jointly for period of up to 1 year from the effective date of the authorization the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states to acquire foreign intelligence information it makes mention of authorizing acquisition it merely speaks of targeting with an eye to acquisition moreover it gives indication of whether the anticipated methods of acquisition include the capture of targets communications of communications relating to target of communications of person or entity related to the target or information concerning one of the three the remainder of the section however seems to dispel some of the questions section 1881a is intended to empower the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information and the methods that may be used to the capture of communications and related information the procedure begins either with certification pr esented to the fisa court for approval or with determination by the two officials that exigent circumstances warrant timely authorization prior court approval 191 in the certification process they must assert in writing and under oath that significant purpose for the effort is the acquisition of foreign intelligence information the effort will involve the assistance of an electronic communication service provider continued immunity provisions see crs report rl34600 retroactive immunity

electronic surveillance and physical searches197 the targeting procedures must be calculated to avoid acquiring communications in which all of the parties are in the us and to confine targeting to persons located outside the us198 both are subject to review by the fisa court for sufficiency when it receives the request to approve the certification199 copies of the guidelines which also provide
