3ga listing part i lecture given on 27 september 1962 thank you this is what audience 27th of september ad 12 now the subject of tonights lecture has to do with something you havent been paying very much attention to and on which theres very little technology and which ive even got notes for its the first time i think in history i sometimes come in with notes but i seldom use them in this particular case i asked suzie to give some data from an earlier lecture so that we could compound these lectures and put them all together and this lecture is all about listing and you never heard about listing before obviously youve heard about listing for 3dxx and the list must be complete and youve heard about listing this and listing that well just so nobody misses it see when goal is found see when goal is found you then have number of lines called lines and item by item you ask the question of these lines you see you ask the question of the lines of the pc and he gives you the answer and that is written down and that is called line listing and when you have finished all the lines completely there is free needle on all of the lines and you have clear unless you list the goal you dont have one now i just wanted to put this in as data in case anybody had missed it listing is not prepchecking its different listing is done in model session listing is done with very good auditing and anybody who believes that it could be done with slaphappy qanda auditing sort of thing has got another think coming and it is very smooth operation now in view of the fact that it is not studded with stellar actions and such as well i found the dynamic i found the goal i found the item some people dont think it is important but it is listing that makes the clear now the things that are listed are items and today we are listing forty lines forty linesforty you have sometimes seen marquees on carnivals and so forth forty girlsforty but these are forty linesforty and these are all listed and these lines each contain items which are terminals now lists are not done by significances this is an important point because somebody sooner or later is going to mess up line and fix it up so that it can only be answered with significance ill give you an example heres goal you say to be good enough as the goal and then say for what see that gives you significance well the line must always be answeredor written in such way that it can be answered with an item now there are several reasons for this you want to know why people cant go clear just by finding goals well thats because you can reach infinite distances in the world of thought and therefore reach amongst all of these massy massive electronic supercharged masses called items which exist in spaces and which are all jammed up on the time track to time zero called the gpm and the gpm is only slightly composed of thought the gpm is composed of masses and the masses make up the difficulties that the pc is having now please remember that please please remember it it is so easy to face thought that in all fields of philosophy they thought that thought was enough and it arent you know read the philosophers if you want to know how far they thought thought could think the gpm is made up of masses and it is masses that keep the pc from going clear not thoughts in other words you could audit forever forever spelled forever underscored with an exclamation point afterwardsin the field of thought without producing clear and the reason weve made it and others havent is based on this one pointthis one point that we have discovered that the bank and the reactive mind contains masses whether those are expressed as pictures as in engrams as circuits as machines or anything else they are masses and they exist in space and the confrontation of those masses is what makes deaberration and you could thought and think and thunk and figure and figure and think and thunk and thought for generations for eons and for the next two hundred trillion years without making clear now do i make myself very positive on this because youre liable to slip on this you see the reason this is liable to slip is thought is so easy for thetan to confront hes nothing thoughts are nothingduplicate perfect see that perfect duplication see so he most easily goes to think and he avoids the masses and youre going to hear as the years roll on people leaping up here and leaping up there and expostulating the fact that somebody could go clear with thinksbecause its so painful going clear on masses theyre so hard to confront so people are going to take the easy road out and try to go by thinks you understand so we have to make that clear on listingthat listing consists of getting items getting the pc to confront items and name them now that is what listing consists of and you dont as an auditor in listing dont have to stress this point all of the mechanical data is already there you just go through the action of listing and all the rest of this takes place but that pc is confronting masses its terribly important see now the mind according to every philosopher on the track from here back to none is composed of thought see they all believed it was composed of thought it was full of think and nobody ever asked what the hell is all this think stuck in how come he cant unthink and you know i pondered this one question for years and years and years and years and years before i finally came down to the answer of it you address masses and you will never think person through to anyplace interesting isnt it you confront him through now all of the material that underlies clearing its tremendously extensive there have been tremendous quantities of it deleted as unnecessary and it comes down to this simple operation known as listing and the operation looks so simple that it can slip it is near perfect now it is very near this and it contains complexity of combinations which are staggering once you begin to look them over the gpm is composed of masses and these masses are composited identities its actually masses of identities ill show you what happens the thetan sails through life hes wearing body the whole way hes being hit by trucks and hitting trucks and beating his wife and being spat in the face of you know shes been hanging new dresses on herself and corseting herself so that you can put circle of your fingers around her waist theres all kinds of impacts compression suppression so forth and all the time this thetan is emanating energy and absorbing energy and emanating and absorbing and energy is being emanated at him or her and things are absorbing his or her energy and here they are you see and when they finally take the body and put it in the sixfoot box or in the tree or in the sand dune or other customs or send it back to be melted down for the new dollbody factory when they finally finish up with this they dont bury with it the masses thats very interesting but those masses are not buried the thetan tucks the old tin cans sadly under his arm and goes clanking away dragging every chain of that lifetime and not having any way to get rid of them and not knowing what to do with them and being low on havingness anyhow he sort of tucks them all together and wads them up you know he takes whole lifetime and makes it look like kleenex and stuffs it someplace because it may someday be of use and also because hes never known what the devil to do with it he tries to shove it into bodies and it doesnt stick he says it belongs to bodies and wears it on himself this thing is pretty fabulous when you come to think about it what the devil is he going to do with his accumulated bricabrac lifetime looks like picnicground monday with place to put any of the debris so hes sort of liable to pack it over into the corner and wad it down when you finally get all through hes got gpm thats honey because hes done this hundreds of lives thousands of lives millions of lives and every one of them had its residue well there it is theres the stuff theres the junk not only that but this material has the oddity of appearing in his vicinity as whole beingness as machine as circuit as thinkingness all kinds of weird things occurs he sees himself yesterday and he says ooooh theres somebody yes there was somebody and this is very very often compounded but sometimes he does see somebody dont you see he sees you or he sees somebody or he sees another thetan and he wonders whether or not it isnt valence or an item or whether you arent part of his bank and you know there are people walking around right now that think everything else and everybody else they see is just part of their own reactivity in the story fear not calling off any of my own bibliography the stunt of walking down the street and being absolutely sure that the whole street is knocked down and dismantled as soon as one is out of sight of it you see and making sure that the people who are talking together dont just stand there like dummies after one has gone by and never move thereafter you see this feeling that the whole world is an emanation of self could be result of one of these packedup banks he cant any longer tell the difference between an identity in the bank or an actual being or anything like this it gets to be pretty mixed up he finally gets so he doesnt know them and he doesnt know himself and he doesnt want to know he doesnt know how it got that way and he doesnt know what to do with it so he invents psychology which proves to people that youve got to be crazy to be clever be glad youre neurotichave you ever read that great textbook well that actually is the type of textbook that thetan writes when hes just given up man he says there must be some use for it hes been saying that for trillennia you see so finally he knows the use for it you write book about it and say be glad youre neurotic its valuable possession well youd think processing some pcs that you were trying to take away their head when you take away an item sometime theyd be very sad about it and theyd be very upset and theyd be very this and very that the item youre trying to get is crazy man that has made this person unsuccessful his whole lifetime hasnt even been game he didnt even know he had it see this thing is pretty wild now its listing that gets rid of all these items and that accumulation the fantastic thing has occurred of finding out how it is that the masses came into being in the first place and thats really pretty fantastic to plumb that particular secret but that is the secret of any being that is his secret how did the masses materialize in the first place they materialized through an alterisness of his basic purpose and if he never altered his basic purpose and never lost and never had any conflict with life because of his basic purpose and was always able to carry it out theoretically he would have gathered mass theoretically it was never opposed he never opposed anything with it dont you see theoretically itd never happen so its an alteris of this one idée fixe the basic purpose of the being now he justone day he was floating out amongst the clouds and he was awful bored and he didnt have anything to do and by god he thought something up he says well see he doesnt carehes gone beyond caring now see and he says wellno games i think i had better have basic purpose i really should have purpose in life what would be good purpose in life theres reason for him to have it at all you see he says to catch catfish that will be it thats good laudable purpose catfish are evil beings and im going to catch catfish and thats going to be my purpose in life so he gets job as street sweeper walking around with dustbin spearing paper there arent any catfish well hes in trouble now you see hes got to go through all the motions of materializing catfish so he can catch catfish and then hes got to have some opposition to him doing this and then hes got to have this and hes got to have that and the laws of games set in at once and he starts individuating out of existence having made this basic purpose now he little envisioned any vast consequences of this or that he would forget his basic purpose or itd be so lost as to be unexecutable or to face the fact that the one thing he did with strain was his basic purpose he could do anything else well but this one was tough to do he had to do it and it was very hard to do it practically wore him out but he never much paid any attention to that but the reason he was accumulating everything and had unsuccessful lives and didnt have game was the reason whythe only thing is he is specialized in his game you see the game must only be to catch catfish he may play other game so there is his idée fixe his total limitation of ability and as he goes along the trillennia this thing snowballs in terms of mass he accumulates beingnesses he opposes beingnesses he gets mental image pictures of these things he tries to oppose his own goal he does everything you can think of and eventually hes walking around and he doesnt know whether hes afoot or horseback much less able to or not able to catch catfish finally he has thinks he has thousands of purposes and he cant execute any of them and he is confused boy now there is school of thought an interesting school of thought that tells you that livingness is necessary you very often hear an auditor say this ive never come down under it or made many comments about it but heres the truth of this school of thought of livingness is necessary familiarization with something raises ability you go out and pat an automobile for while and youll improve your ability to drive now that is true because its an analytical causative motion whereby the individual is actually touching and withdrawing from an automobile and familiarization will result so long as the person is at cause now thats as far as that livingness thing goes but because it exists to that degree it has been stretched to an enormous extent and what does it look like now well if you have enough automobile wrecks you wont mind them and you know that isnt true it just isnt true now if you have goal to wreck cars you wont have much trouble in automobile wrecks because thats your basic purpose after all youll be able to wreck cars with enormous impunity youll be amazing youll be somebody like lucky teeter you can go out on fairgrounds and run cars over jumps and smash them into walls and lock them up in barns and set it on fire and do all kinds of mad things on the subject of wrecking cars and it looks like familiarization but every once in while this fellow lucky teeter will pick up some young fellow that hes going to trainand heres something very peculiarhe never seems to be able to train these young fellows they wreck cars all right and wherever lucky teeter has gone you come in the town short time afterwards you will find that theres one or two young fellows in the hospital there recovering from burns breaks and contusions now you know by experience that if you break your leg once itll heal up pretty well and if you break it twice you have little harder time at it and if you break it three times it starts to get pretty difficult and you break it four times you dont even bother to heal it up in other words you dont get used to it and the basic lie on the track is that you can get used to this universe see that is wild game that passed off in some direction or another and its never materialized so thetan keeps on going up the time track expecting at any time to get used to the universe and hes getting less and less and less and less effective picking up more and more psychosomatics picking up more and more difficulties having more and more gpm always hoping hes going to get used to this livingness thats one of the biggest operations that was ever pulled off on life and its one of the primary operations of this universe that you can just get used to it youre all setif you can get used to it if you just fall down enough wells youll eventually get an expert wellfallerdowner familiarization oddly enough requires an entirely different action the pc must be at cause and the pc must do the reaching and withdrawing and life if you will notice does most of the reaching and the person is carefully educated in this universe that he cannot have caused it having built it hes now told somebody else did uniform lie you get the compositings of these lies and you get the fact that there was possibility of person living his way out of it this is one of the earliest philosophies that you run into when you start to do listing im not berating this universe one isnt berating it just to say what its about the individual then as far as the gpmtake any cycle of the gpm operates as the whole gpmthe individual then is universe he is building up as universe he is collecting the mass of universe so on because he apparently follows identically the pattern of this universe the physical universe is bais basically built on postulate which was alter ised thats apparently the mechanism of the sixth dynamic thats apparently how it was built now thetan does this same thing and he builds up on this basic purpose now heres whats wonderful about this there is only one basic purpose at time this is quite fabulous theres just one at time now why that is i dont know see you can find an earlier basic purpose in the individualit governed an earlier cycle but you wont find that earlier cycle ive thought for while you could reach deeper in the bank and you could do some things like thatno you cant you find the goal you find and you will only find one thats quthats nuts you see youre only going to find one goal in this individualuntil it is goneand then you can find an earlier goal then list it out and then you can find an earlier goal but at time do you find two goals this may become as surprise to some of you because ive never said it that emphatically there isnt any such thing as two goals as you sit there as an auditor finding goals youve paid your money and you takes your chance there it is man theres only one i dont care how long the list is theres only one goal on it you can console yourself with this interesting fact that it does exist or the person wouldnt be here it is here in other words and theres only one now that one has accumulated unto itself by collisions with other identities and activities many more purposes what is the purpose of catfish well this is one of the waysyou get it by oppgoalsone of the purposes of catfish could be not to get caught and an individual who is catching catfish will eventually pick up the goal not to be caught and its all tangled up in the gpm and he very often doesnt know whether its his or somebody elses or anything else other way he goes up the trackthe silly goofand hes been catching catfish and catching catfish but for some reason or other town and county planning has eradicated all catfish you see theyve gotten rid of them all and they passed an ordinance you see against them and said that this is it see and this is unreasonable because it isnt even in their department you see but the individual is kind of wiped out about the whole thing so he gets the goal to eradicate all governments he decides that because you see he has to eradicate all governments in order to catch catfish see you get how this works see now in the process of eradicating all governments he finds out that he cant rouse up people to doing anything about it he goes around and theyre all reasonable you know they say well town and county planning men mean well and they arent all idiots the way you say and theyre perfectly reasonable and you have to have planning heres all sorts of weird and odd things you see so eventually he decides to hell with this id better dream myself up another idea here and he does and he decides to increase his ability to convince people heres another goal to convince people now he finds out that the people are just in total overwhelm with regard to the government and even though he convinces them nothing happens they just go on paying their income taxes and tearing down their homes and so forth and so he finally says to squeal with this he says im just going to be above it all now you try to get him on an emeter and of course he yoyos all the time its all right i washed that one out last night so i can use it now you think your old goals will never be used again youd be surprised they live on and on you see how it goes now he could have thousands of these things hes got the oppgoals and hes got the goals he had to have because of the goals and then he finally finds out that catfish are sympathetic and come around and nibble at him when hes in despair so he has goal to be in despair see and its all around and then he doesnt know what hes trying to do after while is he trying to be above it all or to eradicate governments or convince people or what and somehow or other he overlooks the basic goal he never seems to be able to get near it its so charged up by this time that he cant approach it he doesnt recognize it he doesnt know what hes trying to do and here is being who is totally built you might say as far as the mass hes collected on purpose being purposeless and the result of his purpose is eventual purposelessness and the reason hes purposeless and cant seem to get anything done is because he has tremendous purpose that he doesnt know anything about and to break your heart didnt need in the first place now finding the goal is difficult sometimes it just drops in your lap finding the goal is difficult and therefore listing it by comparison appears to be less vital and so youre likely to neglect it but this is true bad listing or bad auditing during listing can wipe out and cancel any benefit of the goal and make the pc worse just remember that when youre teaching hpas and other people to list see just remember that bad listing can wipe out all the hard work that the goal finder has done goal can become utterly and completely submerged and unrecognizable completely challenged mishmashed and the pc turned into bundle of sensation and dizziness and pain and everything pushed out of line and messed up with bad listing how can you do this all right let show you the basic mechanism when youre checking out this goal it isnt goal unless it has pain on it you all know that all right their sen comes and goes sen is not opposition i will tell you what sen is sen is the product of the three buttons suppress careful of and failed to reveal now ill tell you some other time about big tiger but you can just rack it up for now that youve got in an ordinary tiger drill youve gotthis is an ordinary tiger drillyouve got over on the left sideif you can envision it here youve got three buttons here youve got suppress youve got careful of and youve got failed to reveal theyre the guard of the left and here we have invalidate suggest and mistake and theyre the guard of the right got these three now group your tiger drill this way these buttons suppress careful of and fail to review reveal produce sen and these buttons produce pain that ought to make tiger drilling awful easy for you not big tiger but ordinary tiger see awful easy there they are it doesnt much matter the order in which these buttons are hit in this particular drilling but remember this the goal fires falsely on the buttons on the right invalidation suggest and mistake they make the goal fire falsely see this goal i just gave you to be above all it fires falsely if theres any fire in it at all you see you know ticks and thingsnot rocket reads but ticks and so on it makes it look like its the goal you see because of these three buttons invalidate suggest mistake all right sensensation motion misemotion so forththese things are caused by suppress careful of and fail to reveal and when the goal doesnt fire its in the lefthand column suppress careful of and fail to reveal and when the goal falsely fires its over here in the righthand column invalidate suggest and mistake you got that thats very neat isnt it all right well call that just ordinary tiger drill you see the goal fires pick righthand button goal doesnt fire pick lefthand button got it sensation is totally not the product of opposition although opposition will also give you sensation you should ask yourself why does opposition give you sensation its because youre suppressing it and its suppressing you actually suppression gives you sensation being careful of gives sensation fail to reveal gives sensation see its pullin got it now these buttons can get tangled up with the righthand buttons so that sometimes you get the goal firing and you find out it was suppress that was firing but boy thats all tangled up and if you analyzed it very carefully youd find out it was an invalidation which had been suppressed you see its intertwined its mess in other words and you get it straightened out but this is your order of action now you got this guy hes got his goaltheres got to be pain see while youre listing that goal there must be pain theres also going to be some sensation and so forth but while youre listing that goal if you got the pc to suppressing you the auditor or if you the auditor got to suppressing the pc his right goal will turn into total sen it is his goal and hell get nothing but sensation on all lines in other words hes suppressing the auditing hes being careful of the auditing hes failing to reveal things dont you see and the net result of that is itll look just like wrong goal and one of the primary tests of whether or not its the right goal is whether on listing it produces pain and if goal only produces sensation on listing your first conclusion perhaps would be to call it wrong goal ah but supposing you have joe jinx who almost got through the comm course he failed he couldnt remember where the door was and you got this fellow listing and you hear his auditors report see you get his auditors report and he says well i dont know the pc every time i ask these questions who or what would want to catch catfish and so forth the pc just goes dizzy or cries you finally say you knucklehead what the hells happened around here maybe you were the goal finder see did i miss could it be know that thing rocket read tiger drilled for hours and prepchecked and so on it read and produced pain at that time right then youd start to think well lookahere ithis guys doing something wrong and youd find out yeah hes doing something wrong this is the way he was auditing the goal now who or what woulduh woulduhuhuhwho or what would want to try catuhno thats wrong uh whouhhuhuh what cat thats the wrong line who or what would try to catch catfish yes whats the answer or he reads the auditing question who or what would want to catch catfish and the pc says fisherman and the auditor says you had that you had that couple of lists back you had that couple of lists back cant have that one you have to think of another one you have to think of another one thats good or supposing it went like this the pc says well fisherman well why would fisherman want to catch catfish you sure thats the right answer now whats the date of that the date of what well the date of that or the pc says im sorry ive lost the auditing question well you must have missed withhold then and the first thing you know its all over on the lefthand column you got it now if you werent the goal finder and you werent sure it was the right goal to begin with ahha youre going to invalidate your fellow auditor and youre going to say somebody found lousy goal and you could just beat your brains out now because you try to do dynamic assessment when its already been done and you cant find any dynamic and you cant find any item and you cant find nothing you make yourself lot of work and then you decide to prepcheck the goal and accidentally the auditing gets prepchecked and all of sudden the goal has pain on it again do you see that it isnt opposition that makes the sensation then its the suppression of the opposition and the suppressiveness of the opposition that causes the sensation see therefore listing becomes very important now there are various tests for whether goal is the right goal or the wrong goal and with tiger drill these days and expert auditing and getting the goal to fire at the beginning of every session youre not going to get this type of submergence that was another step taken theres very little chance of wrong goal being run very little chance of it because in the first place goal when found ought to be checked by another auditor i dont care who found it including it ought to always be checked you always look it over because in the first place it might be one of these inandout affairs you may not be aware of the fact that some goals have been tiger drilled big tiger for twelve hours and then faded but they werent rocket reading and they didnt look like goal they were very out most of the time but they still produce sensation they still produce pain on the pc for that period of time some mornings you get up and you just should have stayed in bed you see you chose that goal to go into the pc feels wonderful so what you didnt find the goal you see thats how long theyll hang on sometimes but remember those goals arent rocket reading worth nickel real goal goes in and out and it rocket reads and doesnt read and it ticks and it ticks sporadically and then it wont read at all and then it gives you three beautiful rocket reads and then the pc says well im in thats it and having asserted this of course you get three ticks or he says ii just well ii guess id better not have to put my attention on this anymore theyve just found it in and if i just kind of withdraw over here and not pay any attention to the auditor itll stay in pcs do the darnedest things and then you getafter these three nice beautiful rocket readsyou get three complete noreadatall all kinds of wild things occur on goals but that is not necessarily the subject of this lets say the goal has been tested the goal has been checked out and there you have the goal now youve turned it over to somebody who lists or youre listing it yourself now at the beginning of every session which is done in model session you want that goal tiger drilled until it fires now how fire is fire well youll find goal which has been listed halfway out has about half rocket read left on it and then they start going sporadic on their reads they start going prior and latent and they start doing other queer things they do all kinds of oddball things these by the way can usually be straightened out you can usually resurrect goal matter how long it isif you want to spend that much time on itto make it absolutely read perfect instant read every time now how long itll stay that waythe pc coughs and it doesnt read like that now do you see so you want that thing to fire every time now you see thats good provision because if its the wrong goal and is made to fire every time and if you prohibit listing unless the goal fires you got that rule see goal fire list see why the worst thats going to happen to pc is hes going to get three or four or five listing sessions and therell be goal and nobody can make it read and nobody can do anything to it and nobody can resurrect it andbig tiger and everything else nothing can pull it back to life again theres pain on it theres sensation on it theres just nothing its gone you see what would happen even if you had wrong goal see thats wonderful safety factor there matter how good you are as an auditor or how good the fellow whos doing the listing or the goals finding and so forth you can always miss see so thats good safeguard to have in there completely aside from this listing is not effective unless the goal is firing you wont get listing done unless you get the goal firing thats why old listing took so long did you know it took upwards to two hundred hours did you know it took that long and that was done without getting the goal to fire it was done on too few lines and it was done this way and it was done that way it still produced some clears these characters are always very very happy now to get sixteen or twentyfour lines at least they say well thats funny i mean you know i kept rolleycoastering id get up in the morning id put myself on an meter and id read 275 then after id had cup of coffee id read 3l then by noon it would be settled down with total free needle by five oclock in the afternoon itd be reading 25 it worries them well why are they worried why do they put themselves on emeters and do other odd things like this they got pieces of gpm still kicking them see their needle was free in the session then couple of days later piece of the gpm from the same channel keyed in on them do you get what happened to them when thats all listed clear on enough lines that doesnt happen you see you got high degree of stability and if the goal is made to fire at the beginning of every sessionjust at the beginning right after the beginning rudimentsthat goal was made to fire and made to fire so that you say to catch catfishpangto catch catfishpangto catch catfish pang thats fine lets get on how much of rocket read must that have boy i pity you i pity youthe questions that are going to be asked you and you and you by people doing listing on the subject of how fire is fire because as the goal begins to pass away and the force and power of it deteriorates youre going to get decided differences in what fire looks like and what is fire eventually the goal is going tsk tsk tsk and eventually the goal is going tsk youre going to have more people coming to you saying gaaaaaaa of course you look for the other signs pc still getting pain on listing lines are going fine pcs looking good everythings going along like hot shell and there we are say go on go on list list list yeah i know but i cant get it to fire well get the pc to fire instead go on get listing this is whatthis is what you face this is my subtle revenge on this matter for all of the questions youve asked all right now listing session is wrong session youre going to get certain manifestations occurring in that session which are very easily distinguishable and so forth but the subject of what im telling you right now is is smooth auditing take that up in the second lecture see the exact lineups but the trouble that youre going to have isbeen because of the various preventions really not with wrong goals the trouble youre going to have is with lousy listing see because thats unspectacular listing is quite exciting you find lots of items and all of sudden you find an item and oh woof whats that wow whoa wow the pc says you say whatswhat happened whohohohohoho what happened whew its planet i swallowed damn fool stunt thetans sure are stupid swallow planet there it went stuck to another planet yeah wonder what the other planet ulp in other words theres lot of excitement to be had in listing and theres the other thing that you want to train people to do about listing is the randomity produced by the pc is usual ordinary standard the convulsions the foam at the mouth these things are not anything to worry the seasoned auditor what he is supposed to do is ask the next listing line that is what he is supposed to do and when people come running to you and their face looks so white that paper company would pay fortune theydthat istheyhe says huhhehhuhaheh pc you go back and you find out whats happened nothing the pc just got off items one and two they were counteropposed they both stuck together and all of sudden the whole back of his head blew off and his body coordination went kind of baaaah for minute and hes sitting in the chair going like this getting over the shock now without an auditor what youre supposed to do is ask him the next auditing command and if you can train listing auditor to be able to confront pcs and ask for the next auditing command and write it down and not fumble paper and drop the sheets all over the floor and few things like that your listing sessions will go off like bomb the goal stays in the pain all stays on you dontyou need minimum number of prepchecks and the guy goes clear swish thats very much to everyones interests its minimal number of auditing hours now the worse listing sessions are the longer it takes to list goal to free needle and the monitoring thing is not the state of the pcs bank but the smoothness of the auditing of the listing auditor that is almost the total determination factor on how long it takes pc to go clear after the goal is found one pc doesnt have more items than another pc that is almost neglectable you dont have to do anything about that they all come out about even but one pcs list will get longer and longer and longer and longer and whats he doing well hes actually not blowing anything so he keeps putting the same items back on the list hoping they will blow you see he isnt insession the rudiments are out other things are wrong so therefore it appears that he has much longer list the length of time it takes to go clear is determined by the skill quietness and ability of the auditor doing the listing and by and large so far ive found that the goals found at saint hill that those goals which were found to have beengone out apparently or werent the goalthat was of last year you seegoals were found and run on other routine 3s they were the goal but theyd just been very badly listed and the pc was total sen and hadnt gotten any better and everything person takes his life in his hands leaving here without his goal listed let tell you that ill just put that across the pan you think you save time by going home hahahahahahahaha not so so anywayjust holding that horrible thought up to youits the quality of the listing auditor so my point of this lecture is simply this is listing may not be spectacular you might say anybody can do listing but just remember this anybody who can do listing must also be very excellent auditor hes got to be smooth he doesnt have to be clever he doesnt have to be spectacular but hes got to be smooth hes got to be able to keep the pc insession and hes got to be able to do his job without chopping the pc up in other words hes got to be pretty good what you try to keep from happening in listing session is randomity questioning q and auditor taking up items all of this nonsense the best listing session is an almost totally muzzled session comments twoway comm nothing thats the best listing session its just bare bones session okay thank you
