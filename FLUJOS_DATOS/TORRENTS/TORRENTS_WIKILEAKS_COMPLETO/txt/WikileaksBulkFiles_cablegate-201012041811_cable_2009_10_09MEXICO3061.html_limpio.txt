14 bd 1 snf summary dni dennis blair met with president calderon for about forty minutes at the presidential palace on october 19 the bulk of the discussion focused on cooperation on intelligence sharing and the integration of operations by mexican intelligence and law enforcement authorities calderon also commented extensively on political developments in latin american and the role of the united states while he said the united states had regained significant stature in latin america he also urged greater us involvement in the politics of the region several upcoming elections will be critical in shaping the regions political course the us he said needs to be seen as critical player end summary 2 snf the issue at the heart of the discussion was that mexico must continue to improve its coordination and response capacity among its own security forces to act effectively on intelligence leads regardless of the source including mexicos own internal intelligence channels mexicos federal police still largely bases its operational capacity in mexico city the secretary of defense sedena is more decentralized but has yet to define cooperative platform to work with the federal police when operations are undertaken in rural areas with difficult terrain the complexity of moving large security operations in short time frame may often result in targeted individuals escaping from these operations calderon said this situation made him very sad and that it was great mistake on their part further calderon indicated that he would assess the possibility of creating joint strike force capability note in separate subsequent meetings discussion was launched with gom officials on the possibility of undertaking simulated exercise that would begin to test how multiple agencies could cooperate together septel end note 3 snf blair underscored that the fight against crime has to move beyond highvalue targets cut the head off this snake and new heads will grow blair said the key ingredient to success is generating community confidence to call in tips against drug traffickers to get that people need to feel secure they have to believe that the police can maintain public safety and it also means that intelligence has to be used quickly effectively and responsibly intelligence operations and institutional capacity have to be interwoven calderon agreed he responded you made it very clear without attacking the body as well we cant win and we have to create the capacity to take on the body 4 snf dni blair asked calderon for his perspective on political developments in the region and how the united states could continue to increase its diplomatic effectiveness calderon emphasized that venezuelan president hugo chavez is active everywhere including mexico he went out of his way to highlight that he believes chavez funded the prd opposition during the presidential campaign nearly four years ago chavez uses social programs including sending doctors to curry political influence and there are governors in mexico who may be friendly to him calderon said that mexico is trying to isolate venezuela through the rio group calderon also commented that he is particularly concerned about venezuelas relations with iran and that the iranian embassy in mexico is very active calderon underscored that irans growing influence in latin american should be of considerable concern to the united states and chavez is doing all he can to aid and abet it 5 snf calderon exhorted the us to watch guatemala and belize since their internal weaknesses make them vulnerable he is concerned about mexicos southern border and said the gom is starting strategic planning process to better treat the topic note calderon is scheduled to visit guatemala next week end note calderon later in the meeting raised the southern border again as an area for usmexico cooperation ambassador pascual noted that the us and mexico were to hold the next day joint conference on the guatemala border to combat arms trafficking from the south mexico 00003061 002 of 002 6 snf circling back to venezuela calderon said that chavez has qualms about involving himself in latin american elections and that he tried to do so in mexicos own 2006 presidential contest the region needs visible us presence he noted chavez said calderon will also have the opportunity to do so in number of upcoming votes especially honduras most importantly said calderon the united states must be ready to engage the next brazilian president brazil he said is key to restraining chavez but he lamented that president lula has been reluctant to do so the us needs to engage brazil more and influence its outlook in closing calderon said that there is link among iran venezuela drugs narcotics trafficking and rule of law issues the us should look at latin america from an interconnected perspective visit mexico citys classified web site at httpwwwstatesgovgovpwhamexicocity and the north
