plan issues with respect to the changes suggested by clare green inserts within the text i am comfortable with the suggested changes i am however somewhat concerned with the definition for weather generator but this relates to personal perception and my concerns as to how this would be interpreted by users i would prefer not suggesting that the weather generator generates weather data but that it generates weather variables at the daily and subdaily level consistent with the projected climate as such i would prefer something along the lines of the following definition weather generators are statisticallybased computer programs that use existing weather records and random number sampling to produce long timeseries of synthetic daily and subdaily variables the statistical properties of the generated weatherlike variables are expect to be similar to those of the existing weather record the ukcip08 weather generator bases its daily and subdaily variables for future time periods on the statistical nature of the pdf data chosen to drive it the variables generated are those required by many applications precipitation maximum and minimum temperature rainfall solar radiation and wind speed as well as measures of atmospheric water vapour and evapotranspiration in terms of the definitions for scenarios and projections those ascribed to are actually those developed through the deliberations within chapter 2 of the ipcc wgii for which tim carter was one of the lead authors my understanding after talking with tim was that these definitions which are the result of considerable discussion within the ipcc impacts vulnerability and adaptation community will be included with the wgii publication i suggest that the definitions to be included and used within ukcip08 do need further consideration to ensure that they are clearly identifying what ukcip08 will be delivering probabilistic projections and scenarios the definitions within ukcip08 should be informed not constrained by the ipcc deliberations and should be directed at informing the user community client focused i also agree with clare that we should be providing definition of what is meant by probabilistic within the context of ukcip08 in terms of way forward would it be reasonable to ask the following to develop for the specified terms definitions for approval by the sg after seeking views of the users panel mohc baseline period climate climate change climate model deterministic and probabilityprobabilistic density function newcastle weather generator and ukcip scenarios and projections these could be done over the next couple of weeks with single request for views going out to the users panel in july roger original message from clare goodess cgoodessueaacuk to

steven wilson stwinercacuk vicky pope vickypopemetofficegovuk winter guy seerad guywinterscotlandgsigovuk sent friday june 15 2007 659 pm subject re outstanding comms plan issues dear all i was looking at this glossary on the train yesterday and have few relatively minor comments on some of the entries added in green to kathryns latest draft but i found the definitions of projections and scenarios very confusing with problems in both the ipcc and rogers wording which i couldnt think how to resolve so it was interesting to see this email discussion there do seem to be some fundamental differences and still confusion so im afraid that some more discussion is needed sorry kathryn we agreed at the last meeting to add deterministic and following this logic through i think that we should also have added probabilistic according to the key messages ukcip08 will be providing probabilistic projections it therefore seems rather confusing to read that projections are generally less comprehensive than scenarios this implies to the user that the ukcip08 probabilistic projections are less comprehensive than the ukcip02 scenarios which is not the intended message though it depends what you mean by less comprehensive over the last few months i have been persuaded by discussions with people like tim carter that we should avoid talking about probabilistic scenarios i agree with david that it makes sense to say that scenarios include projections when our definition of the latter includes uncertaintiesprobabilities perhaps the solution is to make clear distinction between projections which can be deterministic or probabilistic and probabilistic projections at least we all seem agreed on not using prediction i hope that this has not further muddied the waters best wishes clare at 1523 14062007 davidsextonmetofficegovuk wrote hi i am off for week and half now and have few things to sort out here so i wont be able to give you any text for pdfs i think that might be best left until the report is written because it depends lot on what the report writers think other comments in the text on thu 20070614 at 1103 0100 humphrey kathryn cesa wrote all you seem to have all more or less agreed on the key messages which is great however the glossary is continuing to bring up range of divergent views ive had more comments and have got amended definitions in the attached david and chris who couldnt make last weeks meeting have questioned the use of the ar4 definitions chris too technical for the layperson see comments in the attached and the projectionsscenarios definition david not in agreement with mohc definitions david i am keen not to open up the debate again on the differences between scenarios projections and predictions the latter of which were not using at all as weve already had an astonishingly long conversation on this one and i thought had come to agreement for the time being i think we should remove any reference to climate predictions in the ar4 definition of projections because we havent got glossary term for climate prediction so climate models climate projections depend upon the emissionconce would be better however if you can find support from the rest of the sg then ill open this one up again otherwise id like to stick with the definitions we have which are consistent with the ar4 wg2 ones defining projections as the bit that includes uncertainty and scenarios not i must be missing something here but where does ar4 say projections as the bit that includes uncertainty and scenarios not anyway ar4 also says climate projections serve as the raw material for scenarios so how can scenarios not include uncertainty when projections do i still think there is confusion and that this issue will arise again when it comes to report writing can i also have actual text if you want to change the definitions as otherwise i am just guessing on what you are asking for david i like your point on providing an explicit def of probability and pdf but can you offer some text plus some for stochastic and error if you want these in i dont think we need stochastic and error i just wondered why we had deterministic there in the first place cheers david kind regards kathryn ______________________________________________________________________ from roger street mailtorogerstreetukciporguk sent 14

2007 0905530499 utc filetime 360a52b001c7ae63 returnpath davidsextonmetofficegovuk hi here are some quick comments i probably made some similar ones while back general comment on glossary general comment is that i can see the point of having glossary early on so that terms are consistent across different communications but i really feel that lot of these are scientific and that they need to be correct for the report and consistent with the ideas of the report writers geoff and james and to lesser extent phil and chris and stephen dye these ideas will develop as the report is written so i dont think it helps the report writers to set in stone these terms also i think the glossary has several inconsistencies in it which will cause confusion so here are my comments finally we have to be really careful with the terms prediction and uncertainty because both have connotations to the lay person which are different to the scientist scientific predictions should always have an estimate of uncertainty associated with them where prediction to lay person might mean oneoff value error is another good example i would try to avoid these terms in the glossary and the report specific comments projections scenarios and predictions at mohc we see climate projection as some plausible climate that is an outcome of some inputs eg emission scenario it has likelihood assigned to it here we see climate predictions as set of projections which have been calibrated by the observations and therefore have an assigned likelihood it seems this is more like the ar4 definition of scenario as ar4 use observed data see ar4 defn and therefore scenarios do ascribe likelihoods this seems to contradict rogers last line on projections which says scenarios do not ascribe likelihoods also the product has always been referred to as the ukcip08 scenarios and they definitely assign likelihoods i also disagree with rogers last sentence on projections id say projections are not probabilistic so temporary suggestion would be to use the ar4 definition of projection but delete the confusing bit relating it to predictions which havent been defined in the glossary ie delete distinguishedprojections pdf i would use probability distribution function cos it has an element of subjective uncertainty in it probability density functions are to more analytical eg gaussian exponential also the definition does describe what pdf is but it doesnt convey how the pdf should be viewed because it doesnt convey what probability is measuring for ukcip08 probability is measuring the degree to which future climates are consistent with the information used to construct the scenarios climate model data and observations and the assumptions and methods used in constructing them ie they are convenient summary statement of all that data given some assumptions which are more usable than the data itself in helping planners make decisions this is different to the definition learnt at school where probability of say rolling dice can be measured by repeated experiment climate is oneoff so there is repeated experiment and so the schoolboy definition doesnt apply and this needs to be explained consequence of this is the pdf will change in ukcipnext because better models methods and more observations will change it deterministic means the output ie from single run of typical climate model is based solely on the inputs here the model its input parameter values and the initial conditions what word are you contrasting this against it should be contrasted against random or stochastic where there is random element involved that can change the sytem hopefully this is not be contrasted against probabilistic cheers david on wed 20070613 at 1632 0100 humphrey kathryn cesa wrote all attached is an updated
