discussed with him and the director division of administrative servi ces in september 2005 are reflected in the attached final report in italics 7 the security and safety service has accepted most of the recommendations made and is in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 8 the overall objective of the audit was to provide the directorgeneral unon with an assessment of the adequacy of unons arrangements for security and safety management of its staff assets and premises this included assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of unons arrangements for security and safety of its staff assets and premises and b whether the security and safety services were being carried out in compliance with united nations regulations and rules and relevant standards iii audit scope and methodology 9 the audit embraced activities for the period from 1 january 2002 to december 2004 and early 2005 where necessary 2 10 in view of a59365 dated 11 october 2004 strengthened and unified security management system for the united nations the current audit did not include detailed review of country security arrangements mandate and mission of unons security and safety services the relationship with the unsecoord and the reporting line of sss within unon and with the department of safety and security dss 11 security for unep unhabitat and unon ffices away from nairobi headquarters oanh are not included in scope beyond confirming what steps had been taken to ensure that they were part of the local security plan arrangements where they are located 12 the audit activities involved interviewing staff and management as well as reviewing available documentation and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations planning monitoring and reporting country security plan csp 13 oios reviewed the 2004 draft country security plan csp and was satisfied that the overall approach and assumptions taken by sss in preparing the csp were in accordance with the field security handbook fsh however the csp could be further improved by taking account of the following fsh requirements including locally recruited general service gs staff in the country security plan cover and evacuation entitlements and b establishing clearer distinction between essential and nonessential staff 14 oios is pleased to note that these factors have been taken into account in the preparation of the 2005 draft csp and as result recommendation is raised b evacuation plan 15 oios reviewed the gigiri complex evacuation plan and was satisfied with the majority of the information contained in the plan however the evacuation plan could be further improved by taking account of the following full rehearsal to test its effectiveness b list of key personnel c details of specific evacuation procedures from the gigiri complex to the designated transit safe haven and d details of assistance to physically challenged staff members including the use of volunteer colleagues as defined in stsgb20028 evacuation procedures for the united nations headquarters complex that states in case of an emergency trained volunteers will assist in evacuation staff with special needs recommendation to improve the completeness nd effectiveness of the gigiri complex evacuation plan security and safety service sss in 3consultation with united nations department of safety and security should review and update the evacuation plan to include list of key personnel details of specific evacuation procedures from the gigiri complex to the designated transit safe haven details of assistance to physically challenged staff members and consider the use of volunteer colleagues as defined in stsgb 20028 evacuation procedures for united nations headquarters complex and determine mechanism to carry out rehearsals of the evacuation plan to ensure staff are aware of what should happen in case of an actual evacuation rec 01 16 unon commented that the recommendation was accepted and action would taken by end of 2006 oios notes the response and will close the recommendation upon receipt of copy of the revised gigiri evacuation plan c standard operating procedures sop 17 oios noted that the current standard operating procedures sop had last been updated in 2001 oios is aware that the depa rtment of safety and security dss is currently developing standard operating proce dures which will be disseminated to sss then tailored to local conditions although these compensating arrangements are due to take place oios are concerned that sss currently has neither mechanism for updating and disseminating changes to the existing sop nor mechanism to cope with the tailoring of the dss sop to local conditions recommendation to improve the effectiveness of standard operating procedures of security and safety service s ss sss should develop mechanism to tailor the department of safety and security dss standard operating procedures sop to local conditions and update the sop as changes in those conditions occur rec 02 18 unon commented that upon receipt of th generic sop from dss unon would tailor them to local conditions as required oios thanks unon for the response and will close the recommendation upon receipt of copy of the sss sop d monitoring and reporting 19 oios noted the initiatives taken by sss in respect of monitoring and reporting activities including the 2003 year book and the w eekly incident reports disseminated to united nations staff members efficiency of monitoring and reporting may be better served if these initiatives formed part of central register of sss reporting requirements supported by mechanisms to collate and monitor the information to generate these reports recommendation to improve the effectiveness of monitoring and reporting arrangements of security and safety service sss sss should compile central register of repor ts required of sss by whom and by when then develop monitoring m echanism to identify collate and monitor the information required to generate these reports rec 03 4 20 unon commented that central registry would be compiled by the end of 2006 oios notes the response and will close th recommendation upon receipt of copy of register and details of the mechanism to identify collate and monitor the information required to generate these reports b human resources management overtime general 21 oios noted that the sss allotment for overtime in the 20022003 biennium was 19400 and the expenditure against that allo tment was 437000 sss explained that the majority of the over expenditure resulted from staffing shortages to cover unscheduled leave due to personal staff emergencies and b staff the close protection unit which provided protective escort service to the directorgeneral unon and the executive director unhabitat b overtime shift system 22 sss changed the security officer shift system from an eight hour to 12hour working day to ensure security officers sa fety was not jeopardised by travelling home in the hours of darkness and also to redu ce sss overtime expenditure sss can demonstrate that the shift system has benef ited the security officers in terms of their personal safety but information has been collected to demonstrate whether there has been any reduction in overtime in additi on the current system is unable to absorb unscheduled events such as sick leave w ithout overtime being incurred whilst sss believes that the problem is shortage of staff oios is of the view that this can only be established by analysis of management information recommendation to assist in ensuring that the na irobi security and safety service sss shift system minimises over time to the extent possible sss should analyse the information available on overtime to determine whether overtime could be reduced by making changes to the system or whether and to what extent additional resources are required rec 04 23 unon commented that it would undertake the analysis suggested and intends to complete the work by end of 2005 oios thanks sss for the prompt action taken and will close the recommendation upon notifica tion of the results of the review c overtime staffing of the close protection unit cpu 24 in the 20022003 biennium the two security officers assigned to the heads of unon unep and unhabitat contributed approxima tely us30000 to the overtime expenditure of sss oios noted that adequate procedur were in place to ensure the cpu overtime was approved in accordance with the united nations regulations and rules but are concerned about the lack of clear guidelines governing length of working hours for protective escort service duties oios not ed that there were approved guidelines covering any aspect of the duties offered by the cpu to the directorgeneral unon and executive director unhabitat which may have contributed to the excessive hours worked sss have taken steps to address the situation by establishing roster but this 5roster has not been discussed and agreed and does not form part of operating procedures for the close protection duty recommendation to improve the protective escort rvice afforded to the director general unon executive director unep and to the executive director unhabitat the security and safety service sss in conjunction with the department of safety and security dss should establish guidelines to govern the protective escort service provided by sss which should be discussed and agreed with all parties involved rec 05 25 unon commented that dss is undertaking threat assessment of risks to united nations senior personnel and based on this work will develop an sop for protection of united nations senior personnel which sss would tailor for local conditions oios thanks unon for the additional informa tion and will close the recommendation upon receipt of copy of the sop d background checks 26 at the time of the audit there was re quirement for sss to carry out checks into the background of candidate selected for recru itment to confirm that there is nothing that would make them unsuitable for sss position oios is of the view that such checks should be introduced because security staff ve access to knowledge about the security of unon buildings and united nations staff members dwellings that could be of value to any third party planning an act against the buildings or dwellings recommendation to safeguard the credibility nd reliability of unon security officers security and safety serv ice sss and the human resources management service should work together to determine mechanism for carrying out background checks on candidates selected for sss employment rec 06 27 unon accepted the recommendation oios will close the recommendation upon receipt and review of the mechanism for carrying out background checks on candidates selected for security positions training of sss staff 28 the sss training and development team t dt consists of three gs staff members who are assigned the responsibility for planning nd organising the training of sss staff at the time of the audit the td t did not maintain central register of training required nor training undertaken by each sss staff member oios is aware that dss is planning to develop centralised training programme wh ich will be disseminated to sss then tailored to local conditions although these compensating arrangements are due to take place oios is concerned that sss currently has neither mechanism for maintaining central register nor mechanism to cope w ith tailoring of the dss centralised training programme to local conditions 6 recommendation to improve the effectiveness of training of kenyabased security and safety service sss staff sss should develop mechanism to tailor the department of safety and security dss centralised training programme to local conditions and maintain central register to identify training required and undertaken by each sss staff member rec 07 29 unon accepted the recommendation which w ould be implemented by the end of 2005 oios notes the response and will clos the recommendation upon receipt of copy of the training programme and the register f training of united nations staff 30 sss have made considerable effort in providing security induc tion briefings for new staff members and weekly incident reports to keep all united nations staff members informed of events relating to security and sa fety these measures are not currently linked to any policy on what general and geographi c specific training should be provided united nations staff members working in kenya and there is central register of security training undertaken recommendation to ensure that kenya based united nations staff receive the appropriate level and quantity of security training and there are mechanisms in place to ensure that this training is kept up to date security and safety service sss should seek advice from department of safety and security dss on wh at training should be provided to kenya based united nations staff member how this will be kept up to date in addition sss should develop and maintain central register of training undertaken rec 08 31 unon commented that they would refer the matter to dss oios notes the response and will close the recommendation upon receipt of copy of the proposed training for united nations staff based in kenya c operationsprovision of services surveillance 32 sss undertook security surveillance rationalisation exercise in 2004 which highlighted the areas within the gigiri comp lex with inadequate surveillance coverage oios is of the opinion that whilst the security exercise addressed the adequacy of external coverage it did not adequately address internal surveillance for example there is electronic surveillance in any of the conference rooms b there is poor security surveilla nce around the office of the executive directors and the office of the deputy executive directors and c there are an inadequate number of cameras with insufficient scope to monitor the complexs perimeter areas and portals 33 an inspection of the control room unit re vealed that the majority of surveillance cameras used outdated technology were fau lty or not functioning properly and the 7maintenance contract for these cameras did not allow for immediate repair in the opinion of oios this exposes the gigiri comp lex to illegal entry and could reduce the effectiveness of investigations of incident s which may not be captured by the current surveillance equipment 34 oios is pleased to note that das has taken steps to procure the surveillance equipment identified as lacking and as such recommendation is raised b identification unit 35 oios noted that the controls over th work conducted by the identification unit appeared adequate with the following exception which reduces the effectiveness of unit at the time of the audit there was record of lost and stolen identification id cards which is important to provide security officers with tails of recently stolen passes which they should be vigilant for when checking passes b for detecting and analysing trends and c considering action required against staff members who continually lose their passes recommendation to ensure the security and safe ty service sss has adequate control over lost and stolen id entification id cards sss should develop procedures for recording m onitoring and analysing information about lost and stolen id cards and to take appropriate follow up action where necessary rec 09 36 unon commented that it had begun work on developing the procedures which should be complete by the end of 2005 oios thanks unon for the prompt action taken and will close the recommendation upon receipt and review of copy of the procedures c accessing the gigiri complex 37 as illegal or undesired access to the gigiri complex puts both united nations property and staff members at risk security officer s guarding access to the gigiri complex are tasked with ensuring that each person entering the gigiri complex has valid identification pass oios observed an inconsistent treatme nt by security officers guarding access to the gigiri complex in checking the validity of identification passes depending on whether person arrived in vehicles with united nati ons number plates or kenyan number plates unon commented that when funds become available it is implementing an electronic access system involving personnel and vehicle recognition in view of this additional information oios is not raising any recommendation d host country support in accessing the gigiri complex 38 following request by unon in june 2004 the host country kenyan government provided static armed personnel to assist in controlling and restricting entry to the gigiri complex the benefits of this initiative are diminished because at the time of the audit there was only an informal understanding of wh at this entailed and it was unclear what would happen in the event of an emergency at th front gate especially with regard to use of weapons 8recommendation to clearly define the role of th host country security officers in controlling access to the gigiri comp lex security and safety service sss and the department of safe ty and security dss should reach an agreement with the host country on the specific roles and responsibilities of these security officers including the actions to be taken in the event of an emergency especially when the use of weapons may be required rec 10 39 unon accepted the recommendation which w ould be implemented by the end of 2006 oios notes the response and will clos the recommendation upon notification of the outcome of discussions with the host country on the specific roles and responsibilities of these security officers including the actions to be taken in the event of an emergency especially when the use of weapons may be required assistance to united nations staff 40 oios noted that sss provide assistance to united nations staff members and their dependants in response to range of distre ss calls outside the gigiri complex including robberies and traffic incidents in addition oios noted the formation of the diplomatic police unit in 2005 to further assist united nations staff members although oios is pleased to note the assistance offered to staff members where 223 distress calls were reported and followed up by sss from january to august 2004 there is concern that there is clear policy which governs the us of sss staff and funding resources to provide this assistance 41 as result without clear policy and funding sss staff responding to multiple distress calls outside of the gigiri complex could lead to both inadequate and untimely responses to these calls as well as depleted sss staff remaining to safeguard the security of the gigiri complex recommendation to clearly define the role of s ecurity and safety service sss assistance provided to united na tions staff members and their dependants sss should request the partment of safety and security dss to provide guidance on what assistance should be provided to united nations staff members and thei r dependants how this assistance will be incorporated into the sss duties and what funding is available to support the assistance provided rec 11 42 unon commented that it would request gui dance from dss on the level of assistance to be provided to nairobi based staff and their dependents oios notes the response and will close the recommendation upon notification of the outcome of the discussion with dss d fire and safety team fst fire and safety procedures 43 fst consists of five gs staff whose duties were not exclusive to the fst as they were also included in duty roster for all security officers to compensate for the lack of dedicated fst staff an external party had b een contracted to provide fire protection and 9ambulance services to the gigiri complex however neither the contract signed with the external party nor the current capacity of the fst provides for reviewing the adequacy of the dedicated fst staff resources b reviewing the adequacy of unon fire fighting equipment fire detectors fire hydrants fire hoses hydrogen cylinders water sprinklers and water pressure c inspection and servicing of unon fire fighting equipment d training fst staff members security officers building marshals floor wardens and key building maintenance personnel in fire fighting techniques and fire prevention procedures and resolving the issues raised in the independent fire safety assessment conducted in 2002 recommendations to improve the fire and safety pr ocedures for the gigiri complex security and safety service sss should review the adequacy of the current resources of staff members and fire fighting equipment and make arrangements for the regular inspection of all fire fighting equipment and carry out servicing of this equipment where necessary rec 12 to safeguard both property and staff members at the gigiri complex security and safety service sss should make arrangements to train all fire and safety team st aff members sss security officers and key unon staff members on fire fighting techniques and fire prevention and take steps towards addressing and resolving the issues raised in the independent fire sa fety assessment conducted in 2002 rec 13 to ensure that the contract awarde d to the external party for fire protection and ambulance services covers all critical services required to safeguard property and staff members at the gigiri complex security and safety service sss in conjuncti on with procurement travel and shipping section ptss should ensure scoping exercise is undertaken prior to the renewal of the contract to procure fire protection and ambulance services to ensure that the contract covers as minimum all services identified as critical in that scoping exercise rec 14 44 unon accepted the recommendations oios notes the response and will close recommendation 12 upon receipt of details of the review of the adequacy of the current resources of staff mbers and fire fighting equipment and details of the arrangements for the regular inspection of fire fighting equipment b recommendation 13 upon notification of the arrangements to train all fire and safety team staff members sss security officers and key unon staff members on fire fighting technique s and fire prevention and the steps taken to address and resolve the issues raised in the independent fire safety assessment conducted in 2002 c recommendation 14 upon receipt of th outcome of the next contract renewal exercise in 2006 10b building marshals and floor wardens 45 oios is of the opinion that the fst shoul d maintain central register of every building marshal and floor warden within the gigiri complex the training they have received to date and the training required to keep their knowledge of fire safety up to date furthermore as the fst are reliant on buildi ng marshals and floor wardens to disseminate information to all united nations staff mbers the fst should monitor whether the building marshals and floor wardens are carryi ng out their duties as detailed in the annual fire service presentation recommendation to ensure all building marshals and floor wardens are held accountable in safeguarding united na tions property and staff members security and safety service sss should ensure that central register of every building marshal and floor warden is maintained to determine at any time which staff members have completed the training provided in the annual fire service presentation furthermore this should also include mechanism to monitor whether the building marshals and floor wardens are adequately carrying out th eir duties and feature to record feedback on the briefings and training required rec 15 46 unon accepted the recommendation which would be implemented by the end of 2005 oios notes the response and will close the recommendation upon receipt of copy of the register of training for building marshals and floor wardens special investigations unit siu 47 ga report a58708 report of oios on stre ngthening the investigation functions in the united nations stated that the arra ngements for the conduct and follow up of investigations needed strengthening during the course of the audit oios noted formally approved guidelines or procedures dictating the protocol for receiving complaints andor inquiries conducting investigations issuing reports nor following up of reported complaints andor inquiries b investigators were hired as secur ity officers and then reassigned to siu based on possessing previous experience in investigative work whilst appreciating the rationale oios is of the opinion that it would enhance the standing of the siu if officers assigne d to siu were either recruited directly against specific criteria or we re subject to additional testing and training prior to being assigned to such duties c siu had inadequate systems to mainta in accurate records of all complaints andor inquiries investigations repor ts issued and follow up action taken and d investigative training by the inves tigations division of oios had been provided to selected sss staff but the lessons learnt from that training were not adequately disseminated to all sss staff recommendation to ensure security and safe ty service sss unon has professional special investigations unit sss should refer to the ga report a58708 report of oios on strengthening the investigation functions in the united nations and in consultation with oios 11investigations division develop guide lines dictating the protocol for receiving complaints conducting investigations issuing reports and following up on reported complaints as well as recruitment and training of investigators and tracking and main taining an accurate record of these complaints rec 16 48 unon commented that it would approach dss to discuss whether this issue was going to be addressed centrally or whether sss should approach oios directly oios thanks unon for the additional information and will close the recommendation upon notification of the outcome of discussions with dss f security strengthening projects project implementation status 49 in his report a56848 of 28 february 2002 th secretarygeneral presented set of proposals for strengthening safety and security which included the following projects for unon installation and improvement of gates and barriers b installation of perimeter alarm system and fence c increase in perimeter lighting d installation of closed circuit tv and control room equipment installation of public address and fire safety systems f installation of conference preregi stration area at the visitors pavilion including the extension of the local area network to reach the site and g installation of laminationglazing ma terial on the glass surfaces of window in the visitors pavilion and the main gate 50 ga resolution ares58295 6 b st ates time frames for the completion of the various projects proposed in the report of the secretarygeneral a58756 as well as determinations as to which organizational its are responsible for their completion since both section 27g originally stated as section 29g in a58756 and section 33 expenditure was covered in a58756 the above mentioned statement is to be applied to any procurement related to the project strengthening the security and safety of united nations operations staff and premises 51 unon expensedcommitted us726700 against the initial appropriation of us535000 the difference being met by dditional appropriations in 2003 and 2004 these increases arose mainly in respect of project above for variety of reasons including achieving compliance with hmoss nd changes in specification and design furthermore due to inadequate monitoring and lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities of all parties involved only project g was fully implemented at the end of 2004 12 b management for security strengthening projects projects planned completion date actual completion date reasons for delay installation and improvement of gates and barriers the target date was not determined june 2004 for hardware installation material cost escalation caused shortage of funds for which additional fund of us320400 was approved for completion installation of perimeter alarm system and fence the target date was not determined phaseone nov 2003 phasetwo june 2004 delay was caused due to substandard delivery by the contractor and inadequate monitoring by unon roles and responsibilities of the various parties involved were not adequately clear for overall coordination which is central feature of project management to ensure all interlinkages are fully understood and optimized budgetary control was vested with bfms together with nyhq the sss security and safety service was ultimate project owner the actual implementation of the work was to the sss support services service based on contracts conducted by procurement unit with joint monitoring responsibility by bgmu building and ground management unit and sss the lack of adequate coordination arrangement hampered prioritization of various projects and monitoring of the project and financial performance oios also determ ined that this lack of adequate project management arrangement attributed to the delays in implementing the construction projects installation of closedcircuit tv and control room equipment the target date was not determined the original amount of us138900 was allocated for this project in 2002 and subsequently increased by unon to us17160000 the delay has been caused by combination of factors namely the allocation of insufficient funds the requirement for thorough site survey and revisions to the global assessments hence the project was put on hold and included in a59448add 2 report of the fifth committee for the general assembly at its 59 th session this submission has been postponed pending reevaluation by undss unon is currently undergoing procurement action to utilise both these funds and
