has preclearsound versions of these tapes please check the others and post differences statement of purpose our purpose is to promote religious freedom and the scientology religion by spreading the scientology tech across the internet the cof abusively suppresses the practice and use of scientology tech by freezone scientologists it misuses the copyright laws as part of its suppression of religious freedom they think that all freezoners are squirrels who should be stamped out as heretics by their standards all christians moslems mormons and even nonhassidic jews would be considered to be squirrels of the jewish religion the writings of lrh form our old testament just as the writings of judaism form the old testament of christianity we might not be good and obedient scientologists according to the definitions of the cof whom we are in protest against but even though the christians are not good and obedient jews the rules of religious freedom allow them to have their old testament regardless of any jewish opinion we ask for the same rights namely to practice our religion as we see fit and to have access to our holy scriptures without fear of the cof copyright terrorists we ask for others to help in our fight even if you do not believe in scientology or the scientology tech we hope that you do believe in religious freedom and will choose to aid us for that reason thank you the fz bible association shsbc11 renum 11 9 jun 61 reading emeter reactions reading emeter reactions lecture given on 9 june 1961 based on clearsound only thank you okay lets see this is the 9th of june 1961 saint hill briefing course and you have had bulletin today or you should have had says something to the effect i think sarcastic snide asking you if youre waiting for the emeter to play dixie and i expect almost anybody at any minute to say were waiting it to play god save the queen but im quite happy about it actually in and in fairly exuberant frame of mind with regard to it because i found out whats taking you so confounded long to clear people and theres general misconcept abroad and it although its taken up in this bulletin which is what the 8th hcob 8 june 61 youre auditing peoples analytical minds out thats right i mean this sounds incredible but thats what youre trying to do and you know youre not going to shoot any ducks if you keep going around shooting at crows well its true isnt it huh i know ive left you in little bit of mystery but that is what you are doing dianetics modern science of mental health 1950 we change all the time we change all the time except were always dealing with the same fundamentals all were doing is changing an approach to the same fundamentals now i say we change all the time sarcastically because somebody is always walking up to telling us how fast we change and how we are changing and all that sort of thing and i say what have we changed lately oh well what have we changed lately um come on what have we changed lately uh well um weve changed the axioms the one thing that hasnt been changed for years and i find out they dont know enough about the subject to know whether its been changed or not which is always good test if somebody tells you that now what we are doing is trying to approximate exactly what the mechanics which are already known to us about the mind how these things are stacked up in peoples minds so we get common denominator of approach and of course it gets simpler and simpler but were always handling the same mechanics so lets get back to very fundamental fundamental here and lets take look at this thing called the reactive mind now i know youre all sitting there burning with questions about other things but im interested in this today and that is the reactive mind the reactive mind is mind which acts without inspection on the basis of stimulus in other words when this mind is restimulated it acts without inspection its noninspection mind do you understand and it puts into actions solutions for problems it fancies must exist but which may well never have existed or which havent existed for billions of years and you put in any part of the old problem and the reactive mind goes into solution its sort of an idiot simplicity so it is mind that solves problems without inspection its taken up pretty well in dianetics modern science of mental health only thing much weve changed about that book is the second part of the book which has to do with how we address this situation and heavens how we addressed this situation in old dianetics still is raising its ugly head lately weve got presession 38 which i havent authorized anybody around here to use but what is that but book one and weve got all kinds of ramifications on the same fundamentals so heres this mind without inspection all right its pretty good you know it doesnt have to make an inspection see thats the first thing thats wrong with the situation so therefore it reacts on anything it inspects got the idea so the inspections are kind of accidental because its based to work without inspection of course everybody knows that this is the safest thing to do thetan is trying to survive who doesnt find any necessity for trying to survive at all which is the first idiocy you couldnt possibly kill thetan you could degrade him submerge him make him unable and do various things like this or he could do these things to himself but he couldnt possibly not survive so the first thing it is doing is trying to solve problem which doesnt exist the survival of thetan doesnt exist so therefore it immediately relegates itself to the survival of form or the perpetuity of an existing state if you cant keep thetan from surviving you certainly however could keep form surviving couldnt you but if you kept form surviving what you would have is perpetuation of existing state which would of course take out all the time all the matter all the energy and all the space in sensible arrangement and garblize them why all right the reactive mind is the accumulated goals of survival of the individual for forms and that is exactly what the reactive mind is thats its more complicated than that its goal is survival in each case you see now the reason it destroys is because its trying to get something to survive you got the idea see trying to get self to survive so it destroys other see but its still survival it creates something in order to get form to survive even though youve got create and destroy and even though you have cycle of action the reactive mind is that part of the cycle of action which is never going to move and never has according to any understanding or activity in which man has engaged in all the time he has been on this planet why because the keynote of it is survive survival of form theres question about the survival of thetan oh theres question of the survival of his capabilities theres question of survival of his happiness theres question of survival of whether or not hes interested theres question of all these things but these are significances as far as his actual survival is concerned hell be here till the universe fades out even though hes only crumb of sullivan i mean sand got to be careful of who i have overts on here anyhow now here then is this enigma you have mind that is trying to make something survive which is already dead its gone man its gone the body you had back there on the galaxy of gee whizzes that man that hadnt been that form hasnt been around for long time go back and look dig up the old scrapheap where they threw the factory workers and you wont find anything there anymore except memory touching isnt it but the reactive mind because it was trying desperately you see to make that form survive once has never forgotten the impulse thats pretty good because the impulse is survive then the reactive minds impulse regarding that action is surviving you see and it hasnt any more use to you you could remember this dont you see if you didnt have to make it survive but by remembering it because of the impulse of survival being so great in that particular area you get restimulation as though youre still in the period as though youre still there why because all the impulse of survival is trapped into that period and area but it has been riding on up to the present time heres the great game of makebelieve the form has lived forever and is still here what game of pretense you see well the accumulation of these pretenses with all of their attendant recordings and nostalgia wind up in present time having nothing to do with the situation anywhere but in order to guarantee the survival of this doll you lost back in the galaxy of gee whizzes it is perfectly obvious that you have to do something about gorillas well this is difficult because there just dont happen to be but about 450 of them left theyre the united nations officials now anyway they thats something on that order there are very few gorillas left and so the reactive mind has great starvation for gorillas which can make this thing survive so woman walks down the street with fur coat and fellow has feeling in his head of small machinery going around only because its all by inspection you see the safe thing to do is to act without thinking because you never know whats going to happen to form the surprises have been multitudinous so if you just act quick enough the datum is if you just act quick enough why the form goes on surviving but if you well if you could just duck bullets give you an idea see an ambition of this character every time somebody fired bullet at you in war or something like that if you acted quickly enough of course you would never be hit i know thats idiotic but so is the reactive mind yet sometime or another youve had an ambition of that character youve said i wouldnt ever have airplanes run into if i ducked every time i thought there might be an airplane in my vicinity well this gets embarrassing particularly when youre in basements see its if youre going to get form to survive you mustnt wait until you look over the name rank and serial number of the aircraft you see the thing to do is duck actually i knew naval officer he has only one creditable action in his whole existence and that was he actually did identify an american fightercraft that was coming back in over the fleet and it had been mauled up and it was making it all right it was trailing smoke and he did identify it and he did restrain at the last instant his people from firing at that aircraft he did restrain them the aircraft was shot down by the next ship in line but that was creditable action and i i wish to assign it to him it shows you that not all men are all bad but this was very unusual for him to do such thing which is why it stands out in my mind its almost incredible for the man to ever have inspected anything yet he did in this particular case but the safe thing reactively to do is of course shoot at an aircraft without inspection well when fellows get all gingered up by war theyre liable to do things like this actually the only thing wrong with wars is you put weapons in the hands of men and get them marching around some of those guns will go off and somebodys liable to get hurt and thats the only thing wrong with war otherwise theyre fine so there was little dutch corvette and it had escaped from java when it was abandoned by the associated allied admirals union and they had to work overtime so they abandoned it anyway this little corvette escaped well i myself was in sort of gingery frame of mind and had very often gone clang when in approaching american harbors the local fighter command or torpedo boats would use you for target practice and they all were under orders that in view of the fact there were ships around of the enemy that they should fight ours and they would take practice dummy runs on every ship that was coming in and they were under orders to do this it was almost enough for ship to be coming down the fairway for the fighter command to leap into their cockpits tie their girls stockings or was that another war and go screaming off down the runway and go dummy runs on you you know and youd have to hold your cap on on the bridge you see and the funnel would go eeuengh and so on and i used to object to this rather considerably because id been over in in the south pacific early in the war and it made nervous and i was getting reactive on the subject you see not as reactive as bunch of officers i went down to meet one day who had just come in from that area an aircraft passed over their landed aircraft on the airport and they were on american soil you see and every one of them threw himself face down on the concrete alongside of the airplane of course there were all the people at the airport thought this was silly which it was because it was in the wrong time and place but it was just reaction you see well anyway this little dutch corvette comes steaming up the line in miami and whole squadron of american torpedo bombers say well thats what were supposed to do and they jump in their cockpits and tie their girls stockings around their necks or whatever it is and go screaming down the runway up into the sky and start practice run on this dutch corvette and of course they got met right in the teeth with everything the dutch corvette had well at least part of the air force had baptism of fire by the way the united states government couldnt do anything about it at all they spoke to the dutch corvette and the dutch corvette said captain said ve have jus come out of war uns you go running against us you gonna get shot at thats it and the corvette was provided with air cover all the way up the atlantic seaboard clear to new york to warn off torpedo bombers and things that might make runs on it they kept it spotted much more carefully than they were looking for the deutschland it was dangerous now their reactivity of course has come up to total insistence its come up to total identification of all aircraft with enemy aircraft you see because the safe thing to do is not inspect obviously if you sat around in enemy waters you know and the lookout he sees an aircraft in the distance and he walks back to the phone and he picks up the phone and he said give the captains orderly and the orderly comes to the phone he said id like to speak to the captain if he isnt busy captain i dont wish to disturb you but i have spotted something up in the sky im not sure what it is would you like to come out and have look captain says well im going to finish cup of tea here and ill be up of course they would have been dead by that time never would have had chance so instead of that they jam time you get the idea and the jam of the time finally results in noinspection see what happens so any aircraft in the distance gets shot at until i think i was the first one across the pacific after the declaration of war in ww ii in an unarmed merchantman and we were running like hare before the wolves and one day one day there was terrible alarm and wed managed to haul some antitank guns out of the hold and mount them in sandbags and i dont know what they could have done but it was very interesting anyway and kept the morale up and we had couple of lewis guns that id put in action nobody on board knew how to operate the things and it was quite it was quite good and all of sudden there was tremendous screaming rush up on the boat deck and everybody was gesticulating at the sky and the lewis gun goes off with low snarl and antitank guns start banging so i went up to find out what was happening and they point up at the sky and the bridge meantime is madly trying to communicate with the boat deck out of communication totally nobody would listen to the bridge and finally i spot this thing i couldnt figure out what they were shooting at they knew they were shooting at an enemy aircraft and theyd seen it circle and it was circling the only difficulty was in the tropics venus is totally visible in daylight and they were shooting madly at the planet venus and the bridge had already figured out what they were doing and was trying to tell them madly that that was venus being seamen they have their own goddesses here was totally reactive situation of course the safe thing to do was shoot obviously well thats how far off it can go so one day this part of the reactive mind which has been trying to keep doll surviving on the galaxy gee whizzes from being destroyed by gorillas gets whiff of fur coat and goes into total action takes over right as out of that moment youve got an emergency situation instantly youve got gorillas in the vicinity and its better not to inspect even people who turn around and really inspect things are very often amongst the wounded and dead so what what are you going to do it means that when you speed up things in the universe to too great degree on the false basis that you are prone to nonsurvival but in the interest of keeping something surviving you are then going to run into this timeless reactivity of action without inspection infinite dedications to the survival of forms and patterns this is why goals sop works so beautifully and why when you start to take goals off somebody they start nulling you think offhand well gee whiz im taking all this fellows goals away from him you see or something of that sort well youre auditing the wrong target youre auditing the guy now of course youre actually auditing toward the guy in order to free him up from reactivity so there actually your auditing target is the reactive mind that is your auditing target not the pc and as long as you go on busily auditing thetan called pc exclusively as the thing which monitors what youre doing youre going to continue to make mistakes and not clear people thats all because you never look at whats wrong with him youre only auditing what he knows the only thing wrong with him is what he doesnt know and what he doesnt know is totally contained in the reactive mind and there is inspection involved so he cant see what is wrong with him and if he could see what was wrong with him it wouldnt be wrong would it all right lot of things stem out of this first and foremost you think that reaction probably to your question may take place in the next several minutes you sit and look at an emeter and wait for it to react and of course the reaction which you have to wait for is something the pc knows and the reaction which you get instantly is in the reactive mind and itll occur in something on the order of tenth or even hundredth of second it starts to occur instantly that you enunciate it because youre more in control and more able to restimulate the reactive mind than the thetan whose reactive mind it is why because every time its restimulated it blanks something out the noinspection factor arises well youre not being blanked out by his reactive mind so therefore you can think on these subjects and he cant unless you have total case duplicate between the auditor and the pc the auditor can always see more of what is going on than the pc can you take in pcs adjudication or what pc thinks about something as any indicator of what you ought to do at any time and you of course are always going to waste auditing time and youre always going to do the wrong thing inevitably and invariably itll be the wrong thing if you want to do all the wrong things then listen to the pc because hes under tyrannical dictatorship known as the reactive mind which knows best because it now has in it all the individualities which he has tried to make survive and all of them know best so one of his basic goals although he knows its very bad for him is to make his reactive mind survive so even though this fellow will sit down and be audited this is peculiar and the peculiarity which resolves around this he wont let you near any part of the reactive mind that ought to be audited gluahgluahgluahgluah because those parts are the survivals so it dictates that he let them survive so hell always throw you red herring and after youve accumulated several warehouses full of red herring you have also wasted an enormous amount of auditing time because youve never audited anything that should have been audited on the case and youve permitted to survive everything that should have been audited out of the case dont you see you listen to the pc you listen to the pc about whats flat or what should be run or what he thinks about the situation and thats just write it over here in the loss column of auditing for you got nothing to do with the case nothing you can almost go on the basis if he says this is what the score is your immediate reaction can be that is certainly what it isnt aside from this basis of goals and checks against the emeter now the emeter can read the case why because everything that is surviving madly to be computed and go into action without inspection even though it doesnt apply anymore you see things like this can go into action if you go around and inspect things and turn around and look when youre running from stricken field you normally get speared so therefore its very very bad to look at the things that are pursuing you so you mustnt look at the things which are pursuing you so you had better prevent the auditor from equally getting in danger by looking at the things that are pursuing you something of that sort comes up there are all sorts of crisscross computations involved here but youre going on avoiding what is wrong with the pc quite unintentionally whats wrong with him registers on the meter but not on the person itll register on him secondarily now you can actually get something to register on the meter which then the person finds out about and then you get another reaction on the machine have you seen this happen you say gooseberries and the machine says tick and then you get surge of some kind or another whats that all about well the tick you found it in the reactive mind the surge the pc found out about it well you go on assessing for surges and running surges of course youre just going on auditing whats already known see youre just wasting time now if the pc doesnt find out about it after the tick you better audit it got it now theres another thing which makes this difficult and which has obscured your clear view of it and that is just this one little terrible factor withholdingness is important in auditing today because it happens to be the comm bridge between the reactive mind and the pc and when withhold comes out of the reactive mind the pc momentarily or rather continuously withholds too in other words he does what the reactive mind tells him to do so therefore if the reactive mind is withholding something it comes to the surface the pc will instantly withhold it so you ask somebody have you ever stolen any chickens and the thing goes tick only you didnt really see the first tick to amount to anything and then it goes whaam and then you say well did you ever steal any chickens and it now goes whaam and will continue going wham hes now under orders from the reactive mind to withhold well now withholdingness is part and parcel of survival all agencies of the law everybody else dramatize this rather astonishing fact what is the fellow doing when he is trying to protect himself by running from stricken field he is withholding body from the enemy isnt he hes withholding form now the withhold of the form the withhold of the form the withhold of the form from destruction dont you see is nonduplication you kill somebody theyre dead but the form youve got isnt dead so therefore you have to withhold the form youve got from duplicating the form that is dead dont you see so similarly somebody threatens to kill you you are very likely to threaten to kill them duplication is quite active you see but if somebody tried to kill you and you killed them during that whole period of your killing them youd have to hold your form from being killed do you see this which of course sets the mechanics going for survival and that actually is prior to the actual idea of surviving is withholding form or you could say surviving is coincident with it whichever way you want to figure it out but withholding form and surviving are blood brothers so withhold form you find the pc then withholding thought and the common denominator of the actions of the reactive mind are withhold which we see as onlyone chronic individuation there are just factors factors factors factors that weve added up through scientology all of which amount to withholding oneself withholding ones thoughts withholding ones actions and all of these things add up why because theyre dictate from the matter of survival and are probably theyre probably prior to survival and with survival and after survival and theres that little comm bridge and the comm bridge between the reactive mind and the pc is withhold so what the reactive mind is withholding if you click it the pc now withholds he dramatizes the reactive mind when he decides to give this up he has conquered the reactive mind to that degree in that hes not following its orders he ceases to be controlled by the reactive mind and starts to be controlled by living being so therefore he feels better when he gets withholds off this is the mechanics of it dont you see because the withholds add up to keeping him separated from the human race and when he gets the withhold off he rejoins it to that degree see how it stacks up so the pc can always be counted upon to dramatize the withhold after its been dredged out of the reactive mind even for an instant if only for an instant hell still dramatize it so you get click and then you get fall and if youre not being terribly observant you will see only the hard large fall thats when the pc knew about it dont you see actually the click was there instantly but now the pc knows about it well the secondary action is not to get the withhold off the pc but to keep the pc from dramatizing his reactive mind so we say what was that and if he doesnt tell us why he just is going on dramatizing this withhold it withhold it withhold it and eventually he says well maybe ill take very adventurous step and not do what i am always told to do and i will tell this auditor what it is and pow then it goes clean on the meter so at the state of withhold youve got pc who is reactive the pc himself as an analytical being is being reactive but that is the crossroads and thats the only point where he is being you got that otherwise hes talking to you fairly straight or at the dictates of the reactive mind early in case particularly if you kept on auditing the pc you would be something like auditing light bulb because you wanted to fix the generators in power station now you can go on auditing this light bulb and itll blink and flicker and youll say gee look what all im doing then all of sudden theres horrendous crash someplace and it goes out and you say well i failed well naturally youre going to fail youre auditing light bulb and youre trying to fix the generators in the main power plant well the thing to do is to go down to the main power plant and fix the generators and this tells you the name and address not only of the power plant but it also tells you very distinctly which generator and it tells you every part on the generator and its means of propulsion as long as you fly with your emeter flat youre all right and if you start flying with the pc flat youre just going on auditing light bulbs so its just going to take forever to clear somebody thats all ill give you an example now all of this is highly theoretical up to this point but let give you very practical example now were running this prehav scale assessment all right ill show you how to waste time in auditing see real good this is the way you can burn it up and audit those light bulbs and everything is wonderful see and you say well do you have faith in things thank you you get how much time that consumes just watching the emeter just watching the emeter watching the emeter what are you looking for are you waiting for it to play dixie because there isnt anything else going to happen you look here at your list and you see faith you dont say faith you take your eyeballs and you fix them on the needle very closely because its going to happen fast and you say not is the square root of the common denominator of the differential of faith you dont waste all that time you say now im going to say some lines here some levels and maybe ask you some questions about them and you dont have to answer you dont have to say thing just sit there and be comfortable all right thats fine thank you very much now were going ahead with this assessment okay faith cause effect effect obsessive canthave create think peculiar interest now look if youre sitting here doing this uh faith well you remind of small boy the day after the race waiting for the horses to go by you know its not only that its im not talking to you just about missing the flick on the needle im talking to you about expecting significant flick on the needle after youve asked the thing half second later if theres not going to be any flick on the needle there is now youre going to see this kind of thing occasionally theres flick on the needle and then clong theres drop well the flick on the needle is the reactivity thats what youre looking for so theres clong okay in joburg security check youd better say what was that because youve got another activity going now youre not doing an assessment by the joburg youve got that have you ever stolen chickens and you ask them have you ever stolen chickens and nothing happens and you say well okay have you ever stolen chickens you suspected maybe there was flick there the first time maybe it was couldnt see it maybe you ask him second time you get click and then surge and you say what was that he knows about it now the clicksurge routine has put it from the reactivity into the analytical sphere now to keep the pc himself from dramatizing reactivity youve got to get him to tell it to you but it hasnt anything to do with the assessment of the question as to whether or not the questions hot now you get something thats actively being withheld from you and it doesnt wait after you say what was that to go click again you say have you ever stolen any chickens wham have you ever stolen any chickens wham have you ever stolen any chickens wham have you ever stolen any chickens wham and you say brother youd better tell about that of course you are actually assuming that by this time he knows about it well really he does of course i conduct security checks much differently than you do youre very happy to go along and buy garbage you ask guy question you say to him have you ever raped any chickens and whatever the question is and he says well and you notice theres flick on the meter and all of sudden it does surge you say what was that see he knows by now the surge says he does youre longer assessing the reactivity of the question now youre assessing the knowingness of the pc but youve got to get it off its another operation now that youve got it out of the reactive mind to him now youve got to get it from him to you so you say what was that and he says well i remember my father killing chickens when i was little boy and you say all right all right you say have you ever raped any chickens but i dont say that thats your notion i believe these things i believe these meters see ive used them long enough to be made very very tame by the whole thing you know i know what to say and when to say so i say well did you ever rape any chickens click boom i say what was that and he says well my father uh my father uh uh used to kill lot of chickens used to kill lot of chicken i say id say you didnt hear the question did you you ever rape any chickens oh well he says yes if you put it that way yes i used to when i was little boy you dont do it that way you havent been doing it that way at all you say did you ever rape any chickens he says my father killed some chickens one time well good did you ever rape any chickens and the meter falls and you say well what was that and he says well i was just thinking about chickens hanging up in the market and that was what that was in other words you keep buying this buying this buying this buying this buying this buying this you get the idea youre actually building the pcs belief up that he can withhold things from you so i say i say very meanly i dont necessarily advise you to do this because you can get into lot of trouble this way youve got to have terrific control of the pc in order to do this kind of thing hes really got to be grooved in otherwise you create arc breaks and the rest of the session is all messed up and you get nothing done anyplace anywhere at any time so thats your adjudicative idea how much control have you got of this pc and how much control have you got of the session and if your control is terrific and your arc with the pc is very good and the pc knows what youre trying to do and he knows he cant fool you you eventually get security check going like this youve started in this way you said well did you ever rape any chickens and he said well my father killed some once and uhwell i saw dog jump on chicken the next time you ask him you know did you ever kill any chickens and he says well i i did you ever rape any chickens and where wuh i dunno uh yes uh yes i remember something about chickens it was little boys talking about chickens one time and you say good good fine good did you ever rape any chickens and he says well i thought about it once and you say good thank you fine your meters falling falling falling youre just wasting time wasting time wasting time well if youre real good you dont go at it this way at all you say did you ever rape any chickens and you get clickfall surge and you say what was that and he says well i was just thinking about uh mmmm i was just thinking about uh i was thinking about my father used to kill some chickens you say i asked you did you ever rape any chickens well actually my little sister come on come on come on come on did you you you ever rape any chickens thats what im trying to find out here he says yeah yes i used to when i was little boy you say good did you ever rape any chickens all right its clear now good next question get the idea and he all of sudden has got the horrifying notion that there you just arent going to buy dodges thats all coo he has met tartar and the reactive mind after that is longer as powerful the reactive mind says protect it says its withhold its valuable youre in danger give him an equivocation got the idea feed him some muck over here and throw him red herring and protect so i just say it says here that rape of chickens i think i think even suzie has heard say questions like this it says here that rape of chickens has occurred now supposing you tell about it huh yes thats the end of that security question got the idea so it goes off boom questionbang questionbang questionbang you see get the idea you ask the question see the fall you notice theres secondary surge now you do the other thing say tell the reactive mind says under circumstances tell him withhold withhold withhold withhold and i say i say all right but you can tell and all of sudden the pc says he believes in one way or the other and ill tell him right here right now bang and he tells you and the needle clears and you ask the question again just to make sure and then you ask the next question and then youre sailing you understand goals you dont ask goal i want to pick gooseberries is the goal that youre checking you come down the line find this thing and you say well now im going to ask you about goal here youve already run through 200 goals see im going to ask you about goal here and i dont want you to think im terribly personal but i want to know if this goal is i want to know if this goal is still active the goal is is it all right if i read it to you all right uh okay well im going to read it to you now you want to pick gooseberries hows that now lets see now lets see what its saying over here on the meter boy thats the way to burn auditing time man youre going down the list preliminaries nothing you just say i want to pick gooseberries i want to ride horses you got the idea you got the list over here youve got the meter in front of you what you really do is you look at the goals list it says i want to pick gooseberries you dont read it there you delay your own read of it you look over here at the meter and you say i want to pick gooseberries and it goes flamp you say good i want to pick gooseberries flamp good i want to pick gooseberries its going more now you say good thank you mark it here two divisions go to the next goal i want to ride horses nothing there i want to ride horses nothing there next goal got the idea if you watched doing this stuff youd think you were looking at sausage grinder you just chew right up see right on down the line well the longer you suppose that pc is going to be adjudicative it about it at all or his adjudicativity proves only that he reacts according to the dictates of tyrant known as the reactive mind in order to protect and not disclose the valences in other activities which exist without his inspection so that he as form can survive and it doesnt work out you cant go at it that way at all i i talk with the emeter about the fellows circuits and if he wants to chip in once in while thats all right with thats its okay i wont chop him hell say well i just i just remembered something i just remembered about riding horse across field as little boy and the horse picked up stone and i say well here we go and i say gee is that so thank you and at first he begins to believe i couldnt possibly be auditing him well im not im finding out whats whats holding the show up here im finding out what hes reacting to im finding out what is there to react in terms of matter energy space time and thoughts which are all crisscrossed in one way or the other and suspended in time so that thought two billion years old is still being violently thought in this persons mind why this person is perfectly capable of inspecting this person cant do otherwise than survive this person is capable of being totally able this person can get the show on the road this person can actually make form survive but because hes got all these dependent mechanisms and googahs and things of this character and reactive mind to help him out and pat him on the back and make it unnecessary he acts like nut and he destroys everything he lays his hands on well dont you think its about time you straightened it out well all right itd be easy to straighten it out all you have to do is validate the pc thats for sure after youve cut him to ribbons why look up and say well youre doing all right thank you very much you know but you can saw into these assessments with whir and clank with your eye pinned right there to the needle and away you go and you go right on down the line bangetybangetybangetybangetybang its like telegraph poles passing by when youre riding in train you know and it isnt well here we are well well isnt this unusual now im going to consult with you all about your reactive mind now what do you think you possibly might be having to run now what do you think that might be well youre talking to the wrong telephone line youve got it hooked into the wrong you might have it in the right switchboard but you sure got it in the wrong corner of the building now theres an example in this bulletin of of an assessment that could have been bought merely because the pc believed it and you were getting cognition curves surges off of it see it could have been bought i didnt say that the auditor would have bought it or anything of the sort but there was another one that was alive and these were order command and conquer and that conquer was alive man and thats what i was looking for on the case i said weve missed something here someplace somewhere along the line we have missed one and thats why i wanted to assess the case and this person was perfectly agreeable and knew completely that it was order or command but these were the little red tabs that were hanging out and they cleared up and it was one the pc didnt mention now the pc did report because hes in pretty good shape as i was doing the assessment which i was still taking just the emeter he said i just keep thinking about control i keep thinking about control i said thats fine thats fine thats cooperative data youre being helped by the pc but i bought the emeter i went over everything and settled everything down and it was control so i bought it you got the idea i didnt buy it because he said so but he helped out by saying that he could just as easily have been throwing great big red herring across the path too it it he might have said my you know sort of down deep someplace the one thing i dont want to have anything to do with is failed importance see reactivity you know so he just as likely would have said well its connect im sure its connect got the idea if i can just tell him convincingly enough that its connect you dont find pcs doing this when theyre in better condition but when theyre in worse condition they will do this continually its connect it obviously is connect hes trying desperately reactively not to get anywhere near failed importance when pc starts getting too insistent that it is something and is practically screaming that it is something i know very well whats happening the mechanics and the all of the various little wheels and so forth that are going around are adding up just this there is something here that we had better not put our numbertens in because its quicksand and itll go straight through somebody tells well i dont want to run this level anymore this levels boring and i dont want anything more to do with this level and and all of that kind of thing i say how interesting isnt that fascinating of course im perfectly reasonable about it i dont get militant on the subject i say has the pc got withhold which is very likely running these things these days as i told you the withhold is the bridge between the reactive mind and the analytical mind so of course pc picks up withhold half an hour later you find the pc with an arc break thats by the way the way it goes they get the withhold on the auditor and the auditor misses it and then theyll pick up an arc break and then the auditor will try to cure up the arc break when in fact its this withhold back here half an hour earlier all arc breaks by the way for your information usually occur half an hour before theyre expressed by the pc if youre sharp you can always see that an arc break has occurred but earlier than that if youre very sharp you can see that withhold occurs and you just bust into your auditing command and say now how are you doing hows it going hows it going now all right havent got any arc breaks youre not looking for an arc break see withholding anything clang you say what was that well i havent answered the auditing question for ten commands oh you say all right give ten answers you dont necessarily say that but you sure as hell could and ive been known to do things like that anyhow what youre trying to do is keep the pc from being fooled about himself and if you are in continuous consecutive forever and ever avoidance of the reactive mind youre just qandaing with the pc youll eventually wind up doing something like this and this is the ne plus ultra of qanda youre doing joburg all right you say now have you ever thrown any rings around chimneys and the pc says youve gotten your click and then your surge see very often on an assessment you get good read which then disappears well actually it was just the cognition surge when the energy released you know that was withholding it from the pc and the pc found out about it and so on of course you get needle response but its usually after the fact of the needle reaction on the reactive mind that after the fact is the pc finding out see so these latent surges that you get on the emeter are analytical ordinarily all right he says well yes yes mmhm ive thrown some rings around chimneys i threw ring around chimney when i was little girl uhm i i did i i did that and um my grandmother was very cross with about it im showing you qanda now see and you say good why exactly was your grandmother cross with you and she says well id been very bad and i treated my grandmother very badly or something like this and the auditor says well just where was that where did you live at the time what the hell does this have to do with joburg see its got nothing to do with joburg its trying to run an incident with using the excuse of the joburg the joburg is totally dedicated to withholds and thats everything its dedicated to and there isnt anything else its dedicated to and you want to know if he threw any rings around chimneys and he finally you you said you throw any ring around chimneys you get clink surge you say what was that and he says well i as matter of fact i did i i did i did yes i i just remembered i i did i threw some rings around chimneys when i was little boy and you say good throw any other rings around chimneys clang and you say good well what was that well when i was young man i used to do it all the time and you say good now did you ever throw any rings around chimneys clink just little clink on it that time and then surge and you say what was that and he says whewww well i actually didnt mean to get down to this but every night about midnight i have to go up and throw ring around the chimney and i thats it and you say all right thank you very much good now did you ever throw any rings around chimneys deader than mackerel next question see youre just interested in withholds and youre just interested in that question now youll get some oddball ramifications on questions you get some oddball ones where hes got everything connected with everything connected with everything you understand if you dont get any instantaneous response youre not getting response on that question why are you fooling with the question now the order is clear the emeter but what is the emeter and what is the emeter doing that you must clear well the emeter is responding what is the emeter responding on the emeter is responding on reactivity if you havent got reactivity to hell with it because the second time you ask the question if the pc now knows it analytically youll have it reactive anyhow itll be an instant read if youre not getting instant reads or something the pc is dawdling around and walking over the hills and so forth of course i will go ahead and clean up meter on question rather thoroughly but it isnt necessarily falling on the question if youre getting latent surge all the time you say did you ever throw any ring around chimneys and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 and 9 and surge you say what was that well i dont know its sort of escaped my mind now oh this is not the time to say what has escaped your mind did your grandmother spank you that day what was the color of your brothers hair this is not the time the time to say that is the original question it turned on and will become kind of response after while so lets ask the original question whatever it was you ever done any illicit diamond buying and watch that meter and if it doesnt go snap that isnt it isnt falling on that in other words your emeter actions are as instantaneous as the reactive mind is batty you got it theyre fast see theyre right now of course if you get any kind of fall of any kind whatsoever even latent fall you had better find out what it is by asking what was that but that is pursued by asking the question again and if you dont get fall on the question why are you interested in the latent fall you can go ahead and clear it up if you want to its good workmanlike job if you do but that isnt necessarily whats going on here at all theres something else going on someplace well youre doing the thing of trying to read the question to the pc and then trying to clear the rest of the security check as sideline it clears one question at time and if it doesnt fall on that question it doesnt fall on the question when is the fall going to occur on that question well it might not occur on your first read but thats beside the point itll certainly occur instantly on your second read instantaneous within tenth of second of your having uttered the question there will be reaction on the meter and if theres not reaction on the meter but latent reaction that is finally going bthooong after several seconds or something like this yeah the pc is withholding something of some kind or another about something but lookahere its not necessarily on that question at all and thats the mistake youre making you see you can actually read joburg off brtrtrtrtrtrtrt right on down through all ten pages you see and take instantaneous falls plang what was that nuhhhh yes i did you say good thank you repeat the question reaction now if you sat there and waited for the emeter to play dixie you might get fall on almost anything see you might get fall on the fact that he was getting bored that he was getting tired that he hopes he doesnt find out he knows the joburg hes had it about four times and he knows theres question coming right up on the next page that is hotter than pistol and hes guilty as actually hes never thought of it before but it just suddenly occurred to him that it wasnt quite the right thing to do to hit his father and mother on the head with an axe and its just occurred to him like flash of lightning on the head and the question that has to do with this is on the next page so youve read the question now the pc gets to worrying about the next page and you get an answer in the meter here which is reading the surge of the pc you got the idea it isnt on that question the law is if you dont get an instantaneous reaction on the meter theres something wrong with the question it isnt the answer to that question if you get any kind of reaction on the meter at all you ask the question again of course if you dont get reaction on the second time it still isnt it dont sit there and wait for it to play dixie you dont have to hang around on the street corners leaning up against the lamppost hoping something is going to happen the town youre operating in isnt that onehorse if you want things to happen in auditing do them rapidly so that you do get something happening and youll get something happening with speed so your assessments do not take in the zone and area of the pcs analytical mind unless of course the pc is being very resistive now hes being very resistive about withhold well thats between you and the pc you got the idea thats another operation has nothing to do with finding it on the meter or anything of the sort its still on the meter youve found it now it is reacting on the pc well you just say stand and deliver what is it and you could go on and clear eightynine other questions with the pc of one character or another but it isnt falling on the one youre asking you got the idea so clear what youre doing now similarly on an assessment it requires cooperation on the part of the pc at all actually the pc could be walking around the room if he could do that and hold on to the electrodes and if you were speaking loud enough the pc would hear reactively what you were saying because its dangerous and youd get reaction on the meter and you think you have to wait for the pc to think about it or the pc to rationalize about it thats not true you dont want anything to do with that its very its very happy fact that he can still think were glad hes still alive cheerio but thats about all it has anything to do with it and nothing else has anything to do with it all right ive given you very long lecture today as i am prone to do and should start them earlier on fridays but ive been studying for some time why it takes so long for something to happen and ive now done enough observation that i can tell you that it isnt slight thing of speeding you up so that your actions are more coordinated or something its gross youre auditing the wrong target see youre auditing the pcs analytical sphere of action and that isnt what you should be auditing at all youre supposed to be auditing the reactive sphere as long as youre auditing the reactive sphere it shows up only on the meter and it shows up instantaneously and thats what you bite right away pang and you get the job done now im not asking you to rush i dont care how leisurely you go about the job of auditing but just audit the right target which is the reactive bank of the pc dianetics modern science of mental health published may 9th 1950 thank you end of lecture
