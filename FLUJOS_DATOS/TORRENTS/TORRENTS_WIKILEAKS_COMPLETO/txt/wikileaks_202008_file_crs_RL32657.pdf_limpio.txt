types of immigrationrelated document fraud that may facilitate an aliens entry into or continued presence within the united states are criminal offenses the following sections discuss the primary criminal statutes covering immigrationrelated document fraud many of which are overlapping in coverage with civil statutes prohibiting immigrationrelated document fraud 22 in addition to these statutes number of other criminal statutes can potentially be used to prosecute aliens for document fraud in certain circumstances23 further persons may be held criminally liable for aiding and abetting or conspiring to commit such offenses24 g5g155g146g150g146g151g138g149g561g18g142g151g138g149g157g146g142g156g561g158g151g141g142g155g561g11g16g3g561g535g561g344g349g346g5g561 besides imposing civil penalties for immigrationrelated document fraud ina 274c also includes criminal penalties for those who prepare or assist in preparing fraudulent immigration documents for fee or other remuneration more particularly failure to disclose role in the preparation of falsely made application for immigration benefits may result in fine andor imprisonment for up to five years as well as being prohibited from preparing or assisting in the preparation of any other such applications in the future 25 subsequent offenses are subject to fines and imprisonment for up to 15 years26 21 unlawful presence is only criminal offense when an alien is found in the united states after having been formally removed or after departing the united states while removal order was outstanding ina 276 8 usc 1326 22 the assessment of civil penalty for document fraud probably does not prevent the federal government from seeking criminal penalties as well see hudson v united states 522 us 93 1997 double jeopardy clause of the us constitution protects only against imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense and civil remedy statutes will generally not be implicated unless civil sanctio ns are so punitive either in purpose or effect as to transform what was clearly intended as civil remedy into criminal penalty noriegaperez v united states 179 f3d 1166 117274 9 th circ
