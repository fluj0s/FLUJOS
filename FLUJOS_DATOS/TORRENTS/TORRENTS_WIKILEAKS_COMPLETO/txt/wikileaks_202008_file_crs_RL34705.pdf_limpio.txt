system offsets have the potential to provide considerable cost savings and other benefits however offsets have generated considerable controversy primarily over the concern that illegitimate offsets could undermine the ultimate objective of cap andtrade program emission reduction an offset is measurable reducti on avoidance or sequestration of ghg emissions from source not covered by an emission reduction program an estimate of the quantity and type of offset projects that might be available as compliance option would provide for more informed bate over the design elements of cap andtrade program it is difficult to timate the supply of offsets that might be available in capandtrade system becau the supply is determined by many variables including mitigation potential mitigation potential estimates are the raw data that feed into models estimating offset use in capandtrade program r ecent estimates contain considerable uncertainty policy choices the design of the capandtrade system would be critical to offset supply particularly relevant design choices include which sources are covered which types of offset projects are allowed whether or not offset use is limited and the degree to which setaside allowances are allotted to activities that may otherwise qualify as offsets policymakers treatment of international offsets would play major role economic factors the development and market penetration of low andor zerocarbon technologies would likely have substantial effects these technologies could lower the costs of the capandtrade pr ogram making fewer offset projects cost effective emission allowance price the allowance price would determine the supply and type of offsets that would be economically competitive in capandtrade system as the price increases more nd different types of projects would become cost effective allowance price estimates are difficult to predict as they are dependent on numerous variables including offset treatment other factors nonmarket factors such as social acceptance may influence offset use in addition information disse mination would likely be an issue because some of the offset opportunities exist at sm aller operations such as family farms several studies have generated estimates of offset use within defined policy framework although the studies absolute values should be viewed with skepticism relative differences generated by varied offset scenarios may be instructive to policymakers for instance the results indicate that international offset treatment ie whether or not they are allowed and to what

the role of offsets in greenhouse gas emissions capandtrade pr ogram potential benefits and concerns by jonathan l ramseur 3 in this way offsets would complement the more traditional emissions trading that can occur between two covered sources for exampl covered source eg power plant can make reductions beyond its compliance obligations and then sell these reductions as credits to other covered sources this type of transaction represents the trade component of capandtrade program potential offset supply in capandtrade program introduction if congress enacts greenhouse gas ghg emission reduction program such as capandtrade system the treatment of offsets would be critical design element for example epa found that different offset scenar ios eg unlimited offsets versus offsets generated significant variances in capandtrade program costs1 however offsets have genera ted considerable controversy primarily for the concern that illegitimate offsets c ould undermine the ultimate obj ective of capandtrade program emission reduction2 an estimate of the quantity and type of offset projects that might be available would provide for more informed debate over the design elements of capand trade program an offset is measurable reducti on avoidance or sequestration of ghg emissions from source not covered by an emission reduction program from climate change perspective the location of the reduction avoidan ce or sequestration does not matter ton of co2 or its equivalent in another ghg reduced in the united states and ton sequestered in nother nation would have the same result on the atmospheric concentration of ghgs if capandtrade program includes offsets covered sources would have the opportun ity to purchase them to help meet compliance obligations3 offset projects vary by the quantity of emission credits they could generate and the implementation complexity they present in general agriculture and forestry activities offer the most potential but these projects often pose multiplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34705crs2 4 s 2191 was reported out of the senate committee on environment and public works december 5 2007 several agencies and other interested stakeholder groups conducted economic modeling of the legislation some of th studies are used in this report because they represent the most recent analysis of effects from federal capandtrade program implementation challenges this may create tension for policymakers who might want to include the offset projects th at provide the most emission reduction opportunities while minimizing the use of offset projects that pose more implementation complications or ve the potential to be invalid what is capandtrade system capandtrade system would create an overall limit ie cap on ghg emissions from the emission sources cove red by the program covered sources may vary but are likely to include major emitting sectors eg power plants and carbonintensive industries fuel produ cersprocessors eg coal mines or petroleum refineries or some combination of both covered entities that face relatively low emissionreduction costs would have an incentive to make reductions beyond what is required because these further reductions could be sold ie traded as emission credits to tities that face higher emissionreduction costs instead of making internal re ductions or purchasing credits from other covered sources capandtrade program ma allow parties to purchase offsets as compliance option the emissions cap is partitioned into emission allowances typically one emission allowance represents the authority to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxideequivalent tco2e in general policymaker s may decide to distribute the emission allowances to cove red entities at cost based on for example previous years emissions sell the allowances through an auction or use some combination of these strategies at the end of each established compliance period eg calendar year covered sources woul d be required to surrender emission allowances to cover the number of tons emitted if source did not have enough allowances to cover its emissions the source would be subject to penalties how many offsets would be availabl as compliance option if congress enacted capandtrade program the first section of this report addresses this question by discussing the multiple variable s that help shape offset supply the second section discusses estima tes of offset use within the policy framework of the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 s 21914 factors affecting offset supply it is difficult to estimate the supply of ffsets that might be available in cap andtrade system because the supply is determined by many variables including policy choices figure 1 illustrates the various inputs nd variables that would affect the potential supply of offsets in cap andtrade program these factors mitigation potential policy choi ces economic factors emi ssion allowance price andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34705crs3 other factors are each discussed below as figure 1 indicates the factors do not act in isolation but interact in complex manner source prepared by crs mitigation potential mitigation potential is not synonymous with potential offsets supply figure 1 some of the activities included in mitigation potential estimates would not qualify as offsets in capandtrade system st riking example is biofuel production which is projected by some studies to play substantial role in ghg mitigation in later years capandtrade programs emission allowance price is expected to increase biofuel and biomass production for exampl if power plant substitutes carbon intensive fuel eg coal with less car bonintensive fuel eg biomass such as switchgrass the plants ghg emissions w ould decrease these emission reductions would be counted directly by the power plant the increased biofuel use would mitigate ghg emissions but would not count as an offset in capandtrade program because the reductions from the fu substitution woul d be made directly by covered sources mitigation potential estimate s are often used as inputs for other economic models for example epas 2005

agriculture 2005 at httpwwwepagovsequestrationgreen house_gashtml 7 epa greenhouse gas mitigation potential in us forestry and agriculture 2005liebermanwarner climate security act of 20085 both of these analyses generated estimates of the number and type of offsets that would be used by covered sources for compliance purposes however these offset supply timates are potentially flawed because the underlying data mitigation potential estimates are rife with uncertainty elements of uncertainty estimates of mitigation potential are derived by assigning price for ghg emissions and sequestration under an epa 2005 model6 for example landowners would receive pa yments for increasing sequestration and reducing emissions and would make payments for increasing emissions or reducing sequestration as with all models the mitigation pot ential simulations include numerous assumptions including behavioral responses to economic incentives and disincentives for example actors g farmers in the 2005 epa model are assumed to have perfect foresight perfect foresight assumes that agents when making decisions that allocate resources over time eg inve stments know with certainty the consequences of those actions in present and future time periods7 epa recognizes that this assumption which the agency states is used by most of the climate economic modeling co mmunity does not reflect reality the use of this assumption likely yields an overestimation of mitigation potential in reality market participants make imperfect judgements and leave so financial opportunities on the table mitigation potential models must necessarily include certain technical assumptions such as land availability and sequestration rates of various activities different models often use different underlying assumpti ons to generate results indeed there is often disagreement within the modeling community particularly for forestry sequestration simulations ove r the use of various modeling inputs in addition to the above limitations wh ich are generally inherent to some degree with all economic modeling the next two subsections discuss elements of uncertainty that are particular to agriculture and forestry activities competition for land use critical factor for agriculture and forestry mitigation opportunities is land availability more projects would become economically competitive as the emission allowance price rises at certain price levels one mitigation ac tivity may replace another for example agricultural soil sequestration projects eg conservation tillage practices are expected to present costeffective opportunities at relatively low prices as the allowance price rises afforestation projects are expected to beco 1 cost effective in more places andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34705crs5 8 this is because afforestation can generate more co2 sequestration per acre than soil sequestration 9 the federal government promotes biofuel pr oduction through range of mandated fuel use tax incentives loan and grant programs and cer tain regulatory requirements arguably the most significant federal programs for biofue ls have been tax credits for the production or sale of ethanol and biodiesel however with the establishment of the renewable fuels standard rfs under the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 congress has mandated specific level of biofuels use this leve l was significantly increased with the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 for more on these incentives and other policies see crs report rl33572 biofuels incentives summary of federal programs by brent d yacobucci2 more cost effective than ongoing soil sequestration activities8 thus lands that once generated soil sequestration while growing traditional commodities may be replaced with afforestation projects tree farms other activities preserva tion recreation fuel production may compete for limited land resources some activities eg biofuel pr oduction discussed further below may preclude options for resource use such as traditional crop production or afforestation in other cases more than one practice that redu ces or sequesters co2 may be possible for example conserva tion tillage may be conduc ted in concert with biofuel production it is very difficult for most modeling tools to keep track of these competing or compatible activities althoug h some models may have the capability to account for some of these interactions thus diffe rent analyses will produce varying results related factor is that land uses change over time for example changes in product demand seed use cultivation technol ogies and importa ntly regulatory or financial incentives can influence land us andor crop choice as discussed in the following subsection biofue l policies provide striking example of this type of development biofuel production in this discussion biofue ls include alternative energy sources in both the transportation sector eg ethanol corn based or cellulosic and biodiesel and the electricity sector eg biomass such as switchgrass biofuels are likely to play substantial role in determining the mitigation potential of other agriculture and forestry projects because biofuel production is expected to strongly compete with other mitigation ac tivities for land resources indeed the 2005 epa study projected that biofuels w ould outcompete other ghg mitigation options in later years around 2030 and at higher carbon prices by contrast in 2015 epa estimated that biofuels would account for 12 of the mitigation portfolio and only at prices above 30 however the 2005 epa mitigation model did not include the most recent federal policies that curren tly influence biofuel producti on and the land base it uses9 in 2005 congress established renewable fuels standard rfs under the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 the rfs ma ndated specific level of biofuels usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34705crs6 10 see crs report

part 2 mitigation opportunities february 2007 at http wwwageconagohiostateedu resourcesdocsbrucemccarlpaperpdfin transportation fuels this level was significantly increased with the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 these new policies may affect mitigation potential in several ways first the mandatory biofuel pr oduction levels may re quire land resources that could be used for other mitigation activities such as soil sequestration or affore station second the required production levels may stimulate growth in infra structure relating to biofuel use in the transportation sector this may increase demand which could lead to increased production above the required threshold of biof uels for the transportation sector it is unclear how the new federal policies would affect the mitigation potential for biomass in the electricity sector with mandatory thresholds in place biofuels for transportation could reduce the acreage av ailable for biomass production however federal renewable portfolio standard r ps requiring percentage of electricity generation from renewable energy10 could alter the calculus estimates from agriculture and forestry activities in recent years several studies including separate reports from epa 2005 and usda 200411 have produced estimates of mitigation potential from agriculture and forestry activities these study results vary as epa stated the differences can be expected based on differences in the models and assumptions embedded in the estimates in some cases estimates of comparable categories vary substantially table 1 for example epa estimates dramatically greater mitigation potential for soil sequestration activities usdas lower overall estimate for soil management activities is comparable to more recent estimate that was produced by mccarl in 200712httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34705crs7 mitigation potential estimates in context it may be instructive to compare the mitigation potential estimates with current sequestration levels emissions caps and offset quantity limits from recent legislative proposals the agriculture and forestry sector s currently sequester approximately 810 mtco2e per year epa inventory of us greenhouse gas emissions and sinks 19902005 2007 in 2015 the missions cap in s 2191 would be 5456 million emission allowances each allowance equals 1 mtco2e several of the proposals would limit th use of domestic offsets in some fashion s 2191 for example would allow covered sources to use domestic offsets to satisfy up to 15 of th covered sources allowance submission however the calculation is not simp ly 15 of 5456 mtco2e by allowing domestic offsets and international credits to satisfy separate 15 blocks of the allowance submission the cap could effec tively represent 70 of actual emissions permitted at covered sources for instance if there was only one covered facility in the united states and it emitted 7794 mtco2e in 2015 the facility could be in compliance with the cap by submitting 5456 million allowances 1169 million tons of domestic offsets and 1169 million t ons of internationa l credits however if the covered source does not use either compliance option to the maximum level ie less than 15 the calculation is ltered for example if covered source does not use any international credits domestic offsets would be limited to 963 million tons the calculation is further complicated by covered sources ability to bank emission allowances for submission in subsequent years although the estimates include high degr ee of uncertainty and are outdated for various reasons discussed above the estimates may be informative in some capacity for instance the estimates indicate the relative differences between offset supply and offset type by price and time regardless of the differences in absolute values between the epa and usda models both agencies results demonstrate the influence of price moreover both models indicate that afforestation activities may provide more mitigation potential than carbon soil sequestration table 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34705crs8 table 1 epa and usda estimates of mitigation potential for

yet have not been implemented because of the existence of nonmonetary barriers14 these are discussed below in other factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34705crs10 15 for comparison of capandtr ade proposals see crs report rl33846 greenhouse gas reduction capandtrade bills in the 110th congress by larry parker brent d yacobucci and jonathan l ramseurthe fact that parties are not acting in the most economically efficient manner at 0mtco2e calls into question the estimates for higher emission allowance prices this demonstrates the uncertainty contained in mitigation potential estimates policy choices policy decisions from congress us st ates and foreign governments would directly and indirectly aff ect the supply of offsets in capandtrade program the primary factor would be the design of the capandtrade system other policies would also help shape the pool of offsets that could be used for compliance purposes these policy choices are discussed below design of the capandtrade program programmatic design elements could affect offset supply in several ways from the overall structure of the cap eg which sources are covered to specific gistical details eg monitoring and measuring protocols anot her critical element would be the programs use of set aside allowances scope of the cap the wider the scope of the cap the smaller the offset universe in other words as more source categories are subject to the cap the fewer the number of uncapped sources thus the num ber of eligible offset project types decreases for example s 2191 would not cover n2o emissions from adipic or nitric acid production whereas s 1766 b ingamanspecter would include these emissions under its cap15 eligible offset types policymakers may choose to restrict the types and locations domestic versus international of offsets eligible for use by regulated entity for example some capandtrade proposals in the 110th congress would allow wider range of biological questration activities th an other proposals biological sequestration genera lly offers the most potential but these projects present substantial challenges in addition the degree to which international offsets are allowed would have considerab impact on domestic offsets offset protocols the protocol established for measuring and verifying offsets would affect supply more st ringent protocol would likely reduce supply offsets that are questionable for instance in terms of their additionality would likely be excluded or discounted also re ducing supply additionality determinations ie would the project have happened an yway typically require some subjectivity in the decision process protocol with more constraints could remove some of the subjectivity which if left in place could lead to an influx of questionable offsets some protocols may include more conservative parameters for measuring tons of co2 sequestered for particular project type for example one protocol may stipulate that carbon saturation for given pl ant or tree species occurs in shorter time frame thus fewer offsets woul d be produced through the projecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34705crs11 16 for more information see crs report rl34502 emission allowance allocation in capandtrade program op tions and considerations by jonathan l ramseur 17 for example methane reduction from landfills is generally considered more certain offset than methane reduction from rice cultivation see lydia olander designing offsets policy for the us 2008 nicholas institute for environmental policy solutions 18 the number of setasides in the asreported version of s 2191 is different from the version s 3036 that included the revenue neutral amendment 19 epa epa analysis of the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 2008moreover the stringency of the protocols would likely affect the costs of developing implementing and verifying an offset project these costs might be described as transaction costs for exam ple protocol that required independent thirdparty verification would entail higher costs for offset projects if transaction costs increase the number of costeffective offset projects would decrease the proposed and enacted systems of m easurement and verification vary in many cases legislative proposals direct vari ous agencies to develop the protocols in these cases the level of protocol stringency would be uncertain at the bills passage setasides if the capandtrade program pr ovides setaside allowances for specific activities these activities would be removed from the potential supply of offsets several of the capandtrade proposals from the 110th congress would give emission allowances seta sides to noncovered tities to promote various objectives including bi ological sequestration16 setaside allowances are taken from within the cap so if the setaside allowances do not lead to further emission reductions abatement or sequestration the cap remains intact indeed one strategy for policymakers is to allot setasides for activities whose emission reductions abatement or sequestration may carry more uncertainty than other potential offset activities17 however project that receives setaside cannot also qualify as an offset thus setaside allowances woul d reduce the pool of offsets available for compliance with the cap in some of the recent proposals setasid would substantially reduce the offset pool for example s 2191 as reported18 would set aside the following emission allowances in 2012 289 mtco2e 5 of total allowances for domestic agriculture and forestry emission reduction sequestration projects and 58 mtco2e 1 of total allowances for landfill and coal mine methane projects actions in other nations or us states as other nations or us states establish emission controls or climaterela ted policies the pool of offsets would shrink international offsets particularly in the devel oping nations are projected in models to provide numerous opportunities for compliance19 however these projections assume that these nations are decades away from requiring ghg emission reductions or other regulations eg technolog standards that would exclude these projects as offsets httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34705crs12 20 see crs report rl33812 climate change action by stat to address greenhouse gas emissions by jonathan l ramseur 21 see http wwwarbcagov cclandfillslandfillshtm 22 for information on these matters see crs report rl34489 climate change costs and benefits of s 2191s 3036 by larry parker and brent d yacobucciclimaterelated polic ies in us states may also ffect offset supply number of states have taken actions th at directly address ghg emissions20 for example 23 states have joined 1 of the 3 regional pa rtnerships that would require ghg or just co2 emission reductions state or re gional emissions cap might cover more sources than federal program thus di squalifying emissions from these sources as potential offset opportunities however it is uncertain how these state actions would interact eg whether or not they woul d be preempted with federal apand trade program regardless of whether state and regiona l emission caps are subsumed into federal capandtrade program other state policies could play role for example california is developing methane emission performance standards for landfills21 if this policy is finalized methane capture from california landfills would not be available to qualify as offs ets in federal program other policy influences policies not directly related to capandtrade program could also affect the potential s upply of offsets comprehensive review of policies that could affect offset s upply is beyond the scope of this report however several federal po licy options stand out as mentioned above congress has enacted energy legislation requiring certa in levels of biofuel use in transportation sector this policy affects the amount of nd potentially available for agriculture and forestry offset projects if enacted by congress federal renewa ble portfolio standard rps may affect offset supply federal rps would s timulate the producti on of biomass for electricity generation as discussed above biomass for electricity generation would not qualify as an offset but would instead compete with other offset projects for land resources economic factors the potential supply of offsets would ultimately be aff ected by how the economy responds to federal capandtrade program such complex analysis is beyond the scope of this report22 critical factor is the development and market penetration of low andor zerocarbon technologies these technologies could lower the costs of the capandtrade program federal policies g funding or tax incentives could stimulate these technologie s if these technologies are available earlier than predicted by models the emission allowance price discussed below would likely decrease making fewer offset projects cost effective httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34705crs13 23 offsets could potentially be design element of carbon tax regime as well 24 epa epa analysis of the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 2008 25 epa global mitigation of nonco2 greenhouse gases p 123 2006emission allowance price the supply and type of offsets availa ble would be largely dependent on the emission allowance price in capandtrade system23 the market price sometimes referred to as the price of carbon of tradeable emission allowance would be influenced by several factors discussed above the central factor would be the structure of the emission re duction program par ticularly the programs scope which sources are covered and stringency t he amount and timing of required emission reductions in addition to the core structural sign of the capandtrade program the allowance price would be dependent on the programs treatment of offsets which types would be allowed whether internati onal offsets could be used whether covered sources would be limited eg as percentage of their allowance submission in their use of offsets indeed epas analysis of s 2191 as reported indicates that different offset treatments yield the greatest range in emission allowance prices for example if the use of domestic and international offsets are unlimited the emission allowance price would be 71 lower than under the aswritten conditions of the bill24 the supply of offsets would fluctuate as the allowance price changes if the allowance price is relatively low ie 1 to 5mtco2e only the lowhanging fruit projects would be financ ially viable if the allowance price is higher more offset projects would become economically competitive it is impossible to predict with confidence what an allowance price would be in capandtrade system although multiple studies have provided through economic modeling estimate s of allowance prices under the proposed capand trade regime that would be created by s 2191 the liebermanwarner c limate security act of 2008 the results vary considerably among studies for more information on these issues see crs report rl34489 climate change costs and benefits of s 2191s 3036 by larry parker and brent yacobucci other factors an epa study stated that other nonpr ice factors such as social acceptance tend to inhibit mitigation option installation in many sectors25 for example farmers engaged in dairy operations for many generations may be hesitant to convert their land to forests even if this would be the most profitable use of the land in addition institutional factors have been obs erved in the forestry sector which was initially expected to play much larger role in the cdm report from the intergovernmental panel on c limate change ipcc stated that although the forestry sector can make very significant contri bution to lowcost mitigation

change costs and benefits of s 2191s 3036 by larry parker and brent d yacobucci 29 in particular the soil sequestration estimates in epas 2005 study are dramatically higher than estimates produced by usda in 2004 and more recent analysis in 2007 mccarl bruce agriculture in the climate change and energy price squeeze part 2 mitigation opportunities 2007 30 eia stated in its analysis of s 2191 that it applied the same methodologies and data continuedwill to implement and has resulted in only small portion of this potential being realized at present26 two other factors that may limit or slow offset s upply are information dissemination and transaction co sts discussed in subsequent section many of the emission abatement and sequest ration opportunities particularly in the agricultural sectors may be widely di spersed and under the control of relatively small operations eg family farms similarly many of the agriculture and forestry offset projects may present technical challenges dependi ng on requirements to measure emissions and verify projects to generate offset s at these locations parties would need to know that opportunities exist and are financ ially viable based on the carbon price in addition the smaller operations may need technical support in order to initiate measure and verify the projects offset use in capandtrade program several studies including sepa rate reports from epa and eia27 have generated estimates of offset use within defined policy framework the capandtrade program that would be established by s 219128 although the absolute values should be viewed with skepticism relative differences generated by varied offset scenarios may be instructive to policymakers the absolute estimates of offset use in the epa and eia models are inherently flawed at least for the agriculture and forestry sectors because both models used epas 2005 mitigation potential estimates as underlying data as discussed above this underlying data is outdated and embedded with its own uncertainty29 epa and eia use different economic models with different underlying assumptions in their s 2191 studies fo r example epa and eia make different adjustments to the mitigation potential data which provide the foundation for offset estimates for its model of s 2191 eia reduced epas mitigation potential estimates by 2530 arguably the value of the adjustment factor is somewhathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34705crs15 30 continued sources described in its evaluation of s 280 the climate stewardship and innovation act of 2007 the 25 adjustments are described in eia energy market and economic impacts of s 280 the climate stew ardship and innovation act of 2007 2007 31 the relationship between allowance price and offset supply is complicated because they are interrelated eias lower allowance prices may be partially explained by the agencys treatment of the underlying mitigation potential data 32 in its study epa used two separate computable general equilibrium models applied dynamic analysis of the global econom adage and intertemporal general equilibrium model igem the 15 offset threshold was reach in 2015 with adage and 2017 with igemarbitrary but eia explained that it accounts for various obstacles eg unidentified costs information diffusion and social acceptance that were not reflected in the mitigation potential data epa did not make similar adjustments in the studies core scenarios the agencies models yielded different estimates for emission allowance prices emission allowance price is key factor in determining offset supply in 2015 epa estimated an emi ssion allowance price range of 2940 eia estimated pr ice of approximately 2131 as one may expect the different models and underlying assumptions led to different estimates of offset use and in particular when the 15 offset limitation imposed by the bill would be binding epa estimated that the separate 15 thresholds on domestic offsets would be binding almost immediately in 2015 or 201732 the eia model estimated that the 15 limitation would not be binding until 2025 although the absolute values provided by the studies of s 2191 contain large amount of uncertainty the relative differences yield some insights because the epa and eia analyses of s 2191 both use ep as 2005 mitigation poten tial estimates the relative differences eg relationships between emission allowance price and offset quantity and type that were observed in mitigation potential are also seen in the s 2191 analyses for example higher allowance prices make more offset projects and different types of offset projects economically competitive however higher allowance prices may make other mitigation activities such as biofuels for electricity more competitive as well an additional insight provided by the s 2191 analyses is the impact that international offsets have on domestic supply epa mode led scenarios with different quantity limitations for domestic and international offsets in the core scenario which matches the 15 limitations in the bill both international and domestic offsets are restricted to 15 of emission allowance submissions almost immediately figure 2 one may expect the combined offset use columns to demonstrate more of decline to coincide with declining emissions cap this is not observed in the model primarily due to the bills applica tion of the 15 limitation for offset use in s 2191 the 15 limit would apply to each covered sources annual allowance submission in which covered source mu st provide or surrender to epa an emission allowance for each unit of ghg emissions mtco2e generated in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34705crs16 33 in contrast the socalled boxer amendmen t samdt 4825 woul d limit offsets to percentage eg 15 for domestic offsets of the aggregate quantity of allowances under the cap in given year 34 by comparison in the offsets sc enario the allowance price is 160 in 2030previous year33 although the emissions cap would decline under s 2191 epa projects annual allowance submissions to remain fairly cons tant until 2030 largely due to the opportunity for covered sources to bank emission allowances and submit them for compliance in later years in an alternate scenario the use of domestic and international offsets is unlimited under this policy framework international offsets dominate and total offset use is considerably greater than under the core scenario however domestic offset use is substantially less than under the core scenario figure 3 although domestic offset use is unlimited fewer proj ects are developed because the emission allowance price increases at much slower rate under this scenario for example in the core scenario the allowance price is 83 in 2030 but only 24 in the unlimited offsets alternative34 the influx of unlimited international offsets keeps the allowance price relatively low thus fewer domestic offset projects are cost effective in third scenario figure 4 domestic offset use is unlimited while international offsets are restri cted to 15 of allowance submission in this situation domestic offset use not surprisingly is greatest but total offset use is well below the estimates in figure 3 as congress continues to discuss wa ys to address ghg emissions and the complex array of alternative approaches understanding the potential effects of offsets will provide for more informed debate the treatment of offsets is one of the more critical design elements for policymakers to consider when developing ghg emission reduction program such as capandtrade
