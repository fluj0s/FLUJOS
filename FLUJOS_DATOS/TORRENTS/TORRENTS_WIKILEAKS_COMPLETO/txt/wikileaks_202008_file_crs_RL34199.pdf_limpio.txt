germanys foreign and security policy conti nues to evolve some experts perceive widening gap between the global ambitions of germanys political class and an increasingly skeptical german public since the end of the cold war germanys relations with the united states have been shaped by several key factors these include germanys growing support for stronger more capable european uni on and its

introduction german chancellor angela merkel t ook office in november 2005 promising foreign policy anchored in revitalized transatlantic partnership since reaching low point in the leadup to the iraq wa r in 2003 diplomatic relations between the united states and germany have improved s ubstantially and the bilateral relationship remains strong during germanys sixm onth presidency of the european union eu in the first half of 2007 and its corresponding g8 presidency merkel has distinguished herself both as an advocate for strong u seuropean relations and as an internationally respected leader within europe with recent leadership changes in the united kingdom france and italy us officials reportedly view germany under chancellor merkel as key us ally in europe indeed despite continuing areas of divergence president bush nd many members of c ongress have welcomed german leadership in europe and have voiced expectations for increased german us cooperation on the international stage merkel is seeking to establish germany as partner on the forefront of multilateral efforts to address global security threats she has made concerted effort to improve the tone of usgerman dipl omacy emphasizing shared values and the need for broad usgerman and useur opean cooperation in the face of common security challenges the merkel govern ment has sought to increase transatlantic cooperation in areas ranging from economic and trade relations climate change policy and global counterterrorism and nonproliferation policy to peacekeeping reconstruction and stabilization in afghanistan the middle east africa and the balkans although us and german officials agree that cooperation has increased fundamental differences remain disa greement tends to stem from what many germans perceive as us indifference to multilateral diplomacy and standards of international law and what some in the united states consider german and broader european inability or unwillingness to take the necessary steps to counter emerging threats widespread belief that us policy in iraq has failed and even exacerbated global security threats appears to be fueling persistently negative german public opinion of us foreign policy and corre sponding skepticism of the exercise of military power in ddition to growing public disapproval of us influence in the world several other domestic factors coul d increasingly constrain merkel as she seeks to implement her atlanticist foreign policy agenda these include pressure to focus more aggressively on domestic econo mic reforms and growing tension within germanys grand coalition governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34199crs2 1 germanys first grandcoalition government from 19661969 was widely viewed as ineffectual and many observers have voiced similar

2008current domestic context merkel has led grand coalition government of germanys two largest political factions merkels christian democraticchristian social union cducsu and the social democratic pa rty spd since november 2005 this is only the second time in postwar history th at the traditionally opposing parties have ruled together1 after setting an electoral goal of 40 for september 2005 federal elections merkel and the cdu won 352 of the vote barely one percentage point more than the spd and three percentage points less than in 2002 elections the disappointing electoral showing fueled criticism of merkel within the cdu however public opinion polls suggest that both merkel and the cdu have since gained favor at the expense of their coalition partners2 observers attribute merkels initial nd somewhat unexpected popularity to her leadership in foreign policy and to the relatively strong performance of the german economy merkel gained high marks fro m her peers within europe and beyond during germanys sixmonth presidency of the eu in the first half of 2007 and its corresponding yearlong presidency of the g8 group of industrialized economies in addition rise in gdp growth from just under 1 in 2005 to about 25 in 2007 helped bring unemployment down from almo st 12 in the first quarter of 2005 to just over 8 at the end of 20073 these developments appear to have at least temporarily deflated pressure from within the cdu for merkel to pursue bolder economic reforms at home largely for these reasons most observers expect merkels governing coalition to hold until the next scheduled federal ections in 2009 however events suggest that if the spd continues to slide in opinion polls its leaders may increasingly seek to block cdu policy initiatives in an effort to distinguish the party from its coalition partners such political stalemate could revive criticism of merkel both from the left and from within the cdu and shift her attention away from pursuing foreign policy objectives to focusing on domestic i ssues and consolidating her hold on party leadership as one german commentator laments neither side can impose its will on the other resulting in gridlock and crippling germanys influence in the world4 there is also some indication that the spd may increasingly challenge aspects of merkels foreign policy which have heretofore enjo yed broad bipartisan support germanys foreign minister frankwalter steinmeier of the spd has consistently pursued foreign policy initiatives in unison with merkels positions nonetheless differences between the respective parties have emerged on issues such as turkishhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34199crs3 5 see for example wess mitchell germanys awakening washington times july 3 2007 6 white paper 2006 on german

respect to russia both coalition parties advocate strategic part nership however merkel appears to favor harder line than the spd and has openly criticized moscow for its treatment of nongovernmental organi zations and political opponents and for an increasingly confrontational energy and foreign policy the spd is thought to favor more conciliatory approach to russia mark ed by enhanced political and economic engagement some commentators view disagreement within the grand coalition on russia policy as an indication of the potential fo r broader domestic challenges to merkels atlanticist foreign policy5 the merkel governments 2006 national security strategy or white paper on german security policy recognizes the transatlantic relationship as the foundation of germanys and europes common security6 however german public opinion has become increasin gly critical of us influence in the world leading some to suggest that merkels efforts to strengthen relations with the united states could become more of political liability at home7 perhaps in reflection of this trend merkel has not been reluctant to express her opposition to especially unpopular aspects of us policy such as the incarceration of prisoners at guantanamo bay alleged us extrajudicial renditions of detainees in the war on terror and us climate change policy at the same time merkel who has widely reported deep personal commitment to forging stronger relations with the united states emphasizes that disagreements on sel ect policy issues should not threaten the overall partnership betw een the two

reform has provoked much criticism including from leaders in the united states14 however germany continues to view the as the onl organization capable of providing the international legitimacy it seeks in the conduct of its foreign policy an early indication of germanys postco ld war aspirations to assume greater global responsibilities has been its quest fo r permanent representation on the united nations security council former ch ancellor helmut kohl first articulated germanys desire for permanent security council seat in 1992 and received the backing of the clinton administrati on kohls successor gerhard schröder intensified calls for permanent german s eat but failed to gain international support in what some consider an indication of the merkel government s decision to soften its tone on the international stage german officials have ceased publicly calling for permanent german seat nonetheless german government documents state that germany remains prepared to accept gr eater responsibility also by assuming permanent seat on the security council and september 2007 pre ss reports indicate that merkel has asked president bush to support german bid for permanent

german foreign policy establishment was cautiously beginning to chart postco ld war course for the country today approximately 6500 german tr oops are deployed worldwide and germany plays leading role in diplomatic initiatives from the balkans to the middle east however what some consider too rapid shift in german security and defense policy has led to growing debate over ge rman national interests and the most appropriate means to realize them german politicians have nded to justify increasin g troop deployments and more assertive foreign and security policy by appealing to longstanding desire both to be considered credible global partner and maintain alliance solidarity16 some argue however that foreign policy built largely on the need to assume fair share of the multilateral burden and on notions of international legitimacy and credibility has obscured lack of domestic consensus on more precisely defined national interests this s become more apparent as german troops are deployed in riskier missions with less clear limits and mandates such as in afghanistan or lebanon increasingly germans are questi oning whether stated goals of alliance solidarity and credibility are worth the risks associated with military deployment or indeed whether such deployments run counter to other german interests such as commitment to pacifism in response calls for exit strategies and more comprehensive accounting of the goals of german foreign policy have grown some analysts and politicians primarily in conservative political circles argue that german leaders should be more willing to justify diplomatic and military engagement as satisfying na tional interests beyond those defined in the multilateral sphere others are skeptical emphasizing what they s ee as continued postworld war ii obligation to surrender degree of german sovereignty to such multilateral institutions and to avoid any action seen as satisfying unilaterally determined german interests germanys grand co alition

the end of the cold war german leaders have used the eu as the primary forum through which to forge more proactive role for germany on the international stage german foreign policy in the early to mid1990s was almost singly focused on fostering deeper european integration and eu enlargement to the east this focus strongly supported by former president george hw bush was widely underst ood as based in desire to quell fear of resurgent germany and to rep licate the benefits of west germanys post world war ii integration in central and eastern europe18 europes inability andor unwillingness to intervene to stem conflicts in the balkans in the early to mid1990s fueled calls within germany and other eu ropean countries for collective european foreign security and defense policy to some analysts merkels predecessor gerhard schröder embodied growing german desire to pursue german interests within the eu more assertively merkel has continued this trend also demonstrating willingness to forge more proactive role for germany within europe this growing assertiveness has at times put germany at odds with other eu member st ates causing some to question germanys longstanding commitment to european unity as is the case in several other eu member states german eu policy under merkel reflects much tempered enthusiasm for eu enlargement and skepticism of several aspects of european market in tegration on the other hand germany advocates deeper european integration in areas ranging from climate change policy to police and judicial coope ration and has assumed an in creasingly significant role in europes common foreign and security policy cfsp and european security and defense policy esdp germany was strong proponent of the proposed eu constitutional treaty rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 and merkel used germanys eu presidency in the first lf of 2007 to forge agreement on the outlines of new reform treaty aimed at enabling larger eu to operate more

nonetheless divisions with in germanys governing coalition over how to engage russia and the strong histor ical economic and energy ties between the two countries lead analysts to suggest that germany
