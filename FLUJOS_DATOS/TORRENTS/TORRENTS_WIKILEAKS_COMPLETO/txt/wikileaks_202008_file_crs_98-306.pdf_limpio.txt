senate valerie heitshusen analyst american national government government and finance division the senates presiding officer typically does not have responsib ility for proactively ensuring that matters under consideration comp ly with the rules instead senators may enforce the senates legislative rules and precedents by making points of order whenever they believe that one of those rules or preceden ts is or is about to be violated under some circumstances ruling by the presiding officer determines whether or not the point of order is well taken under others the senate itself decide s the point of order usually by majority vote for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgov productsguidesguidehomeshtml1 senate rule xx states in part that stion of order may be raised at any stage of the proceedings except when the senate is voting or ascertaining the presence of quorum and unless submitted to the senate shall be decided by the presiding officer without debate subject to an appeal to the nate the rule goes on to confirm that the presiding officer may submit any question of order for the decision of the senate points of order under most circumstances nator may make point of order against question whether it be bill am endment motion or something else at any time that the question is pending before the senate the primary exception arises when the senate is debating question usually an amendment or motion under unanimous consent agreement that limits the time for debating it under this circumstance point of order can be made until all time for debating the question has expired or has been yielded back while sena rules preclude deba on points of order themselves the presiding officer may by precedent entertain discussion at his or her discretion2httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98306crs2 3 assuming action has been taken on the amendment on which point of order has been laid the presiding officer may by precedent allow modification to the amendment prior to ruling on the point of order see riddicks pp 65 988 4 riddicks pp 5254 p 989 5 riddicks pp 716 736 6 riddicks p 725 under this circumstance only majority vote is required to

in most situations the presidin g officer rules on all points of order3 under two circumstances however the point of or der is decided by the senate first the presiding officer may in rare instances d ecline to rule and instead submit the point of order directly for the senate to decide by majority vote the presiding officer is most likely to do so when the procedural question has not arisen before and there is senate rule or precedent on which to base ruling second only the senate not its presiding officer is empowered to decide certain point s of order under rule xvi for example the question of whether an amendment to an appropriations bill is germane is usually submitted to the senate to deci by majority vote also by precedent if senator makes the point of order that the question pending before the senate is unconstitutional the senate must decide that question by majority vote if the presiding officer submits point of order to the senate to decide under either of thes circumstances it is subject to nondebatable motion to table or kill the ma tter which would dispose of the question permanently and adversely4 in any situation in which the presiding officer submits the question to the whole senate it is debatable under the re gular rules of the senate5 appeals in most cases rulings made by the presiding officer in response to points of order are subject to appeal when the presiding officer rules on question of order any senator who disagrees with the ruling may challenge it that senator rises and states mr president i appeal from the decision of the chair such an appeal usually is debatable though the senate may end the debate and dispos of the appeal by agreeing to motion to table or kill it which woul d uphold the ruling of the chair absent successful motion to table deba on the appeal is subject to extended consideration under the regular rules of the senate6 by precedent decisions of the presiding officer concerning recognition of senato rs are not subject to appeal7 in addition when the senate has invoked clotur rule xxii gives the presiding officer the authority to hold an appeal to be dilatory and therefore not in order also under rule xxii when the senate is operating under cloture point s of order and appeals are to be decided without debate after any debate on the appeal takes place the senate votes on whether the decision of the chair will stand as the judgment of the senate senators who support the ruling vote aye those who oppose it vote appeals usually are decided by simple majority vote threefifths vote of the entire senate 60 if vacancies is needed to overturn rulings by the presiding offi cer on most budget process points of order8httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98306crs3 9 in addition rulings on certain budget points of order require examination of estimates supplied by the senate budget committee which monitors the compliance of measures with the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended titles iix of pl 93 344 2 usc 601688 10 according to the majority leader who raised the point of order chair rulings or votes on appeal had previously subjected senseofthes enate and senseofcongress amendments to this germaneness requirement for appropriations b ills sen trent lott military construction appropriations remarks in the senate congressional record vol 146 may 17 2000 pp8283 8286precedents rulings by the presiding officer invariably reflect the advice that the senate parliamentarian gives based on his or her examinati on of how presiding officers decided similar questions in the past9 the presiding officer fo llows these precedents and in similar fashion new rulings become preced ents on which presiding officers will rely in the future by the same token when the presiding officer submits point of order for the senate to decide or when the senate decides poi nt of order by overruling the decision of the chair on appeal that decision of the senate also becomes guiding precedent in 2000 for example the senate determined throug h successful appeal from ruling of the chair that senseofthesenate or senseofcongress amendments to appropriations bills must comply with rule xvi regarding germaneness just as substantive amendments to appropriations must10 nevertheless although it is not unusual for senators to appeal the rulings of the chair the senate only rarely overturns the rulings of its presiding officer to routinely do so would undermine the continuity of senate rules and the consistency of rule interpretation essential to legislative work the most authoritative precedents are those established by vote of the senate itself rulings of the chair on which the senate does not vote are of so mewhat less probative value still weaker as preced ents are statements and opini ons by presiding officers in reply to parliamentary inquiries parliamentary inquiry is question posed by senator to the chair about the senates procedures or the current procedural situation the presiding officers reply is not ruling so it is not subject to appeal in addition successful motions to waive budget act point of order do not establish precedents successful motion to table would likewise not establish precedent because the senate would not have voted directly on the ques tion or appeal it could however have precedential value if it allowed ruling of the chair to stand for
