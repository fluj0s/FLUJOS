extend far beyond the borders of their city of license and in many cases extend beyond state borders under existing fcc rules which are intended to foster localism the licensees explicit public interest obligation is limited to serving the needs and interests of viewers within the city of license yet in many cases the population residing in the city of license is only small proportion of the total population receiving the stations signal hundreds of thousands of television households in new jersey outside new york city and philadelphia delaware outsi philadelphia western connecticut outside new york city new hampshire outside boston kans as outside kansas city missouri indiana outside chicago illinois outside st louis and kentucky outside cincinnati have little or access to broadcas t television sta tions with city of license in their own state the same hol ds true for several rural states including idaho arkansas and especially wyomin g where 5455 of television households are located in television markets outside th state although market forces often provide broadcasters the incentive to be re sponsive to their entire serving area that is not always the case this report provi des for each state detailed countybycounty data on the percentage of television households located in television markets outside the state and whether there are any instate stations serving those households the nielsen designated ma rket areas dmas also often extend beyond state borders local cable operators are requi red to carry the broadcast signals of television stations located in their dma if they are located in dma for which the primary city is in another state and most or all of the television stations in that dma have city of license in the other state then the broadcast television signals they must carry will be primarily or entirely from out of state in some cases they may not be allowed to carry signals from within the state but outside the dma to provide news or sports programming of special interest in their state b ecause of network non duplication syndicated exclusivity or spor ts programming blackout rules or because of private network affiliation contract ag reements or may be discouraged to do so because these signals do not qualify for the royaltyfree permanent compulsory copyright license for local broadcast signals the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act of 2004 expanded the scope of instate television signals that satellite operators are permitted and in some cases required to offer subscribers in addition to the signals of those broadcas t television stations with city of license within the dma in which the subscriber is located localintolocal service satellite operators may offer subject to certain restrictions signals from outside the dma if those signals are significantly viewed by those households in the subscribers geographic area that only receive their broadcast signals overtheair not via cable or satellite in addition satellite opera tors may offer certain subscribers located in new hampshire vermont mississippi and oregon certain instate signals from outside the subscribers dma and

many members of congress receive comp laints from constituents that the news information and even entertainment tele vision programming available to them does not address the needs and interests of their local community these constituents question for example why th ey cannot receive local news programming that focuses on the issues of importance in their locality or state or the football games of their state university sometimes desired progra mming cannot be provided because of private contractual network affiliation agreements between broadcast networks and local broadcast station affiliate s but at other times desired programming cannot be provided because the geographic boundaries of broadcast signal contours audience viewing patterns and governmental jurisd ictions do not confor m with one another as result methodology for allocating broadcast spectrum or for constructing rules about which viewers broadcasters programming must serve or which signals cable and satellite operators must or may carry will meet the needs of all viewers or communities for example millions of us televi sion households are located in the same metropolitan area as major city but across state lines from that city some of those households will have str onger affinity for programming that focuses on issues relevant to the major city others will have stronger affinity for programming that focuses on relevant state issues using either metropolitan area hubs or state borders as the basis for determining the programming obligations of stations whose signals reach beyond city borders and state borders will inevitably disappoint some househol ds with or without government intervention it is inevitable that some viewers and some communities will feel their needs and interests are not being met at the same time it may be possible to make the existing statutes and rules that affect the television programming available to consumers more flexible in order to foster the provision of television programming that better meets the needs of local communities the purpose of this report is to explain how existing statutes and rules affect the television programming available to consumers and to discuss potential ways to foster the provision of television programming that better meets the needs of local communities each broadcast television license is assigned community of license in the form of specific city most broadcast television stations viewing areas extend farhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs2 1 47 usc 534 each cable system also is required to carry the signals of certain qualified local lowpower television stations 47 usc 534 and certain qualified local noncommercial television stations 47 usc 535 lowpower television lptv service was created in 1982 to provide opportunities for locallyoriented television service in small communities these communities may be in ru ral areas or may be individual communities within larger urban areas lptv stations are not considered fullservice stations and have secondary spectrum priority to fullservice st ations this means lptv stations must not cause interference to the reception of existing or future fullservice television stations must accept interference from fullservice stations and must yield to new fullservice stations where interference occurs lptv stations are limited to an effective radiated power of 3 kilowatts for stations operating in the very high frequency vhf spectrum band and 150 kilowatts for stations operating in the ultra high frequency uhf spectrum band see footnote 11 for brief explanation of the di fferences between the vhf and uhf spectrum bands 2 nielsen media research identifies televisi on stations whose broadcast signals reach specific area and attract the most viewers according to nielsen dma consists of all counties whose largest viewing share is given to stations of that same market area non overlapping dmas cover the entire continental united states hawaii and parts of alaska there are currently 210 dmas throug hout the us httpwwwnielsenmediacom faqdma_satellite20servicehtm viewed on january 9 2008 very small number of counties are divided between two dmas typica lly because topographical features such as mountains split the viewing patterns within the county in addition there are several very sparsely populated portions of aska that are not part of an county and not included in any dma each year nielsen reassigns small number of counties to different dmas based on shifts in viewing patterns for example in 2003 nielsen reassigned 24 counties to different dma beyond the borders of their city of licen and in many cases extend beyond state borders the local broadcast television stations that each cable system must carry are determined by the nielsen designated market area dma in which the cable system is located in the 1992 cable act congress amended the 1934 communications act to require subject to certain exceptions each cable system to carry the signals of all the local full power commercial television stations within the same television market as the cable system with that market determined by commercial publications which delineate television markets based on viewing patterns1 the dmas represent the only nationwide commercial mapping of television audience viewing patterns each county in the united states is assigned to television market based on the viewing bits of the residents in the county2 since viewing patterns are more closely aligned with the economic markets in which households participate than with state boundaries some counties are assigned to dmas for which the primary city is in different state in dma that straddles two states with the major city and most of the broadcast stations located in one state the cable systems in the other state may find th at few or none of the broadcast station signals they must carry are from their own state

that might have originated nearby but outsi the subscribers dma4 as result in many situations those subscribers to satellite service who were located in dmas in which all the broadcast television stations are in another state typically because the primary city in the dma is in another state could not be provided the signals of any instate local broadcast television stations5 shvera expanded the scope of instate television signals that satellite operators are permitted and in some cases required to offer subscribers in addition to the signals of those broadcast televisi on stations with city of license within the dma in which the subscriber is located satellite operators may offer subject to certain limitations signals from outside the dma if those signals are significantly viewed by those househol ds in the subscribers geographic area that only receive their broa dcast signals overtheair not via cable or satellite6 in addition under shvera satellite operators may offer certain

located in dmas for which the primary city is in different state it identifies for each statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs4 10 the television cable factbook 2004 was published in april 2004 and thus does not include stations that have begun operation in 2004 as explained later in this report the industry currently is in the midst of c ongressionallymandated transition from the analog transmission of broadcast signals to digital tr ansmission while most licensees had already begun transmitting digital as well as analog signals prior to 2004 many licensees began dual transmission in 2004 and those new digital transm issions are not reflected in the data and hence not reflected in table 1 11 analog broadcast television service is prov ided over two portions of the radio spectrum the very high frequency vhf portion and the ultra high frequency uhf portion the transmission characteristics of the spectrum is such that vhf signals transmit further and require less power and therefore vhf stations tend to have larger reach with better reception quality and lower costs these di fferences disappear when the signals are received via cable or satellite service rather than over the air the number of television hous eholds in the state the counties in the state assigned to dmas for which the primary city is outside the state the number of television hous eholds in those counties the percentage of tele vision households in the state that are located in dmas for which the primary c ity is outside the state and the full power broadcast television stations with city of license or transmitting location inside the state that are located in dmas for which the primary city is outside the state these data provide the empi rical basis for the discussion in this report the information on city of license in table 1 is very important it shows whether television households in coun ties assigned to dmas for which the primary city is outside the state nonetheless have instate indma tele vision stations available to them10 for example it shows that the approximately 55000 ar kansas television households that are located in the spri ngfield missouri dma receive service from two uhf analog11 stations in their dma that have city of license in arkansas and that therefore have the obligation to meet the needs and interests of arkansas viewers but approximately 77000 arkansas households that are located in the memphis tennessee dma have access to br oadcast television stations that have city of license in arkansas and thus ve access to broadcast television stations that have an obligation to serve the needs and interests of those arkansas households what table 1 does not provide is inform ation about whether and how well the needs and interests of these television households are being met by broadcast television stations with city of license in the other state for example how well the broadcast stations with city of license in memphis tennessee are serving the needs and interests of those 77000 televi sion households in arkansas httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs5 12 the other two are diversity of voices and competition 13 the source for this discussion of broad casters public interest obligations is the introduction to the fccs notice of inquiry in the matter of broadcast localism mb docket 04233 adopted june 7 2004 and released july 1

systems and their im pact upon the existing television broadcast service 12 fcc rcd 12829 1977 in which it noted that even as they transition to digital technology broadcasters will remain trustees of the publics airwaves 15 47 usc 307b 16 see amendment of section 3606 of the commissions rules and regulations 41 fcc 148 167 1952 the commissions first television allo cation priority is to provide at

of the thr ee primary objectives of us broadcast policy12 broadcasters are considered to be temporary trustees of the publics spectrum because the 1934 communications act instructs the federal communications commission fcc or commission to award licenses to use the airwaves expressly on the condition that licensees serve the public interest13 section 309a requires the commission to determine in the case of applications for licenses whether the public interest convenience and necessity will be served by granting such application14 as trustees of the public airw aves broadcasters must serve the public interest by airing programming that is responsive to the interests and needs of their community of license the concept of localism derives from title iii of the communications act section 307b of the act explicitly requires the commission to make such distribution of licenses frequencies hours of operation and of power among the several states and communities as to provide fair efficient and equitable distribution of radio service to each of the same15 in carrying out the mandate of sec tion 307b when the commission allocates channels for new broadcast service its first priority is to provide general service to an area but its next priority is for facilities to provide the first local service to community16 the commission has long recognized that every community of appreciable size has presumptive need for its own transmission service17 the supreme court has stated that fairness to communities in distributing radio service is furthered by recognition of local needs for community radio mouthpiece18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs6 19 47 cfr 73685a 20 47 cfr 731125 21 amendment of sections 731125 and 731130 of th commissions rules the main studio and

television stati on whyytv wilmington delaware the commission stated although the petitioners emphasize the station s primary obligation to serve the needs of wilmington its city of license whyytv owes secondary duty to serve other nearby areas which include philadelphia and camd and trenton new jersey as we have previously recognized 18 rr 2d 1603 1970 53 fcc 2d 421 9 in subsequent decision involving the same station th commission expanded on this although whyy believes that it is television station licensed to serve wilmington and almost equally important adjacent metropolitan areas of ph iladelphia and camden the licensees first and primary obligation is to serve the local needs and interests of community of license wilmington this primary obligation to wilmington contrary to whyys assertions has been emphasized by the commission for at least the last twentythree years while regional programs can address the interests of wilmington residents such programs cannot serve other service area residents to the detriment of the citizens of wilmington the licensees prime and most important focus must be on the problems needs and interests of its community of license however as we outlined in our 1975 decision to renew the continuedstate state x state linecity of license mgrade agrade b source crsfigure 1 broadcast television station city of license and signal reach under existing fcc rules the licensees explicit public interest obligation is limited to serving the needs of viewers within its city of license24 over the years the commission has interpreted its rules to

stated it is expected that the licensee will devote itself to meetin g the special needs of its new community and the needs of the northern new jersey area in general in the usual case secaucus the city of assignment would be the primary focus of the licensees programming responsibilities however we have previously determined that the lack of local vhf television service to this highly populated area of northern new jers ey presented unique set of circumstances see eg docket 20350 2nd ro 59 fcc 2d 1386 37 rr 2d 1275 1976 wherein special service obligations have been impos ed on all new york city and philadelphia tv stations accordingly we expect rko to pe rform higher degree of service to its grade b coverage area than is normally required of broadcast licensee at renewal time rko will be judged by how it met the obligation to serve the greater service needs of northern new jersey which we view as broader than the specific needs of secaucusbut the fcc rules do not provide specific guidance about this secondary obligation yet in many cases the population residing w ithin the city of license is only small proportion of the total population r eceiving the stations signal many broadcast television st ations have viewing areas that cross state borders this is not surprising as cities often are located along rivers or other natural boundaries that act as state borders but urban development often occurs on both sides of the border and stations viewin g radius around central city will extend into suburbs and even into other cities across state borders in many of these situations the fcc has atte mpted to serve populations on both sides of the state borders by assigning some licenses to citie s in each state for example in the paducah kentuckycape girardeau missour imount vernon illinois area an nbc affiliated vhf analog and digital station and uhf analog and digital station have city of license in paducah kentucky foxaffiliated uhf analog and digital station and the cbsaffiliated vhf analog and digital station have city of license in cape girardeau missouri an abcaffiliated vhf analog and digital station has city of license in harrisburg illinois and vhf an alog station has city of license in mount vernon illinois but some metropolitan areas are dominated by single large city with most of the television licenses including those for all the stations affiliated with the four major broadcast networks assigned to that city and the licenses for only few stations assigned to cities in the neighboring states for example the licenses for the preponderance of stations servin g the metropolitan new york city and philadelphia areas are assigned to those cities with very few licenses assigned to new jersey western connecticut or dela ware the fcc has taken special notice of this situation with respect to the state of new jersey by explicitly stating that all the new york and philadelphia stations ve the responsibility to serve the needs of their new jersey viewers26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs9 27 the data underlying the following discussion are found in table 1 28 interestingly four stations were listed under new york state in the television cable factbook 2004 data source widely used in the industry despite having city of license in new jersey in the 2005 edition three of those stations were listed under new york state in the 2006 edition all four of the stations were listed under new jersey 29 today upwards of 85 of all us televi sion households receive their broadcast signals continuedas result of television viewing areas extending beyond state borders and the frequency of populations being concentrated along both side s of those borders there are number of situations in which despite the efforts of the fcc significant proportion of the television households in state are served primarily or entirely by broadcast television stations whose city of license and hence primary service obligation lies outside that state27 there are 3149060 television households in new jersey but the vast majority of these households receive all or most of their overtheair signals from stations licensed to new york city or philadelphia only one television station with city of license in new jersey is affiliated with one of the major television networks and that uhf analog nbcaffiliate serves th relatively sparsely populated southern tip of the state of the other eight commercial stations with city of license in new jersey only one is vhf station and fi ve are affiliated with spanish language networks four of the new jersey stations transmit from locations in new york city and their signals fully cover that city28 as indicated earlier at least at the policy level the commission has attempted to address the potential lack of coverage of new jerseyspecific issues by explicitly requiring the stations licensed to new york city and philadelphia to offer programming that serves the new jersey households within their viewing areas there are 313630 television households in delaware but there is only one uhf analog commercial station with city of license in the state plus three uhf noncommercial stations the bulk of the laware population is rved by television stations in philadelphia those stations ve primary obligations to serve the viewers of philadelphia and suburban new jersey the remainder of the delaware viewers are served by stations in salisbury mary land similarly the onl major network with an affiliate in new hampshire is abc the vast majority of new hampshires 498150 television households recei ve broadcast service pr imarily from stations in boston this pattern exists around many large cities more than 900000 television households in maryland are in the washin gton dc dma although small portion of these households are served by uhf analog and digital ab caffiliated station and uhf analog independent station both with city of license in hagerstown maryland and uhf analog nonc ommercial station w ith city of license in frederick maryland most are primarily served by washington dc stations the baltimore stations provide potential source of programming that addresses marylandspecific issues but although most of these house holds fall within those stations grade b contours most households subscribe to cab or satellite servi ce and therefore few of them have the antennas needed to bring in the baltimore stations29 whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs10 29 continued by means other than over the air reception according to data presented by the national cable and telecommunications associa tion on its website httpwwwnctacom statistics viewed on january 9 2008 in september 2007 there were 1123 m illion us television households of which 651 million subs cribed to cable television and 320 million subscribed to satellite television or some other noncable multichannel video program service adding these two fi gures together would create slight amount of double counting of nonbroadcast households as small portion of these households subscribed to both cable and noncable service the statutory regula tory and private contractual restrictions on cable and satellite systems carrying the signals of broadcast stations located instate but outsidethedma are discussed in the cable and satellite sections of this reportwashington dc stations do address issues of interest to maryla nd suburbanites they have the burden of addressing the need s of three jurisdictions with primary obligations to serve dc in virginia as well more than

city stations do not have explicit obligations to meet the needs of their ka nsas viewers similarly more than 330000 or just under 35 of the television households in connecticut are in the new york city dma and primarily served by new york city stations more than 150000 kentucky television households are in the cincinnati ohio dma and there are commercial stations in that dma with c ity of license in kentucky almost 200000 television households in nor thwestern indiana are in the chicago illinois dma served primarily by chicago stations with only one uhf analog and digital commercial station and one uhf analog nonc ommercial station located in that part of indiana and more than 300000 television households in western illinois are in the st louis missouri dma served primarily by st louis stations with only one uhf analog and digital commercial station with city of license in illinois this problem is not limited to majo r metropolitan areas as shown in table 1 5455 of the television households in wyo ming are located in television markets outside the state the popul ation centers around casper nd cheyenne are served by broadcast stations with city of license in wyoming but most other parts of the state are served primarily or entirely by broadcast stations with city of license outside the state almost onefourth of idahos television households are in dmas whose principal city is outside the state and mo re than onefifth of arkansas television households are in dmas whose prin cipal city is outside the statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs11 cable television as early as the 1960s when households be gan receiving their broadcast signals over cable television rather than over the air congress became concerned both that local broadcasters could be harmed either because they were not compensated for their programming or because local cable systems chose not to carry their programming thus cutting off their access to large segment of the viewing audience and that there could be diminution of programming that serves local needs and interests congress therefore enacted several laws intended to extend the policy goal of localism to the cable levision industry including the 1972 1984 and 1992 cable acts must carry rules most notable was the adoption of the retransmission consentmust carry election in the 1992 cable act every thr ee years each local commercial broadcast television station must choose between negotiating retransmission consent agreements with the cable systems operating in its service area whereby if agreement is reached the broadcaster is compensated by the cable system for the right to carry the broadcast signal and if agreement is not reached the cable system is not allowed to carry the signal or requiring each cable system operating in its service area to carry its signal but receiving compensation for such carriage with this mandatory election broadcas ters with popular pr ogramming that are confident the local cable systems will want to carry that programming can make the retransmission consent electi on and be assured compensation for such carriage and broadcasters with less popular programmin g that the local cable systems might otherwise not choose to carry can make th must carry election and be assured that their signal will be carried by all local cable systems the evolution of the must carry rules monstrates the difficulty of constructing rules that safeguard local broadcasters and foster local programming without unduly burdening cable operators or undermining the exclusiv distribution contracts between program content providers and pr ogram distributors the initial rules required cable operators to carry all br oadcast television signals whose grade b signals reached into the cable service area but this proved too expansive for example the grade b contours of wash ington dc stations extend over baltimore and vice versa the must carry requirements were then scaled back to those signals from stations located within certain mileage limits for example within 35 miles there then was some concern that this w ould harm broadcast stations that did not meet these

between two options 1 negotiating retran smission consent agreement with each local cable operator to make its programming ava ilable in exchange for compensation or 2 requiring the local cable operator to carry its programming at charge to the cable operator area that did not receive service from cable or sa tellite providers30 the specific threshold viewing levels were for networ kaffiliate station market share of at least 3 of total weekly viewing hours in the market and net weekly circulation of 25 for independent stations 2 of total weekly vi ewing hours and net weekly

receive television signals from multichannel video programming distributors that viewed the station for five minutes or more during th entire week expressed as percentage of the total households that do not receive television signals fro m multichannel video programming distributors in the survey area but as more and more households subscr ibed to cable service it became less reasonable to base must carry decisions on the behavior of the minority of households that continued to get their service over the air in the 1992 cable act congress modified sections 614 and 615 of the 1934 communications act32 to base the must carry rules on definition of local television markets explicitly based on viewing patterns requiring each cable operator to carry the signals of local commercial television stations qualif ied lowpower stations and qualified noncommercial educational stations if the licensees of t hose stations chose to have their signals carried33 this statutory language remains in place today the exact number of broadcast signals that cable systems must carry varies with the size of the cable system but includes at minimum three local commercial stations and one

against more distant television broadcast stations carried on local cable television system that serves more than 1000 subscribers commercial broadcast stations may assert these nonduplication rights regardless of whether or not their signals are being transmitted by the local cable system and regardless of when or if the network programming is scheduled to be broadcast generally the zone of protection for such programming cannot exceed 35 miles for stations licensed to community in the commissions list of top 100 television markets or 55 miles for stations licensed to communities in smaller tele vision markets in addition cable operator does not have to delete the network progra mming of any station which the commission has previously recognized as significantly viewed in the cable community 37 with respect to nonnetwork programming cable systems that serve at least 1000 subscribers may be required upon proper notific ation to provide syndicated protection to broadcasters who have contracted with progra m suppliers for exclusive exhibition rights to certain programs within specific geographic ar eas whether or not the cable system affected is carrying the station requesting this protection however cable system is required to delete program broadcast by station that ither is significantly viewed or places grade b or better contour over the community of the cable system 38 cable system located within 35 miles of th city of license of broadcast station where sporting event is taking place may not carry the live television broadcast of the sporting event on its system if the event is not available live on local television broadcast station if the holder of the broadcast rights to the even t or its agent requests such blackout the holder of the rights is responsible for notifying the cable operator of its request for program deletion at least the monday preceding the calendar week during which the deletion is desired if television broadcast station is licensed to the community in which the sports event is taking place the 35mile blackout zone extends from the broadcast stations licensed community with which the sports event or team is identified if the event or local continuedlocal commercial stations are defined as all stations whose community of license is within the same television market as the cable system34 following the statutory directive to use television markets delineated by commercial publications the fcc implemented rule defining television markets according to the nielsen dmas35 other federal rules and laws cable systems must carry the entirety of the program schedule of every local television station carried pursuant to the mandatory carriage provisions or the retransmission consent provisions of the 1992

ruleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs14 38 continued team is not identified with any particular community for instance the new england patriots the 35mile blackout zone extends from the community nearest the sports event which has licensed broadcast station the s ports blackout rule does not apply to cable television systems serving less than 1000 subscrib ers nor does it require deletion of sports event on broadcast stations signal that was carried by cable system prior to march 31 1972 the rule does not apply to sports programming carried on nonbroadcast program distribution services such as espn these services however may be subject to private contractual blackout restrictions 39 17 usc 111are quite complex and result in signifi cant amounts of programming from television stations within cable operators dma not being carried because such carriage would be duplicative or would cont ravene exclusivity agreements interestingly while the must carry rules are now based on dmas the non duplication rules continue to be based on the old significantly viewed criteria consider cable operator that sought to carry the broadcast signals of network affiliated station that is located nearby but outside the dma in which the cable system is located and that successfully worked out retransmission consent agreement with that affiliated station for example assume montgomery county maryland cable operator which is located in the washington dc dma sought to carry baltimore broadcast station and ccessfully worked out retransmission consent agreement with the baltimore station then if that baltimore station met the significantly viewed criteria in the cable operators location its signals would not be subject to the nonduplication rules nd the signals from both the washington dc network affiliate and the baltimore network affiliate could be carried by the montgomery county cable operator in th eir entirety without blackouts of the network programming on the baltimore sta tion some industry observers claim however that such duplication does not occur very often because the national networks rather than the affiliated stations tend to make the determination through language in the private contractual agreem ent between the networ k and each affiliate about whether station locat ed outside cable systems dma should grant the cable system retransmission consent and freque ntly these contracts effectively preclude retransmission consent copyright law also may tend to discourage cable systems from carrying the signals of broadcast stations located outsi the dma in which the cable system is located39 cable systems are required to pay royalties under congressionally granted compulsory copyright license for the s econdary transmission of the signals of broadcasters located outside the dma within which the cable system is located in contrast cable systems enjoy royaltyfree permanent compulsory copyright license that is do not have to pay copyright fees for the secondary transmission of broadcast signals of stations located in their dmas the royaltyfree license extends to the secondary transmission of signals of outofdma broadcast stations that meet the significantly viewed criteria discussed above however if an instate but out ofdma station does not meet the significantly viewed criteria the requirement to pay the copyright royalties might tip the balance away from the cable system carrying the stations signalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs15 40 codified at 47 usc 534 41 16 fcc rcd 16099 2001 42 for

2009 by which date the broadcasters will be required to return the spectrum us ed for analog transmission during this transition many broadcasters are providing both analog and digital broadcast signals therefore there has been public policy debate over which br oadcast signals cable systems should be obligated to carry in january 2001 the fcc announced adoption of rules for cable carriage of digital levision signals the fcc ruling does not require cable systems to simultaneously ca rry both the analog and digital signals dual carriage of local television sta tions the fcc tentatively concluded that such requirement appears to burden cab operators first amendment interests more than is necessary to further substantial governmental interest while not approving dual carriage mandate the fcc did rule that digitalonly television station whether commercial or noncommercial can immedi ately assert its right to carriage on local cable system in add ition television station that returns its analog spectrum and converts to digital ope rations must be carried by local cable systems in april 2007 the fcc issued notice of proposed rulemaking to address another issue how to protect those househol ds that subscribe to cable systems that have not fully deployed digital technol ogy by the february 17 2009 deadline for broadcasters to discontinue analog transmission43 the commission addressed the statutory requirement that cable operators must make the signal transmitted by broadcaster electing mandatory carriage viewable by all of their subscribers44 seeking comment on how cable operators can impleme nt this requirement after the end of analog broadcasting the commission propos ed that cable operators must comply with this viewability provision and ensure that cable subscribers with analog television sets are able to continue to view all mustcarry stations after the end of the digital television transition by either 1 carrying the digital signal in analog format or 2 carrying the signal only in digital fo rmat provided that all subscribers have the necessary equipment to view the broadcas t content although all the commissioners agreed that this was an important issu that the commission should address two of the commissioners raised several questi ons whether it was premature to propose specific prescriptive rules in light of potentially strong market forces that could resolve any problem whether all the constitutional issues had been fully vetted whether it was premature to propose revers of existing decisions without having had chance to

6 mhz of spectrum into separa and discrete str eams of content and broadcast multiple as many as six cha nnels of programming this is known as multicasting broadcasters sought an f cc ruling requiring cable operators to carry any and all multicasted channels transmitted by commercial broadcasters arguing that the incentive to develop additional programming streams is diminished if they have guarantee that cable systems will carry that programming cable providers countered that their decision on whether or not to carry additional broadcaster programming streams should be dictated by the market not mandated in february 2005 the fcc affirmed its prior decision th at cable operators are not required to carry more than single digital programming stream from any particular broadcaster47 local franchi requirements under the 1984 cable act local franc hising authorities may require cable operators to set aside channels for public educational or governmental peg use48 in addition

meetings they are usuallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs18 programmed by individuals or groups on ither public educati onal or governmental access channels or on commercial leased access channels summary of factors affecting local programming on cable the bottom line of the existing rules is as follows unless they have systems with very small capacity local cable operators are required to carry the broadcast signals of all the fullpower television stations and certain qualified lowpower television stations located in their dma and noncommercial sta tions that transmit from within 50 miles of the cable headend whose grade b contours cover the cable systems service area the cable operator is required to carry the entirety of the program schedule of each of these broadcas t stations subject to possible blackouts to conform with the nonduplication rules for those circumstan ces where more the broadcast programming is duplicated by second or third station in the dma if cable system is located in dma in which the primary city is in another state and most or all of the television stations in that dma have city of license in the other state then the broadcast television signals it must carry will be primarily or entirely from out of state this scenario is shown in figure 2 although local cable operator qs franchise is located in state and the major nearby city m is located in state x both are within the same dma f if local cable operator q wants to carry the signals of broadcasters that are located in state but outside of dma f it can negotiate with those broadcasters to carry their signals but any carriage would be subject to the restrictions in th network program nonduplication syndicated programming exclusivity protection and s ports programming blac kout rules and to copyright fees though these rules and fees will not be in effect if the significantly viewed criteria can be met all these factors may restrict the statespecific entertainment programming cable operator q can carry and also could affect the local news programming carried cable operator q is not likely to use one of its channels to offer swiss cheese program schedule w ith holes in it for blacked out programs or programs for which it does not choose to pa copyright fees nor is it likely to set aside channel just for several hours day of state news or one or two sports events per weekhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs19 state state x state linecity of license mgrade agrade b cable franchise qdma f source crsfigure 2 cable system located in dma in wh ich the primary city is in another state some observers claim however that when cable operators do not carry the in state programming of outofdma broadcast si gnals it is unlikely to be because of these rules which frequently can be si destepped through application of the exceptions for significantly viewed stati ons rather these observers claim it is likely to be because the instate broadcaste rs are constrained by territorial exclusivity provisions in their network affiliation agreements allegedly imposed by the broadcast networks whatever the cause of cable system reluctance to carry the signals of instate but outsidethedma broadcast signals it is likely that the withindma but outof state broadcasters for example the broadcasters with city of license m will cover some issues of interest to the cable operators subscribers the subscribers to cable system q their inclusion in the same dma is based on the assumption that viewers in the county in which the cable system operates tend to view the signals from that dma and are likely to have marketplace connection that broadcasters will have an incentive to foster but the coverage of issues specific to the viewers in that cable systems service area may be quite limited since the broadcasters are not subject to any explicit obligation to serve the needs of viewers outside their city of license and their closein viewers are likely to be considered more valuable by advertisers whether or not this represents problem to the cable systems subscribers will depend on their relative affinity toward news information and sports

transmission of di stant broadcast signals the geographic areas in alaska that are not in any nielsen dma are to be assigned by satellite carriers to one of the local markets dmas in that state in order to allow the carriers to offer subscribers in those areas the calintolocal service for the dma to which they are assigned62 in addition satellite carriers with more than 5 million subscribers must retransmit all of the analog broadcast signals originating in alaska and hawaii within one year of the passage of shvera and all of the dig ital broadcast signals originating in alaska and hawaii within 30 months of the passage of shvera these signals must be made available to substantially all of the subscribers in their local markets dmas and the signals from at least one of the local markets in the state must be made available to substantially all of the subscribers in the state not located in dma the cost to subscribers of such transmission shall not exceed the cost of retransmission of local televisi on stations in other states63 referring back to figure 3 shvera may expand upon the availability of programming of interest to subscriber z if there are broadcast signals originating in state but outside dma f that meet the significantly viewed criteria or if subscriber z happens to be located in st ate and county covered by one of the state specific provisions in the act give n the high likelihood that the sate llite carrier already is uploading these broadcast signals to serve customers in the dmas in which the signals originate and the royaltyfree compulsory copyright license for significantly viewed signals it would appear that the only reasons that the satellite carrier might choose not to offer this dditional programming to subscriber z wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs26 be if it failed to negotiate retransmission consent agreement with the license holder of the significantly viewed broadcast si gnal to cover subscriber z and other subscribers that previously could not be rved or if subscriber z were not located in the footprint to which the signal was currently being beamed in some situations the provisions in shvera that expand the number of in state signals potentially available to satellite subscribers will provide an additional public policy benefit candidates for public office who have had to reach many of the citizens of their state through highpriced advertising on outofstate big city stations may now be able to reach those citizens through lowerpriced advertising on instate stations this could reduce the costs associated with political campaigns issues for congress localism remains one of the cornerstones of us media policy there are small number of broadcast television stations relative to the number of local governmental jurisdictions moreover ev ery full power televisi on station broadcasts signals that extend far beyond the borders of its city of license thus when particular station is assigned city of license to serve there will always be many nearby local jurisdictions that the licensee has explicit or specific obligation to serve where the broadcast coverage area extends across governmental boundaries and especially state borders it is difficult fo r broadcaster to fully address the needs of all jurisdictions broadcas ters of course have the incentive to meet the needs and interests of as many of its potential viewer s as possible most television broadcasters attempt to reconcile this by covering issues of general interest such as crime and weather andor regional interest such as transportation systems however some current statutory and regulatory requireme nts do not provide incentives or even make it more difficult for broadcast cable and satellite providers of television to meet the needs and interests of their communities if congress wants the fcc to systematically review its rules to eliminate any disincentives to localism or to clarify licensee obligations it could pass legislation instructing the commission to do so broadcaster obligations wi thin the city of license as explained earlier the fccs first priority when it assigns licenses is to provide general service to an area and its second priority is to provide the first local service to community most broadcast television stations are attentive to the needs and interests of the viewers in their city of license it is in their selfinterest to be responsive to their viewers their mark et incentives may diverge from this goal however if their city of license is an outlying city to much larger city and their signal covers the larger city as shown in figure 4 the grade b contour of the station licensed to outlying city fully covers major city m in th is situation the licensee may have stronger incentive to serve the needs and interests of the larger city this incentive may be stronger yet if the city of license is in different state than the larger city httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs27 state state x state linecity m city of license ograde b grade source crsfigure 4 broadcast station whose city of license is an outlying city to major city but whose signal covers the major city that incentive may affect how the station markets itself for example as station in the outlying city of license or as station in the larger city across the state line this in turn may affect how the station is identified geographically by the industry the television cable factbook is widely used annual industry source book that presents data on each television st ation

7 2004 and released july 1 2004 initial comments are due on november 1 2004 66 commission decisions to date do not provide explicit guidance for example in the fcc license renewal decision most on point here in re application of whyy inc for renewal of license of station whyytv wilmington delaware 93 fcc 2d 1086 1983 the broadcast and communications commission of the city council of wilmington delaware challenged renewal of the license alleging that the station broadcast more programming that focused on philadelphia than on wilmington the commission found that over its last license term whyy provided an average of less than 33 ½ hours per week of programming exclusively addressed to the needs and interests of delaware residents thus it would appear there has been an erosion in the commitments which led the commission to grant the construction permit application of whyy this erosion however does not indicate that whyy has failed to fulf ill its obligations and to treat wilmington as its primary service area as the commission has previously stated licensees are not bound to strict inflexible adherence to program propos als but are afforded broad discretion in the manner in which they respond to community problems educational broadcasting continuedlarger city64 according to the publishers of the television cable factbook its editors not the stations determined how to list each station in 2006 it made the decision to list the stations by city and he nce state of license rather than using hyphenated market designations with the major city listed first during 2004 the fcc opened pr oceeding on broadcast localism65 but to date has not proposed or adopted any rules rela ting to localism congress might choose to direct the fcc in that proceeding to undertake rulemaking to explicitly identify or provide written guidance about the obligations of licensees with city of license in an outlying city to major city to specifically serve the needs and interests of the viewers in their city of license66 it also might choose to direct the commission tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs29 66 continued corporation 31 fcc 85 1961 93 fcc 2d 1095 in the decision the commission goes on to state programming which reflects service to wilmington as whyys primary service area is not limited to programming which exclusively involves delaware persons and issues regional national and international topics may be of interest to residents of wilmington as well as programs specifically designed for delaware the interests of delaware residents it can be concluded fl ow beyond the confines of the borders of delaware to topics of interest outside the state such interests are addressed by such national programs as the mcneillehrer report wall street week over easy and the advocates which are broadcast by the licensee however despite the wealth of national programs an educational licensee must also provide local program service which addresses the unique problems needs and interest s of the community it is licensed to serve id at 10951096 address how it would enforce those ob ligations for example under what circumstances if any could failure to serve the needs and interests of its community of license result in license not being renewed or being revoked broadcaster obligations beyond the city of license at the same time current fcc rules are not clear about the broadcast television licensees obligations to serve viewers w ithin their service area who are beyond the borders of the city of license but not in larger nearby city with its own licensed broadcast television stations as shown in figure 1 in many situations the television household population beyond the city of license exceeds that within the city of license this in itself provides broadcasters with some economic incentive to be responsive to the needs and interests of these viewers but news and information programming is relatively expensive to produce and unless such programming is of general interest to relatively broad portion of the potential viewing audience there is always the risk of losing audience thus congress might choose to direct the co mmission as part of its current proceeding on broadcast localism to explicitly identify or provi written guidance about the obligations of licensees to serve the portion of their viewership that lies outside the city of license but not in large nearby cities with their own licensed broadcast television station it also might choose to direct the commissi on to address how it would enforce those obligationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs30 67 public interest obligations of tv broadcast licensees 14 fcc rcd 21633 1999 commonly known as the dtv public interest noi 68 see for example

1999 the fcc issued notice of inquiry concerning the public interest obligations of broadcast television licensees as they transition to digital television67 the commission subsequently has issued two notices of proposed rulemaking as well as periodic reviews of the commissions rules and policies affecting the conversion to digital television and in september 2004 voted to adopt childrens programming obligations for digital television broadcasters68 the commission has incorporated the relevant portions of the comments received in those rulemakings and periodic reviews into its broadcast localism proceeding69 technological change has the potential to help broadcasters better meet the local needs of their viewers with digital tr ansmission one option available to licensees is to use their 6 mhz of spectrum for multicasting that is to broadcast multiple programming streams as the commission develops rules addressing digital broadcast television public interest obligations it might try to construct rules that foster programming that meets the possibly divergent needs of viewers within the city of license and viewers beyond the city of license for example it might consider modifying the current rule that requires cable operators to carry only the primary programming stream of each local television broadcaster by requiring cable operators to carry each programming stream that ffers distinct programming aimed at different previously unserved geographic portion of the broadcasters serving area70 this could explicitly address those situations in which broadcasters serving area crosses state borders awarding the broadcas ter must carry rights for second signal if the programming on that signal specifically addresses the needs and interests of the viewing households in the second state if the fcc were to consider this approach it would want to take into account the imp act on cable systems of requiring them to carry additional broadcast channels it so would want to termine how best to construct rule that did not artificially encourage or discourage broadcasters from choosing multicasting over other potential appli cations of digital technology to their 6 mhz of spectrum such as high defi nition television congress might choose to direct the fcc in its current proceeding on implementation of th digital transition to study and construct r ecommendations for rules and if necessary statutoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs31 71 with respect to copyright some observers claim that the carriage of instate programming would be fostered by expanding the congressionally mandated royaltyfree compulsory license to include the secondary transmission of signals of those stations located in the same state but outside the dma of the cable franchise but that are not significantly viewed continuedchanges to address the potentially related issues of mandatory carriage of multiple broadcast signals and better serving the n eeds and interests of viewers in different governmental jurisdictions increasing the flexibility of cable carriage rules as explained earlier the existing array of must carry and nonduplication rules and compulsory copyright license fees may restrict or discourage cable operators that happen to be located in dma that has its primary city in another state from carrying the signals of broadcasters in their own state that are located in different dma this can decrease viewer access to both informational and entertainment programming of statewide interest the data presented in table 1 suggest this may not be an isolated occurrence in many states substantia l number and percentage of television households are in dmas in whic h the primary city is located outside the state and in which most of the television stations have city of license outside the state however there is degree of flexibility in the must carry rules the statutory provision allowing cable operato rs to request that they be allowed to carry signals from outside their dma that would fost er localism the nondup lication rules allowing significantly viewed stations to be carried with out having duplicated programming blocked and th copyright laws providing royaltyfree permanent compulsory copyright license for the secondary transmission of programming of broadcast stations that are significantly vi ewed in the cable systems service area congress might choose to direct the fcc when reviewing its existing rules as part of its current broadcast localism proceed ing to heed the flexibility that congress has given it to implement and administer its rules in fashion that fosters localism it might instruct the commission to st udy whether there are narrowlydefined conditions under which the existing nonduplica tion rules can be loosened to foster the cable carriage of programming of stat ewide interest w ithout undermining the goals and objectives of those rules it also might ask the commission to explore how it could best allow exceptions to its current rule that uses dmas to determine which broadcast television signals cable company must carry as indicated earlier the commission has ruled that only broadcas t licensees and cable operators have standing to request exceptions to the curre nt rule restricting must carry rights to stations within the dma the commission might investigate whether it would be in the public interest for other parties such as state officials to be able to make such request based on demonstratively positive impact on localism it also might investigate whether it would be in the pub lic interest for the commission itself to have the right to propose an exception to th rule on its own authority if it were to reach the conclusion that such authority would be in the public interest it might recommend to congress that the statute be modified to give it that authority71 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs32 71 continued by television households in the county in whic h the cable franchise is located copyright holders argue however that now that cable is longer an infant industry it is inappropriate to maintain the current royaltyfree compulsory license less expand its scopethe commission already has concluded that the parties currently with standing to seek an exception the broadcast licen see and the cable system operator have knowledge of key relevant pa rameters for example the demand for particular types of programming the progra mming available both on the specific broadcast station and on the cable system the geographic reach of the broadcast stations grade b contours etc not readily available to state officials or the fcc adding or deleting must carry stations will change the array of programming available to the cable systems subscribers and any party seeking to change the lineup of channels should have sufficient information on subscribers preferences to be confident that consumers will be better served by the proposed change in programming increasing the flexibility of satellite localintolocal programming by passing shvera in november 2004 congress expanded the scope of in state television programming that satellite operators are permitted but not required to offer subscribers in alaska and waii that expansion in mandatory the combination of generic change in law allowing satellite providers to offer programming that is significantly viewed by overtheair television viewers and several statespecific provisions intended to address restricted access to programming in six states may significantly reduce consumer complaints that they are not able to receive programming via sate llite that meets their needs and interests the effectiveness of shvera however will not be determined until it has been in operation long enough to find out if the cr iteria in the rules and limitations associated with the significantly viewed provision allow for real expansion in the signals made available to satellite subscribers if the significantly viewed provision does not provide relief for subscribers seeking programming that meets statespecific needs and interests then it is likely that bills will be introduced in the 110th congress that seek statespeci fic or countyspecific solutions analogous to the ones involving new hampshire vermont mississippi or egon alaska and hawaii in shvera several such bills already have b een introduced as described below bills introduced in the 110th congress to date three bills that address cable and satellite carriage of local broadcast television station signals have been introduced in the 110th congress senator allard has introduced s 124 which would allow sa tellite operators to offer subscribers located in two counties in the southwestern corner of colorado the signals of broadcasters in denver even though thos counties are not located in the denver dma analogous to the provisions in shvera affecting subscribers in certain counties in new hampshire vermont ssissippi and oregon and also would allow cable operators in those two counties to carry the primary signal of any network station located in denver senator salazar s introduced s 760 which in addition to the two provisions in s 124 would wa ive the retransmission rules to allow ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32641crs33 satellite carrier cable system or translator station to carry the primary signal of network station located in state to subscr ibers in that state who otherwise would not receive the primary signal of that network because those subscribers are located in dma outside of the state if two conditions are met 1 the fcc determines that it is in the best interest of the public welfare and 2 the satellite carrier cable system or translator station agrees to also carry the primary signal of the network station in the assigned dma representative boren has introduced hr 602 which would modify the retransmission rules to allow satellite carrier to provide the signals of network stations located in oklahoma to subscr ibers who reside in oklahoma but do not currently receive the signal of any network station located in that state because of their assignment to dma receiving network stations located outside oklahoma if those subscribers choose to receive the ok lahoma signals rather than the outofstate signals representative ross has introduced h r 2821 which would amend section 352b2 of the communictions act 47 usc 352b2 to permit satellite carriers and cable operators to retransmit the signals of local television broadcast stations to any dma that is adjacent to and at least partially located in the same state as the dma in which the broadcast stati on is located amend section 122 of the us copyright act 17 usc 122 to allow sa tellite operators
