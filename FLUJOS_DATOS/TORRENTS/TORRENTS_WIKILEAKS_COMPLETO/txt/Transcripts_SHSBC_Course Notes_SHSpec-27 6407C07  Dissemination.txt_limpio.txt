6407c07 shspec27 dissemination lrh took pictures of the circus at the request of its management he projected them on 12 x 12 screen in the ring and had party he told the elephant man who had swelling on his knee how to do touch assist two weeks ago it worked if someone asks you for help do something for him i never tell anybody anything people come to see wherever i go putting practice together has always been mystery to how anybody could miss the only thing an auditor has to solve is the problem of what to live on while he is building practice it could take three to five months get in contact with people join social clubs people listen to you because you seem to know your business dissemination is not problem with lrh because he doesnt make it problem name and reputation dont matter it is what you can do that counts lrh has signed things rene lafayette ken martin kurt von rocken winchester remington colt etc there is easy way to do anything there are some ways that are not as hard as others being pro in any field takes work of one sort or another physical or otherwise you have to invest some of yourself in it you have to know how you are going to use the data you had better know all there is to know about your subject if you hope to be able to solve technical problem that may or may not have been covered in what you have been studying you may find that the problem is actually very simple even though you know that what you are studying is inapplicable to what you are going to be doing go ahead and learn it well if it is part of formal course finish studying it if you are in training because you are liable to find out that its principles do apply after all when you get round the corner after you have completed the study make your adaptions put some of yourself in it ask yourself how will i use this stuff how will it apply to study does you good whatever unless you go through this process students in many fields engineering courses economics etc dont consider what application they will put the data to which is one reason they have trouble learning it solutions are evolved not from inspiration but from observation inspection data and familiarity reach and withdraw runs off the barriers that prevent you from observing something you can overdo the studying by spending far too long gathering data this would indicate some defect in getting familiarity with what you are studying to gain knowledge or understanding of something you need to be in touch with it arc u you can get too concentrated on one line and get so withdrawn that you lose touch with other things that is why lrh periodically goes charging off into contact with different areas once in awhile you ought to go look and see how people operate so that they dont get unreal in building practice youve got to work at it but you cant force it out of its own timeframe im not creature of ivory towers i get impatient with sitting at desk snowed under with dispatches thats why we have scientology
