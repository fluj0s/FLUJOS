6503c02 shspec53 technology and hidden standards economics and organizations are matter of the mest universe let give you tip if someone around you or your organization is having trouble with organizational matters you just processed them subjectively too long it doesnt matter how long you process them subjectively now they are not going to go anyplace the trouble with them is objective you want to give the objectivetype processes not subjective organizational tech is being formed up into courses for the business world it has taken two to three years to plow this line now that we have product to put on the line it will go like crash dissemination techniques have been worked up out of the materials of scientology which have only to be written up and issued lrh has found all the points where organizations dont expand and found what makes them not expand what contracts them etc you end up with formulas that you can give to the janitor to apply to his job and he will look them over and see that they make sense his willingness to work was jammed by his ignorance of the law that governed that work under its various conditions all you have to do is to know and use the formulas if you apply them backwards you shrink and collapse it is longer question of our arriving before everything blows up we have made all our deadlines the questionable period is behind us organization is important to build scientology up to civilization level our intentions are good so we will make it it is now foregone conclusion that we will make it as soon as the materials are in your hands you cant help but make it in the human race and in the mind there is barrier called the hidden standard when anyone is critical they are apparently criticizing against hidden standard of behavior they seldom tell you what the behavior should be only what it shouldnt be or if they say what the behavior should be it is in antipathetic terms there is definition of normal person hence abnormal is defined against hidden standard the communist ideal would be anonymous this is weird person who is doing job should make known that he is the one doing it if someone isnt known he gets reward it is possible to develop odd tests for deciding what is good or right eg choosing doctor for appointment to hospital on the basis of his sports career examination and selection of personnel gets into trouble continually for lack of proper standard the hospital blames the medical school for not training good doctors but the hospital is setting up hidden standard and blaming the school for not delivering without saying what they want delivered marriages are made miserable by the hidden standards that spouses run on each other they dont make clear what they want when they say that they want good spouse eg the wife says you are not an adequate husband the husband says i guess im not an adequate husband but the wifes standard remains hidden she doesnt describe it to him you could handle marital problems organizationally by finding hidden standards auditors come up against this often you as an auditor have to face up to pcs who are running hidden standard on you all the time what you are looking at is not really standard but perverted standard it is not real standard nobodys ever acknowledged this standard and that holds it apart from the time track the auditor should acknowledge the standard so that it doesnt get parked on the time track the standard is the collection of nonacknowledgments that the individual has if you want to end cycle of action acknowledge if you dont want to end cycle of action dont acknowledge in auditing if you dont want to end cycle you halfacknowledge as way of keeping someone going full acknowledgment of cycle ends it nonacknowledgment keeps it going that is why people tend to get uglier not prettier one ever says my you look ugly today one reason why person gets fixed on human bodies is that one said oh i see you are man this lifetime this datum is very applicable to registrars as well as auditors if you acknowledge the person before he arrives he wont arrive nobody will appear for training or processing if you acknowledge heavily the right way to handle letter from someone who announces his intention to come for training or processing is to be courteous and not too definite give some information but not solid acknowledgments people generally work towards beingness they dont function so well just being post this is question of acknowledgment which ends cycle on the post retirement is an acknowledgment of persons total active life it ends the life in many cases it ends life in any form military commissions act as an invitation to overthrow ones superiors because commission is not granted by saying thank you for having been lower post you now have the right to work toward commissioned post corporal would function much better if on attaining his new rank he were to be congratulated not on being corporal but on having been private and on having attained the right to work towards becoming lance corporal if persons rank or position is bestowed as an accomplishment rather than as challenge or becomingness then the cycle has been ended before it began by being prematurely acknowledged the only way person can get in trouble is to be george smith while hes pretending to be his post there is the post which is set of beingnesses and lines and actions and policies all by itself and theres being who runs the set of beingnesses lines actions and policies which is the hat george smith must not operate as george smith when he is supposed to be being or attaining say the post of d of t there is hat and then there is being who runs the hat to get hat on you must put it in category of being in the process of being attained once it is attained and acknowledged it ends so as an auditor you have to be careful what and how and when you acknowledge if arthur says that he has had horrible day at school lrh doesnt acknowledge with good he would use something more sympathetic and really acknowledge it so that it could go onto the backtrack you have the power to put someones past on the past track and to give them future if you want to kill them dead acknowledge everything with crash this gives them future be little doubtful about someones future plans dont use certain solid acknowledgments then give the discussion good acknowledgment recognize that datum like this with lot of uses could easily gang agley on the back track it would get perverted messed up etc from this datum could arise such things as hidden standards and amnesia getting shot is too solid an acknowledgment of lifetime so one forgets it that is the basic mechanism behind nonrecall of past lives things that arent acknowledged because they are totally out of agreement while the good things are acknowledged these unacknowledged things bring about condition where everything disappears out of the persons past except the nonacknowledged things that people thought were silly or that they protested or that they were upset about this gives you decay of personality as person moves along the time track whether the person has gpms or not though without gpms the person could do and undo the aberrations almost at will person should know that he has tendency to collect all those things that were never acknowledged that is because the individual has some dependency on the comm formula as long as person has any desire to communicate he will be liable to malfunction of certain parts of the comm formula and when these parts go awry things do go weird person could regulate his conduct by knowing what parts of the comm formula were good and what parts were bad which parts would natively get him into trouble and which wouldnt if youre gonna associate with your fellow beings youre going to have to use the communication formula one way or another you will have to know how it works the part that acknowledgment plays etc the comm formula can have things go wrong with it so there is potential for native aberration there is direct source of direct aberration plus the native aberration of beings the two can work together gpms which are agreedupon aberration can hold lesser stuff native aberration eg failed acknowledgments etc in place and give them aberrative force and importance insanity could be two things 1 the persons collection of unacknowledged things 2 outright gpm commands to be nuts crazy person is doing lot of things that have never been agreed with and therefore have never been acknowledged you dont have to agree with something in order to acknowledge it where you have both factors working together the gpms make the unacknowledged things very solid and very much in force you know that the pc will run into aberration of this sort at levels vi and vii the latter is power processing he runs into the collection of nonagreedwith things the bank itself has lots of charge the nonagreedwith things locks carry very little charge the pc assigns the values wrongwayto especially at first because he assigns aberration to what he can confront so youve got 1 the bank 2 the accidents and incidents of livingness the power of these two is eight billion to one but it appears to be the reverse because that is all the thetan can confront you can key out the locks and pat the bank back into place this in itself is fantastic improvement over what anyone has been able to accomplish before there are hidden standards about what we are supposed to be accomplishing nobody will admit that you have reached any state because they have never told you what state you were supposed to reach in the first place amongst your fellow human beings this kind of cycle takes place you finish the pc up in session he feels good then he runs into the human race after the session they run hidden standard on him and try to make him prove that he is now in better state the hidden standard interferes with delivery there is point in talking to someone about clear or release youve got to talk scientology in terms that are real in relation to the goals of the person to whom you are talking or you will trip all over his hidden standards about the only standard you could have for clear is fn at clear read the standard for release is do you think that you will get any worse people have hidden standards about who you should be to audit them what condition they should be in in order to have had case gain etc you could run who would i have to be to audit you and acknowledge the dickens out of it for any condition you have described as better condition in scientology there is hidden standard and hidden standard exists even for known standards for instance you say we require pink sheet but they keep bringing you green ones saying is this what you want what happens is that the individual with his concatenation of nonacknowledged ideas adds up to nonobservational point he cant observe from this point he cant tell where he is or what you are saying to him about how he should be etc cf earlier material on service facs as substitute for observation safe assumptions etc see hcob 6sep63 scientology five instructing in scientology auditing instructors task d of ps case handling hcob 160ct63 r3sc slow assessment and pp 497 and 499 above the pc will keep trying to bail himself out provided you dont overwhelm him with things to bail or give him nothing just give him things to bail with within his understanding and ability to confront and he will eventually float in that way you dont q and with his hidden standards you never realize how much better you are than yesterday because you are experiencing negative gain it is longer wrong with you so of course you are not now worrying about it just attesting level and getting certificate acknowledges the entire level the session the auditing etc the attestation keys it out and puts it on the back track this way also the pc doesnt get stuck in win hidden standard because of hidden standards the only safe way to evaluate case progress is mechanical method such as meter and completed cycle of processes it so happens that if the pc does complete the cycle of processes he will have case gain and this can be strung out along levels with such basic processes that you dont have different pcs all the time an unwritten standard is hidden you may feel that there is hidden technical standard this is an alteris what has happened is just that there is material that has not yet been released nobody is trying to hide any technology your best answer to the pcs hidden standards is to hold to your standard technology and just take the pc on up the line with q and
