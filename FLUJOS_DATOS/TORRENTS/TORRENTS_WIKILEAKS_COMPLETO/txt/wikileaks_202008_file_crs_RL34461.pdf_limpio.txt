interiorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34461crs2 2 these panels are now called the subcommittees on interior environment and related agencies and related agencies2 this change resulted from the abolition of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on veterans affairs housing and urban development and independent agencies which previously had jurisdiction over epa since fy2006 appropriations laws

include funds for doi wildland fire management in the past wildland fire funds have been appropriated to blm for fire fighting on all doi lands however for fy2009 the administration pr oposed funding for doi fire fighting as departmentwide program rather than through the blm the administration sought 8501 million for doi wildland fi re management reduction of 3419 million 29 from the 119 billion appropriated to the blm for fy2008 for more information see the wildland fire management section in this report proposed funding for several key activities is discussed below the administrations fy2009 budget included several suggested changes in law for instance the administration suggested amending the federal land transaction facilitation act fltfa in part to alte r the distribution of proceeds from land sales under current law pro ceeds are deposited into separate treasury account and are available primarily for land acquisition the presidents proposal would direct 70 of the proceeds to the ge neral fund of the treasury it would cap receipts retained by the doi at 60 milli on annually and direct using updated land management plans to determine which lands to sell or exchange the administration supports these changes to reduce the amount of money not subject to oversight during the appropriations process and to enha nce the public benefits from land sales according to the blm budget justification legislation would be needed to make these changes the administration made similar proposals in earlier budget requests which were not enacted the administration also proposed to eliminate the range improvements fund and consequently did not re quest an appropriation from the fund the administration seeks legislative change to direct that the grazing fee receipts that are deposited into the fund instead be deposited in the ge neral fund of the treasury range improvements include vegetati on projects fencing and water developments the administration advocates the change so that construction and maintenance of public land projects is the responsibility of public land users and interest groups while allowing that blm funds from other account s could be used for range improvements the administration proposed similar change s in earlier budget requests but they have not been enacted while the adminis tration did not request funds for range improvements for fy2009 table 3 below shows request of 100 million because under current law portion of the grazing fees collected are deposited in the fund management of lands and resources management of lands and resources includes funds for an array of blm land programs including protection recreational use improve ment development dis posal and general blm administration for this line

wildland fire management as departmentwide program with request for 8501 millio n b the figures of 0 are result of an appropriation matched by offsetting fees in general the administration sought reduced funds for fy2009 for activities funded by this account this is due in part to the separate identif ication of funds for the nlcs in fy2009 which in the past we re included as part of other activities proposed reductions for fy2009 from the fy2008 levels include the following range management 23 million from 730 million to 707 million cultural resources 26 million from 161 million to

1099 million in fy2008 to 1320 million in fy2009 the lower amount for fy2008 was primarily the result of 255 million in offsetting fees these revenues were expected to be derived through program for fy2008 requiring payment of 4000 for each pplication for permit to drill oil and gas wells including these revenues the amount available for fy2008 was 1354 million the administration sought legisla

to impose price threshold in certain leases earlier in the 110th congress the house had passed hr 6 with similar language on royalty relief but the provisions were not enacted as part of pl 110140 in addition the authority of the secret ary to impose price thresholds has come into question in lawsuit filed by kerrmcgee19 the us district court western district of louisiana issued rulin g on october

oil compan lessees brought breach of contract claims against mms seeking restitution for bonus payments made to mms in order to obtain and suspend their leases in ffshore california in november 2005 the us court of federal claims held that the federal government breached its contract with the lessees when it enacted the amendments to the czma in 1990 that according to the decisions described bove required lease suspensions to be evaluated for consistency with states coastal management plan27 the court reasoned that the lessees had not bargai ned for the more extensive consistency determination requirements to be applie d to suspension requests when the leases were signed and that therefore the legislation creating these new requirements amounted to breach of the leases28 the government was

hazardous wastes and the cleanup of environmental contamination epa also awards grants to assist states and local governments in complying with federal requirements to control pollution epas funding

to his original fy2009 request rather than the 926 million indicated the presidents fy2009 budget request included 723 million for the lust program account this is due to difference in the accounting of funds for certain activities authorized in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 the presidents request reflected funding for these activities within the amount for underground storage tank categorical grants under the stag account consistent with the enactment of appropriations for fy2008 the house appropriations committee included these re quested funds within the lust program account and adjusted the presidents request to 926 millio n for comparative purposes accordingly the committee also adjusted the presidents request for the stag account downward by the same amount to reflect this accounting difference b the rescissions are from unobligated balances from funds appropriated in prior years and made available for expenditure in later year they include 50 million rescinded from prior years and made available in fy2008 the presidents budget request included 100 m illion that would be rescinded from prior years and be made available in fy2009 in effect these rescissions increase the availability of funds for expenditure by the agency in the years in which they are applied functioning as an offset to new appropriations by congress key funding issues there have been varying levels of interest in the presidents fy2009 budget request for individual programs and activities administered by epa much of the attention has focused on funding for wate r infrastructure proj ects the cleanup of hazardous waste sites under the superfund nd brownfields progra ms and scientific research on human health effects upon whic h pollution control standards are based selected funding issues receiving more prominent attention are discussed below water infrastructure appropriations for water infrastructure projects are allocated within epas state and tribal assistance grants stag account most of these funds are devoted to grants th at support state revolving funds srfs these grant funds provide seed monies for states to issue loans to communities for wastewater and drinking water infrastr ucture projects the presidents fy2009 budget request included 5550 million for th clean water srf to support local wastewater infrastructure needs 1341 million less than the fy2008 appropriation of 6891 million the fy2009 request for the drinking water srf was 8422 million 131 million increase above th fy2008 appropriation of 8290 million the adequacy of federal funding to assist states in capitalizing their clean water srfs is perennial issue although appropr iations for these grants have declined in recent years congress had been providing significantly more funding than the president requested this stemmed from diffe ring views on the extent of the federal role in capitalizing these state loan f unds departing from this trend the fy2008 enacted appropriation was closer to the presidents request than in past years the presidents fy2009 request would have further reduced the federal role in capitalizing these loan funds there gene rally has been less disagreement between congress and the administration about the federal role in capitalizing the drinking water srfs however some members continue to assert that more federal funds are needed to help capitalize these latter an funds noting more stringent federal drinking water standards with which communities must comply httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34461crs48 76 42 usc 9601 et seqalthough the srf grants represent the bulk of epa funding for water infrastructure congress also has suppor ted these needs through congressionally directed funding for speci project grants within the agencys stag account as in past budget requests the presidents fy2009 request did not include funding for these special projects as the administration views them solely to be the priorities of congress for fy2008 congress appropr iated 1329 million within the stag account for 280 special project grants and id entified the intended recipients in the explanatory statemen t accompanying the fy2008 appropriations law each recipient generally is required to provide 45 of projects cost in matching funds but the grants do not require repayment as do loan funds from the srfs funding for epas water infrastructure gran ts also has been an issue within the context of economic stimulus legislation as passed by the house on september 26 2008 the job creation and unemployment relief act of 2008 hr 7110 would provide emergency supplemental appr opriations for fy2009 for many federal programs and activities these funds are intended to stimulate the economy through various means the bill would provide total of 75 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for epa in fy2009 this additional amount would double the agencys funding level relativ to the fy2008 enacted appropriation of nearly 75 billion of the 75 billion proposed in hr 7110 65 billion would be allocated to the clean water srf to support wastewater infrastruct ure projects the remaining 10 billion would be allocated to the drinking water srf municipal water agencies have questioned the greater funding priority in the bill for the clean water srf noting that funding needs for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure are comparable based on some estimates superfund the presidents fy2009 ame nded budget request included 129 billion for the hazardous substance s uperfund account 344 million more than the fy2008 appropriation of 125 billion this account primarily funds the cleanup of contaminated sites on the national priorities list npl of the nations most hazardous waste sites and s upports numerous activitie s related to that effort these amounts indicated for the fy2009 request and the fy2008 enacted appropriation are the total amounts for the superfund account prior to transfers to the science

superfund pr ogram to fund the cleanup of contamination when respon sible parties cannot be f ound or cannot pay total funding for the superfund account has remain ed relatively flat over the past decade some members of congress and the bush administration continue to assert that steady funding is sufficient to maintain constant pace and adequate degree of cleanup considering the costs borne by

necessary to expedite the pace of cleanup and to clean up sites more thoroughly some also have observed that funding has declined over time in real dollar values when accounting for inflation resu lting in fewer resources to maintain consistent pace of cleanup concern about the availability of re sources has renewed interest among some as to whether supe rfund taxes on industry should be reinstated the authority to collect these taxes expired on december 31 1995 the remaining revenues were essen tially expended by the end of fy2003 since that time congress has funded the superfund account w ith general treasury revenues the allocation of funds within the superfund account for the actual cleanup of sites also has been an issue th president proposed 7800 million for actual cleanup activities in fy2009 34 milli on less than the fy2008 enacted appropriation of 7834 million funding for site cleanup includes support for both shortterm removal actions to address immediate risks of exposure to contamination and longterm remedial actions intended to provide more permanent means to prevent exposure the balance of th superfund account funds numerous activities not directly involved in th physical cleanup of contamin ated sites per but that support this goal in some way in rms of funding some of the major cleanup related activities include enfo rcement against responsible parties to require payment of their shares of cleanup costs and res earch of more effective cleanup methods with funds transferred to the sc ience and technology account the growth of funding within the superfund account for homeland security activities also has been an issue among those concerned about the availability of resources to clean up existing sites superfund homeland

lived on navajo partitioned land according to onhir data by the end of fy2005 according to onhir 98 of the currently eligible na vajo families and 100 of the hopi families had completed relocation in addition however onhir estimated that about half of roughly 250 navajo families not all of them eligib families who live on hopi land and signed accommodation agreements under pl 104301 that allow them to stay on hopi land under hopi law might wish to opt out of these agreements and relocate using onhir benefits onhir estimated that as of the end of fy2006 76 eligible navajo families were awaiting relocation eight of thes 76 families still reside d on hopi partitioned land one of these families was seeking relocation home and the other seven refused to relocate or sign an accommodation ag reement onhir and the us department of justice were negotiating with the hopi tribe to allow the seven families to stay on hopi land as autonomous families in retu rn for onhirs relocating off hopi land those families who had signed accommodation agreements but later decided to opt out and accept relocation in its fy2008 budget justification onhir had estimated that relocation moves for currently eligible families would be completed during fy2009fy2010 onhir also had estimated that the addition of navajo families who opt out of accommodation agreements and of navajo families who filed late applications or appeals but whom onhir is acco mmodating to avoid litigation83 and who are certified by onhir would not extend relocation moves beyond fy2010 onhir noted however that this schedule for co mpletion of relocati ons would depend on infrastructure needs and relo catees decisions in add ition according to onhir any required postmove assistance to relocatees would necess itate another two years of expenditures after the last relocation move congress has been concerned at times bout the speed of the relocation process and about avoiding forced reloca tions or evictions in the 109th congress legislation passed the senate but not the house to sunset onhir in 2008 and transfer any remaining duties to the secretary of the inte rior further longstanding proviso in onhir appropriations language reta ined for fy2008 prohibits onhir from evicting any navajo family from hopi pa rtitioned lands unless replacement home were provided this language appears to prevent onhir from forcibly relocating navajo families because of onhirs b acklog of approved relocatees awaiting replacement homes as the backlog is reduced however forced eviction may become an issue if any remaining navajo families were to refuse relocation and if the hopi tribe were to exercise ri ght under pl 104301 to begin legal action against the united states for failure to give the hopi tribe quiet possession of all hopi partitioned lands the purpose of th negotiations among onhir the justice department and the hopi tribe ntioned above was to avoid thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34461crs62

foot the project is expected to cost 212 million funding issue receiving broad attention is the level of commitment by the federal government to implement restoration activities in the everglades some observers measure commitment by the frequency and number of projects authorized under cerp and the appropriations they receive because onl two restoration projects have been authorized since wr da 2000 these observers are concerned that federal commitment to cerp implementation is waning others assert that the federal commitment will be measurable by the amount of federal funding for construction expected when the first pr ojects break ground in the next few years some state and federal offi cials contend that federal funding will increase compared to state funding as cerp projects move be yond design into construction still others question whether the federa l government should maintain the current level of funding or increase its commitment because of escalating costs and project delays much of the concern over funding is focu sed on the requested ppropriations for two newly authorized restoration projects th indian river lagoon and picayune strand which are expected to be implemented by the corps concerns over p hosphorus mitigation since fy2004 interior appropriations laws have conditioned funding for th modified water deliveries project based on

for the five fiscal years ending in fy2001 appropriations for federal land acquisition had more than tripled rising from 1366 million in fy1996 to 4534 million in fy2001 the appropriation for land acquisition has subsequently declined to roughly the fy1996 level to 1297 million for fy2008 the decline may be attributed in part to increased interest in allocating funding to nds already in federal
