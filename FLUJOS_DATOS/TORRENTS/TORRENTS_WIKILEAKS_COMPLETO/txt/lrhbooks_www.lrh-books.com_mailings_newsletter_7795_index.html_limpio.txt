scio knowing in the fullest meaning of the word and the greek word logos study of in itself the word means literally knowing how to know scientology is further defined as the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself universes and other life any comparison between scientology and the subject known as psychology is nonsense early psychology such as that begun by st thomas aquinas and extended by many later authors was in 1879 interrupted severely by one professor wundt marxist at leipzig university in germany this man conceived that man was an animal without soul and based all of his work on the principle that there was psyche greek word meaning spirit psychology the study of the spirit or mind then came into the peculiar position of being study of the spirit which denied the spirit for the subsequent decades wundtian psychology was taught broadly throughout the world it taught that man was an animal it taught that man could not be bettered it taught that intelligence

psychology scientology is route way rather than dissertation or an assertive body of knowledge through its drills and studies one may find the truth for oneself it is the only thing that can show you who you really are the technology is therefore not expounded as something to believe but something to do the end result of scientology studies and drills is renewed awareness of self as spiritual and
