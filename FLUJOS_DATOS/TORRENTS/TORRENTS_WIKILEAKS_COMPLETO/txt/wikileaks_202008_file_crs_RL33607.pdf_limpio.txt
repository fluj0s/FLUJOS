report suggests that nuclear and conventi onal military capabilities can s imultaneously have positive effects on deterrence or warfighting and negative effects on crisis stability or war termination objectives therefore changes in military force structure or capabilities to improve deterrence for example s hould consider potential effects on crisis stability for example further investments in military capabilities that may positively contribute to all potential stages of military conflict eg deterrence crisis stability warfighting and war termination might be preferred to investments that

department of defens dod are engaged in an extended discourse over the future direction of us defense strategy and military force structure1 in the past these discussions have focused almost exclusively on questions related to us conventional military forces w ith discussions about nuclear weapons held in separate fora however the 2005 quadrennial defense review qdr examined both nuclear and conventiona l forces first in the qdrs history2 as result this indicates that analysts both inside and outsi government are beginning to review and assess the relationship between conventional and nuclear weapons the purpos of this report is to support this assessment using possible conflict with china as framework or case study dods attention to possible military c onflict with china appears to have increased since the end of the cold war such potential conflict presents the challenge of very complicated politica leconomicsocial rela tionship among the participants it also presents the noteworthy military challenges of defending distant ally or friendly country from proximate adversary possessing large conventional forces and nuclear weapons cap able of reaching the continental united states many in dod appear to consider military conflict with china to be pacing threat the military capabilities required to ccessfully cope with this scenario are likely to be adequate to c ope with other and presumab ly less challenging stateon state conflicts practical decisions regarding how the united states might most effectively equip its forces and develop strategies for their use to contend with possible military conflicts with china raise obvious issues concerning the structure of us conventional forces and the role of nuclear deterrencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs2 3 generally speaking european nato member s resisted improvements to conventional force capabilities in part based on the argument that it would raise the nuclear threshold and make conventional war appear more winnable to the warsaw pact the united states in general favored increasing nato conventional military capabilities because if the nuclear threshold were breeched both us and natona tion cities would likely be attacked as consequenceinterplay between conven tional and nuclear forces during the cold war assessments of the interplay between nuclear and conventional forces were most relevant and most often debate d in scenarios that pitted the united states and its nato allies against the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies defense planners recognized and calculated the effect perceived balance or imbalance of conve ntional and nuclear forces might have on deterrence crisis stability and the outcome of potential conflicts in europe specifically the united states sought to extend deterrence and protect its nato allies with both conventional and nuclear forces for much of the cold war natos conventional forces were perceived to be weaker than those of the warsaw pact and were allowed to stay that way in part because nucl ear weapons were seen as less costly alternative to large conventional force stru cture many analysts argued that under these circumstances the united states and nato could deter soviet and warsaw pact attack by threatening to escalate the conflict to nuclear use others however questioned whether such threats were credib in light of the fact that the soviet union could have responded w ith nuclear attacks of its own as result analysts often argued the pros and cons of in creasing natos conventional force capabilities and the potential this might have for enha ncing deterrence and raising the nuclear threshold3 dods 2002 nuclear posture review n pr constructed new triad consisting of offensive strike weapons missile defense nd the nuclear weapons infrastructure to describe the capabilities that are part of the us nuclear posture the old nuclear triad consisted of landbased icbms sealaunched ballistic missiles slbms and nucleararmed long range bombers thus the new triad appears to be much broader construct one noteworthy aspect of the new triad s offensive strike component is the planned interplay between nuclear nd conventional weapons dod seeks to integrate nuclear and conventional capabilities in some military plans and applications where hitherto only nuclear weapons were thought to play role administration officials suggest that this integration may reduce potential us reliance on nuclear weapons studies and analyses subsequent to the npr have sought to consider whether the addition of conventional weapons to u s nuclear plans might alter the role of nuclear weapons few appear to have asked however whether the integration implied in the new triad might alter the ro or requirements fo r us conventional weapons further very few if any of th considerations appear to have informed the debate over budget and procur ement of conventional weaponshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs3 4

warfare catastrophic threats include missile attack s on the united states enemy employment of weapons of mass destruction some dod leaders say that todays c onventional and nuclear forces are well suited to deter stateonstate conflict and that the primary challenges are deterring nonstate actors4 this may be true however dod currently faces much more complicated stateonstate security environment than it did during the cold war when possible war with the soviet union dominated planning and procurement activities many potential military challenges exist eg north korea or could emerge eg iran or reva nchist russia but possible conflict with china is often mentioned as the military scenario of great concern to military planners politicomilitary uncertainty conducting review of military strategy and force structure today is likely to be dominated by two overarching themes the first theme is uncertainty relative to the past contemporary defense planners must now consider broad and diverse menu of national security challenges when examining the relationship between conventional forces and nucl ear deterrence and assessing the most effective mix of forces during the cold war the threats confronting the united states were reasonably well understood and comparativel predictable if the united states had the military capabilities to deter or defeat its most stressing threat eg the soviet union then these military capabilities were deemed adequate to address lesser included cases such as nation states with more modest military capabilities or even nonstate actors such as insurgents and terrorists th terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 graphically illustrated that todays nonstate actors can ex ploit relatively inexpensive and commercially available t echnology to conduct very structive attacks over great distances few observers today consider nontr aditional threats to be lesser included cases increasingly it is recognized that in many cases combating nonstate threats presents different and in many cases greater set of challenges than combating conventional military foe key question for contemporary defense planners is what proportion of us military capabilities should be focused on tr aditional military challenges and what proportion should be focused on nontrad itional challenges such as irregular disruptive and catastrophic threats5 preparing for nontraditional threats will likely call for much different investment pattern than strategy that seeks to furtherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs4 6 dov s zackheim the

the second theme affecting any current st rategy and forces review is that of resource constraints owing to growing concerns about cont rolling the overall size of the federal budget it appears that pr essure is building on dod leaders to make strategy and force structure decisions with costeffectiv eness in mind for example the cost of the ongoing operations in iraq and afghanistan could have much higher price tag than the 357 billion allocated to date7 some economists estimate that the final cost to us taxpayers could be 2 trillion8 in the past most of the funds for iraq and afghanistan have been provided through supplemental appropriations the office of management and budget omb however reportedly will resist any future large supplemental appropriations whic h may increase turbulence within dods annual spending plans9 further in june 2006 the senate passed an amendment of the fy2007 defense authorization bill that could restrict the use of emergency supplemental war funding10 longterm dod spending plans are already experiencing intense pressure the congressional budget office cbo estima tes that dods spending plans are underfunded by 50150 billion annually during the years covered by the qdr11 such projected shortfalls lead some obser vers to believe that dod will increasingly be forced to make hard decisions about fo rce structure such as having to choose between purchasing new equipment and main taining old equipment another choice may have to be ma between purchasing new equi pment and maintaining personnel end strength12 failure to adequately consider the po ssible interaction be tween nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy on th one hand and the size nd capabilities of conventional weapons on the other and failure to plan for and budget

res some understanding of both us and chinese nuclear strategy and doctrine forces and strategy are not static but evolve over time thus general discussion of the subject may be useful united states the us nuclear strategy and doctrine has evolved over 50 years it can be roughly divided into three distinct eras co ld war postcold war and present or 21st century strategy cold war deterrence during the cold war the s oviet union was the primary country to be deterred by us military forces the united states sought to develop policy and nuclear forces that it be lieved were needed to convin ce the soviet union that any nuclear attack on the united states would be met with retaliatory attack against the full range of valued targets in the soviet union other countries such as china and the countries of eastern europe were cove red by us nuclear war plans but their presence reflected their relationship with the soviet union more than any independent threat they might pose to the united states or its allies the united states also expected its nuc lear weapons to ter soviet nuclear attack conventional attack or coercion aimed at us allies in europe and asia13 many believed the united states needed to threaten nuclear retaliation to deter these threats because the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies had far greater numbers of conventional forces than did the united states and its nato allies according to this view if war was fought with only conventional weapons us and nato forces could be overrun therefore the ited states fielded variety of strategic theater and tactical nuclear weapons that might be used to repel and defeat such an attack this doctrine came to be known as exte nded deterrence the theory underlying this doctrine was that if any level of aggression against us allies could escalate into nuclear conflict that might involve att acks on the soviet ion then the soviet union might be deterred from all levels of aggr ession this theory was not without critics however as some analysts questioned whether the soviet union wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs6 14 there was calculated strategy for war winning or termination beyond that of producing as

continuedbelieve that the united states would us nuclear weapons to defend its allies particularly if such use might invite s oviet nuclear attack on the united states strategic doctrine and targeting during the 1950s the strategic doctrine known as massive retaliati on envisioned simultane ous massive integrated us nuclear strike against targets in th soviet union eastern europe and china if the soviet union or its allies initiated any nuclear or conventiona l attack against the united states or its allies14 in the early 1960s the united states developed doctrine of damage limitation which called for attacks agains t soviet conventiona l and nuclear military forces this counterforce strategy explic itly excluded attacks designed to destroy cities and focused instead on attacks that would impede the soviet unions warfighting capability15 in particular it sought to destroy those weapons that the soviet union might use to attack us c ities in the mid1960s dod developed the doctrine of assured destruc tion strategy that was signed to convince the soviet leadership that soviet society would be destroyed if the soviet union launched an attack on the united states or its allies but by the early 1970s many again questioned the credibility of doctrine that called for massive strikes against soviet society particularly if the soviet union could threaten to strike back against us cities therefore the united states sh ifted its doctrine once again to flexible response in the mid1970s and countervailing strategy in the late 1970s these policies emphasized retaliatory strikes on soviet military forces and warmaking capabilities as opposed to attacks on civilian and industrial target s and they called for limited focused attacks on specified military targets instead of largescale attacks on greater number of sites16 postcold war deterrence in its 1995 national security strategy report the clinton administration stated that the dissolution of the soviet empire has radically transformed the security environment facing the united states and our allies the primary security imperative of the past half century containing communist expansion while preventing nuclear

nuclear arsenal that could threaten the survival of the united states the clinton administration also argued that nuclear weapons served as hedge against an uncer tain future guarantee of our security commitment s to allies and disincentive to t hose who would contemplate developing or otherwise acquiring their own nuclear weapons18 the clinton administration did not consider china to pose direct threat to the united states as regional or global advers ary nevertheless dod officials testified that chinas small nuclear force is still formidable and china continues to make steady efforts to modernize those forces assistant secretary of defense ted warner stated that the united states could not be sure that it would not need nuclear weapons to deter china in the future19 the clinton administration also identified other threats to us national security specifically noting in its national security strategy report for 1998 that weapons of mass destruction pose the greatest potential threat to global stability and security20 strategic doctrine and targeting although the clinton administration maintained the us focus on deterring potential russian threat it did issue new guidelines for us nuclear strategy in late 1997 in document known as pdd60 the administration stated that our military planning for the possible employment of nuclear weapons is focused on deterring nuc lear war rather than attempting to fight and win protracted nuclear exchange21 in practice this probably meant that the united states would not seek to cause as much damage against as wide range of targets as it had planned on attacking in previous war plans but clinton administration officials also noted that this did not alter the structure of us nuclear war plans or the variety of options available to the president for us retaliatory strike many press reports about pdd60 highlighted the provisions covering the use of us nuclear weapons to deter nations other than russia and viewed this as an expansion of the role of us nuclear weapons however the united states has never maintained first use policy nd has always retained the option to use nuclear weapons in response to attacks by conventional chemical or biological weapons these policies did not change in the 1990shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs8 22 us senate committee on armed services st atement of the honorable douglas j

in the us arsenal that can hold at risk the full range of targets valued by an adversary they continue to play key role in us deterrent strategy however in contrast with the clinton administrations focus on potential russian threat the bush administration has stated that russia and the united states are longer enemies even though russia re tains thousands of nuclear weapons the increased cooperation between the two na tions has allowed new strategic framework to replace the cold wars adversarial relationship the bush administration has emphasized however that the united states faces threats from multiple potential opponents sources of conflict and unpreced ented challenges23 and that these challenges must be taken into consideration when the united states plans its nuclear weapons policy and force posture according to the administration these adversaries could include nonstate act ors and terrorists as well as nations such as china24 iran north korea and others in the past us policy essentially vi ewed nuclear weapons apart from the rest of the us military establishment with nuclear weapons serving to deter global nuclear conflict with the soviet uni on or russia in contrast the bush administration has describe d more comprehensive role for nuclear weapons arguing that nuclear weapons along with ssile defenses and other elements of the us military establishment not only deter adversaries by promising an unacceptable amount of damage in response to an adversarys attack they can also assure allies and friends of the us commitment to their security by providing an extended deterrent dissuade potential adversaries from challenging the united states with nuclear weapons or other asymmetrical th reats by convincing them that they can never negate the us nuclear deterrent and defeat enemies by holding at risk those targets that could not be destro yed with other types of weapons25 doctrine and targeting in describing the future role of nuclear weapons the bush administration has stated that the united states will not only rely on the threat of nuclear retaliation but will also seek to deter and defeat dversaries with precision conventional weapons which are hoped to be capable of destroying some targets that were assigned to nuclear weapons in the past and ballistic missile defenses which might deter attack by denying an adversary the ability to threatenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs9 26 ibid 27 statement of the honorable douglas j feith op cit 28 ibid dod is also using capabilities based approach to justify its

change as tailored deterrence with the united states developing more sp ecific responses that would rely on broader range of military capabilities to respond to the threats posed by emerging adversaries moreover the bush administration has stated that the united states will longer size and structure its nuclear forces to address the soviet threat27 instead it will employ capabilitiesba sed strategy where it w ould look more at broad range of capabilities and contingencies that the united states may confront and tailor us military capabilities to address this wide spectrum of possible contingencies28 specifically the united states would identify potential future conflicts review the capabilities of its possible adversaries identify those capabilities that the united states might need to att ack or threaten with nuclear weapons and develop force posture and nuclear weapons employment strategy that would allow it to attack those capabilities the bush administration has not discussed publicly how it will identify specific targets or allocate weapons in its capabilitiesbased strategy the most specific and visible change to emerge from this new targeting strategy has been the replacement of the cold war siop single integrated operational plan with new war plan known as oplan operations plan 8044 this document contains the major strike options and majo r contingency plans that had been included in the siop but could also include plan s for wider range of options against greater number of adversaries some press reports indicate that the administration has also developed companion contin gency plan conpl an 8022 22 which plans for the prompt us response to number of contingencies with nations other than russia reports indicate that most of the options in this new plan call for the use of conventional weapons but some also allow for the use of nuclear weapons early or at the start of conflict29 as result it is evident that the bush administration has not altered the us policy that permits the possible first use of nuclear weapons further the administration has stated that the united states would develop and deploy those nuclear capabilities that it would need to defeat the capabilities of any potential adversary whether or not it posse ssed nuclear weapons the focus will be on how we will fight not who we will fight30

director of central intelligence estimated in 2002 that the prcs strategic nuclear force could grow by 2015 to about 75 to 100 warheads deployed primarily against the united states36 still us government estimates have changed and china could deploy significant new capabilities such as multiple warheads also some experts have charged us intelligence with overestimating dramatic improvements as the modernization of chinas missile force has been slower than predicted for about 15 years37 china employs variety of basing mode s such as hardened silos and mobile launchers along with concealment and deception techniques to ensure that its missiles can survive first strike these basing modes can add hours or days to the amount of time that china would need to prepare its missiles for launch this long launch time could seriously hamper any effort by china to use these missiles in first strike against the united states because the united states would be able to detect launch preparations and possibl preempt the attack ho wever these basing modes could ensure the survivability of chinas ssiles in the event of us attack and help to guarantee that china would be able to launch retaliatory strike the prc has expressed strong opposition to us plans to deploy ballistic missile defenses us national and theater missile defenses even with limited numbers of interceptor

actually use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear nations39 china has not however ruled out the use of nuclear w eapons in retaliation for nuclear attack this is the essence of minimum deterrent strategy some observers note that declarator policy is poor measure of nuclear strategy because policy statements need not be consistent with actual military plans or warfighting others however believe that china is sincere in this policy of firstuse because its nuclear forces lack commonly recognized first strike capab ilities because of their propellant type and current deploy ment patterns china cannot launch its missiles promptly upon warning of an attack or early in crisis and add that the missiles lack the accuracy to dest roy an enemys retaliatory forces which could be key objective of nuclear fo rce strike the plas strategic nuclear modernization however combined with th occasional statements by some prc officials about chinas ability to strike th united states have led some to question whether china will change its minimum nuclear deterrent some have questioned whether china might pursue more proactive limited deterrence strategy with its nuclear weapons40 this strategy presumes that nuclear weapons can deter both nuclear and conven tional conflicts and that if deterrence fails nation could use nuclear weapons to control escalation and compel the

44 rumsfeld visits china the chinese side reiterates it will not use nuclear weapons first zhongguo tongxun she new china news agency october 20 2005to back down with this strategy china might not wait for an adversary to use nuclear weapons before it employed its own nuclear forces it could respond to conventional attacks with nuc lear weapons or it could th reaten nuclear attack to compel an adversary to cease hostilities or othe r actions short of war that it perceived as threatening to its interests many analysts believe that such strategy would be more useful to china if it sought to deter us intervention in crisis with taiwan particularly if it feared that the unite d states could achieve its objectives with advanced conventi onal weapons and without resorting to nuclear attacks such strategy also would address some of chinas concerns bout us missile defenses because chinese first strike might contain more warheads than retaliatory strike and therefore might be more capable of penetrating us missile defenses however limited dete rrence strategy would place added demands on chinas nuclear forces they would need to do more than simply survive and retaliate against cities or widearea targets after an attack china would need variety of delivery vehicles and warheads types along with relatively high accuracies on its weapons so that it could credibly threaten to attack the full range of targets from forces in the field to military facilities and urban areas it would also need to develop relatively complex warfighting strategies and would need advanced command and control capabilities so that it could direct its attacks and monitor their effects china might seek to develop these capabilities in the longer term but dod reports evidence that chinas first use doctrine has actually changed41 chinas nuclear force capabilities and nuclear doctrine have been monitored closely many observers were concer ned for example when in july 2005 pla major general zhu chenghu told wester n journalists in beijing that if the americans draw their missiles and positionguided ammunition into the target zone on chinas territory i think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons zhu also dismissed chinas declared first use po licy saying that the policy applied only to nonnuclear states and could be changed42 some argued that gen zhus comments were reaction to chinas concerns about the growing challenges presented by us defense policy nd nuclear strategy43 others downplayed zhus remarks saying they reflected his personal opinion for example the commander of

efforts illustrative scenarios requirements for military force structure and capabilities are often expressed in terms of the number and type of conflicts that can be ddressed by that force for

different formulas such as the 142 1 formula us forces should be able to defend the us homeland operate in four key forward regions engage in two nearly simultane ous regional continge ncies and swiftly prevail in one of those conflicts55 debate rages over such formulas because they are euphemisms for breadandbutter issues such as larger or smaller fighter aircraft forces bigger or smaller army and whether to spend more money on space systems or on ground equipment56 in the 2005 national defense strategy of the united states of america dod describes how it has adopted new pproach for

characteristics of tomorrowshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs18 57 ibidmilitary some argue that we must take hard look at feasible realworld contingencies57 examining feasible contingencies or scenarios can be useful in determining the preferred size and characteristics of us military forces in various contexts do some scenarios place greater emphasis on air and naval forces do others require greater commitment of ground forces perhaps mo re important how relevant are nuclear weapons in particular scenarios and how exactly might they influence the conflict or crisis for example some observers contend that the availability of nuclear weapons can help deescalate conflict by reminding all the parties of the risks of escalation others argue that nations ability to strike critical targets at the start of conflict can place pressure on the other nation to preempt such potential attack escalating the crisis and possibly complicating efforts to end it short of allout war dods 2006 report to congress on chin as military capabilities notes that chinas current options to prevent taiwan from claiming formal independence include persuasion and coercion if china we re to resort to overt military force the dod report outlines four possible courses of actionthe pla would be likely to take missile strikes and information opera tions an air and missile campaign naval blockade and an amphibious invasion dods scenarios are not exhaustive howev er as additional s ources of conflict could emerge between the united states and china for example taiwan in expectation of chinese attack could take the initial overt military action in the conflict further possibl conflicts between china nd japan might unfold and draw in the united states illustrative scenarios that capture these additional dynamics are addressed below examining these scenarios can contribut to an understanding of us force requirements and the potential dynamics of the conflict this assessment focuses on the possible interaction betw een conventional and nuclear forces rather than on the specific order of battle nd force levels the united states might need in each particular scenario scenario sof infiltration of taiwan china attempts to insert military special operations forces sof into taiwan the total number of troops involved c ould be somewhere between 100 and 1000 the method of attempted inf iltration is small boats s ubmarines and helicopters sof forces cooperate with covert prc intelligence operativ already in taiwan to conduct disruptive attacks on taiwans political economic communications and military centers of gravity specific targets could include political and military leaders power generation and transportation infrastructure early warning radars and command and control facilities the purpose of these actions could be to foment fear and unrest in the taiwanese population in an attempt to undermine taiwans government another potential purpose of th is infiltration may be to facilitate ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs19 followon combined arms attack by the pla this attack could be preceded or accompanied by cyberwarfare or an information operations campaign against taiwans political and military organizations scenario b maritime conf lict between china and japan chinas peoples liberation army navy plan deploys destroyer two submarines and other ships to support ch inese oildrilling operations near islands in the east china sea that are claimed by china but controlled by japan called senkaku by japan diaoyu by china japan deploys p3 maritime patrol aircraft two aegis destroyers and f15 fighters to monitor plan activities nighttime collision between chinese submarine and japanese destroyer results in damage to both vessels and numerous casualties japanese forces attempt to assist the severely damaged submarine and chinese destroyer interprets the action as hostile it fires two antiship missiles which are intercepted by the aegis destroyers defenses naval forces in the area sepa rate and further shots are fired the chinese submarine sinks with additional casualties both japan and china prepare to dispatch additional forces to the regi on japans ambassador to the united states requests personal meeting with the president to discuss the us japanese mutual security treaty scenario c fullscale co mbined arms attack on taiwan this scenario is the military conflict that is most often discussed in defense circles and may represent the worst case for both taiwan and the united states in this scenario china would employ air land and naval forces in an attempt to invade taiwan defeat the taiwanese military and impose military control over the island one of chinas military objectives would lik ely be to prosecute successful attack as quickly as possible to reduce the ability of the united states or potentially other allies from intervening in the conflict scenario d preemptive attack by taiwan on prc military forces fearing that pla plaaf plan exercise is actually defacto mobilization and the prelude to an imminent attack on taiwan taipei launches an attack on chinese forces and infrastructure across the taiwan strait specific military actions by taiwan include air and missile attacks on chinese ports airfields ballistic missile sites and ground forces in southern chin taiwans navy conducts attacks on plan ships operating in chinese territorial waters taiwanese sof forces are reported to severely damage plan submarine believed to carry long range ballistic missileshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs20 analysis the analysis that follows seeks to study the role that us nuclear and conventional forces might play in four stages of each potentia l conflict deterrence prior to the start of the conflict crisis stability in the early stages of the conflict warfighting during the height of the conflic t and war termination objectives and potential challenges or shortcomings are identified deterrence deterrence is based on threat or promise to be effective this threat or promise must appear credible to the actor to whom it is directe d studies of deterrent theory suggest that credibility is something of nationallevel mind game perception of intent and capability is more important to deterrence than actual intent and capability in some instances clear indication of military capabilities and intentions has more deterre nt value than an ambiguous indication of capabilities and intentions in other instances reverse is true finally cultural societal linguistic historical and other qualitativ differences between countri play role in what might deter conflict and what does not given these uncertainties it appears that us deterrence objectives in these illustrative scenarios may be to field nuclear and conventional forces 1 that are more capable than the chinese forces 2 that are postured in way that makes their use appear credible and 3 cast doubt on whethe r china would be able to satisfy its military or political objectives at an acceptable cost in some circumstances the mere existence of military capabilities may be sufficient to deter military aggression some analysts argue that us and chinese nuclear weapons can overshadow all interaction between th two nations and deter behaviors that might lead to conflict that could escalate to nuclear use this school of thought appears to apply to scenario c combined arms attack and scenario d taiwan preempts the most overt uses of military force whether us nuclear forces actually would serve as the key deterrent in scenario c is unclear while superior us nuclear forces are clearly capable of severely punishing china for attacking ta iwan chinas ability to respond with nuclear attack on the united states albeit limited one could be sufficient to deter the united states from credibly threat ening nuclear response to chinas conventional attack s imilarly many fear that scenario d is plausible because of the questionable credibility of us extended deterrence to taiwan scenario sof infiltration and scenario b maritime conflict however represent crises where nuclear threats may not be credible and nuclear capabilities may not play an active role in deterrence because the level of violence is too low direct threat of nuclear use appears even less credible because the circumstances do not pose dire threat to national surv ival conventional us military capabilities also appear to have limited deterrent value in these scenarios in scenario there is unlikely to be unambiguous warning upon wh ich to act and it is not clear that ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs21 conventional forces would be more effective than taiwanese forces because scenario b is the result of an accident it by definition cannot be deterred crisis stability once conflict begins participants can f eel pressure to act quickly to control events and to manage the crisis in way that meets its interests this in turn can make the crisis escalate quickly and unpred ictably for example if its command and control systems were protected from att ack and offered redundant capabilities and its forces were not vulnerable to an early st rike by the adversary then nation could delay its response await further informa tion and possibly seek alternate means to resolve the conflict on the other hand if countrys command and control infrastructure and its key forces were vulnerable to attack early in conflict then it might feel compelled to act quickly using those forces before it lost them to attack and before it had complete information about the intent and capabilities of its adversary in pursuing the conflict preferably the capabilities or posture of nations conventiona l and nuclear forces would not inherently add to this instability specific us crisis stability objectives in these scenarios may include fielding forces that 1 are not vulnerable and do not make chinese forces vulnerable to use it or lose it pressures and 2 do not appear to be either vulnerable to or capable of political or military decapitation both the united states and china have currently deployed their longrange nuclear forces in ways that would not leave them vulnerable to first strike and therefore appear unlikely to undermine stability in crisis chinese forces lack the accuracy to attack us landbased forces and cannot effectively track and engage us submarines that carry ballistic missiles called ssbns chinese longrange missiles are deployed in deeply buried silos protected by rough terrain and mountains or deployed on mobile launchers therefore neither the united states nor china would experience pressure to use these weapons before losing them early warning and command and control systems could however still be vulnerable to disruption on both sides therefore efforts to disrupt these assets or other factors such as desire to achieve tactical rprise could stimulate prompt or accelerated responses as soon as crisis unfolds todays conventional forces do not appear to have capabilities or to be postured in ways that inherently erode crisis stability currently the great distance that most us forces must travel to address these s cenarios imply that they will not effect the conflict immediately in scenario the forces that might most usefully contribute to taiwans defense might be surveillance intelligence or information operations resources because these ssets could be deployed nd employed unobtrusively they appear unlikely to exacerbate crisis scenario b represents classic unstable crisis it was caused by an accident but the stakes rise quickly as each side tries to defend its interests and becomes more entrenched the nature of this crisis proba bly would not be affected at least in the early stages by us forces or the doctrin guiding their use as each nation focusedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs22 only on the actions of the other as the crisis unfolds us decision makers may not experience pressure to use its forces quickly to help resolve this crisis current us forces could be employed on purposefully long time line to allow the situation to cool and to give both countries time to fi nd diplomatic facesaving way to resolve the crisis both scenarios c and d evolve into conflicts so quickly that it is unlikely that nuclear forces would either exacerbate or calm the crisis however if the united states maintained the ability with its conven tional forces to attack critical targets in china and to disrupt chinas ability to prosecute the conflict china might feel compelled to move quickly to achieve its objectives this however may be more of an issue for consideration in the warfighting phase of the conflict than the crisis stability phase warfighting if the united states found itself drawn in to military conflict with china via any of the illustrative scenarios above it would wi sh to prosecute this conflict on its own terms specific warfighting objectives would likely include 1 limiting collateral damage to allied or friendl populations 2 minimizing u s taiwanese japanese casualties 3 emphasizing warfare in which the united states excels eg aviation and naval engagements and voiding warfare that presen ts obvious challenges eg urban warfare and 4 avoidi ng protracted conflict ar current us nuclear and conventional forces and doctr ine well suited to achieve these warfighting objectives us conventional military i nvolvement in scenario could present many of the challenges experienced in recent conflicts in somalia or iraq urban warfare in the midst of civilian population presumab ly civilians would form large or well armed militias in opposition to the taiwanese government such as the experience in iraq nevertheless the uncertainty regard ing the number of chinese sof forces and the difficulty of separating friend from foe and the need to severely limit civilian casualties could make it difficult to achieve the objectives above scenario b presents obvious cha llenges to todays conventional military forces in terms of achieving the warfi ghting objectives above there appears little chance for collateral damage for example managing crisis stability may be the biggest challenge in this scenario although most discussions of nuclear weapons focus on their ability to deter conflict deterrence rests on the adversar ies perception that nuclear weapons can achieve us warfighting objectives th at cannot be otherwise achieved by conventional weapons us nuclear wea pons could be used under wide range of circumstances but they would probably have the most to contribute in scenario c the combined arms attack if the united states determined that this level of warfare between china and taiwan threatened vital us interests it could be prepared to take whatever steps were necessary to defend its interests for example the united states might believe that it had to use nuc lear weapons to destroy targets in china that were critical to chinas ability to achieve its objectives that could only be reliably damaged or destroyed by nucle ar weapons these might include for example hardened or deeply buried bunkers housing weapons or command facilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs23 58 the military power of the peoples republic of

orourkethe united states would likely explore all possible conventional options for disabling or destroying these targets but that it would not rule out the use of nuclear weapons casualties are likely to be high regardless of th specific targ ets nuclear employment could bring the conflict to an abrupt end but the longterm political consequences from using nuclear weapons under any circumstances is unpredictable but feared to be considerable this could also defeat overarching us politico military goals such as regional stability and international s upport and consensus the challenges of achieving us wa rfighting objectives with conventional forces in this scenario are well documented58 it appears likely that airpower would be used to defeat chinas air force engaged in military action vs taiwan to destroy or degrade the invasion force and to stroy or disrupt the plas command control and communications the forces most likely to be employed include land and sea based fighter and attack aircraft long range bombers command nd control aircraft aerial refueling aircraft strategic and theater airlift aircraft and intelligence gathering aircraft the united states would use naval forces principally to destroy or degrade the invasion force naval forces would clear mines engage plan ships in transit and in port attacking targets in china and defend against missile attacks the navy would probably employ forces that include d carrier battle groups aircraft carriers attack submarines destroyers cruisers frigates and marine corps amphibious ready groups the air wings on these airc raft are composed of tactical combat aircraft and helicopters long range maritime patrol aircraft and mine countermeasures ships could also plausibly be employed of primary concern in scenario c are chinas antiaccess weapon systems eg advanced air defenses fighter aircraft naval mines antiship cruise missiles theater ballistic missiles designed to impede us operations in the theater the united states would seek to disable defeat or destroy these capabilities early in the conflict like the nuclear force balance between the us and china it is generally accepted that us conventional forces are superior to chinas conventional forces59 unlike nuclear forces however geographical distance and the resulting operational challenges of timeline ss and sustainment put us conventional forces at distinct disadvantage further the potential for hi gh numbers of us casualties ma diminish the us appetite for large scale conven tional warfare which may be required to prevail in scenario chttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs24 war termination if the united states found itself drawn into military conflict with china it would benefit from nuclear and conventional forces th at would facilitate war termination on favorable terms war termination objectives that appear to be appealing include 1 decisive victory 2 longterm improvement in the key regional politicomilitary relationships and 3 longterm need for increased us basing presence commitment in the region achieving these objectives in scenario appears to be difficult the threat of escalation possibly to the use of nuclear w eapons could play role in bringing the conflict in scenario to an end such action may appear decisive however threatening nuclear attacks is unlikely to improve the regional relationships and may not appear credible employment of us conventional forces may succeed in rolling back the chinese sof incursion and deterring or preventing escalation by the pla however once deployed it may be difficult to avoid longterm presence in or near taiwan to enforce or gu arantee the peace conditions achieving war termination objectives in scenario b appears more promising by brandishing its conventi onal and nuclear capabilities nd reminding china of the us commitment to japan the united states could possibly play significant role in ending the crisis on terms favorable to ja pan or at least not unfavorable to japan nonetheless the threat to leap to nuclear attack even in defense of treaty partner could seem extreme particularly if both china and japan were amenable to face saving way out of this accide ntal conflict deploying or using conventional forces could also demonstrate us commitment to japan possibly with greater credibility in either case increased presence or commitment by us forces is likely to be required the threat of escalation to nuclear weapons could play significant role in the termination of conflict in scenario c and may achieve us objectives of decisive victory and longterm increased us presence in the region whether terminating this major conventional conf lict by threatening the use of nuclear weapons will contribute to long term stability is unclear terminating the conflict with actual use of nuclear weapons appears likely to achieve the first objective of decisive victory but only if china does not retaliate with an attack on the united states as with scenario terminating th is conflict with conventional weapons capabilities appears advantageous but may risk the need for increased longterm us presence in the region scenario d appears to present noteworthy challenges to achieving war termination objectives this conflict would be very difficult to terminate without allowing either taiwan or china to wi n once this conflict had begun the stakes for both china and taiwan would be so high as to make it difficult to return to the status quo rapid and sustained deploy ment of large contingent of us or coalition forces might reassure taiwan sufficiently to terminate its attacks on the pla however the longterm costs of adopting such an obligation are probably unacceptable to the united states and th resulting peace could

from defense planners because it is regional competito r today and could over time grow to be nearpeer competitor analys ts can also easily identify flashpoints where the two nations might meet and feel compelled to defend national interests the united states has longstanding nuclear deterre nt relationship with china however during the cold war managing this relationship was far less important than managing the relationship with the soviet union with the demise of the soviet union and the improved relationship betw een the united states and russia the nuclear equation between the united states and china raises its own series of questions are existing us capabilities sufficient to deter or defeat china or other potential challengers would added or different capab ilities enhance the us position in conflict by enhancing deterrence easing crisis instabilities or hastening the end of hostilities on terms favorable to the united states and its allies the answers to these questions can inform decisions about the ba lance of nuclear and conventional capabilities in the us military force structure in time of growing budget scrutiny investment in several conventional weapon systems or concepts is frequently justified by their perceived utility in possible conflict with nearpeer competitors such as china61 often these weapon systems are among the more expensive programs in dods budget examples of these weapons or concepts include ballis tic missile defense prompt longrange conventional strike the f22a raptor advanced combat aircraft and the airborne laser the desired number of us navy aircraft carriers attack submarines anti submarine warfare ships and aircraft is also frequently linked to need to effectively counter potential chinese military action although not

the estimated costs of developing and fielding these weapons are the potential enhancements in one situation offset by potential liabilities in other situations might other investments offer more promise at lower costs what linkages exist between nuc lear and conventional forces the answers to these questions can also inform decisions about the balance of nuclear and conventional capabilities in the us military force structure nuclear deterrence as described earlier in this report it is too narrow to conclude that the united states and china have not engaged in an open armed conflict simply because each is deterred by the nuclear capabilities of th other potential flashpoints eg taiwan other territorial disputes have not ignited because both nations apparently recognize that on many fronts the costs of conflict would far exceed the benefits the us defense department for example contends that china is deterred from using overt military force against its ne ighbors by concerns over potential economic repercussions and fear of domestic instability62 some argue that as chinas economic and political interests in asia expand and as chinas military continues to develop the possibility of conflict could increase others however believe that the possibility of conflict is likely to decrease or at least not increase because the united states and china may find as many potential areas for cooperation as they do for co mpetition there is doubt that this calculation could change if the political and military factors associated with the flashpoints were to change as one part of this broad calculation however chinas assessment of the costs of c onflict would hinge heavily on its assessment of whether the united states would intervene and its assessment of whether the conflict might escalate to the use of nuclear weapons the bush administration has indicated and many agree that the united states can and should alter its nuclear force struct ure and nuclear doctrine so that they can play more prominent role in us national security policy others however question whether the threat of nuclear wea pons employment would be credible if the united states did not face dire threats to its national survivalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs27 63 chet richards neither shall the sword center for defense information press january 2006 washington dc 64 for discussion of the role that defenses can play in strategy of deterrence and denial see us nuclear policy in the 21st century fresh look at national strategy and requirements center for c ounterproliferation research national defense university january 2001 pp 337344concerns about the credibility of more prominent role of nuclear weapons in us national security policy are magnif ied when questions of extended deterrence for taiwan or japan come up because as noted above china coul d retaliate against us cities with its own nuc lear weapons however chinas threats of nuclear retaliation could also inspir questions about credibility china could launch small number of nuclear weapons at us territory if attacked by the united states but the united states could re taliate against china with fa r greater number of weapons and far broader nuclear attack hence it is possible that each could be deterred from escalating the conflict and any conflict would remain c onventional moreover the possibility that china could invite far greater destruction if it used its nuclear forces after the united states used relatively small number of nuclear weapons against discrete targets has led some to some argue that the current and foreseeable nuclear relationship between china and the united states suffices to deter conflict for example one observer states we are not going to fight russia china or india the main reason were not going to fight these guys is that they all have nuclear weapons63 some have suggested that chin might employ nuclear weapons to conduct an electromagnetic pul emp attack on the unite d states or us forces others however doubt the likelihood of ch an attack because it would affect chinas forces as well as us forces it is also unclear whether an adversary would interpret an emp attack as crossing th nuclear weapons threshold and how the adversary would respond much of the debate above is reflected in proposals to velop ballistic missile defense capabilities some argue that missile defenses including boost phase weapons like the airborne laser could in crease the deterrent value of us nuclear weapons even limited missile defenses could make the u s threat to escalate more credible because it would undermine chinas confidence in its ability to retaliate against the united states or its allies knowing this it is argued china would be deterred from initiating conflict that might draw in us response missile defense proponents also note that military conflict can evolve from accidents or miscalculations rather than cogent costben efit analysis therefore missile defenses could enhance crisis stability and the us ability to conduct th conflict on its own terms if china and the united states une xpectedly found themselves caught up in quickly escalating conflict64 others believe that the us development of ballistic missile defenses could upset the current stable balance in the uschina nuclear terrence equation in particular the united states does not yet have capable longrange missile defense system china could perceive us missile defenses as effectively swinging the military balance too much toward the united states and may thus decide to pursue military options against taiwan sooner rath er than later whil it could still deterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs28 65 these same arguments were made against ballistic missile defenses and in favor of the anti ballistic missile treaty abm during the cold war 66 it may be interesting to note that the origin rationale for developing many of these same weapon systems was to address threats from the soviet union 67 for more information see crs report rl33067 conventional warheads for longrange ballistic missiles background and issues for congress by amy f woolf 68 stephen trimble global strike concept raises hopes and fears flight international february 7 2006 michael bruno defense fficials outline longrange global strike plans aerospace daily defense report april 20 2006us nuclear attacks on its territory with the threat of retaliation65 thus the potential for future missile defenses it is argued could be destabilizing in crisis further the us pursuit of ballistic missile defenses could motivate china to develop more capable missiles or missile defense countermeasures such as decoys or early release submunitions or to field more missiles to increase its retaliatory capabilities consequently any warfighting advantages th at missile defense advocates desire it is argued are unlikely to be realized pa rticularly if china could build additional ballistic missiles or field ssile defense countermeasures more quickly than the united states could field ffective missile defenses new or improved conventiona l weapons or capabilities as mentioned above the prin cipal justification for many new and in some cases costly conventional military capabilities is that they are required to address possible conflict with china66 for example dod is expl oring options for fielding prompt global strike pgs capabilities these options include for example conventionally armed inter continental ballistic missile s icbms or submarine launched ballistic missiles slbms67 and new hypersonic air vehicles that would be capable of accurately striking transcontinental targets within 60 minutes68 dod argues that pgs systems would be ab to hold at risk targets that at present can only be destroyed with high confidence by nuclear weapons examples could include mobile burie d or hardened targets or command and control c2 facilities they could also attack promptly at the start of conflict destroying an enemys airdefenses or other antiaccess forces therefore prompt global strike capabilities might enhance terrence because these c onventionally armed weapons would be more useable and therefore more credible than nuclear weapons china could still retaliate against the united states or its allies but with its nofirst use policy in place and forces consistent with minimum nuclear deterrent it may not be able to respond with nuclear weapons thus supporters argue that the united states might have greater credibility when extending deterrence to its friends and allies if through accident or miscalculation war were to break out conventional weapons could offer improved warfighting capabilities that would allow the united states to prevail conventionally and raise the threshold for the employment of nuclear weapons for example chinas ba llistic missiles longrange air defenses long range surveillance radar and antiship cruise missiles are widely consideredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs29 problematic for dod these weapons are expected to strongly impinge on dods freedom to maneuver in this theater and overcoming these capabilities are likely to engender significant us casualties advocat argue that in warfighting context pgs and the f22 raptor by virtue of its stealth speed advanced sensors and avionics will be able to destroy or defeat these targets more effectively and with much less attrition than current weapon systems while these new conventional weapons might enhance deterrence they might also detract from crisis stability if conflict were to occur for example in scenario c combined arms attack neither us nor chinese nuclear forces appear postured in way that would exacerbate crisis over taiwan neither is vulnerable to first strike from the other however the same may not be true of conventional forces china may believe that its forces are vulnerable to an attack by either taiwan or the united states and that such an attack is bout to occur it may then believe that in spite of the risk of escalation and possi ble attacks conventi onal or nuclear on its own territory that it would be better off initiating the conflict during the crisis in essence then the us ability to defend taiwan by attacking targets especially centers of gravity in china could actually make crisis worse and could spur china to begin or expand its attack on taiwan it can also be argued that potent conve ntional forces those that truly overmatch chinas defenses may weaken deterrence as described in the background section of this report during the cold war relatively weak us conventional forces were viewed by many as consistent with str ong deterrence because th united states would have to quickly fall back on nuclear weapons if attacked by more potent warsaw pact forces in europe conclusion this report highlights number of policy issues that may bear consideration in the ongoing debate regarding investment s in conventional nd nuclear forces it appears that china and the united states currently have stable deterrent relationship this deterrence appears to be based on complicated nexus of economic political and military factors despite this deterrent relationship military conflict might ensue either as part of consciously pl anned strategy or due to mistakes misperception or accident together us nuclear and c onventional capabilities contribute to military deterrence and therefore it appears that it would be worthwhile to consider the inte rplay of nuclear and conventional capabilities in force structure and strategy decisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33607crs30 nuclear and conventional military capabilities can simultaneously have positive effects on deterrence or warfighting and negative effects on crisis stability or war termination objectives therefore it may be overly simplistic to make changes in military force structure or capabilities to improve deterrence for example without considering potential effects on crisis stability for example investments in military capabilities that may positively contribute to all potential stages of military conflict eg deterrence crisis stability warfighting and war termination might be preferred to investments that have mixed effect on the potential range of conflict
