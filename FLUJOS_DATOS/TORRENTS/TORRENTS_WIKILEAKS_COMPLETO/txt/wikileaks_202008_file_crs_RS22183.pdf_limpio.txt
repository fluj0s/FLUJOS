act agoa which are available to subsaharan african countries13 in february 2005 the united states submitted requests for gatt waivers for the three programs through their existing expiration dates 1 cbera as amended through september 30 2008 2 atpa as amended through december 31 2006 and 3 agoa through september 30 201514 these programs extend dutyfree treatment that in some cases is subject to quantitative restrictions nd thus the requests seek wa ivers not only of gatt article i1 but also of article xiii 1 and 2 which require nondiscrimination in administering quotas the united states submitted revised re quests in march 2007 re flecting legislative changes to these programs15 the requests have not yet b een approved with questions on the programs raised by brazil chin india pakistan and paraguay16 wtolegality of nontrade conditions in preference programs in european communities conditions for the granting of tariff preferences to developing countries the wto appellate body ab explained how developed country wto members may design preferentialtariff programs within the requirements of the enabling clause17 the dispute between india nd the european communities ec stemmed from an ec regulati on which awarded tariff preferences to closed group of 12 beneficiary countries on the condition th at they combat illicit drug production the drug arrangements india brought the cla im alleging that the drug arrangements were inconsistent with gatt article i1 and unjustified by the enabling clause the initial dispute panel in report i ssued on december 1 2003 concluded that the ec was in violation of its wto obligations with one panelist di ssenting on procedural grounds18 addressing the nature of the enablin g clause and its pro cedural implicationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22183crs5 two member majority first concluded that the enabling clause functions as an exception to the gatt article i1 mfn obligation and th at consequently the burden of proof rests on the party that invokes the enabling clause as defense 753 the lone dissenter argued that the mfn obligation does not apply to the enabling clause and that india did not properly bring the claim under the clau 915 921 employing broad reading of the term nondiscr iminatory in the clauses description of the gsp the panel concluded that developed countri were required to provide identical tariff preferences under gsp schemes to ll developing countries 7161 applying this standard the panel then ruled that the drug arrangements were inconsistent with gatt article i1 and could not be justified under the clause 7177 the european communities appealed the appellate body report issued on ap ril 7 2004 first addre ssed the relationship between gatt article i1 and the enabling cl ause the ab upheld the panels findings that the enabling clause is an exception to gatt article i1 and that the clause does not exclude the applicability of article i1 99 103 the ab explained that the enabling clause is to be read together with article i1 in the procedural sense since challenged measure such as the drug arrangements is submitted successively to the test of compatibility with the two provisions in other words when the enabling clause is implicated the dispute panel first examines whether measure is consistent with article i1 as the general rule and if it is found not to be so th panel then examines whether the measure may be justifie d under the clause 101102 noting the vital role played by the enabling clause in promoting trade as means of stimulating economic growth and development and th intent of wto members through the clause to encourage the adoption of preference schemes the ab found that the clause was not typical gatt exception or defense 106 114 thus the ab modified the panels finding and he ld that unlike the ordinary practice with respect to gatt exceptions under which ex ceptions are invoked only by the responding party it was incumbent upon complainant india to raise the enabling clause in making its claim of inconsistency w ith article i1 of the gatt 1994 and to identify specific provisions of the clause whic h it believed were violated by the respondents measure 115 123emphasis in original at the same time the burden of ju stifying gsp schemes under the cited enabling clause provisions still rests on respondent 125 in application the ab found that india sufficien tly raised the issue thereby placing the burden on the ec to justify the dr ug arrangements under the clause most importantly the ab reversed the pa nels substantive decision regarding the breadth of acceptable preference programs under the enabling clause the ab found instead that developed countries can grant pr eferences beyond those provided in their gsp to developing countries with pa rticular needs but only if id entical treatment is available to all similarly situated gsp beneficiaries 173 the ab elaborated that similarly situated gsp beneficiaries are all gsp benefici aries that have the development financial and trade needs to which the treatment is intended to respond 173 in reaching this conclusion the ab reversed th panels reading of the term nondiscriminatory as used to define the gsp in the enabling clause even under the more expansive view of the clause however the ab upheld the panels rulin g that the ec had failed to prove that the drug arrangements were in fact nondisc riminatory 189 two factors led the ab to its conclusion 1 the closed list of be neficiary countries in the drug arrangements could not ensure that the preferences would be available to all gsp beneficiaries suffering from illicit drug production and tra fficking and 2 the drug arrangements did not set

dopted the ruling the us representative stated according to meeting minutes that the united states was pleased that the appellate body had reversed the panels finding th at the enabling clause required developed countries under their gsp programs to provide identical preferences to all developing countries and that the abs decision w ould help maintain the viability of gsp programs19 the united states raised concerns however about the abs finding that complainant india needed to raise the clause but that the ec bore the burden of proving that the drug arrangements were consistent with the clause the united states questioned the legal basis for this hybrid approach suggesting that difficulties might ensue in allowing the complaining party to set the burden of proof for the respondent recent legislation pl 109432 extended the gsp program until december 31 2008 with provision calling on the president to revoke certain competitive need waivers and thus remove benefits for
