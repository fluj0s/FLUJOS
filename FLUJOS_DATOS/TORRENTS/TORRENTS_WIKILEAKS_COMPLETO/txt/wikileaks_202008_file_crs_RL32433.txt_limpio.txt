powers analyst in energy and environmental policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress the iraq marshes restoration activities summary during the 1990s saddam hussein drained approximately 90 of the iraqi marshes this action displaced 200000 to 250000 madan marsh arabs and severely harmed an important ecosystem efforts to rehabilitate the marshes have returned water to about 40 of the former marshland however reflooding additional areas and providing for longterm marsh restoration requires actions to maintain the quantity and quality of water flowing through the marshes to facilitate such efforts nongovernmental organizations and us contractors are working with iraqs ministry of water resources mwr ministry of environment the newly established center for restoration of the iraq marshlands crim and local iraqis to implement shortterm action plans calling for ecological and socioeconomic studies these draft studies and the associated monitoring and modeling activities will set the foundation for longterm restoration management plan implementing the overall plan will include training and equipping iraqi officials managing water supplies and negotiating international water agreements some of these efforts have already begun developing and implementing restoration plan will depend on continued funding current estimates for restoration costs include 10 million for developing sustainable restoration plan the iraq foundation and 25 million in projects for three years under the iraq marsh restoration program action plan the united states has provided support for ecosystem restoration and for assisting the madan through 4 million us agency for international development contract and through the us state departments and the us army corps of engineers support activities in its fy2004 request for supplemental appropriations the coalition provisional authority asked for 100 million for marsh restoration congress did not appropriate these funds and the presidents fy2005 budget request does not include targeted marsh restoration funding however as stated in hrept 108312 p 19 such efforts may receive

historically extended over 15000 to 20000 square kilometers km2 3749 million acres of interconnected lakes mud flats and wetlands1 see figure 1 fed by floodwaters2 and other inflows from the tigris and euphrates rivers these marshes became the largest wetland ecosystem in the middle east and western eurasia this wetland supported fish rice and water buffalo production that supported more than 350000 people known as madan or marsh arabs for more than 5000 years3 the marshes also provided important habitat for number of endemic species birds traveling the intercontinental flyway and aquatic species supplying coastal fisheries4 draining the wetlands while early inhabitants of mesopotamia built structures to capture water from the rivers and to protect themselves from floods plans to develop the marshes were not outlined until the middle of the 20th century5 even with plans on the drawing board largescale water projects were constructed sporadically and the marshes remained relatively intact into the 1980s during the 1980s and 1990s large water projects in iraq and upstream nations began affecting the mesopotamian marshes specifically dams built on the tigris and euphrates in turkey syria iraq and iran can store more than five times the rivers average annual flows6 this storage capacity allows upstream users to effectively eliminate the spring floodwaters that historically maintained the marshes 1 hassan partow the mesopotamian marshlands demise of an ecosystem narobi kenya environmental program 2001 available at httpwwwgridunepchactivities

they were not the immediate cause of marsh dessication beginning in the 1990s the iraqi government undertook number of massive water projects that severely reduced the marshes water supply through these efforts saddam hussein drained approximately 90 of the marshes by 20007 while the iraqi government claimed that it built these dikes dams and canals to increase land reclamation and irrigation others found evidence that the water projects were used for development purposes8 rather saddam hussein drained the marshes to give his army access to the region and to remove sanctuary where an estimated 9000 iranbacked shiite guerillas and thousands of deserters lived9 by 2000 the marshes had been severely diminished specifically the central and hammar marshes were reduced to small secluded parcels the largest remaining marsh the hawizeh marsh occupied third 1025 km2 or 253000 7 the bulk of the dessication occurred between 19911995 unep 2001 p 32 8 crs report 94320 f iraq marsh arabs and

arabs an estimated 40000 of these marsh arabs sought refuge in iran while 200000 to 250000 are considered to be internally displaced11 initial findings from us agency for international development usaidfunded census indicated that roughly 85000 madan still dwell in or alongside the remaining marshes12 between 2000 and 2002 an additional 325 square kilometers dried leaving about 7 of the marshes intact13 according to unep loss of the mesopotamian marshes stands out as one of the worlds greatest environmental disasters14 the marshes were major wintering ground for birds traveling the intercontinental flyway incomplete studies have recorded 134 bird species15 including 11 species of critical endangered or vulnerable birds16 the marshes also contained three species of endangered and vulnerable reptiles and mammals these species are now in more critical condition and may be extinct marsh rehabilitation number of entities are working to restore the iraq marshes even before president bush announced the end of hostilities on may 1 2003 reports and proposals for marsh restoration were developed by the environment program17 and the iraq foundation18 with 200000 grant from

ministries and its new center for restoration of the iraq marshlands crim in implementing proposals for marsh restoration marsh rehabilitation efforts include reflooding and monitoring research planning training and capacitybuilding and establishing international agreements further some entities are working on projects to increase the prosperity of the marsh dwellers reflooding and monitoring reflooding has been undertaken through breaching dams and embankments opening sluice gates and stopping pumping in some cases these activities have been undertaken by the us army corps of engineers at the direction of the ministry of water resources mwr in others areas were rewetted without consultation with the mwr aboveaverage rainfall and releases of water from iran have also contributed to reflooding marshlands as of june 2004 up to 40 of the former marshlands had been rewetted20 restoration is not as simple as rewetting former marshlands according to the iraq foundation vegetation has not returned to all of the rewetted areas in order to understand how best to pursue further restoration entities are monitoring some of the reflooded areas monitoring demonstration projects is the first step in the iraq foundations threestep process toward developing sustainable restoration plan they are pursuing this step with grants from italy to monitor the revegetation and rehabitation process at one of the recently flooded sites the abu zarag marsh and to examine ways to increase the amount of water available for marsh rehabilitation the iraq foundation has also received 140000 from usaiddai to monitor additional sites initial reports from these monitoring efforts include the return of 45 bird species two of which are on the endangered list unep also plans to monitor and assess the environmental character of changes taking place since unep officials are not present in iraq based on security policies they will monitor by collecting and analyzing satellite data research planning the rehabilitation of major wetland requires specific information on the former wetland site eg soil salinity vegetation and development and on the quantity and quality of available water prior to the fall of the hussein government marsh data was limited primarily to satellite imagery therefore major component of rehabilitation efforts is gathering sitespecific information in june 2003 and february 2004 teams of independent experts from dai duke university the iraq foundation the international resources group the iraq ministry of water the amar foundation and the university of basra collected data on soil water quality seed banks and other characteristics of the former marshlands the june trip revealed extensive reflooding and lower than expected salinity in most areas the iraq foundation has conducted monthly field surveys since august 2003 in addition to examining the status of the former marshlands efforts are underway to understand the regions hydrologic system the system that supplies 19 usaids work is through subcontractor development alternatives inc dai 20 personal communication with suzie alwash the iraq foundation apr 24 2004 crs5 water to and removes water from the marshes usaiddai hired the corps to conduct marsh studies and to develop water management model for the tigris and euphrates rivers this model is currently in development21 the iraq foundation and the danish hydraulics institute dhi are also working on marsh models dhi is working on pilot areas in hawizeh and hammar marshes and river model from baghdad south to the arabian gulf the iraq foundation is working on models of the central marshes these models will help clarify the quantity and quality of water available for the marshes planning the primary purpose of the various research and modeling efforts is to provide for comprehensive marsh restoration and management plan over the past year teams of experts have met to discuss restoration planning in february 2004 team of 71 experts from 6 countries22 joined together to work on an action plan focusing on integrated marsh management for usaids iraqi marsh restoration program23 usaiddais proposal for working to develop an integrated marsh management plan supports the broader work of the new center for restoration of the iraq marshlands crim24 according to the iraq foundation crims goal for the next year is to prepare sustainable restoration plan to prepare the plan the iraq foundations international technical advisory panel has recommended three actions 1 implement demonstration projects to observe how the ecosystem responds to re hydration 2 conduct series of comprehensive environmental surveys to be accomplished by iraqi scientists with the assistance of international experts to provide scientific basis for making wise landuse decisions and 3 obtain input from stakeholders to allow for decisionmaking through participatory process within iraq25 the iraq foundation has begun some of these activities with 2 million from italy but estimates that crim will need 10 million to complete this process and prepare the plan26 usaiddais iraq marsh restoration program includes some funding for these activities for example it includes 350000 towards strategic and comprehensive planning activities and 520000 for integrated marshland management training and capacitybuilding carrying out restoration actions and implementing longterm management plan require trained iraqi officials and well functioning ministries therefore entities are working to provide iraqi ministries 21 the us geological survey is helping the corps with this model 22 the countries include iraq the united states the united kingdom jordan australia and the czech republic

and training necessary to manage their waters and maintain the marshes usaiddai through the us army corps of engineers has trained two senior iraqi engineers at the corps modeling center in california they are also helping to set up soil and water lab for the mwr and to train iraqi staff other entities are also involved in training efforts the canadians who have pledged 2 million us are supporting the training of iraqi academics and unep is supporting capacitybuilding activities international agreements even with plans in place and trained iraqi staff sustaining the marshes will be difficult if not impossible without international cooperation much of the potential marshwater originates in and flows through the tigris and euphrates rivers in turkey the syrian arab republic and iran see table 1 dams in these countries can hold back five times the rivers annual flows since the quantity and quality of water available for the marshes depends on foreign water management unep and other organizations have been involved in promoting regional dialogue on the restoration of marshlands specifically unep is promoting bilateral dialogue between iran and iraq to identify potential areas of technical cooperation for the shared marshlands of alhawizehalazim27 in may 2004 unep hosted technical meeting between iran and iraq on the shared marshlands and the countries agreed to attend followup meeting in october 2004 which will aim to identify specific areas of cooperation28 similar meetings have not occurred with turkey or syria however turkey is aware of the iraqiran meetings and is providing water data to the corps for its modeling effort table 1 contribution of each country to the water potential of the tigris and euphrates rivers river turkey syrian arab iraq republic

visitedjune 14 2004 in addition to bilateral discussions entities have also been working to develop broader regional collaboration for restoring the marshes for example the unep is encouraging collaboration with the regional organization for the protection of the marine environment to highlight the connection between the marshes and the marine environment and to build support for restoration furthermore usaid through dai is examining the possibility of getting the mesopotamian marshes listed as world heritage site 27 personal communication with hassan partow unep june 3 2004 28 this is the first time the two countries have met to discuss shared water resources in 29 years crs7 socioeconomic activities along with ecosystem restoration activities usaiddai and other entities have been working to improve the socioeconomic condition of the marsh dwellers usaid with its development mission is working through its contractors and subcontractors on number of agricultural programs for example dai has facilitated the planting of 1000 date palms at one site and is planning planting at five more sites dai is also involved in aquaculture and is helping to improve the health of water buffalo by planting alfalfa and setting up veterinary facilities dai has also subcontracted with another nonprofit the amar foundation to conduct socioeconomic surveys of the madan and to start health clinics restoration funding in addition to its general agency oversight responsibilities the major issue facing congress concerning the restoration of the iraqi marshes is whether to appropriate funds for their rehabilitation in supplemental appropriations request for fy2004 the coalition provisional authority requested 100 million for the iraq marshes29 congress did not appropriate these funds however as stated in hrept 108312 other nations may contribute to the marsh restoration effort this report describes the status of project funding to indicate how any additional us appropriations might be utilized projects in february 2004 dai convened team of 71 experts from six countries to design an action plan focusing on integrated marshlands management through ecosystem management and restoration and social and economic assistance30 during february 2004 teams examined opportunities for marsh management agriculture livestock fishing public health and constructed wetlands this work identified set of tasks dai proposes to complete by december 31 2004 with its 4 million budget from usaid the team also proposed 71 million in additional tasks for year one these tasks are currently unfunded unfunded priorities include 35 million for master plan for water resources in iraq 450000 for marsh monitoring and 250000 for soil and water lab the group also identified 139 million in additional projects which are currently unfunded for years two and three funding the us state department the iraq foundation unep and other entities are working to solicit funding for marsh restoration projects as of june 2004 the united states italy japan canada australia denmark and great britain had pledged support for the marshes and marsh arabs denmark funded river navigation strategy italy provided 2 million for water modeling environmental assessments and water budgeting through the iraq foundation great britain funded technical experts through uenp and australia provided technical experts as noted earlier the united states through usaid contributed 4 million in funding split between ecosystem restoration and development activities japan pledged 11 million through unep most of which will fund water and sewage treatment projects within the marshlands area the united kingdom has also pledged funding to unep 29 coalition provisional authority request to rehabilitate and restore iraq sept 2003 30 us agency for international development iraq marshlands restoration program action plan april 2004 forward task order water indefinite quantity contract crs8 for environmental initiatives in iraq italy contributed more than 2 million in funding through the iraq foundation canada has pledged 2 million for the marshes and will be participating in conference to determine where best to direct that money project funding conclusions in total nations have pledged around 18 million some but not all of this funding will directly target marsh restoration it will also fund projects with less direct relationship to restoration eg sanitation water supply and economic development for the madan and other environmental projects in iraq this funding is insufficient to undertake the projects currently identified by usaiddai and the iraq foundation overall usaid report identifies projects that it estimates would cost approximately 25 million over three years the iraq foundation stated that crim will need approximately 10 million to prepare sustainable restoration plan and additional projects are likely to be identified over the next year as crim develops management plan for the marshes for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32433
