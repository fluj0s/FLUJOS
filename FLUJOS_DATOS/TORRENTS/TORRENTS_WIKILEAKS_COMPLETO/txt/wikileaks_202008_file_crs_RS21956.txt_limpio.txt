britain created the ckgr to protect the san traditional way of life in 1966 botswana was awarded its independence from british rule immediately after independence the botswana democratic party bdp which remains in power declared that botswana would be nonracial country in 1978 the government of botswana launched its remote area development program radp to bring services to remote area dwellers rad of which the san were key target beneficiaries under the radp program the government both provided water and social services to the san and created new settlements for them outside of the ckgr the biggest of these was new xade which provided extensive social services including hostels and maternity ward3 in 1986 the minister of commerce and industry announced that botswana would compulsorily relocate the san people outside of the ckgr action was taken to implement this decision until 1997 though some san voluntarily relocated during this time in 1997 xade functioning san community within the ckgr was completely relocated 19962002 saw an intensification of the governments policy of relocation4 diamonds implementation of the governments compulsory relocation policy followed the discovery of diamond kimberlite ie volcanic pipe containing diamondladen material in 1982 at gope inside the ckgr as result of prospecting by httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21956 two firms falconbridge and beers in 1996 the full evaluation of the site which caused debswana to state that it would not be commercially viable to mine the site was completed 5 in 2000 however beers was awarded threetosix year retention contract for the gope site it endows beers with mining rights to the site until 2006 despite the reported nonviability mining at the site some international human rights groups in botswana britain and southern africa contend that the future potential for diamond mining was the main reason for the removal of the san6 government of botswana position the government of botswana began

august 2002 more than 200 san have returned to the ckgr during this time governmental officials accused the san of attempting to create break away state within the ckgr7 the government maintains that the relocation of the san from the ckgr where their population averaged around 1500 between 1988 and 1996 is important for the preservation of the fauna and flora of the ckgr and will allow the bushmen to develop according to the socioeconomic practices of the larger contemporary society the government maintains that the san have largely stopped living their traditional way of life because of their involvement with the bakgalagadi8 an ethnic group related to the san which practices agriculture and animal husbandry rather than hunting and gathering way of life the government argues that the methods of cattle herding used by the san are destroying the flora and fauna of the ckgr in addition the government claims traditional methods of hunting with bowandarrow have been replaced with the use of firearms and that the san have formed permanent settlements within the ckgr and longer live traditional nomadic lifestyle some observers also allege that some san use vehicles to hunt charge denied by the san the department of wildlife and national parks has stated that the biomass measure of the volume of living organisms within httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21956 designated area more than doubled in the ckgr between 1986 and 1996 while the government maintains that the relocation program is encouraged to provide the san the benefits of development it has also stated that it can longer fund its remote area development program radp and that the san people must move out of the ckgr to existing settlements such as new xade the government of botswana believes that the new settlements outside of the ckgr will better equip the san people to live according to demographically predominant social norms9 the botswana government maintains that it has never employed force coercion or threats during its relocation of the san the government maintains that san are free to stay within the ckgr but that they would have to live without the government support they enjoyed under the governments radp the botswana government formally ceased providing services to remote area dwellers rads on january 31 2002 it maintains that this is solely due to operational costs10 views of the san and of human rights organizations some international human rights advocacy groups maintain that the government of botswana is removing the san from the ckgr so that they cannot claim any rights to minerals within the ckgr one such group survival international reports that by 2003 7 hitchcock r k we are the first people 8 the bakgalagadi are descendants of the nguni peoples of northern africa they migrated to southern africa as cattle herders and formed an interdependent relationship with the san though the former eventually became dominant within the relationship the bakgalagadi

diamond prospecting concessions analysts also suggest that over six different mining companies have been awarded these concessions other human rights experts doubt that the diamonds discovered are economically viable at this time and see the relocation program as being motivated primarily by the states goal of pursuing environmental conservation within the ckgr for tourism purposes as well as due to the influence of cattle ranching interests11 human rights critics of botswanas government allege that in pursuing its relocation policy between 1996 and 2002 the government used tactics ranging from monetary incentives to the burning of huts the removal of water supplies and physical assaults survival international reports that the government of botswana destroyed homes and water tanks to make the return of the san to their former settlements impossible one of the san who has taken the government of botswana to court is reported to have said that the government told us to leave or they would send the army in he also alleged that government agents threatened to achieve their goals through the use of murder and arson they reportedly threatened to lock his wife in her hut and torch it experts report that in 2002 the government of botswana sealed existing boreholes and destroyed all san water httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21956 storage structures within the ckgr it has also been reported that the government banned nongovernmental organizations ngos from supplying san within the ckgr with food and water12 critics also suggest that the governments relocation policy is placing in peril the ability of the san people to preserve and maintain their unique culture and language the sans relocation outside the ckgr for instance is seen by some anthropologists as eroding san social coherence because it has removed them from their ancestral lands and grave sites which have historically formed central facet of san spiritual life and social identity some san have named new xade the place of death in addition some allege that resettlement may also be contributing to reportedly high rates of alcoholism social degradation crime and hivaids in the resettled communities where jobs and other economic opportunities are rare some experts argue that although development services and programs have been provided to the resettled san they are inaccessible to the san due to cultural and linguistic differences these experts also argue that although these programs are provided they do not tackle the problems of social and economic exclusion cultural differences also play role for example the san believe the increase in health problems in new xade is due to their inability to visit their ancestors graves reports indicate that some san would be happy for mining to take place within the ckgr as long as they would be given jobs and paid royalties in accordance with the rights to the land through ancestry that they are claiming13 11 survival international diamond concessions

are fighting their removal from the ckgr in court in order to press their case these san with the assistance of ngos created unified organization named first people of the kalahari fpk in 1993 in 1996 the san along with botswana human rights groups rallied together to form negotiating team to press their claims during interactions with the government the group included representatives from fpk working group of indigenous minorities in southern africa wimsa ditshwanelo botswanas center for human rights and the botswana council of churches their first step taken was to register 250 san as residents of the ckgr this offered the negotiating team basis for discussions with the botswana government14 negotiations did not produce the results acceptable to the san and human rights groups however and in april 2002 the san took the government to court in botswana the court case focuses on the legality of the governments policy of halting the provision of essential services to rads the governments potential legal responsibility to restore these services questions relating to the sans claim to hold land and mineral ownership httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21956 rights in the ckgr on the basis of their ancestral occupation of the land in question and whether the government of botswana used force to remove the san from the ckgr the case is being continued in new xade following initial hearings in the capital these were criticized by observers as being inaccessible to the plaintiffs who are generally poor lack transportation and in some cases do not speak english or tswana some observers see the case as an example of botswanas democracy at work but those defending the san object that all the judges are batswana and argue that this shows the botswana governments desire to tilt the judicial landscape in its favor15 legal precedents two prior political decisions made by the first president of botswana seretse khama are central to this court case first asserting that botswana was nonracial nation he effectively decreed that all people of botswana were indigenes of the nations land this presumption has informed the botswana governments decision not to recognize the san as the original people of the kalahari or as having any rights to the land in the ckgr through ancestry second under president khama the parliament passed law that decreed that all minerals are the property of the botswana government this law known as khamas choice means that if any mineral deposits of wealth are discovered they automatically belong to the botswana government this is important to the san court case because the law may undermine san claims to the minerals within the ckgr16 14 hitchcock r seeking sustainable strategies the politics of resource rights among the

southern africa occasional paper 3 the diamonds and human security project march 2002 crs6 possible implications of the case the court case between the san people of the ckgr and the government of botswana may prove important both regionally and internationally for those seeking the rights to their ancestral land the legal systems of several other african states where there exist historically disputed land claims are similar to those in botswana should the san win any portion of their case their victory may create precedents of legal strategy that may be applicable to the cases of land case plaintiffs in other countries similarly legal precedents in other countries may inform legal outcomes in botswana in 2003 for instance the richtervelders of south africa won landmark court battle with prominent diamond company17 the constitutional court ruled that even though the 3000 nama richtervelders had legal land titles they owned the rights to the minerals and land that they inhabit through ancestry analysts have suggested that the south african ruling is important in the ckgr case as botswana and south africa share similar judicial systems18 international observers also champion the importance of the san case for indigenes of other african countries such as the masai of kenya the pygmy peoples of central africa and the hadza hunting people of east africa19 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21956 us policy the san case has not attracted extensive attention among us policy makers but its outcome may provide an important precedent for treatment of aboriginal
