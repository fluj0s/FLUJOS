scientology definitions iii lecture given on 13 december 1966 thank you whats the date audience 13 december ad 16 thirteen dec ad 16 saint hill special briefing course and weve got some more definitions coming up today i would like to make comment just before each lecture here for the last couple of tuesdays why weve managed to have accumulated flapyou know one of the press flaps last tuesday the minister of health was shooting his face oft and this tuesday why the local council was shooting its face oft see trouble is theyre very bad marksmen and they dont quite make the grade so their faces dont entirely disappear but the truth behind all this isyou should know were issuing it in directive just the rebuttal statementthe council has said yes the minister of healths statement that scientology is potentially harmful theyd better keep an eye on this thats all it amounts to see they cant say anything or do anything now where they go off the deep end is simply on this fact alone hubbard association of scientologists international since 1952 the very formation of scientology was religious fellowship thats one of the first and earliest lines in its charter in the state of arizona the current organization is the church of scientology of california operating throughout organizations throughout the commonwealth very good what is scientology how does it fit into the framework of man this is not the counter statement that was issued i will tell you what that is in moment and you will see it in full truth of the matter is is you are studying an extension of the work of gautama siddhartha begun about twentyfive hundred years ago he sought to end the endless cycle of birth and death and birth and this deathbirth cycle led into an effort to show men that they were spirit and did not have to be body and did not have to go on being clay gautama siddhartha perfected some work that we did in 1952 and we did it better how to exteriorize now the trouble he had with his work was how to stably exteriorize or continue somebody in an exterior condition he did not know how to do this actually lamaism which began in tibet after gautama siddhartha was longer around he in actual fact went to tibet and worked in tibet and developed what is called lamaism in an effort to produce methodology to reach the basis of the mind and permit an individual to be spiritually free now that work too was relatively unsuccessful we were more successful in that in 1952 in scientology we could more easily and more swiftly exteriorize an individual and show him that he was human spirit than had been done yet the work of gautama siddhartha although looked upon by him as failure produced thea sufficiency of wisdom on this planet to bring civilization to threequarters of asia buddhism is the oldest and most numerous religion on this planet at this moment it is very numerous and it predates christianity by 500 years probably the shreds of buddhism coming into the middle east with the silk and spice merchants who after the contact of alexander in about 333 bc found out there was europe the spice merchants and silk merchants of india and china followed on back on the trail of his retreating conquest and made trade contact with thewith europe and from there on supplied europe with spices and silks and so on on an overland route well along with them undoubtedly came buddhism it sparked religious revival and considerable amount of messianic activity in the middle east now regardless of any truths or prophecies or prophets or anything like that that happened as independent endeavors this nevertheless was sparked off by buddhism buddha predicted that in twentyfive hundred years the entire job would be finished in the west thats in the pali canons well we finished it now were somebody to claim that scientology were not religion that religion was disguise this would be about the most erroneous statement that man could make because it is an extension direct extension of the work of gautama siddhartha buddha it has very many peculiar facets buddha never pretended to be other than just man everyone anyone race color or creed could be member of the buddhist church it was not limited to one caste or class or race or nationality it was the first international religious movement and it has carried forward but it has moved actually in its technology not one inch further than it was pushed in tibet until 1952the successful exteriorization of human beings by very brief swift technology now human beings do not stay exterior you can demonstrate to them that they are spiritual being and that in essence is the essence of religion man is spiritual being now where he came from and so forth are questions developed in religion but the spirituality of man is the basis of religion and is the one thing that all religions have in common they have different creators different gods different altars of worship but in one thing they hold common truth and that is that man is spiritual being only in buddhism was this ever proven now what is interesting about this is that any such forward push runs into the fellows who are sufficiently suppressive to not want anybody free they are men who are essentially afraid they are afraid if you got better you would be able to knock them off if they had been very evil chaps indeed i should very well think you might gratify ittheir ambition there is something there for them to be afraid of they could longer carry on licentiously suppressively longer dip both hands to the elbows in the public funds to support their private friends they could longer do number of things but the basic goal of psychiatry today is to wipe out religion it does not have the goal of healing the sick or helping the insane that is demonstrated by the rising statistic of insanity throughout the world during the duress of psychiatry the longer they operate the more insane theyve got well now thats what we would call very bad statistic indeed the truth of the matter is they inveigh against religion to this degree they say anyone who is religious is psychotic thats what they say now i think what they intend to do has very little to do with us but i think by knocking us out of business and disqualifying the fact that we are religion they can then pick bigger game can knock out bigger church and bigger one and bigger one their sole interest is in the quick buck as far as these national mental health associations and so forth are concerned you must realize that they are private organizations which have nothing to do with the government which pretend that they are part and parcel of the government they call themselves the national mental health association they have right to the word and it as matter of fact is in controversion to the companies acts which passed that said the word must express exactly what the organization is it might surprise you to know that the british medical association is simply private company of doctors and has nothing to do with the government similarly these national mental health associations are only solely and entirely private profit companies the one here in england runs mental homes that charge fees that would make us blush they take care of nothing but the idiot children and the senile parents of the aristocracy that is their role in life they use their name to obtain falsely public funds and in addition to that one such associationand we have it signedstated that in view of the fact that i was millionaire i would not miss hundred thousand pounds and that unless i paid hundred thousand pounds every minister of health every information service and every government in the world would be provided with information by which to crush us and all i had to do was pay up hundred thousand pounds we have that signed the australian inquiry would make the profumo case look like sunday school picnic they called all the hostile witnesses together they arranged their testimony and then they went to the hearing and gave their testimony our witnesses were neithereither not heard or intimidated or discredited perjury was permitted by the qc there isnt legal crime that you could mention that was not committed in the quote australian inquiry instigated by psychiatry far enough away that they could make splash because i was totally inhibited from appearing or testifying at that inquiry its very interesting so theyve rolled through to their brother organization in england who is now kicking up the fuss this is what it is all about and this is really all it is all about as long as religion brings solace to man in any way shape or form as long as churches stand in any way for the spiritual freedom of man psychiatry will not really be able to progress whatever its end goals are therefore our rebuttal to any such attack is that psychiatry should not be permitted to wipe out small church and then go on to bigger church and then go on to bigger church and so take it all over and also that the minister of health as we have just told the press has right whatsoever to comment upon religious beliefs or practices and in addition to that that they are telling us that we must not do something we are not doing now this is the yickleyackle that appears in the world the public at large is in actual fact getting ready to turn much of it has already turned they see something very rotten in this idea of attacking scientology they are sick of this see because its gone on too long and we hear cross comments of this particular character here and there and theyve gone too far and theyve said too much and they are now talking to an hostile public on the subject its up to us to make sure that this is the downfall of all suppressive practices in that line well the local council has been told that it has objection to euthanasia in its local hospitals and that it should avail itself of our invitation to have councilelected representative sit on our advisory board at saint hill and then maybe they could learn that we were not doing what they say we are doing because they say that we are treating the sick and treating the insane and we are not doing that as you know by policy so that is the total way this thing sums up there are other ramifications to it psychiatry is demanding its right to kill or maim any human being after it states that hes crazy now if they can do that they can control planet politically and its quite push we dont say its total conspiracy because its bunch of incompetent boobs trying to pull it off but it is already in use politically as in the case of long i think it was they wanted to get rid of him as political rival so they had the psychiatrist pick him up and throw him in hospital they wanted to get rid of walker general walker and so they picked him up and said he was insane and threw him in hospital in other words this is political mechanism which is being used and i think it should be resisted its not too hard to resist it in view of the fact that the men are too suppressive to actually carry through theres two things that suppressive cannot do he cannot choose right target and he cannot complete cycle of action but the one thingwhen you are talked to about thisthe one thing that you should give them back right in their teeth is that if you are not doing something you cannot stop doing it and that there is law or regulation of any kind which says that you cannot make people more intelligent or more able and thats all were doing now we threatenwe threatenthe very fundamentals of the psychiatric push on this planet its not just psychiatric there are lot of people pushing on this planet this planet is full of pressure groups any one of which is trying to do in every other group on the planet we try to ignore this type of action all that we can and carry on actually we have completed our technology we are well on the way out we are just about as stoppable today as juggernaut you cant stop this much wisdom now theres another factor involved is when anyone tries to cut line of pure theta it tends to blow them up what would you think of somebodyyou had just received information that you had won the raffle and he got the piece of paper that said you had and he put it in his pocket and he didnt say anything about it to you what would you say when you finally found out that he had done this well now thats just minor example of what happens to somebody who tries to cut theta line scientology is line of pure theta there just arent any pitches or curves in scientologyits trying to do exactly what its trying to do its trying to secure the spiritual freedom of the individual therefore when they chop across that line and sit squarely on that line and try to stop that line theyll blow up you want to take out few minutes sometime in argument or discussion as to why scientology is attacked and so forth why help them blow up the whole situation though is it would not really matter very much what happened at this particular stage of the game three years ago it would have mattered not now too late too late do not send to find for whom the ax is falling you see our victory was not in the suppression of private group or specialist group that was not our victory our victory was much greater victory than that the victory of the individual over fate and the universe therefore if we win everybody wins the incidental crushing of the opposition route is even hardly worth doing because were moving up to position now where i can assure you anybody really opening his face on this subject to the public is to some degree damaging himself the public is not in agreement with him now we will feed back and we will tell the press that we cant stop doing what were not doing and we have just got through telling the press that the local council was incompetent as observers and that we could have bought the whole thing off for hundredthousandpound bribe and the press has just been told this well lets get on with some daffynitions and so forth and ive one staring ini dont know if this is where i left off is this where i left off yes where i left off what do you know nobody has added any cards to this you know i ought to have all the simple words too you know you know simple words like idiot and so forth what is an idiot its someone who is on council its not clever but bitter all right the first word here is inversion now inversion simply means it should go one way and it goes the other basically it inverts it collapses in on itself downward now when you take an inversion when person is introverted why he would look in on himself you see so you get an inversionthis means its going south of zero or its reverse scale now this also is used in terms of inversion this scale is going plus while this scale goes minus do you follow as one factor progresses the other factor degresses do you follow so when we say its an inversion on something it means actually its godownward about it so that two plus three plus four plus fivethat would be plus scale you see but four and three and two backwards would be the inversion scale do you understand its reversion of what it is there are undoubtedly other meanings and connotations to this particular word but that in essence covers what they are it means it goes backwards all right exteriorization this was an action which i have by the way just described to you as the history of buddhism it simply means thetan walks out of his body moves out of his body or exists out of his body but itin actual fact exteriorization would mean the action of moving out of body give you an idea how thoroughly psychiatry tries to boobytrap the whole field of the mind and so forththey claim that the insane people can exteriorize and you know that is the most blasted lie i ever heard of in my life because i have actually exteriorized insane people and had them go suddenly sane ive actually been talking visàvis to an insane person and banged them out of their headthis is back in research timesand had them all of sudden talk to totally rationally and just perfectcould have passed anything any board discussed their problems and what they were into didnt last when they get up to leave they go back into their head again and start gibbering but exteriorization is not symptom of insanity quite the reverse people who are interiorizedthat means something else it isnt the reverse of this an interiorization means going into it too fixedly and becoming part of it too fixedly it doesnt mean just going into your head you could interiorize into work by which one would get so fixated and so surrounded by his work that he never got out of it see you could interiorize into most anything but exteriorization is relegated in our terminology simply to an exteriorization or moving out of the body by the spirit restimulate well restimulation that means the reactivation of an existing incident if you restimulate it you reactivate it some approximation of the original incident causes it to go into play and you get point where it was restimulated heres an example fellow was out here and he gets run into by truck and he has then an engram mental image picture of pain and unconsciousness and he has this and itshas got truck in it and its associated with truck and so forth now there is the engram and few days later he walks by similar kind of truck and he feels afraid and upset and he doesnt know why now what he has done is restimulate the incident of being hit by the truck it remains unseen to him and the restimulation is usually unknown to person if it were known to the person he would immediately recover from it but if it remains unknown why it tends to be buried and have an effect upon the individual restimulate this is very very very interesting because by picking up restimulations you can knock out of action an engram without running it its sort of as if the engram sat over in locker undisturbed and not troubling the individual but one day he passes by truck and this engram comes out of locker and drops in his lap and he doesnt know what it is and he becomes the effect of it now if you picked up the moment it went into restimulationnot the original engramif you picked up the moment of its restimulation it would drop back into locker and cease to trouble the individual it is upon this fact that the whole subject of releasing depends youre dropping the bank back into locker it isnt really troubling somebody the erasure that occurs is erasure of these points of restimulation now restimulate has an opposite word destimulate which means to take away the restimulation now destimulate does not mean the erasure of the original incident it means simply the knockout of the point of restimulation got it now we have gegenetic entity now what is genetic entity theoretically this is the world and science of cytology which has to do with the field of biology and so forth its the science of cells cytology and cytology conceives that there is an unending stream of protoplasm passing through time which has branch tracks known as bodies and that is the basic theory of cytology it is not wellconstructed science because it does not follow thoroughly its basic theory so that the body which you have is supposed in the field of cytology to have originated at some dim point in the past from sea of ammonia or somethingand in earlier times in pagan worship and that sort of thing fromfull armed from the brain of jove or something like thisand then by the process of reproduction keeps passing itself through time over and over and over and oven so that this gives your unending stream of protoplasm now obviously if that were the case then if an unendingsupposing man were not spiritual being or if he were somewhere along the line there must be some kind of pattern arranged for body otherwise it wouldnt be able to make body quite obvious if you have blueprint in the planning room for ship its highly unlikely that anyone would build ship do you see they havent got any blueprints for ship so they dont build ship if they knocked one together it would be pretty slipshod but the body is pretty complete entity now back in the days of dianetics and this is dianetic term when the thetan had not been particularly regarded as part of it the only way we could account for past livesand good way to account for them now if somebody is wondering about what they are but its not correctwould be to say well they are incidents which happened on the genetic line now the darwin theory is in actual fact although darwin did not know it an explanation of this unending stream of protoplasm now he studied the evolution of bodies now i assure you if there was unending stream of protoplasm making bodies one after the other up through time there would have been nothing to have evolved right so if the darwinian theory was correct then someplace there there must have been blueprint and someplace there there must have been adventures which were recorded as experience which then modified the blueprint of that body do you follow the logic thats involved here well that was what genetic entity is now when we find however the theory of evolution does not in actual fact hold good for various reasonswhen we find out that man is spiritual being and lot of other factors surround it the genetic entity ceases to be very important we have the actual explanation of what past life amounts to and we dont have to blame it on the genetic entity but theoretically you would be able to find the blueprint if you looked in the body and you went backtrack obviously the body must have time recording of some kind or another matter of fact itswe used to think it showed up on the emeter but it never has only you have ive just described what general blueprint that would be the where do you put the ears you know well the first overt would be the first overt on chain of overts and if you were trying to get fellow over an impulse to hit every girl he sawwhich i should think would be rather healthy thing to get somebody oven he complains to you that he wants to hit every girl and you dont handle these impulses and obsessions and so forth any time you process one and so on you generally go cropper but i would showill show you how you go about it he has this impulse to hit girls so what you would do would be to trace back all the times he wanted to hit girls and you would find him back at his first overt on the chain on the subject of hitting girls and at that moment when he saw that why it would release and he theoretically would not have any more impulse to hit girls i say theoretically for the reason that the ability to sort out through the hundred thousand other impulses which he also has and choose this one selectively and alone as the auditoror preclears particular hidden standardhave i gotten over hitting girls yetis fraught with many adventures and theyre all bad ones you should not try to process specific type of aberration if we processed specific type of aberration we of course would be in the field of mental healing and so forth but long ago we actually discovered that we must not process specific aberrations which takes us out of the field of mental healing it is quite fatal to do this because in the first place its an evaluation for the case in the second place its negative type process youre condemning the individual for hitting girls doesnt validate the individual at all do you follow and if carried on very long does not result in the betterment of an individual all were interested in is the spiritual betterment of the individual and you dont achieve that by finding these little bits and pieces and nasty habits and throwing bottles and things like thatby selectively picking those up and processing them now if any auditor were to go along this line he would soon learn the truth of what i am saying that when you try to process the specific aberrations of human being you are now going to take on an endless task which probably wont resolve so therefore there isnot only are we not in the field of mental healingyou see that would be mental healing he has an impulse that should be healed so you process him on something to heal that impulse do you understand well completely aside from not being in the field of mental healing mental healing if any claim is made for it of any kind whatsoever would be the biggest fraud of the centuries because i can tell you by experience that the percentiles of successes when specific aberrations are directly addressed by the practitioner is too low to be considered its not successful because that isnt whatswhats right with the person you have to validate whats right with the person its an entirely different field do we follow you dont have to find out whats wrong with person for instance in modern processing to make him right you dont you know what can go wrong with human beings or what hes having trouble with anyway but they are not things that need healing theres wounds present the individual simply isnt talking very much and he isnt communicating very much and he cant reach very much and so you bring him up into communication level then the individual cant handle his problems because he cant recognize what they are and you bring him up there and then you find out that hes been resolving his problems by committing overts and you get him over doing this and then you find out hes very arc broke with life and life is very cruel to him and you get him over his arc breaks and so forth and then you bring him up to point of where hell find out that he has good solution hes got marvelous solution for everything and any time he has bad break he goes and lies down and beis horse or something i dont know but were not interested in what his solution is and were not treating him for that reason now we move up into the higher grades and so on and all of these things are simply increasing the abilities of spirit not healing whats wrong with it now the entrance point to this universe now that comes under classified information and is in actual fact misnomer many times on the track one has been told that he has just entered this universe its big swindle youre already in the room somebody says and heres one ot activities what are ot activities ot activities would be those programs conducted by ots to assist scientology simple and heres one this has to do with old anchor points and so forth its the gold balls well body is constructed in space framework and you can actually see these things and actually as you look around some people can perceive these and when an individual has dark hollows under his eyes its all these little gold ballsthey all grouped together underneath the eyes and caved in and gone black and that gives him its very interesting if you could in actual fact shift this goldenball framework of the body and so forth you could probably bend the joints in the wrong places and that sort of thing its quite remarkable every once in while somebodys face is out of shape or something and you get him to pick up the ball and put it back where it belongs or put bunch of balls out there to remedy his havingness of that particular ball and this is anchorpoint processing way back when and you all of suddenthe ball instead of lying against his face goes back where it belongs and he reasserts his sense of balance and so on his face will actually change shape its quite remarkable but this has to do with the structure of bodies what is the space in which the body is formed what is that space the body has to be held in certain rigid form in space and apparently the system which is used in mocking up bodies or one of the systems used is to put gold balls out here balanced left and right and back and around and so forth i wouldnt look for them if i were you its rather fraught with disaster in some cases first and second postulate this is first postulate situation and the second postulate situation is what is the first postulate made on any existing situation now if you get the first postulate made on any existing situation you can actually ignore the second postulate thats made on the situation thats the general thing now actually one tried to make an end all out of this back about 52 and so on what was the first postulate on the track whats the first postulate that one ever made and so forth nowwe now find out its not necessary to have that and we have energy energy would simply mean potential of motion or power and energy is normally conceived of in modern physics as being made up of small waves which are flowing from point to b or potentially can flow from point to b and theres lot of explanations in modern physics but we know they still havent got an efficient engine so they probably havent got the right definition of energy either but energy would be potential it would be the force or flow or the potential force or flow from something to something or the ability to accomplish work or the ability to make motion or movement and so on im giving you allall the possible things were taught in physics that if something moves from to b then there is some energy necessary to move it and probably some energy developed in the movement of it when you move something you develop energy and when you move something you also need energy to move it we are taught this very carefully it is highly doubtful well look look if somebody knows all about something he can do some remarkable things with it cant he and you dont need to fill an empire state building full of fuel at cost of hundred million dollars and touch fire to it and send it into space to burn for few seconds to land halfton capsule out into orbit if you knew the whole system of energy because i assure you that they some day will find that this is not that energyconsuming process and that its not quite that necessary to carry out that vast expense of the public purse i think if theyd worked in the field of pure mathematics for long time before they started buying all those empire state buildings full of liquid gases they might have saved the taxpayer some money but that was not the point was it what is energy this is in actual factis something that is above modern physics considerably but they can define it and ive given you working definition its potential or actual motion or forcepotential or actual motion or force sloppy definition i know certain fellows who would call down for saying so but there it is flow that means the progress of particles or impulses or waves from point to point b or point c to point d or in any direction but rather outlaws the idea of dispersal something that splatters all over the place is not flow flow has the connotation of being somewhat directional so that if something is flowing down off mountain it could be flowing awfully wide and on considerable front which could be widening and at some point that would cease to be flow and become flood or something flow is looked upon as something moving from to b and once more we get back to what is energy well energy is particle in progress or energy is motion or wave vibration or bunch of other things but it would be flowing in some direction and when we say joe talks to bill then joe is flowing words and impulses toward bill and when bill talks to joe why hes flowing impulses or words back to joe and it has connotation of limited and directional progress of particles or wave motions through space thought thought well that is very wide subject that is very very wide subject indeed what is thought now every philosopher since the beginning of time has tried to answer this question of what is thought and they have gone from the idiotic to the stupid and back again many times on this particular subject because if they had understood what thought was why then they wouldnt have confused it with life and they wouldnt have confused it with the spirit modern psychology confuses thought with life it says where thought occurs there is life so therefore computer is alive thats one of the first mistakes you can make fact they canthey sort of tend in that direction see now thought would simply be spaceless positionless product of thetan containing meaning thats all its something thetan produces that doesnt have space or energy or location or so forth it is thought and we can say what it is not it is not life and we can also say that thought is not spirit they are different the mistake is originally in the word theta the greek said that the word theta if i remember rightly stood for life or thoughtstood for either one well actually for us it stands only for thetan even life has connotation life is something that is being lived and do you know thetan has perfect choice not to live it now lambda i have forgotten what that symbol was but it occurs in the axioms and so on and i think it is life in the axioms but i wont go down on record with regard to it its an unused symbol theres phi for the physical universe and then i think there was lambda for life ive forgotten what it is and notisness these are contained in the axioms and nothing is better expressed than those axioms notisness implies that the thing is but is being noted you couldnt notis something that wasnt in the first place do you see heres an emeter i can notis the emeter i can say it isnt there i can actually push beams against it and say it doesnt exist and so forth its actually an assertion against fact now counteremotion would be the emotion which greets the emotion you have point exerting an emotion an emotion is normally something which has flow and quite normally has wavelength and has meaning and its got concept all mixed up with it and so on its quite packaged affair emotion is and it would be the counteremotion to any emotion well now any emotion could counter any emotion love can counter anger and hate can counter boredom and so forth its just any emotion that is countering an existing emotion when you start to take apart the energy in bank on the subject of fight let us say you could actuallyyou dont have tobut you could actually pick out of itthe fellow is ravingand you could pick out his heavy antagonism you see and you could differentiate that with victims total apathy and the counteremotion to the antagonism is apathy its the emotion which is used to meet situation or which does meet it quite an interesting study by the way it is study which has even reached into the field of politics and control of human beings the advertising world also and so on theyre very interested in this subject they want to know what emotion people will counter emotions with hitler for instance raving and screaming and so forth was actually greeted by the germans with enthusiasm you remember you ever hear that raving screaming voice you probably heard it and the waves of heil going on in the background everybody going to town on the subject in other words the counteremotion to hate and rage in that particular case was enthusiasm if you just knew this much about it why you probably could make very very very successful advertising executive if you merely knew that one emotion gave another emotion and if you studied what emotion you had to produce in order to get another emotion and that that other emotion is supposed to be desirable or supposed to be something of the sort why you would make quite an advertising executive of course what emotion produces want well the funny part of it is want isnt an emotion see that is desire or postulate or pullin or something of the sort now wanting something because you like it the like it is the emotion but it doesnt have to be there at all people very often want things that they neither like nor hate nor feel emotional about in any way shape or form so you see the advertising executive when hes trying to handle emotion and counteremotion is rather going up against it because what hes trying to bring about is to get the people to want something hes dealing with want and notwant and hes trying to generate want on certain subjects and notwant on competitors products and when he tries to handle these things emotionally why he starts laying an egg youll see in beer ads they handle this very directly without emotion in beer ads itsand so forth they know that inthat fellows love beautiful girls see or like beautiful girls so i think it was rheingold beer was the one that started this and they never had beer associated with anything in any of their ads but beautiful girls so the people would look at the beautiful girl and immediately want rheingold beer whichi think the guy must have been bats makes sense at all memory and recall well actually there is difference between these two terms thats significant to the auditor memory means someremembering something and recalling means remembering something and so forth now recall however implies that you bring it up to present and look at it it has that connotation whereas memory would have the connotation of you simply knew it had happened now theres two different connotations to these things but actually they are very very easily interchangedvery easily interchangedbecause one doesnt have to bring it up when hes clear he doesnt any longer theres lot of things he doesnt bring up to present time to recall them he can recall them in detail and tell you exactly where they are without having them brought up into the present to review do you follow to that extent clear is actually far far in advance of the book one definition of clear the reason might amuse you the reason one cant recall is totally contained in the fact that his memory is surrounded by mass which prevents him from recalling its quiteobviouslythat if you got rid of all of yourall of the mass of the mind why you obviously wouldnt have anything to recall correct doesnt work that way at all which is one of the most astonishing things undue duress prevents recall for instance if you justif you were in lions cage and the lion jumped at you and you got out through the bars and you got about ten fifteen feet away the mental energy contained in drawing back from the lion and squeezing out through the bars and running that ten feet would in actual factnot because its dangerous areabut prevent you from remembering that you had been in the lions cage and thats basically the mechanics of amnesia of how an individual ceases to remember the track you might say gets too charged not that it gets too dangerous but his recalls fold up on him because hes protecting himself against so many dangers and actions on the track that that very amount of charge or energy or mass and so forth prevents his easy penetration into it so what he actually starts doing is bringing up the pictures to look at them he cant just say my license number in rome do you see he sort of has to get picture of it in order to read it you got it well that would only be when his track was very heavily charged and he was mocking up all kinds of charge with relationship to it anyway thats the way it is and confidence confidence is an expression of trust one could make some witticisms on the subject of money is an idea and its value is proportional to the confidence in the government whose money is inflating inflation actually is an expression of confidence in the government just as nasty as that now were talking about philosophic money were not talking about economics the basic ideas which underlie money are simply its an idea and degree of confidence money is an idea now we have to bolster that idea up and give it substance and give it mass and give it reason and give it economics and give it idiocy and give it ideology and when we get all through why were having ball but its basically just those two things its as valuable as one has confidence and it is originally an idea now if you work with those two things in relationship to money you can understand more about money than reading thousand texts on economics you see when money goes bad is when people cease to have confidence in the issuer and therefore money is considered that much less valuable so on tuesday the public likes dictator benzene and on wednesday they hate him well youll find out that on tuesday the countrys money is worth whatever it was worth on the exchange and on wednesday is valueless see thats why they put pictures of kings and presidents and prime ministers and things of this character on money they try to associate these facts so confidence is just degree of trust in confidence is absolute term its degree of trust trust of course is composed of past experience people who dont trust anyone have just had too many past experiences and so forth total trust is looked on by people as being total idiocy and as matter of fact it happens to be the only condition under which you can exist thats interestingexist on line of total trust somebody says well the thing wrong with ron is he just trusted everybody and he always trusts people and he trusts you see and its all very bad and so forth it may be very bad but look where we are today we didnt arrive there being suspicious of everybody certainty would mean the degree of willingness to accept the awareness of an isness isnt that pretty good this is whats known as juggling with words to make more words i know youll have to play it backi cant remember it myself now if there is potato masher in front of youas an exampleif there is potato masher in front of you and if this potato masher is and if youre willing to accept the fact that it is and are willing to be aware of it then you have certainty in it certainty is one of the most conditional things that anybody ever had anything to do with because theres question in the first place to begin with that any mass has mass the physicist plays on this all the time hes not at all sure that mass has mass this brings up something else scientologist actually takes off philosophically in this particular direction with relationship to the universe if he does this why hes perfectly safe and its all very rational this is one of the basic problems by the way of most philosophers is somewhere in his texts there will be this discussion of reality now when were getting down to reality were getting down to the subject of certainty and were on the subject of nothing else but certainty see now there is wall there is wall and now certain philosophers would have you believe that before you can accept the fact that there is wall there you have to know from where the wall came but that is silly do you see so scientologist simply starts out not on the basis of is there wall there because it came from someplace or how long the wall is going to be there or anything else his sole question with regard to reality is the wall there the wall is so therefore he is then certain the wall is what is he certain of he is simply certain that the wall is see he doesnt have to be certain of anything else and this is reduction to simplicity of one of the greatest philosophic conundrums that philosophers have ever boxed the ears of students with you have to ask the question what is to make people uncertain that would be the greatest mechanism in the world of the generation of uncertainty is the world really and you start asking questions about it you shake peoples certainty now brainwashing simply is the trick of mixing up certainties all you have to do if you want to know and extrapolate or develop the entire field of brainwashing as developed by pavlov is simply to make somebody certain that the wall is black and then certain that the wall is white and make it less black and less white and have it eventually become gray but not have him certain that it is gray at all leave him with the two certainties that it is white and that it is black and with those two certainties merged and confused one with the other he gets into confused or hypnotic state in which he can believe anything so to unconfuse somebody it is only necessary to let them regain some certainties therefore you ask somebody to pat his foot against the floor as we used to do well he becomes certain that the floor is there he doesnt have to become certain where it came from what its composed of or how much money is still owed on the mortgage the only thing youre asking him to do is just to make sure that it is there and so you get the increase of certainty which is attended in processes such as cchs and spotting processes and so forth its quite remarkable an individual is displaced after hes been in an accident because of his mental image pictures made at the time of the accident he tends to remain at the moment of the accident and in that moment of time and in that location in space now he dimly sees the room around him so he cant be certain because he sees dimly the accident around him and he sees dimly the room around him so he really cannot be certain that he is in the room or in the accident now by asking him to spot the room gradually we increase his certainty so that he becomes unconfused then he feels straighter and more comfortable his certainty is up do you see now we probably also could run the engram out so that he couldnt be there and then have him look at the room and we would accomplish more or less the same end product either of which would increase his certainty as to the isness of his current location and certainty is of course trust and so forth mixed up againsimilar to confidence but when youre walking down steps and there isnt one there and you were certain that it was this is betrayal the end of which you never heard of and it does more than jar your spine you also get into arc breaks one quite often arc breaks because ones certainty suddenly is shifted he thinks hes looking at gillywhobbit and he actually finds himself looking at goolawhoobit one of the ways of teaching people so as to render them into total hypnotic state is practiced in most universities and that is to qualify every statement in such way as its not quite graspable the allahipatoodrum lived in the cleocene period except where he was in the mongoic period and professor whomfdygumph challenges that he lived at all typical typical one of this type of operation typical the actual statement should be made is these bones was found in tar pit x in order to be able to talk about them we call them whoosis bones now take it from there kid build yourself tyrannosaurus rex if we want to but as far as we know its whoosis bones big certainty see youd probably have developed terrific paleontologist if you did it generality any unspecificity or unspecific statement or indication tends toward generality it is substitution of plural for singular or substitution of greater for lessen it implies that generality is used more or less purposely actually individuals who are pretty dispersed or you know sort of all around and hazy and so forth tend to talk in generalities bill who just talked to them becomes they letter just received from the public about the magazine becomes the public unspecific and its actually blowing up smaller to larger or singular to plural and thats whats known as generalizing now the whole system and subject of classification comes under the head of generalizing or generalities but isnt looked upon normally as doing so and is called classification in other words the word boys includes all boys the word girls includes all girls well now that word itself of course is generality and you naturally to converse at all must have that word but because you do have generality when they are in actual fact boy boy boy boy boy boy and girl girl girl girl girl girl girl and really not girlsthere is such thing as girls really really theres just bunch of girl see repeated several times because that generality has been condoned then you get into further generality much larger generality and you get men are good you know everybody or boys dont like you see thats hell of generality ive never failed by the wayin exploring with meteri have never failed to find out who they was and it was always one person see they instead of joe very interesting generality you have in actual fact one of the sources of aberration and you certainly have big answer to suppression when you have this whole subject of generality explained and understood suppress and we immediately havethe primary mechanism of suppression would be generality but suppress means to squash to sit on to make smaller to refuse to let reach to make uncertain about his reaching to render or lessen in any way possible by any means possible to the harm of the individual and for the fancied protection of the suppressor and that is what it means technically in scientology the suppressor considering himself in danger from something will try to suppress it and suppression of it and so on is done in many ways and covertly is done by expressing generalities to it you are surrounded by dangerous spacetypical fellow is standing out in an open field full of daisies and somebody tells him dont move and the fellow says why why he doesnt ever tell him matter of fact invention of things or the outlining of things like germs that nobody has seen tends to be bit suppressive see you get mama who tells you that everything is covered with germs johnny see these are all tricks and mechanisms to prevent reach tricks and mechanisms postulate means to generate or thunk concept concept is think thought and to postulate howeverto postulateinfers requirement that something goes or it stays or it turns white or goes blue or remains blue or that it is something or that it isnt something or that some action is going to take place and so forth in other words postulate infers conditions and actions rather than just plain thinks now when an individual says ah lovely day hes not making postulate but when he says lovely day and the sun doesnt instantly turn on and move up in three or four shades of brightness and if leaves dont immediately start appearing on the dead trees and so forth why he would consider his postulate hadnt worked postulate is associated more with intention than it is with thought it has dynamic connotation and havingness simply is the feeling that one owns or possesses havingness now fellow actually can be wearing coat without having coat so it must be the feeling that one owns has or possesses or that the group owns has or possesses see and then it becomes havingness mere possession does not make havingness and confronting means the ability to front up to that word front is very important in confront now confronting by derivation would mean withfronting so it sort of has dim implication that if you confront the door the door is confronting you co action is implied here but in actual fact doesnt exist in our meaning of it it means the ability of the individual to face up look at stand in front of be near see visualize or otherwise perceive something so you say he isnt confronting cats that means one does not look at stand up to and so forth andby extensionwont handle cats to handle things you have to stand up to them you know now theres many thetan has been very badly steamrolled by confronting and he learns this rather easily in body and he can also learn it as thetan theres times to stand up and glare and times not to so the total answer is not total confronting total confronting is not implied but when an individual can selectively confront or not confront anything why then he of course is total power and it happens that these do go together when thetan does not want to confront something he tends to mask it or turn away from it and it tends to make him an effect now if he cannot bring aboutmake an effect on it it can make an effect on him that is the connotation but as matter of factas matter of factto stand in front of sixtymileanhour automobile and let it run over you just to demonstrate that youre not afraid of confronting it is not sanity thats asininity now you ask the individual are you willing to confront being run over by sixtymileanhour traveling individualor by an automobile or something and he of course get very very searching about this well if he gets too searching about it you can realize his confront is out just on the basis that he is already obsessively confronting and he thinks that there is some sense in your asking him to dowhatthis and he counterhe has the idea that theres something wrong with him that he wont go do this well i assure you thered be something very wrong with him if he did so willful and knowing act or willful and knowing confronting or willingness to conceive the idea of or to confront or not to confrontall are contained in this single idea dont get the idea thaton confrontingthat youve got to be able to stand up to any circumstance in any action in any anything can ever happen to anybody because that would simply be to confess that you couldnt stop anything from occurring now you see im perfectly willing to confront being able to put out my palm quote unquote in straightarm on sixtymileanhour traveling automobile and have it stop and then therefore to that degree perfectly willing to confront see now this doesnt mean conditional confronting what would be the conditions under which you would be willing to confront this these are really not fair questions well who wants to live life of ruin nobody well now some people have made it virtue to be able to confront living life of ruin well its kind of philosophic booby trap and they persuade individuals that they should be perfectly willing to live life as dope addicts bums and in total ruin in order to demonstrate that they can confront living this kind of life but thats simply suppression actually it has precious little to do with sanity but is terrific process in that the individual will come up and find out what he is obsessively confronting as well as what he is willing to confront and what he doesnt have to confront and the big thing he normally finds out about something like this is good heavens he doesnt have to go on and keep confronting forever hes matter of fact quite tired of standing there as the power to confront and not to confront arises selectively an individuals selfdeterminism arises accordingly because very often the thetan who never likes to be wrong explains the fact that he got run over by x by saying he was perfectly willing to confront it and he was perfectly willing to confront the experience and hes very happy that he got run over by x because hes now got such an experience and he could never have another experience and you often hear him say well it was good experience but i never want to do it again well what was the matter with his arrangement of spatial objects and velocities and so forth that he had to stand there in the first place see that is much more burning question to purely humanoidtype thinking that you cant do anything about anything this is deadly and disastrous in its connotationstelling him that he must be able to confront anything see all right he must be able to confront anything great now to imply that because he is willing to confront everything he must confront everything we have an sp at worknothing but because the truth of the matter is above this level the individual has some control over his environment and so would find it utterly silly to confront the soup kettle falling off and spilling all over the floor and burning the baby as necessary thing to confront as matter of fact it is aits rather comment upon ones ability to pick up soup kettles in midair scoop them down pick up the soup that is also falling in the air and set it on the stove and not waste all the dinner but when one loses that ability then he says well at least i can confront it all right well weve run out of time and there it is and i will leave you confronting your sins thank you very much audience tank you thank you thank you
