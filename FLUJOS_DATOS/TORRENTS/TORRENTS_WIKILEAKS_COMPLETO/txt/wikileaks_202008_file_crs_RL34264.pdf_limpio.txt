strategy since world war ii since then strategic air lift has provided timely worldwide reach for both combat and humanitarian relief operati ons the department of defense dod currently operates mix of c5 and c17 aircraft c5s were built in two production batches designated the c5a and c5b respectively total of 52 c5s are scheduled to undergo two major modifica tion programs after which they will be redesignated c5m super galaxies the remaining 59 c5s will major avionics upgrade c17s are currently in producti on but the c17 production line is scheduled to close unless additional orders are pl

least five options have been proposed for c5 modernization and c17 procurement including the following buy additional c17s and pursue modernization of all c5s halt c17 production but modern ize the current c5 fleet maintain the c5 fleet but forego m odernization on all or part of the c5 fleet while replacing the capability gap with c17s replace all c5amodels with new c17s replace 30 c5s with 30 c17s most agree the strategic airlift fleet should consist of mix of c17s and modified c5s independent studies have analyzed policy options by attempting to measure longterm costs associated with va rious alternatives of c5 modernization with c17 acquisition however there re mains disagreement over how many aircraft are required and of what type policy considerations include costs budget constraints industrial base risk aircraft performance considerations and optimal fleet mix in addition to the aforementione d options dod could increase use of commercial aircraft encourag foreign or

globemaster iii form the core of dods strategic airlift capability both posses intercontinental range and the ability to transport outsized1 and oversized cargo2 the c5 is the air forces largest strategic airlift aircraft and can carry some loads too larg for any other dod airlifter in addition to its strategic airlift capabilities the c17 can perform the tactical airlift mission which the c5 cannot the air forces current plan is to extensively modernize total of 52 c5s partially modernize 59 c5s and end c17 production this represents departure from prior dod plans that called for fully modernizing the air forces entire c5 fleet and was part of changes announced wh dod recertified one of the c5s two major modification programs following high program costs growth3 t h administration did not request c17s in either its fy2008 or fy2009 budget requests further the administrati ons fy2009 budget request did not contain funding to close the c17 production line4 however the air forces fy2009 unfunded priority list contained request for 15 additional c17s5 currently the most pressing issue is whether congress should appropriate money for the purchase of more c17s in the fy2008

17s that congress should fund in fy2009 au thorization and appr opriation bills and in the out years decisions made this year regarding force structure of the air forces strategic airlift fleet could significantly affect future us military capabilities air force funding requirements nd the aerospace industrial base background central tenet of us national military strategy strategic airlift is an essential capability enabling the military power projection anywhere around the world strategic airlift has proven critical in the success of global combat and humanitarian relief operations an alternative transportation mode sealift is capable of deploying larger quantities of troops and cargo when compared with airlift but it is slower and sometimes constrained by lack of seaports near potential contingency operations the capability that strategic airlift provides is the ability to deliver forces equipment and supplies with the greatest speed to virtually any place on the globe despite its importance dods strategic airlift system is under stress having supported conti nuous c ontingency operations over the last 17 years at the same time the united states has reduced its cold war infrastructure by closing twothirds of its forward bases thus us forces are now required to deploy more frequently and over greater distances for example even before the 911 terrorist attacks and resulting conflicts the air force estimated that it was deploying four times more frequently than when it enjoyed the larger cold war infrastructure6 the ongoing war against terrorism has placed further demands on the strategic airlift system combat operations the massive military buildup prior to th 1991 gulf war highlighted the value of strategic airlift when us ai rcraft moved over 500000 troops and 543548 tons of cargo into the persian gulf region7 after desert storm strategic airlift provided 12 years of tinuous s upport to coalition forces enforcing the northern and southern nofly zones over iraq since 1995 strategic airlift s also supported us and nato operations in the balkans strategic airlift plays key role in combat operations in the middle east on typical day c5s bring cargo and troops from the united states to staging bases in europe central asia and th middle east while c17s fly directly to forward operating bases in iraq and afghanista n since september 2001 over 260000 airlift missions have delivered over 33 million pa ssengers and 17 billion short tons of cargo to iraq and afghanistan8 few nations possess the organic airlift

170 c5 and c 17 cargo planes were initially dispatched to create an air bridge to this distant landlocked nation9 although distance was clearly challenge securing permission for overflight and sourcing infrastruct ure appears to have been even more burdensome most afghan airfields from which c17s operated were short 3500 feet and strewn with debris and potholes some airfields were nothing more than packed dirt and c5s cannot operate from these types of primitive airfields10 two events from the global war on terrorism the 2003 brigade airdrop and medical evacuation missions reflect the evolving capabilities of strategic airlift brigade airdrop prior to operation iraqi freedom us commanders expressed desire to open northern front during the invasion of iraq after the turkish government denied the united stat rights to stage the land invasion from turkey air force c17s executed much publicized airdrop of the 173rd airborne brigade into northern iraq on march 26 200311 medical evacuation dod retired its dedicated aeromedical evacuation fleet in 2003 switching to concept where nearly every air mobility aircraft is capable of performing this timecritical mission strategic airlift pl atforms are now routinely tasked in system to perform patient movements as result the time required to return wounded service member from the battlefield is now pproximately 72 hours less than half that required for desert storm this is contributing to survival rates for casualties in afghanistan and iraq now exceeding 90 compared with 75 during desert storm12 humanitarian

growth is significantly lower than 15 and 30 cost growth respectively required to trigger nunnmccurdy breech notification23 in september 2007 the air force declared c5 rerp had breached nunnmccurdy

contributing factors to rerp cost growth reported in the sar appeared to be onetime management problems that may not affect future costs for example permanent waiver to the berry amendment26 would

past three years for example the c5a fleet has averaged marginally higher mission departure reliability ra 831 than the c5b fleet 813 this data may lead one to conclude that c5a mission capable rates

overall national security strategy based on the president s strategy dod periodically studies the global threat environment and seeks to identify the military force structure necessary to meet national objectives and articulates this analysis in the national military strategy nms and quadrennial defense review qdr then in the case of strategic airlift dod examines the status of its fleet and quan tifies future airlift requirements to judge whether airlift m odernization programs are sufficient to support dod force structure and the presid ents strategy in june 2004 dod began its first post 911 review of transportation requirement s the most recent mobility capability study mcs was completed in december 2005 and briefed to congress in february 2006 currently two studies ar underway that are expected to quantify strategic airlift requirements the ins titute of defense analyses is conducting congressionally mandate d study on the size and mix of dods air mobility fleet that is due to congress in january 2009 dod is conducting mobility capabilities and requirements study that is expect ed to be completed by may 2009 mobility capability study mcs the current analytical basis for dods st rategic airlift requi rements is the mcs of 2005 the unclassified executive summary of the mcs notes that unlike past mobility studies the mcs did not recommend an airlift requirement

at the bottom of the range necessary to meet nms requirements with acceptable risk49 subsequently the 2006 qdr stated dod goal of maintain ing 292 strategic airlifters50 to provide congress with

the fy2006 budget decision to end c17 procurement they argued keeping the c17 production line open would be smart thing to do from pure risk perspective but the cost would be prohibitive given the other airlift procurement programs in air force plans97 in 2005 study on mobility the defense science board dsb also considered risk an issue to consider in determining the total number of c17s to purchase the task force understands that each year of additional c17 production beyond 2008 would represent an additional 24 billion acquisition and 23 billion life cycle cost commitment which the department must weigh against other war fighting capabilities it could not acquire however in view of the prominence of organic strategic airlift in enabling ra pid response to crises the task force

the 1997 and 2001 quadrennial defense reviews identified the challenges of operating and maintaining small aircraft fleets that are heavily used in peacetime and in war both studies recommended changes to asset management in order to reduce the prevalence of ldhd aircraft fleets likewise air force leaders have taken steps such as implementing the expeditionary aerospace force eaf cons truct in part to mitigate the ldhd problem conversely others might argue th at if the tonnage capacity of retired c5s was replaced by c17s then smaller c5 fleet would not be in high demand as long as enough c5ms were retained to move bulk cargo shipments between air mobility hubs and large cargo loads ble to fit on smaller c17s homogeneous strate gic airlift fleet some voice concern that fleet composed entirely of one model of aircraft is less robust than fleet composed of two aircraft types pointing out that if one ai rcraft type is grounded for safety the other can still fly others argue homogeneous fleets offer potentially significant savings in operations training and ma intenance costs those that hold this view might point to southwest airlines an airline that s turned an enviable

wanes pressure is building to procure more aircraft in effect this brings longterm air fo rce funding for c17 production into direct competition with c5 moderniz ation however there are strong arguments for both programs and viewing them from this eitheror perspective may be unnecessary and counterproductive becau the c17 can perform both tactical and strategic airlift it also competes to some degree with the c130j for funding thus decisions on c130 recapitalization affect strategic airlift preferably air mobility programs should be developed planne d funded and executed in joint and interdependent way below are five commonly proposed tradeoffs between c5 modernization and c17 procurement with some pros and cons for each modernize all c5s and purchase additional c17s advocates of this option might believe the current mobility capabilities study mcs underestimated strategic airlift requirements or accepted too much risk some in congress have encouraged dod to procur more c17s than are currently planned arguing airlift needs are increasing105 for example general schwartz recently stated that he believes the sweet spot for the strategic airlift fleet is 205 c17s and 111 fully modernized c5s106 these arguments are often based on planned force structure increases or army plans to depl oy faster that may foreshadow additional strategic airlift requirements finally proponents might cite the economic and industrial benefits of continuing the c17 production line for example longer production run might allow poten tial foreign or civilian sale s to come to fruition

requirement present likewise some dod leaders caution against building too much strategic airlift capacity as general schwartz recently testified in terms of organic capacity too much aluminum is just as counterproductive as not enough we should guard against over building the organic fleet to the detriment of other strategic necessities such as modernizing the aging tanker fleet or the viability of our commercial partners107 modernize all c5s and halt acquisition of the c17 this option was dods program of r ecord until dod cancelled the rerp for additional c5as advocates of this pproach note that dod has not requested more c17s during the budget process likewise some assert that there are validated requirements to justify purchasing additional c17s for the tactical airlift role further some state this option is back ed by both the most recent mcs and the 2000 ida study as the most cost effective solution108 others counter that recent cost growth has invalidated c5 rerp cost assumptions used in idas analysis opponents also criticize this approach b ecause it allows the c17 production line to shut down before operational testing validates whether c5as can reach availability and reliability rates pl anned for in amp and rerp fu rther some fear without the competitive option of c17 buys future c5 rerp cost may soar forego rerp on some or all c5s and buy more c17s this option appears to most closely re semble dods current program of record another alternative is to accept the current missioncapable rate s and availability of the c5 fleet but to invest some c 5a rerp dollars into additional c17 procurement some favor this option b ecause it preserves the unique outsize cargo capability of the c5 keeps the c17 pr oduction line open and allows dod to move to less risky point on the continuum estab lished in the most recent mcs however it is unclear how many c17s would be required to fill the airlift gap created by not improving c5 reliability some may argue that the 10 c17s congress provided the air force with fy2007 funds is sufficient to compensate for the loss of one c5 as result of an accident and dods decisi on to forego rerp on remaining c5as

alternatives that hold the number of c17s constant at total acquisition program similar to dods current program of record of 190 c17s may prove helpful based on the assumptions ida examined fully modernizing all c5s produced the highest airlift capacity in terms of milliontonmiles per day for the lowest life cycle costs however it is not clear where the nearterm money would come from to keep c17 production going nor whether cost assumpti ons used in the ida study invalidate this comparison replace all c5as with c17s dod could also replace all c5as with c 17s principal advantage of this approach is investing budget resources into new aircraft thereby facilitating recapitalization of the air forces aging fleet some believe that this might provide more flexible airlift fleet than dods cu rrent program of record and would closely mirror air force plans prior to being faced with c5 retirement restrictions from congress109 however some contend that th is option runs counter to analysis conducted by both the rand cor poration and ida others point out that this option would likely take resources from potentially higher dod acquisition priorities like the 3030 proposal discussed below murk iness of requirements as defined in the latest mcs makes it unclear how many c 17s would be required to replace retiring c5s further it is also unclear wh ether this approach would leave dod with sufficient c5s for cargo that can only be carried by the galaxy or that would optimally be transported on c5 replace 30 c5as with 30 c17s in early 2007 senior air force offici als

of oversized cargo and requires the use of c5 or c17 aircraft or surface transportation single item that exceeds 1000 inches long by 117 inches wide by 105 inches high in any one dimensionbut where the air force would find funds for this proposal is unclear110 proponents of this idea argue it would allow the ai r force to retire the oldest or poorest performing amodels and invest in the youngest portion of the c5 fleet the portion that has the most time to return dividends on the upfront rerp investment opponents of this option contend this pproach is premature because operational testing of the first amodel upgraded to the c5m configuration is incomplete likewise because of budget pressures 3030 proposal may only be executable as an add to the fy2008 gwot request111 furthermore skeptics may point out the air force has not proven that there is s ubset of the c5a fleet that chronically underperforms the remainder of the fleet replacing 30 c5 aircraft with 30 c17s might also present airlift capability issues airlift capability can be measured in different ways but it appears clear that on oneforone basis the c5 can carry mo re outsize cargo and more cargo pallets than the c17 in many cases c5s can carry twice as much of given pi ece of outsize cargo as the c17112 the c5s advantage in size is offset to degree by lower availability thus figure 2 does not compare accurately the

increasing use of commercial aircraft encouraging foreign or civilian sales of c17s bolstering reliance on prepositioning of equipment leveraging potential kcx airlift capabilities and pursuing airships like the tradeoffs of buying c17s compared with upgrading c5s each of these options has strengths and wea knesses these options are not mutually exclusive from the c 5c17 debate as some might be pursued concurrently increased use of co mmercial aircraft dod currently contracts with civilian carriers to move passengers and cargo under the civil reserve air fleet cra f program dod can also obtain use of additional civilian airliners to augment the air forces organic strategic airlift fleet113 some suggest that dod should increase the us of commercial aircraft which offer many advantages over dedicated military aircraft commercial aircraft are numerous tend to have longer range and are typica lly less expensive to buy and operate than most military aircraft however civilian aircraft also have limitations most cannot carry outsized cargo conduct special ssions like airdrops or support special operations also they tend to congest airfields because of longer ground times resulting from lack of roll onroll off capability and reduced ramp maneuverability114 further potential hostile fire effectively deters civilian crews from entering combat zones it is noteworthy that during operati ons enduring freedom and iraqi freedom dod has leased russian an124 aircraft to carry outsize and oversize cargo the an124 condor is strategic lift aircraft rger than but comparable to the c5 it also appears that dod use of an124 missi ons is accelerating some contend that while c5s may not be as modern as c17s or able to operate from as many runways the fact that dod is outsourcing missions to russian aircraft i ndicates c5s offer important capabilities other us aircraft may not be able to satisfy in contrast it is possible an124 contract missions may be the result of the convenient availability of relatively lowcost airlift near busy theater of operations since the air force retired 14 c5s in 2004 the number of an124 missions has increased during congressional

camaa were pursued dod would loan money directly to companies or guarantee their financing to enable purchase of c17s from boeing civilian owners of the bc17x as the commercial variant would be called would make the aircraft available to dod in time of need much like craf the air fo rce proposed several options to sweeten the deal such as helping companies find customers who need outsized cargo delivery and providing them monthly military business paid for at commercial rates in addition to having access to these aircra ft the air force and civilian users could benefit because building bc17xs for civ ilian use would effectively exploit excess production capacity and help lower the pe runit cost of aircraft bought by dod119 in october 2002 it was reported that dods business initiatives council had approved camaa as an efficiency measure120 however dod has reportedly cooled to this approach in an apr il 2006 letter to congress secretary michael wynne wrote the pentagons recent review s of mobility requi rements determined there is need for an outsized commercial aircraft in craf121 second strategy could be for the air force or the general services administration gsa to sell used c17s to commercial companies commercial clients would presumably be interested in used aircraft because they would cost less than new aircraft as part of the arra ngement commercial ow ners would make the aircraft available to dod in times of cris is thus increasing the potential inventory of outsizeoversize airlifters available to dod the air force could use the proceeds from the sales to help finan ce the purchase of new c17s third approach might allow the air force to trade older c17s to boeing and receive credit toward the purchase of new ones reportedly the air force

component of larger military mobility system while aircraft offer dvantages over other transportation modes such as speed and flexibility these characteristics may potentially be offered by mix of other assets both the defense sc ience board and the congressional budget office cbo recommended that dod improve its mobility capabilities by increased investments in afloat prepos itioning of equipment not by large investments in fixed wing longrange airlift fo r example the dsb found that investments now in intermediate stagin g bases more and improved force and sustainment prepositioning and highspe ed intratheater vessels capable of austere port access could add significan t new capabilities to enable land force deployments and meet variety of contin gencies these investments need to be complemented by incremental investments in aerial tankers and possibly in strategic airlift138 both the dsb and cbo found prepositi oning equipment offered opportunities to increase delivery velocity for exampl the dsb found that prepositioning is the sole component of the mobility system that can deliver employable heavymedium land forces early in campaign139 cbo added prepositioning sets of unit equipment offers greater improveme nts in the promptness of cargo deliveries than the other options that cbo examined ch as increasing airlift and fast sealift capabilities140 further increasing the number of existing ships and aircraft would offer very limited improvements in the promptness of unit deliveries during large deployments141 further there are some instances where an

6 151 defensive systems facilitate tanker aircrafts primary mission of inflight air refueling by potentially enabling the tanker to operate clos er to its refueling track thus making more fuel available on each mission as this example illustrates defensive systems also increase tankers capability in its secondary mission of airlift airlift fleet or the ability to handle oversized or outsized cargo149 others also point out that airlift is secondary mission fo r aerial refuelers and that tanker capability could be fully tapped to perform core refueling missions during times of peak airlift demand therefore some argue that ta nker airlift capacity should be viewed as additive to other transportation means when calculating strategic airlift requirements even though airlift is viewed as secondary mission for kcx most agree airlift capacity on tankers can reduce strain on the strategic airlift fleet general schwartz expects the kcx to mitigat wear and tear on the c5 and c17150 the air force envisions kcx to be built from the outset with reinforced floors necessary for carrying either passengers or cargo in the fuselage cargo door sized to facilitate loading and offloading and defensive sy stems enabling kcx to land in certain combat environments151 with these capabilities kcx could potentially fly scheduled combat air refueling mission be subsequently retasked inflight land at an airfield located within threat envi ronment upload battle casualties and air evacuate the patients to needed medical care in another theater this illustrates how kcx with defensive systems not currently found on kc135s might give planners additional options to execute an unplanned medical evacuation sortie perhaps negating the need to tap strategic airlift platform likewise this scenario could be applied to the movement other timesensitive cargo or passengers thus some believe purchasing kcx platform with robust airlif t capabilities may extend the service life

presentation before the 5th international airship convention exhibition august 2004 oxford englandpursue airships or hybrid airships152 another potential strategy to bolster strategic airlift capability might be to re invigorate dod efforts to develop heavylif t airships before congress cancelled the program in 2006 the defense advanced re search projects agency was developing hybrid airship capable of transpor ting up to 1000 tons across international distances unlike traditional cigarshaped ai rships hybrid airship is shaped more like an aircrafts wing to generate lif t through aerodynamic forces advocates hope airships may be capable of carrying complete army brigade directly from the fort to the fight overcoming logistic choke points and mitigating the effects of limited forward basing in addition to very large payloads and l ong range airships and hybrids may offer other advantages to the strategic airlift mission first they may not require as expensive and as specialized infrastructure as aircraft cbo study estimated developing and procuring 14 16 heavylift airships would have the same life cycle cost as 21 c17 aircraft 11 billion but w ould deliver cargo at rate nearly three times greater second they may be able to deliver their payloads near the conflict rather than at ports or airfields miles to the rear thus overcoming logistic choke points and mitigating the effects of limited forward basing airships and hybrids may be able to land on water wh ich could prove valuable in realizing the department of the navys sea basing concept detractors challenge airship survivability and ability to operate in adverse weather also hybrid airships use aerodynamic lift and will takeoff and land much like conventional aircraft so estimate that 1000 toncl ass hybrid aircraft will require 5000 footlong runways153 along with loadingoffloading equipment and facilities these runways appear to constitute infrastructures like those required by conventional aircraft in ddition delivering brigadesi zed payload directly to theater of conflict sounds attractive from conventional wisdom point of view however large payloads take longer to consolidate load nd unload than smaller payloads and the their delivery must be tightly scheduled likewise the inflight loss of single airship carrying 3500so ldier brigade could be both operationally and politically catastrophic finally while lifecycle costs for th concepts could be notably less than manned aircraft can dod find budget room for another procurement
