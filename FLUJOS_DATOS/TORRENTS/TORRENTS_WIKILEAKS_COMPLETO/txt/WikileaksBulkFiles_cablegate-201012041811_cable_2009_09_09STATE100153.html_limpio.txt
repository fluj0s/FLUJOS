01 of 02 state 100153 sensitive eo 12958 na tags ir knnp mnuc parm subject existence of covert uranium enrichment facility in iran 1 u this is an action request please see paragraph 3 for action 2 sbu background the united states is aware that iran has been secretly building another enrichment facility in addition to the one at natanz some other governments are also in possession of similar information the united states france and the united kingdom briefed the iaea on thursday 24 september on this facility the united states remains committed to diplomatic resolution of international concerns with irans nuclear program these concerns are reinforced by the existence of this facility immediate unconditional cooperation by iran with the iaea is essential to address these concerns and to ensure that diplomatic process has chance to succeed 3 u action request posts are requested to inform senior host government officials of the existence of covert uranium enrichment facility in iran using the points contained in paragraph 4 posts are not authorized to provide copy of the points washington understands that in previous iteration of this message nonpaper was authorized if points have already been conveyed in writing posts are instructed to request discretion on the part of host government interlocutors if asked about coincidental claims by an iranian exile group of previously unknown nuclear weaponization sites posts should convey the following iccleared point we do not believe that these other sites that you refer to are the qom enrichment site there are many suspect sites including these others that we monitor 4 u begin talking points we have acquired substantial specific information that iran has been secretly building another enrichment facility in addition to natanz the facility is located near the city of qom iran and has been under construction for several years the facility is located in an underground tunnel complex on the grounds of an islamic revolutionary guard corps base earlier this year we developed information that gave us increased confidence that the facility was uranium enrichment site the site is under the management of the atomic energy organization of iran but unknown to all but the most senior aeoi officials the site is intended to hold approximately 3000 centrifuges but we do not know what type of centrifuge iran intends to employ there we assess an enrichment plant containing 3000 centrifuges is not adequate to produce regular fuel reloads for civilian nuclear power plants which require much larger number of centrifuges based on our understanding of the status of the facility we assess that iran will not be able to begin enriching uranium there before at least 2010 iran is continuing construction of support buildings at the facility intelligence indicates that earlier this year iran was installing the infrastructure required for centrifuges iran may claim that this facility is for civilian nuclear fuel production the iranian government continues to claim that it is not pursuing nuclear weapon yet this facility is too small to be viable for production of fuel for nuclear power reactor it may be wellsuited however for military purpose we are aware that some other governments are in possession of similar information we learned this week that iran has sent the iaea letter indicating that it is constructing pilot fuel enrichment facility and that the required infrastructure has been established the letter provides details and states that state 00100153 002 of 002 further complementary information will be provided in an appropriate and due time we assume this new enrichment facility is the facility that we and other governments have been tracking we the uk and france have briefed the iaea on the information that they have so that they can fully investigate the facility the president with his uk and french counterparts plans to make an announcement friday morning in pittsburgh we firmly believe that the existence of new centrifuge facility in iran constitutes serious violation of irans international obligations iran was required to suspend all uranium enrichment related activities in security council resolution 1737 this legallybinding requirement has been reaffirmed in three subsequent unsc resolutions when iran decided to build this facility it was obligated to declare this to the iaea it failed to do so what is clear is that iran once again has engaged in deceit of the international community the president made clear that we are serious about using diplomacy to find negotiated solution to the iranian nuclear program but in order to do so iran needs to be transparent and truthful it is now time for iran to prove to the international community that it is willing to play by the rules we urge your public support on this matter as we head into the october 1 meeting with iran it will particularly important that iran understand that it must end the pattern of deception and once and for all commit itself to full transparency it is time for iran to come clean on the questions about its weaponization studies and to implement the additional protocol the ministers of the p51 held productive meeting on the margins of the general assembly they stated their expectation that iran will be prepared to take constructive steps when it meets with the p51 on october 1st in light of this new and troubling information the burden is clearly on iran to prove the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program it is essential that iran accept that the process in geneva must be real an address their nuclear program we are prepared to engage in real process but will not be party to phony one we hope that we can count on your public support for holding iran to its international obligations end talking points 5 u posts are requested to report any substantive responses richard nephew isnra 2026477680 nephewrmstatesgovgov is the departments
