that was amazing i understand why he isnt reporter in washington anymore all of america needs to read that from laslocharternetto laslocharternetsubject if youre looking for politically correct statement date wed 2 sep 2009 091550 0500 if youre looking for politically correct statement please do not open as you will recall henry louis gates jr is the harvard professor who was arrested by cambridge police few weeks or so agofred reed was police reporter for one of the large washington newspapers he now writes column which can be googled fred on everythingfred published weekly online column in which he got to say the things his editors would never ever have let him write in the paper his stuff is iconoclastic and various articles have probably offended everyoneregardless of political orientation so with the warning that this is definitely not politically correct here comes fredthe following is an essay regarding the failings of system and culture please note that he elegantly describes the mood of many americans and he does so without prejudice slavery reparations by fred reedon the web i find that henry louis gates jr the chairman of afroamerican studies at harvard is demanding that whites pay reparations to blacks its because of slavery see he is joined in this endeavor by gaggle of other professional blacks i guess hell send bill huhi feel like saying let get this straight hank im slow be patientyou want free money because of slavery right i dont blame you id like free money too tell you what i believe in justice ill give you million dollars for every slave i own and another million for every year you were slave fair enough but tell how many slaves do you suppose i have in round numbers i meansay to the nearest dozen and how long were you slaveoh in other words i owe you reparations for something that i didnt do and didnt happen to you that makes sense like lug nuts on birthday cakepersonally i think you owe reparations for things you didnt do and never happened to ive never been coated in dutch chocolate and thrown from the eiffel tower ill bet youve never done it to anyone i want reparations kind of silly isnt itbut if were going to talk about reparations thats street that runs in two directions you want money from for what some other whites did to some other blacks in another centuryhow about you guys paying whites reparations for current expenses caused by blacks not long ago blacks burned down half of angeles city in my country cities are expensive hank build one sometime and youll see what i mean whites had to pay taxes to repair angeles for you you can send checknow yes i know you burned because you didnt like the verdict in the trial of those police officers well i didnt like the verdict in the simpson trial but i didnt burn my house and loot korean grocers or burn down cityover the years blacks have burned lot of american cities newark detroit watts on and on now add in the fantastic cost over the years of welfare in all its forms the cost of all of those police calls people had to make for cells and jails and security systems in department storesi cant live in the capital city of my own country because of crime committed by blacks toss in the cultural cost of lowering standards in everything for the benefit of blacks see what i meannow id view things differently if you said to fred blacks cant get anywhere in modern country without education we know that we need better schools smarter teachers harder courses books with smaller pictures and bigger words can you help usid say hallelujah hooahh not just yes but hell yes lets sell an aircraft carrier and get these folks some real schools and get them into the economic mainstream id say it partly because it would be the right thing to do and partly because id like to add you guys to the tax basethe current custodial state is expensive id just love for blacks to study and learn to compete and stop burning places but is it going to happen you may not believe it but i and most whites dont like seeing blacks as miserable and screwed up as they arei spend fair amount of time in the projects those places are ugly its fun watching perfectly good kids turn into semiliterate dope dealers who barely speak english it just plain aint right but hank what am i supposed to do about it i cant do your childrens homework at some point people have to do things for themselves or they dont get done maybe its timeill tell you what i see out in the world hank i think blacks are too accustomed to getting anything they want by just demanding it true it has worked for over half century get few hundred people in the street implicitly threaten to loot and burn holler about slavery and sadly the great white cash spigot turns onthing is whites dont much buy it any longer most recognize that what once was civilrights movement has become shakedown game few people still feel responsible for the failings and inadequacies of blacks political correctness keeps the lid on but everyone knows the score which scares hankon one hand blacks hate whites and incline toward looting and burning the whites you hate are the ones who marched in the civilrights movement ever think about thaton the other hand whites quietly grow wearier and wearier of it not good hankon the third hand allow three hands for rhetorical convenience blacks keep demanding things as i write you demand reparations for slavery blacks in oklahoma i think it was want money for some ancient race riotother blacks reject the declaration of independence blacks in new york hint broadly at burning and looting over trial yet more demand the elimination of the confederate flag and the federal equal opportunity apparatus which means blacks want to sue silicon valley for not hiring nonexistent black engineers thats lot of demanding for one monthhankwhat happens if whites ever say nonow how about you youve got cushy job up there at harvard and you can hoot and holler about what swine and bandits whites are i guess its lots of fun and you get salary for it to boot but dont you think you might do blacks more good if you told them to complain less and study morefor example if you want blacks to work in silicon gulch the best approach might be to find some really smart black guys and get them to study digital design not black studies as you teach thats how everybody else does it it works then blacks wouldnt feel left out and racial tensions would decline sound like planjust out of curiosity how many hours week do professors of afroamerican studies spend in the projects encouraging poor black kids to study reallife shonuf subjects____________________________________________________________ graphic design educationbrowse graphic design degrees
