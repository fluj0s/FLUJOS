httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21089 continuity of government refers to the continued functioning of constitutional government under all circumstances arrangements for the continued operation of the federal government in the event of national emergency or catastrophe are specified in law policy and plans some of which are not public information given their sensitive contingent status this report reviews the public record concerning federal continuity of government arrangements it will be updated to reflect significant developments as condition of office the president swears or affirms pledge to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states which also requires members of the senate the house of representatives and the individual state legislatures as well as all executive and judicial officers of the united states and the several states to support this constitution1 arguably such provisions constitute basis for these principal government officials in their separate capacities to contribute to policy and planning for the continued functioning of constitutional government under all circumstances during the latter half of the 20th century such preparations were conducted earnestly and elaboratively particularly with the onset of the cold war and the increasing prospect of nuclear attack upon the nation arrangements for the continued operation of the federal government in the event of national emergency are specified in law policy and plans some of which are not public information given their sensitive contingent status background while the constitution prescribed some arrangements concerning succession to the presidency and the replacement of elected and appointed officials widespread concern about the continued functioning of constitutional government under all circumstances probably did not arise prior to the assassination of president abraham lincoln on april 14 1865 the assassination of the president was not totally unthinkable an attempt had been made on the life of president andrew jackson in the capitol rotunda on january 30 1835 but it was generally regarded as highly unlikely however in the aftermath 1 see article 2 section 1 and article 6 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 of lincolns demise came the assassination of president james garfield in 1881 the murder of president william mckinley in 1901 and the wounding of former president theodore roosevelt in 1912 presidential protection by the us secret service began informally and without statutory sanction in 1894 in 1792 congress had provided in accordance with constitutional prescription for succession to the presidency when both the office of the president and the vice president were vacant by first the president pro tempore of the senate or next the speaker of the house of representatives in this constitutionally suspect arrangement these legislative branch officials were to serve in an acting capacity holding office only until new president could be chosen2 congress returned to the matter in 1886 establishing line of succession relying upon the cabinet following the order of the establishment of the departments any cabinet official coming to the presidency via this arrangement would have to possess the constitutional qualifications to hold the office and would temporarily act as president by virtue of his cabinet position which he would retain thus becoming member of his own presidential cabinet3 during the civil war secretary of state william seward and secretary of war httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21089 edwin stanton created counterespionage organizations but these were directed against spies and saboteurs rather than potential assassins of public officials similarly during world war i the departments of justice the navy the post office and war among other entities conducted intelligence operations and investigations to ferret out spies saboteurs and the disloyal but lifethreatening attacks upon government leaders by such enemies does not appear to have been major concern submarine warfare and aerial bombardment while effective new techniques in warfare utilized limited technologies posing major threat to the defense of the domestic territory of the united states or constitutional government the december 7 1941 attack on pearl harbor by japanese naval aircraft and the american april 18 1942 retaliatory bombing of tokyo by aircraft under the command of colonel james h doolittle demonstrated that at least carrierassisted bombers could reach the continental united states enemy longrange aircraft capabilities were indeterminate during the early months of the war the week after pearl harbor the secret service presented the president with long report of recommended changes to improve white house security it proposed covering the skylights with sand and tin camouflaging the house painting the colonnade windows black setting up machinegun emplacements on the roof and building an air raid shelter in subbasement area of the new east wing the president rejected most of the suggestions with not little annoyance though he finally agreed to the construction of temporary shelter in the treasury department which would be accessed by tunnel that would run under the street from the white house to the treasury4 2 1 stat 239 3 24 stat 1 4

states found itself drifting into increasingly hostile relations with its former ally the soviet union as early as november 3 1946 soviet foreign minister v m molotov attacked us foreign policy in united nations general assembly address the american response included the 1947 inauguration of the truman doctrine for the containment of soviet expansion and the marshall plan for european economic recovery the 1948 launching of the berlin airlift and the 1949 creation of the north atlantic treaty organization the socalled cold war took dramatic turn in september 1949 when it was disclosed that an atomic explosion had occurred in the soviet union recognizing that the soviets had the capability of producing atomic bombs american military planners began to assess delivery capabilities the development of jetpropelled bombers of increasingly longer range and their midair refueling as well as intercontinental and submarinebased missiles carrying nuclear warheads confirmed the reality of possible nuclear attack upon the united states response to the possibility of nuclear attack took various forms for the armed services increasingly sophisticated detection and interception capability and guaranteed counterforce response were developed civil defense planning preparations and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21089 training for public officials community leaders and the american people were undertaken5 new policies established or actions taken in support of the continuity of government at the federal level are less well known two months after succeeding to the presidency upon the death of franklin d roosevelt harry s truman sent june 19 1945 special message to congress asking for revision of the succession law he noted that in naming his cabinet members president chose his successor and concluded that i do not believe that in democracy this power should rest with the chief executive6 in the face of congressional failure to complete legislative action he renewed his request in his january 14 1946 state of the union message7 and again in february 5 1947 letter to senate and house leaders8 five months later congressionally approved legislation came to the presidents desk and was signed into law on july 18 it placed the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate in the line of succession after the vice president and ahead of the cabinet secretaries to become acting president the speaker or the president pro tempore would be required to resign his congressional position and otherwise meet the 5 see harry b yoshpe our missing shield the us civil

the justices of the supreme court but the details of these plans are not public information in locales of the united states where federal courts could not function due to an emergency the president might temporarily declare martial law and vest minimal trial court authority in military tribunals convened by commanding officers in the field dispatched to enforce federal law16 the future shortly after the september 11 terrorist attacks political scientist norman ornstein questioned the adequacy of constitutional arrangements concerning the continuity of congress in the event that many or most of its members were lost as result of similar such terrorist action literal reading of the constitution he wrote would cast doubt on whether congress could even convene under those circumstances however noting that since the civil war era both houses of congress had defined working quorum not as majority of the overall membership of the house and the senate but as majority of those duly chosen sworn and living ornstein thought the situation might be complicated and made more problematic if there were substantial number of members alive but incapacitated moreover he commented even if these difficulties were overcome for congress to operate under those circumstances for long passing sweeping antiterrorist laws emergency appropriations and economic recovery measures would tax its 15

the surviving and ambulatory lawmakers than existed in the full house17 his solution to create small shortterm task force of constitutional scholars and former lawmakers to make recommendations was realized with the continuity of government commission jointly created by the american enterprise institute and the brookings institution in june 2003 this panel called for constitutional amendment to give congress the power to provide legislatively for the appointment of temporary replacements to fill vacant house seats after catastrophic attack and to fill temporarily house and senate seats that are held by incapacitated members other proposals included rules changes to ensure that congress could be effectively reconvened after an attack and to provide in advance for shortterm appropriations for the executive branch if congress is unable to meet18 during the 108th congress several reform measures were introduced but only few came to vote the house supported hconres 190 establishing
