global level since then the increase in hacking incidents the spread of destructive computer viruses and the minimal prosecution of such crimes in many states have spurred on the councils efforts the

2004states canada japan montenegro and south africa that also participated in the negotiations2 the conventions main goal is to blish common criminal policy to better combat computerrelated crimes worldwide through harmonizing national legislation enhancing law enforcement and judicial capabilities and improving international cooperation to these ends the convention requires signatories to define criminal offenses and sancti ons under their domestic laws for four categories of com puterrelated crimes fraud and forgery child pornography copyright infringements and security breaches such as hacking illegal data intercepti on and system interferences that compromise network integrity and availability signatories must also enact laws establishing jurisdiction over such offenses committed on their territories registered ships or ai rcraft or by their nationals abroad establish domestic procedures for detecting investigating and prosecuting computer crimes and co llecting electroni c evidence of any criminal offense such procedures include the expedited preservation of computerstored data and electronic communications traffic data system search and seizure and real time interception of data parties to the convention must guarantee the conditions and safeguards necessary to protect human rights and the principle of proportionality establish rapid and effective syst em for international cooperation the convention deems cybercrimes to be extraditable offenses and permits law enforcement authorities in one country to collect computerbased evidence for those in another it also calls for establishing 24hour sevendaysaweek contact network to provide immediate assistance with crossborder investigations current status president george w bush transmitted the

is deposited with the council of europe in addition to the unite d states 15 other states have ratified the convention to date the united states has not signed an additional hate speech protocol to the convention and the bush administration stre sses that it will not do so because it views the protocol as conflicting w ith freedom of speech rights this additional protocol approved in november 200 2 defines racist or xenophobic acts committed through computer networks as criminal offenses and prohibits distributing racist material via the internet the protocol was opene d for signature in january 2003 the original draft of the convention text contained language supported by seve ral european countries criminalizing racist websites but this provision was dropped when the united states resisted as result negotiators agreed to address computerrelated hate speech in separate protocol which the ited states and others could c hoose not to sign to date 29 members of the council plus canada and montenegro have signed the protocol and seven signatories ve ratified it the protocol tered into force on march 1 2006 possible benefits and risks convention supporters argue that it represents significant step forward in tackling cybercrime because it commits signatorie s to prosecute com puterrelated crimes vigorously which many countries fail to do currently council of europe officials say that the convention will end cybe rcriminals feeling of impunity5 they claim that by mandating sanctions and making cybercrimes extraditabl offenses the convention will improve deterrence an d reduce the number of countries in which criminals can avoid prosecution advocates also argue that th conventions procedures for collecting evidence will assist law enforcement authorities in the fight against terrorism in general the information technology industry in th united states supports the convention viewing it as helping to raise international legal standards against cybercrime to those already in existence in the united states6 skeptics however point out that in order to serve as deterrent more states will have to sign the convention and abide by its mandates they note that states that participated in the conventi ons negotiations are not the p roblem countries in which cyber criminals operate relatively freely hackers frequently route cyber attacks through portals in yemen or north ko rea neither of which are part of the convention in addition some analysts criticize the conve ntion for not permitting police

council of europe convention on cybercrime httpwwwusdojg ovcriminalcybercrimecoefaqshtml 10 the united states draws distinction between data preservation and data retention the latter requires service providers to routinely collect nd keep all or large portion of traffic the united states largely opposes broad data retention regimes but views preservation as striking good balance between the needs of law enforcem ent business interests and privacy rightsdirect crossborder access to co mputer data which they argue creates an extra time wasting step7 the convention has also come under fire from civil liberties groups concerned that it undermines individual privacy rights and expands surveillance powers too far the american civil liberties uni on claims that us authorities will use the convention to conduct surveillance and searches that woul d not be permitted under current us law others fear that the conven tion lacks dual criminality provision making it possible for foreign governments to request that the ited states investigate crimes not considered offenses under us law the us justice department counters that it may deny any assistance to foreign government that venes us sovereignty security or other interests8 european critics also worry that the c onvention allows the tr ansfer of personal data to countries outside europe such as th united states that th ey believe have less protective laws regarding the use of such information council of europe officials dismiss such fears arguing that the conven tion provides adequate ci vil liberty safeguards and limits information transfers to specific criminal investigations meanwhile some business and consumer groups are concerne d that the conventions provisions could increase costs to service providers impede th development of security technologies and sale of encryption programs and negatively affect consumer confidence in ecommerce us policy both the clinton and bush administrations worked closely with the council of europe on the convention us officials be lieve that it removes or minimizes the many procedural and jurisdictional obstacles th at can delay or enda nger international investigations and prosecutions of computerrelated crimes9 the bush administration was pleased with the conventions data pres ervation approach whic h requires the storage of specified data relevant to particular criminal investigation and already in service providers possession for limited period of time it views this provision currently lacking in many national laws as key to imp roving the counterterro rist capabilities of law enforcement officials worldwide10 as noted above the bush administration s ubmitted the convention to the senate for ratification in november 2003 and the senate ra tified it on august 3 2006 the united states will comply with the convention ba sed on existing us federal law new implementing legislation will be required legal analysts say that us negotiatorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21208crs5 succeeded in scrapping most objectionable provisions thereby ensuring that the convention tracks closely with existing us laws proponents assert that many of the conventions provisions reflect the spirit of some congressional actions re lated to cybercrime cyberterro rism and cybersecurity including the following two laws the usa patriot act pl 107 56
