should be addressed foreword by general sir mike jackson gcb cbe dso adc gen the military operations which st arted in northern ireland in 19 69 will without doubt be seen as one of the most import ant campaigns ever fought by the british army and its fellow services that campaign is the longest to date one of the very few w aged on british soil and one of the very few ever br ought to successful conclusion by the armed forces of developed nation against an irregular force this publication is reflection on that campaign that seeks to capture its essence it does not claim to be the definitive analysis the great majority of officers and soldiers jo ining the army aged 18 will be discharged aged 55 if not before total of 37 years at the time of writi ng operation banner has run for almost 37 years almost nobody in the army has served throughout its ngth thus whilst many have served in northern irel and noone can say they experienc ed all of it service in northern ireland has affected whole generation of servicemen and women the immediate tactical lessons of oper ation banner have already been exported elsewhere with considerable ccess operations in the ba lkans sierra leone east timor afghanistan and iraq have ready demonstrated both the particular techniques and the levels of expertise learnt through hard experience both on the streets and in the fields of northern ireland this publ ication does not seek to capt ure those lessons instead it considers the highlevel general issues that might be applicable to any future counter insurgency or counter terroris t campaign which the british rmed forces might have to undertake it is not intended as history in small way it is tri bute to those who served there particularly those who died or were wounded but whilst honouring their service it is critically important to consi der what they learned it is important to learn from their successes which were considerable it is less important to learn from mistakes where they were made and to ensure that they are not repeated the publication seeks to stimulate thought and will have fa iled if whatever is written is slavishly and unthinkingly

of six largel rural counties and two built up areas of significant size belfast and londonderry it measures roughly 80 miles north to south and 120 miles east to west in 1969 it had population of about 18 million people being remote from the european ma inland it has rarely been troubled by major wars however it has been the focus of what became the longest major campaign in the history of the british army that campaign included in operation motorman in 1972 the largest deployment of infantry and infantryroled troops since the second world war over 3600 people have died in the troubles which started in the late summer of 19691 the army called its operations in northern ireland operation banner figure 11 northern ireland aim 102 the aim of this publication is to reco rd the major lessons from british military operations in northern ireland since 1969 in order to guide future commanders and staff officers the term the troubles has been used at various times to describe events in ireland for the purposes of this publication it will be taken to mean the period of vi olent unrest in northern ireland which began in the late summer of 1969 1 1 1approach 103 at the time of writing in 2006 operation banner was still in progress however it was due to be closed down during 2007 even in 2006 most majors at regimental duty had not served in northern ireland in t he highintensity years of the 1970s and 1980s this publication is therefore aimed primarily at the generations of officers and soldiers who did not serve in northern ireland at the height of the troubles 104 it is sometimes said that history does not repeat itself in so far as the precise details of any historical event or period never recur that is true hence this publication is not intended to be record of ta ctical detail nor history there are few specific directly repeatable lessons to be learned from operation banner however there are many gen eral lessons which should be applied by the army on future operations those general lesssons are the primary subject matter of this publication which is intended to be of educat ional rather than tr aining value it should be of most value either prior to or in the early stages of any fu ture campaign the character of the campaign 105 writing early in the 21st century it is easy to underestimate the scope and scale of the campaign particularly in its early phases there were only three battalions of infantry in northern ireland in late 1969 but at the peak of the campaign in the summer of 1972 28000 soldiers were deployed well ov er 250000 members of the regular army served there during the campai gn as well as many tens of thousands in the ulster defence regim ent udr and its successor the royal irish regiment home service force hsf2 in the early 1970s rioti ng in londonderry or belfast often went on for days at time it was fair ly common for over 10000 soldiers to be deployed on the streets thousands of houses were destroyed over 10000 terrorist suspects were arrested ov er 14000 illegal weapons were used at one time or another over 600 soldiers have died or been killed due to terrorist action3 in the worst year of 1972 102 british soldiers died or were killed the largest number in one year since korea 106 however those statistics conceal the fact that for lot of the time much of northern ireland was relatively peaceful violence was largely conc entrated in areas such as west belfast the bogside and t he creggan in londonderry east tyrone fermanagh and south armagh four broad phases can be identified in operation banner although such phases can be identified with hindsig ht it is important to note three things firstly those periods were not definite stages in campaign plan secondly they were not necessarily obvious at the time thirdly the real situation was much more complex than the relative ly simple descripti on given below for example there was considerable concern about the risk of loyalist insurgency in the early years loyalist terrorists made considerable effort until the early 1990s and major public order events such as the annual marches at drumcree church occurred throughout 2 chapter 3 paras 311313 3 for comparison roughly 250 british servicemen died in the falklands conflict of 1982 at the time of writing just over 100 servicemenwo men had died in iraq since 2003 1 2 figure 12 urban foot patrol in the 1970s the first period from august 1969 until perhaps the summer of 1971 was largely characterised by widespread public di sorder marches protests rioting and looting were the main issues b the next phase from the summe r of 1971 until the mid1970s is best described as classic insurgency both the official and prov isional wings of the irish republican army oira and pira fought the security forces in moreorless formed bodies both had structure of co mpanies battalions and brigades with recognisable structure and headquarters staff protracted firefights were common the army responded with operations at up to brigade and even divisional level the largest of these was operat ion motorman which was conducted from 31 july to 1 december 1972 it marked the beginning of the end of the insurgency phase the oira declared ceasefire in 1972 which it has never broken the pira began process of transforming itself into terrori st organisation based on cell structure c the end of the insurgency merged into the phase characterised by the use of terrorist tactics pira developed into w hat will probably be seen as one of the most effective terrorist organisati ons in history professional dedicated highly skilled and resilient it conducted sustained and lethal campaign in northern ireland mainland united kingdom uk and on the continen t of europe from 1980 onwards its political wing sinn fein involved itself in mainstream politics in northern ireland the republic of ireland and the uk however from 1992 or 1993 the level of violence in all three areas diminished gradually d pira declared ceasefire in nove mber 1994 except for few relatively isolated exceptions that c easefire has held and it led to the good friday agreement of 1998 that was followed by long proces s of political discussion negotiation and the decommissioning of pira we apons at time of writi ng may 2006 it may be too soon to say that the troubles are definitively at an end however it is reasonable to say that there has been over decade of relative peace the period since 1990 can therefore be seen as the long tail to operation banner it is possible to consider this period as conflict resolution phase but only in hindsight figure 12 urban foot 1970s patrol in the 1 3 107 for the purposes of this publicati on the differences between insurgency and terrorism can be considered as those of mass means and methods insurgency generally includes large num bers of insurgents using moderately conventional weapons organisations and tactics by com parison terrorism is more selective and often more sophisticated in its means and methods of attack whilst employing generally smaller numbers these features broadly apply to rthern ireland different approach would be to define terrorism as tactic4 and therefore terrorist organisation as one which acts largely covertly and deploys terrorism as its main means of violence conversely insu rgency presupposes an insurgent body as oira and pira could both be described in the early 1970s which employs fairly direct action to achieve its aims although operating under the cover of the loca l population these definitions also gener ally apply to northern ireland 108 the troubles have to some extent been violent struggle between catholic and protestant elements the events of 1969 could easily have turned into open civi l war but did not the troubles were also to great extent working class war between working class republicans and working class loyalists by and large the middle classes did not involve themselves di rectly in the troubles although they and others showed strong tendency towards in transigence and entrenched views the repeated call for surrender of british sovereignty by the loyalist community is but one fairly obvious aspect of this effect the two communities have tended to become victims of their own views moderate political op inion compromise and often logic has largely been marginalised definitions 109 terms such as loyalist republican unionist and nati onalist have been used widely throughout the troubles although not always accurately the following definitions are used in this publication northern ireland consis ts of the six count ies of ulster which remained part of the uk when the rest of ireland was give n independence in 19225 the government of northern ireland was established in 1921 it is usually referred to as stormont after stormont castle where it sat b ulster is an historic province of ireland the others being munster leinster and connaught ulster comprised the six counties now forming northern ireland and three others6 therefore it is not strictly co rrect to describe northern ireland as ulster nor as the province c the terms catholic and protestant are used narrowly in terms of religious observance in practice differences betwe the main factions in northern ireland have been characterised less by religious belief than by the social cultural and political views to which the two sections of the community adhere in simple terms religion has been badge or label rather than cause 4 adp land operations army code 71819 0157 5 the six counties antrim down armagh fermanagh tyrone londonderry 6 cavan donegal and monaghan 1 4 d nationalist refers to that sect ion of the people of northern ireland which views itself primarily as part of the population of ireland as whole they are almost entirely descended from the orig inal inhabitants of the isl and and are catholic by extension republicans are those who wish to see northern ireland united with the republic of ireland though much nationalist sentiment is and has been republican it is not necessarily true to say that all catholics in northern ireland wish or have wished to be part of the republic republican and nationalist groups tend to have the words irish and r epublican in their titles hence names such as the ira the irish national liberation army i nla and irish republ ican socialist party irsp the term unionist refers to that section of the po pulation who wish to remain part of the uk the term loyalist is generally used to describe paramilitary organisations which hold or adh ere to unionist views unionists and loyalists are generally descended from scottish settlers and are almost entirely protestant their organisations tend to contain the word uls ter examples incl ude the ulster defence association uda and the ulster volunteer force uvf other loyalist groups employ unionist ideol ogy in their titles for exam ple the name of the red hand commando reflects the heraldic red hand of the oneills of ulster f the republic of ireland or eire is the sovereign state which was formed in 1922 of the 26 counties of irel and which were given independence from the uk its parliament is the dail and it s prime minister the taoiseach the government of ireland is commonly referred to as dublin g the uk comprises great britain and rthern ireland it is therefore not quite accurate to refer to northern ireland as bri tish although citizens of northern ireland are subjects of the uk for the purpose of the publication the term british will be taken to refer to british mainland issues uk will be used when referring to issues which affect both great brit ain and northern ireland the government of the uk is referred to as whitehall and the uk parliam ent is referred to as westminster 110 as an example of everyday misuse organisations such as the uvf and red hand commandos were collectively referred to by british security forces as protestant paramilitaries although the great majo rity of their members probably were protestant it is more accu rate to refer to them as loyalist paramilitaries caveats 111 publication such as this is inevitably written through the pris m of history which presents some problems the first is that of anachronism it is easy to view the present or the recent past as the norm without consideri ng the situation at the time under study as an example individual reinforcements s ent to northern ireland in 1970 and 1971 travelled in uniform on public transport train and ferry carrying their personal weapons for their own protection they travelled in small groups rather than singly and were issued five rounds of ammunition for self defence more problematic for the purposes of this study is tendency to view military operations through doctrinal framework whic h was developed in the 1990s 1 5 112 it is also difficult to kn ow after the event whether some thing was known at the time or that something could not be done at the time for reasons that are not obvious subsequently it is also possible to s peculate that if commander had made different decision given re sult would have occurred th at is fallacy one can postulate that it might with hindsight have been preferable to decide differently however it is not possible to know what the outcome of that decision would have been 113 that is pitfall of hindsight it is the purpose of this public ation to apply military judgement to the events of the past that is it is intended to develop hindsight in order to guide the judgement of future commanders and staff officers however that is not the same as saying that with hinds ight given commander should have acted differently 114 military terminology has changed consi derably over the 37 years studied this publication generally uses names and terminology which were most commonly used during operation banner or terms in comm on usage in the security forces rather than names and terms in use at the end of the operation 115 this publication is the princi pal output of 6month study by team of three officers carried out in early 20067 it therefore does not discuss events after 2005 and does not attempt to be definitive history of the campaign figure 13 march at drumcree in 2002 in the preparation of this publication 416 unit post operational tour reports were read several thousand other documents were reviewed the information corp orate memory analysis branch of the ministry of defence provided 34 volumes of archive materials which were analysed discussions were held with more than 20 retired or serving officers who had commanded at br igade level or above in northern ireland wide range of other individuals was also consulted including number who had served in northern ireland in 1969 or even before 1 6 7chapter 2 the events 201 this chapter presents br ief history of the events of the troubles and the period leading up to them it describes the four broad phases identified in chapter 1 although it separates the later 1970s fr om the 1980s for convenience before 1969 202 scottish presbyterians began to settle in ulster in the 16th and 17th centuries ulster was not formally colonised in the man ner of say new england the two communities of native catholics and immi grant protestants remained largely separate attending different churches and being brought up in different cultural traditions the protestants were generally the more affluent they tended to have larger farms built mills and dominated the professions 203 the city of derry was effectively taken ov er by group of venture capitalists from the corporation of the cit of london in 1613 and renamed londonderry it became the emotional centre of protestantism in ulster this was reinforced in 1689 when 13 apprentices prevented the governor of the city from surr endering it to king james army despite being king of great britain king james1 was strongly associated in the protestant mind with cath olicism over the years t he action of the apprentice boys and king james subseq uent defeat at the battle of the boyne 12 july 1690 became associated with protestant superiority2 the apprentice boys march is held every year on 12 august number of other marches were added over the years and the protestant movement was institutionalised during victorian times into the orange order3 204 resistance to british rule among the catholic population of ireland developed significantly in the 19th century initially term ed fenians and subsequently republicans in 1905 they formed polit ical movement called sinn fein with paramilitary branch known as the irish republican brother hood the irish national volunteers and then the ira during east er 1916 the ira staged an uprising which centred on the general post office in dublin it was fo rcefully suppressed by the british army which at the time saw this as rebellion treason and an unwarranted distraction from the first world war 205 the 26 counties of souther n ireland were granted home ru in 1921 sinn fein was elected largely unopposed in 124 of the 128 constituencies independence followed in 1922 civil war then broke out in the south which resulted in the ira and sinn fein being outlawed in the republic eire was technically dominion of the united kingdom until 1948 1 king james ii brother of king char ii who ruled from 1685 to 1688 2 the battle of the boyne was fought on 1 july 1690 i n the old style pre1752 calendar in the new style calendar the date is rendered as 12 july 3 named after william of orange husband of queen ma ry ii and grandson of king charles i and who subsequently ruled w ith mary as king william iii queen mary was the elder daughter of king james ii and was brought up in the protest ant faith she married william in 1677 and ac ceded to the throne of great britain in 1689 2 1 206 northern ireland was given its own constitution the same year in set of measures which were seen initially as temporary pending the unification of the north and south by mutual consent unionists won 40 of the 52 seats in stormont and effectively institutionalised their own position of advanta ge one of stormonts early acts was to remove the safeguards for the catholic minor ity all important posts were held by protestants and local elections were manipulated to ensu re protestant advantage for example in londonderry 19000 protest ants controlled eight of the 12 wards leaving only four for 36 000 catholics this gave the minority effective and permanent control of the city council 207 by the early 1960s discrimination had become institut ionalised it was not that legislation was discriminatory in itself but rather that the way it was applied in practice discriminated agai nst the catholic minority in 1969 londonderry was the most deprived city in the united king dom 33000 of the 36000 catholics were crowded into the victorian sl ums of the creggan and the bogs ide unemployment in londonderry was the highest in the uk similar pattern applied in belfast with population of 385000 and many of the other towns throughout northern ireland 208 traditional industries such as shipbuilding xtiles and manufact uring declined after 1945 by the late 1960s pover ty and social deprivation in the catholic enclaves of londonderry and belfast wa s appalling in some cases fa milies of 14 lived in four rooms with children aged five woken at 2am every night to roam the streets in order to allow sleeping in shifts this deprivation and discrimi nation was well known in stormont captain terence oneill elec ted as prime minister in 1963 was seen as responsible reformer with genuine wish to improve the lot of the catholics however much of the protestant comm unity had developed what seemed to be siege mentality they had lived through independence and civil war in the south and had seen the republic stagnate since indep endence they felt that their economic and social advantages we re at risk as was their cultural identity these attitudes tended to strengthen unionist and loyalist sentiments perhaps best characterised by the expr ession surrender 209 catholic reaction to discr imination was focussed in the northern ireland civil rights association nicra and simi lar movements during the 1960s the civil rights campaign in the southern ited states had been widely televised nicra was raised in 1967 it was broadl moderate it aimed at social reform such as ending discrimination in jobs and hous ing the existence and ac tivities of nicra had the effect of strengthening loyalist retrenchm ent nicra staged ma rch in august 1968 which passed off peacefully 210 however nicra march on 5 october 1968 clashed with an orange order march this led to rioting in londonderry in what wa s the first fullytelevised event of its kind in the uk the royal ulster constabular ruc was not well controlled used unnecessary force and gained bad reputati on the violence escalated from then on march in january 1969 was ambushed by loyalists at burntollet bridge the ruc was not well prepared 87 people were hospitalised and there was more rioting in londonderry 211 captain oneill had introduced some genui ne reforms in november 1968 but this was perceived by the unionist community as weakness oneill resigned in early 2 2 1969 and was replaced by another moderate the rt hon james chichesterclark violence continued to escalate through the summer of 1969 nicra had become associated with extreme r epublicanism and the ruc with loyalism this was particularly true of its reserv force the ulster special constabulary known as the b specials 212 the apprentice boys march in londonderry was scheduled for 12 august 1969 it was felt that banning the march would cause political difficulties with the loyalists stormont decided to allow the march to take place however its decision was based on complete ignorance of the likely catholic reaction stormont politician had been in the bogside or the creggan for several m onths the march was met with violent nationalist protest the r uc was completely overwhel med by the scale of the violence of total strength of 3000 ac ross northern ireland almost half of the ruc were present in londonderry they atte mpted to maintain order between over 15000 marchers and several thousand nationalis ts violence broke out when the two sides came into contact petrol bombs were thrown and the first deaths occurred nationalists erected barricades in the streets to keep loyalists out when the ruc entered the bogside to take them down they were followed by 50100 loyalists the ruc and loyalists subsequently withdrew but had completely alienated the catholics in lon donderry violence spread across the city then to belfast and other towns rioting continue throughout 13 august the press tv and nicra reacted with inflammatory reporting the b specials were called out nicra responded by calling for diversions across rthern ireland to take the pressure off londonderry during 14 august the ruc lost control in londonderry and called in the army 1st battalion the prince of waless ow n regiment of yorkshire deployed to separate loyalists and nationalists and hence became the first army unit to deploy onto the streets of northern ir eland during the campaign the early years figure 21 foot patrol early 1970s 2 3 213 ten rifle companies were present in nort hern ireland that day they were reinforced in just over 24 hours by t he uk spearhead battalion 3rd battalion the light infantry which was deployed from plymouth by 19 august the situation had settled down to pattern of occasional rioting and aggro from aggravation term used to describe minor disorder or vi olent behaviour often characte rised by verbal abuse and stonethrowing the army was deployed to interpose itself between protestant and catholic areas catholics viewed its arri val with mixture of suspicion and relief most of them felt that it was there to protect them but the r epublican perception was that the british army was an army of occupation which reflected myths and legends about the easter rising 214 ten people were killed and 899 injured in the violence in july and august 1969 the figure included 368 policemen in jured the response from whitehall was swift on 19 august the british prime nister the rt hon harold wilson issued the downing street declaration under which whitehall undertook to c ontinue to support stormont provided that the storm ont administration proceed energetically with its programme of reforms the cameron report4 looked at the events of au gust and september it concluded that stormont discr iminated against catholics that the b specials were partisan and that the ruc used unnecessary violence lacked discipline were generally inept and were ineffect ive due to lack of number s the hunt enquiry into policing in northern ireland deli vered its report on 3 october5 it resulted in wide reform of the ruc and in particular recommended the disbandment of the b specials 215 the rest of 1969 and early 1970 was period of sporadic riot ing and public disorder rural areas were fairly quie t and the b specials were effective in keeping order there however the lower falls distri ct of belfast and th bogside and creggan were seen as catholic go areas parti cularly by protestant s violence started again with the easter marc hes over the weekend of 2931 march 1970 with major riots in the protestant shankill and cat holic ballymurphy districts of belfast barricades were erected royal engineers dismantled them once they had been cleared by baton charges there was further violence in june with the beginning of the orange order marches genuine problem faced the security forces strange mixture of fanaticism what was seen as an uncompromising desire to march in formal parades6 and deepseated importance attached to every yard of traditional protestant marching routes those routes often did have historical significance but also reinforced the image of protestant ascendancy in t he face of the catholic community over the night of 27 28 june 1970 six peopl died and 61 were wounded by gunfire by paramilit aries the figure included three soldiers wounded gunmen were increasingly using rioting as cover for shooting both across the sectarian divide and at the security forces the army estimated that 1629 rounds had been fired from catholic ar eas 264 from protestant areas and 30 by the security forces about 1600 cs gas grenades or canisters had also been used by the security forces 4 report of the commission on disturbances in northern ireland cmnd 532 5 chapter 3 307 lord hunt had led the mount everest expedition in 1953 and retired from the army as brigadier in 1969 he was chairman of the parole board his committee consisted of himself and two senior police officers 6 chapter 2 figure 22 officers of the orange orde r had traditionally dressed in suits orange sashes and bowler hats in way that had become recognisably sectarian 2 4 figure 22 orange order march 216 violence flared up again on the evening of 3 july an infantry company was conducting planned house search in balk an street in the lower falls when it became encircled by rioters batta lion operation was mounted to relieve the trapped company whilst that was taking pl ace the brigade commander circling in helicopter saw barricades being erected he discussed the situation rapidly with the general officer commanding goc and almost immediately thereafter gave orders for largescale area search involving four battalions7 in practice curfew was in force all that night and the next day 107 weapons 25lbs of explosives and 21000 rounds of ammunition were found four ci vilians died and 68 were injured the army fired 1427 rounds officially known as the balkan street search it rapidly passed into republican mythology as the r ape of the falls although intended as taking hard line against violence it did not in practice discriminate between those perpetrating violence and the rema inder of the community 217 the army had been under sign ificant pressure to sort out the lower falls sorting out was taken to mean imposing law and order and enabling the ruc to patrol without assistance the army had relatively few options open to it other than house searches tactically the ba lkan street search was limi ted success however it was significant reverse at the operational level it handed significant information the brigade commanders helicopter had to make forced landing because the pilot believed it had been hit by small arms fire this may have contributed to his decision his discussion with the commander land forces clfgoc took place soon afterw ards see also chapter 8 829 2 5 7operations opportunity to the ira and this was exploited to the full8 t h government and army media response wa s unsophisticated and unconvincing the search also convinced most moderate catholics that the army was proloyalist the majority of the catholic population became effectively nationalist if they were not already the ira gained significant support it was ironic that with army assistance there had been more police patrolli ng of the falls in the period before the search than there had been for m any years it was notable that stormont ministers had called for an end to the go areas but did not visit to ascertain the real situation figure 23 public order operations early 1970s 218 during the late summer of 1970 the situat ion gradually deteriorated soldiers expressed genuine sympathy for the population as whole many were astonished at what they saw as the squalor and the narrowmindedness that was common to so many of the population in the urban areas in which they we re deployed as the year progressed there was shift fr om rioting to armed violence by early 1971 there was doubt that the ira and pecially pira was the princi pal threat by the summer of 1971 there were ten to 15 serious incidents per month the nature of the violence had escalated with number of significant firsts the fi rst british soldier to be killed in the troubles died on 6 february 1971 the first wave of incendiary attacks took place from 4 to 10 march and the first di rectional antipersonnel device claymore was used on 8 may it was against this in creasing violence that the decision to reintroduce internment was taken at the time it was normal to refer to enemy or adversary information oper ations as propaganda whilst referring to those of the security forces as part of an information campaign this publication uses the term information operations throughout 2 6 8219 internment had been used several times before between 1957 and 1962 the most recent ira campaign it had been applied on both sides of the border and had been generally effective9 in 1971 it was not introduced so uth of the border and much of the valuable intelligence t hat the b specials had previous ly supplied was now absent or dated the rt hon brian faulkner stormont prime minister since 23 march 1971 persuaded the rt hon edward heath the british prime minister to support internment contrary to military advice10 the army and ruc we re poorly prepared suspect lists were badly out of date and tention facilities were inadequate the former led to many of the wrong people being arrested and the latter meant that those arrested could not be properly segr egated during screening in addition the army subjected small number11 to deep interrogation techniques which had been developed in other theatres during the 1950s and 1960s 220 operation demetrius the introduction of internment was in practice an operational level reverse considerab number of terrorist suspects were interned the net total of active ira terro rists still at large decreased by about 400 between july and december 1971 very large amount of intelligence had been gained the number of terro rists arrested doubled in si x months however the information operations opportunity handed to the republican movement was enormous both the reintroduction of intern ment and the use of deep interrogation techniques had major impact on popular opin ion across ireland in europe and the us put simply on balance and with the benefit of hindsight it was major mistake 221 however the security forces took advant age of internment to generate significant tactical advantage attrition of terrori sts through the remainder of 1971 and early 1972 was considerable to that extent the security forces held the initiative in northern ireland however barricades d begun to go up agai n in the creggan and the bogside and marches were still major problem nicras response to ban on any given march was to hold it ill egally and to seek confrontation and publicity the security force response was typically to prevent the march reaching given trouble spots such as protestant enclave and to conduct arrest operations in order to pick up ringleaders the ira would sometimes use marches and demonstrations as cover to shoot at the security forces it was this set of circumstances that led to the events of sunday 30 january 1972 bloody sunday 222 march planned for that day in londonderry had been bann ed the army had put number of manned barriers in pl ace to stop the march enter ing the protestant areas of the old city it was also planned to mount an arrest operation as the march began to disperse so as to arrest th ringleaders and to det er further illegal marches the brigade operatio n order said that it was anticipated that the arrest operation would take place on foot however one battalion commander decided to use mixture of armoured and softskin vehicles to carry his men right up to the rioting marchers before t hey debussed and started making arrests few moments before the operation was mounted high velocity shot was fired at the soldiers from the area of the rioters the operation went ahead and three platoons debussed in 9 chapter 3 302 10 chapter 4 405 and chapter 8 828 11 12 initially 15 in total 2 7 three different areas in the immediate vicini ty of the rioters almost immediately shots were fired and within minutes 12 civilians were dead12 223 the events of bloody sunday were immediately exploite d by republican information operation the consequences ran around the world and could still be felt more than 30 years after the event it is probably the only event in the troubles to be the subject of two judicial enquiries 224 however those events should be seen ag ainst background of the realisation in whitehall that political action was required to institute dequate representation of the catholic minority at govern mental and local level number of measures were present in an extant stormont white p aper but they carried little weight with catholics who were long accustomed to what they saw as the manipulation of affairs by stormont whitehall had come to rea lise that the condition s of the 1969 downing street declaration were not going to be met by stormont on 24 march 1972 the british prime minister t he rt hon edward heath announced the dissolution of stormont and the reintroduction of direct ru from westminster this would be effected by secretary of state supported by northern ireland office nio 225 the dissolution was announced as political initiative but in practice little was achieved politically the army was di rected and agreed to take low key approach the protestants were concer ned unionist politicians and loyalist paramilitaries were hostile the armys posture had little effect on weaning the catholics from supporting the ira pira regrouped retrained an d reorganised the level of violence increased dramatically through 1972 as table 21 shows ser statistic mar apr may jun jul b c d f g 1 shooting incidents 399 724 1223 1215 2718 2 weapons captured 78 74 52 58 101 3 arrests 375

litical development the low profile approach had failed an explosive situation was developing and control was being lost on what became known as bloody fr iday 21 july 1972 pira exploded ten bombs killing ten and wounding 130 mostly protestant civilians the army and whitehall had been consideri ng an operation to reimpose law and order throughout northern ireland and particula rly the go areas of belfast and londonderry since 9 july it would require the reinforcement of the army by seven battalions and 13th died later in hospital these remarks are based on the widgery report of 18 april

consi and major and rapid vehicle royal engineers avre referred to as armoured bulldozers to clear barricades operation motorman operation motorman brought to an end spiral of violence in the province which had seen 95 terroristrelated deaths in july 1972 the catalyst for action was bloody friday on 21 july when bombs were planted in belfast with similar damage in londonderry over the preceding months republican and then protestant go areas had been the security forces refrained from operating in these areas for fear of causing civilian casualties dered number of radical and passive military options military planners recommended massi ve insertion of force to swamp the strongholds with troops and force the ira or loyalist paramilitaries to fight or withdraw this was assessed to offer the best c hance of neutralising the extremists capitalising on public support in the wake of re cent terrorist attacks reinforcement was made from uk and baor to bring troop levels on the eve of operation motorman to over 28000 sold iers including 5300 udr supported by afvs to provide automatic fire from under armour if required and troop of armoured it was the largest troo p concentration in ireland since 1945 2 9 the barricades the bogside and creggan estates in it broke the iras the campaign never again would the on 28 july following cabinet approval t he preceding day announc ements were made to warn of the armys intentions and to gi ve communities final opportunity to remove the operation was launche d at 0400 hours on monday 31 july when an outer cordon was set up around the cities londonderry and the andersonstown and ballymurphy estates in belfast were sealed off and troops moved in to clear the barricades all areas were secured by 0700 hours with security force casualties and two terrorist fatalities in londonderry operation motorman was based on the understanding that authority had to be re established throughout the province without lienating the populace safe havens from which it had been able to plan attacks and spread its influence the security forces had expected an intense firefi ght but the policy of clearly signalling the rmys intentions combined with restraint on the part of the sold iers meant that heavy civilian casualties were avoi ded it confirmed that the br itish government would not be seen to be beaten and broke the cycle of violence that characterised the early years of operation motorman may be seen as turning point in the campaign changing it from counter insurgency to counter rrorist operation instances of violence approach the 1972 levels figure 25 operation motorman 2 10 227 the operation was formally closed down on 1 december 1972 tactically it had been reasonable success it had reimposed the ability of the security forces to operate throughout northern ireland it had demonstrated that the rule of law would be applied in all places it had reassured moderates of all persuasions and pira had lost significant face large number of terrorists had been detained and interned but few of the pira higher command had been caught operationally however motorman was gr eat success it was major defeat for pira as an insurgent body it showed the world that t he british army could operate swiftly efficiently and evenhandedly it clearly monstrated whitehalls determination not to be beaten unusually the british gove rnments information operation to support motorman was wellhand led and success the later 1970s 228 following motorman pira were in disarray and the nio was beginning to make progress on the political front border plebiscite was held on 8 march 1973 this showed that the majority of the population wished to remain part of the uk more importantly it reassured t he unionist community that wh itehall did not intend to abandon them nor force them to integrat with the republic elections for an assembly with limited powers and small executive took place on 28 june 1973 the chairman of the new asse mbly was the former prime minister the rt hon brian faulkner the sunningdale conference on 6 december agreed areas of common interest between dublin whit ehall and the nio its principles were agreed by the northern ireland assembly on 14 december 229 the oira had declared ceasefire in 1972 pira had been badly beaten and its situation deteriorated between may and december 1973 1798 members of pira were arrested one pira company d to be disbanded arrests include one brigade commander eight battalion commander s and 39 members of hq staffs the security forces were achi eving significant success 230 1973 and 1974 saw the release of numbers of internees as part of political process with the eventual goal of the reintroduction of selfgovernment it was intended that internment woul d be phased out as part of t hat process however 1974 was dominated by the ulste r workers council uwc strike small hard core of unionists were strongly opposed to the sunningdale agreement procedural motion in the assembly on 14 may was the catalyst for strike across northern ireland most utilities and essential servic were affected but the workers council was careful to ensure that minimum levels of provision were met on 24 may brian faulkner persuaded the new brit ish prime minister the rt hon harold wilson to use troops to take over the distribution of fuel from the strikers contrary to military advice that was done on 27 may the uwc responded by intensifying other aspects of the strike br ian faulkner resigned on the afternoon of 28 may and the executive collapsed the sunningdale agreement wa s largely dead and both the catholics and dublin had become yet further convinced of the entrenched position of the protestant community 231 however pira survived and evolved with many of their best men in prison they attempted summer offensive in 1974 in the three months from june to august 621 pira members were arre sted 373 were char ged with terrorist offences and 61 2 11 issued with interim custody orders ie interned the summer offensive had been thwarted the third quarter of 1973 was the quietest since 1971 in october and november pira conducted bombing cam paign on the uk mainland with bombs in guildford woolwich and birmingham although pira gained publicit it did not win sympathy or support for what was seen as an attack on innocent civilians pira had however learned that one bomb in london had more impact than ten bombs in northern ireland in early 1975 pira announced ceasefir which lasted for most of the year it was not total viol ence averaged one explosion one device neutralised and four shootings per day in march almost all incidents were inter sectarian ie republican against loyalist or vice versa or internecine typically disciplinary action by pira or inte rfactional disagreements amongst the loyalist paramilitaries 232 pira gradually recommenced activity but in new effective cellular structure its tactical groupings were called active servic units asu typically of four to ten men in the last three mont hs of 1975 17 members of the security forces were killed and 57 wounded the ceasefire had become meaningless piras attacks were fewer but more selective better conduc ted and more effective this period demonstrated the emergence of pira as hi ghly effective terrori st organisation 233 by the end of t he 1970s most of the active memb ers of pira and several other organisations were known to t he security forces often down to the level of volunteer equivalent to private soldier the ch ief obstacle to arresting and convicting terrorists lay in the dynamics of evidence the forensic and l egal process the security forces either had information about offences that was not strong enough to bring conviction or it had evidence it di d not wish to use because to do so in court would reveal the source protection of t he source was key issue if the source was technical the security forces often did not wish to reveal the capability of the technical means used if the source was human the security forces often could not reveal his or her identity thus it wa s quite common for people suspected of up to dozen or more terrorist offences to be able to move openly in the community this in part led to much greater emphasis on fo rensic evidence much greater awareness of the importance of forens ic evidence on the part of the army and equal awareness of the need to avoid leaving forensic evidenc on the part of terrorist organisations 697 british servicemen were ki of those i 155 of the udr and ight in terrorists killed 2148 people incl 162 were other republican terrorists it is ironic that casualties lled by irish terrorists between 1969 and 2006 197 were in the udr seven in the royal irish regment hsf and four in the raf the remainder were members of the regular rmy or royal marines all of the hsf were killed off duty as were roughly tw dozen regular servicemen forty five were killed on the british mainl and five in the irish republic and germany belgium and the nether lands six were killed by yalists the remainder by republican terrorists during the same period the army killed 301 people of whom 12 1 were republican terrorists and ten were loyalist terrorists the remainder were ci vilians republican uding servic emen and 28 were loyalist terrorists loyalist terr orists killed 1071 people republican terrorists killed 30 more r epublican terrorists than the army did 2 12 lost lives by mckittrick keltes lost lives is casualty figures for this publication were derived from feeney and thornton mainstream pub lishing edinburgh revised 2001 the only comprehensive source available to the private citizen and is regarded as an impeccable source for its impartiality 234 sectarian killing had bec ome common but particularly vicious feud erupted in county armagh between south armagh pira and north armagh uvf the two organisations probably numbered less than 30 terrorists each between 19 december 1975 and 12 january 1976 over 40 people were ki lled and 100 wounded the main effect of this feud was to raise tension and the percep tion of the political need to be doing something the last vest iges of the sunningda agreement died quietly and the bulk of the population taci tly accepted direct rule from whitehall which lasted until the signi ng of the good friday agr eement in 1998 the ruc which had been badly demoralised in 1969 had recovered its operational effectiveness to the point where the operat ional primacy of the ruc in security operations was formally reestablished in 1976 235 the political situation had reached impas and pira had been forced to regroup restructure and reorganise those two conditi ons held for much of the rest of the troubles although there was to be political development and security force activity would continue the scene was set for long ca mpaign key events in the rest of the 1970s were the deployment of elements of the special ai r service sas regiment to south armagh and subsequently the rest of northern ireland from 1976 second less effective workers strike in 1977 and socalled dirty protest by prisoners in the maze prison the latter was related to the issue of special category conditions granted to internees and led to t he hunger strikes of the 1980s more widely the abstention of t he one northern irish socialist mp at westmi nster gerry fitt on crucial vote on 28 march 1979 brought down the labour government in the subsequent general election the rt hon margaret thatc her became prime minister bringing in conservative government that lasted until 1997 the 1980s 236 the military situation by 1980 was that six regular ba ttalions were stationed in northern ireland on twoyear tours three further batta lions undertook roulement tours of four and half months although this was reduced to two battalions and tours were extended to six months this broad pattern of deployment applied through the 1980s and into the mid1990s the roulement battalions operated in the most active areas of south armagh and west belfast the udr operated across wide areas where there was comparatively littl terrorist activity in 1980 it had 11 battalions mostly comprising parttimers but the proportion of fulltimers increased as absolute numbers declined pr oducing more effective forc of eight battalions by the end of the decade13 237 piras strength was fairly stable with hard core of bout 30 leaders plus 200300 active terrorists it broadened the nature nd scope of its activity with new weapons new methods of operations and in new areas it developed homemade mortar see box on the ulster defence regiment on page 35 2 13 13capability conducting series of attacks on security force bases it obtained some heavy weapons such as russian heavy mach ine guns and small number of sa7 antiaircraft missiles pira tactics and it s internal security were by now very effective and continued to improve it enjoyed some foreign support particularly from colonel gadaffis regime in libya it undertook campaign in continental europe with attacks on army and raf tar gets in germany the netherlands and belgium however that was the practical limit of its reach nd it did not sustain operations on the continent fo r long perhaps the most spectacular aspect of its continental campaign was the planned asu attack on an army target in gibraltar in march 1988 in the event th ree members of pira were shot dead by the sas in the territory 238 the inla had developed out of the rump of the oira it was much smaller and less effective than pira inla was neither as skilled nor as disciplined as the pira and committed number of major atrocities suc h as the bombing of the droppin well inn near ballykelly on 5 december 1982 and significant assassi nations including the rt hon airey neave blown up in his car at the palace of westminster on 30 march 1979 for much of the 1980s inla was preo ccupied with an internecine leadership struggle which considerably limited the movements effectiveness 239 loyalist paramilitaries cont inued to operate against the ca tholic community but on fairly limited scale they presented themse lves as the protectors of the protestant community but in practice were often littl more than collection of gangsters description which could also apply to number of republican terrorists 240 the hunger strikes of 1980 and 1981 whic h resulted in the death of bobby sands and nine others ended quietly w hen their families made it clear to remaining hunger strikers that when they fell into coma they would permit resuscitation and feeding by medical staff this was convenient way out of an impasse for all sides the initial deaths had been an important informa tion operations opportunity for pira but that wore off as more died whitehall had stood firm in the face of the strikes it was again determined not to be seen to be beaten but wanted an end to the continuing bad headlines however whils t on hunger strike bobby s ands had been elected as westminster mp although he never took his s eat in parliament in the byelection that followed his death his political agent owen carron was elected the head of sinn fein gerry adams was elected at the next general election thus the republican movement which had previously used an almost entirely military strategy found itself drawn into mainstream politics almost by chance 241 pira then developed its strategy into twotrack approach the ball ot box and the bomb this shift of emphasis towards po litics was confirmed with the emergence of gerry adams as the facto head of the republican move ment sinn fein never attracted high per centage of the vote14 but gradually became an accepted part of mainstream politics this could be viewed as part of the polarisation of northern irish politics towards the extremes sinn fe ins rise was largely at the moderate social democratic and labour party sdlps expense alternatively it could be seen as process of moving extreme republicanism away from violence and towards legitimate political activity though resisted in some quarters this process for example 134 of the northern ireland vote in the 1983 british general election 2 14 14has continued and was factor in the si gning of the good fr iday agreement government ban on allowing sinn fein mbers to be heard on the media in the 1980s was easily circumvented and eventually rescinded 242 the british governments main military obj ective in the 1980s was the destruction of pira rather than resolving the conflict t he armys operations during this time had developed into sophisticat ed mix of operations t he bulk of the army both regular and udr undertook vi sible framework operations15 these were primarily intended to reassure the public and deter rrorist activity whilst assisting the development of intelligence given effect ive intelligence that could be converted into evidence the terrorist could normally be arrested quite easily and prosecuted through the courts this might be called forensic and judicia l process and was of course the normal procedure for the ruc 243 on small number of occasions oper ations were planned to catch terrorists undertaking serious and violent offences rrorists were killed on about 13 or 14 such operations and arrested in number of others the most fa mous was that at loughgall on 8 may 1987 when eight terrorists died16 just over 40 terrorists were killed in those operations including severa l of their most expe rienced operators pira never found solution to this tact ic the strength of public condemnation with which nationalist media report ed such operations indicated the serious effect they had on pira 244 the three key tenets of army policy in the 1980s were reassurance deterrence and attrition most of the ttrition took place through arre st and conviction overt operations probably killed at most dozen terrorists during the 1980s the number killed in covert operations was in absolut terms not much greater in any case attrition of individual terrorists of itself had little effect on the outcome of the campaign however pira seem to have been brought to believe that there was answer to army covert operations and that they would not win through violence that was probably key factor 245 the main political development in t he 1980s was the angloirish agreement at hillsborough castle signed on 15 november 1985 its main effect was to allow dublin to advance views and proposals on range of issues relating to northern ireland in forum standing intergovernm ental committee established for that purpose it was welcomed by the catholic community and greatly disliked by the unionists whose mps boycotted westminster fo r some months in retrospect it can be seen as useful stepping stone toward s normalisation but as the only major political development in decade sca rcely great leap forward 246 pira activity levels increased toward s the end of the 1980s as did those of the security forces however the overall pict ure was one of slow and steady return to normality which would continue well beyond the end of the 1990s 15 chapter 5 506 16 chapter 5 fig 56 2 15 the long tail to the campaign 247 in 1990 pira deployed ne w weapon barrett 50 heavy calibre rifle to south armagh and for while this grabbed headlines it was first used at crossmaglen on 16 march 1990 the round struck soldie rs helmet but he was not seriously injured thereafter pira snipers kille d seven soldiers in south armagh before effective countermeasures were found altho ugh tragic this episode was relatively small blip in the stat istics of the campaign17 pira declared c easefire in november 1994 that ceasefire was broken when canary wharf in london was bombed in early 1996 and one later incident in the province resulted in the most recent death of soldier lance bombardier restorick shot outside bessbrook on 12 february 1997 at time of writing it is reasonable to hope that that will be the last the signing of the good friday agr eement and the laying down nd decommissioning of pira weapons seem to indicate that for practica l purposes the terrorist campaign is over decommissioning is as much symbolic as functional issue in this case 248 that is not to suggest t hat northern ireland has achieved state of lasting peace the signs appear good howeve r normality means differ ent things to different people at time of writing in 2006 there are still areas of northern ireland out of bounds to soldiers in 2005 army amm unition technical officers ato were clearing about 30 explosive dev ices month selfconf essed highlevel sinn fein informer was murdered in t he republic on 26 april 2006 however the army has withdrawn from many of its bases it has demolished most of it s observation posts op and permanent vehicle che ck points pvcp its str ength in the province is shrinking to that of peacetime garrison r oughly the same as it was in the spring of 1969 on current plans peration banner will be formally closed down in 2007 249 the road has not been smooth in the mid1990s the gr eatest threat was assessed to be that of dissident republicans who refused to accept the ceasefire new splinter organisations such as the real ira rira and continuity ira cira emerged dissident republicans were responsible for the omagh bomb on 16 august 1998 when 28 civilians died in the larges t single incident occa sioning loss of life in the history of the troubles loya list marches caused trouble most notably at drumcree where the army was involved in ma jor public order operations for several successive years nineteen battalions were involved in public order operations at times during 1998 250 thanks to many factors in cluding significant injection of eu regional development grants northern ireland is cu rrently prosperous and confi dent place most of the old victorian slums have l ong since gone and the number of modern architect designed detached houses is striking so cial conditions have improved markedly employment is reasonably buoyant and mass civ il rights protests are things of the past there is occasional talk of the potent ial for the resumption of violence that may possibly occur however the soci political economic and cultural circumstances which brought about the beginn ing of the troubles are longer present much of the organised crime whic h was for long time feature of both loyalist and republican activity is still pr esent on balance the outlook for northern ireland has improved considerably chapter 5 paras 529530 and box 2 16 17chapter 3 the protagonists 301 this chapter briefly reviews the parties to the troubles in 1969 the regular army was highly experienced force it had f ought number of campaigns in the long withdrawal from empire after 1945 most ly against insurgent forces in former colonies campaigns had been waged in malaya kenya aden and cyprus these had rarely involved over division relati vely small proportion of the army of the time many soldiers who had served in t he second world war were still in the army until the mid1960s in 1969 the army was r educing in size and st ill contained many officers and soldiers who had joined under national service pay and conditions were only just being modernised with the in troduction of pay comparability in addition standards of individual training were somewhat lower for example attendance by ncos at tactics courses at the school of infantry only became mandatory in the 1980s 302 in 1969 the republican move ment consisted of about 120 men in the ira most of whom were veterans of the ira campai gn of 19571962 fourteen were arrested on 14 august 1969 number fled s outh of the border with the republic and many of the rest tried to pacify rather than prov oke the rioters the ira had been taken by surprise by the events of august 1969 an d was found wanting popular song described the ira as i ran away the first few months of violence drove many disaffected unemployed young men into the ira1 proportion of them had little time for the older generations talk of marxist ideology and politics they wanted the ira to take direct action the ira was init ially illprepared for t hat however driven by need to regain its legitimacy as the defender of the catho lic community it started to do so at the ar d fheis central council meeting held in dublin on 10 and 11 january 1970 it was announced that the hardline activists had split from the main or official body of the ira and set up its provisional wi ng after the oira ceasefire this became the pira figure 31 republican gunman many individuals who rapidly rose to prominence in the republican movement were young men in august 1969 gerry adams was 21 martin mcguinness was 19 both took part in secret talks in whitehall in 1972 3 1 1303 training camps were set up inside t he republic volunteer s were trained and returned to units weapons and explosiv were procured and smuggled across the border both the oira and pi ra grew rapidly by july 1971 there were estimated to be about 200 members of oira and 500 in pira of those 700 about 130 were in londonderry and 340 in belfast by the end of the year there were over 2000 about 1300 pira and 750 oira of whom about 880 were active those numbers exclude about 400 who had already been inter ned by may 1972 there were about 1700 active members of the two organisation s and further 600 had been interned training levels were poor and weapons were scarce operation motorman was effectively the beginning of the end of the insurgent stage of the campaign altogether about 10000 people were involved in the ira between 1969 and 1972 many could still be used for support in number of areas the numbers remained high through 1973 about 1600 active member s plus 200 auxiliari 200 women and 600 youths 304 however pira was adapti ng and evolving for most of operation banner pira was the principal cause of violence by 1978 when it had evolved fully into cellular terrorist structure of 200300 active mem bers there was shortage of experienced men and some women to draw on desp ite attrition as the 1970s and 1980s went on pira continued to be able to keep it s numbers up it dev eloped efficient intelligence quartermaster finance and engineering branches the latter was primarily concerned wit h bomb making and development asus specialised typically as bombers or gunmen at one stage there was an allfemale asu which specialised in placing cassette incendiary devices in shops as part of piras attack on commercial property in the mid1980s pira was organised in to 16 principal asus of which ten were based south of the border the original brigade battalion and company structure persisted in public for some time not leas t on street art although pira declared ceasefire in northern ireland in 1994 it conducted five bombing campaigns on the british mainland in the later 1990s principal targets were either commercial such as the baltic exchange bishopsgate and canary wharf bombs or transport infrastructure railway stations and motorway junctions all of the asus involved were arrested and the police noted considerable decline in terrorist skill levels during those campaigns figure 32 republican street art 3 2 305 by comparison the other republican organisations such as inla were much smaller less well equipped an d organised they were all to some extent splinters of the ira and therefore had some training they tended to be organised around smal l number of individuals and subject to vicious internecine feuds they were typically dangerous but unstable 306 there was bewildering arra of loyalist paramilitary organi sations mostly aligned to some aspect of the unionist movement the largest was the uda which was perhaps the most respectable although origin ally an association of local vigilante groups formed in 1971 at it s peak it had over 2000 mem bers the most dangerous was probably the uvf which was essentially terrorist organisation it had about 1000 members at its peak both organi sations were heavily involved in racketeering extortion and other forms of serious crime the loyalist movement rarely attacked the security forces it di d so on occasion in response to political activities that were unpopular with the prot estant community for example in late 1985 and 1986 loyalists attacked the houses of over 300 members of the ruc in response to the angloirish agreement over 50 of them were burnt out with petrol bombs 307 the ruc was raised in 1922 it was in tended to be onethird catholic but never recruited catholics in thos numbers by 1969 it had total strength of 3000 organised on county basis with small tact ical reserve of eight platoons of about 30 men it was badly demoralised by t he events of august 1969 and needed significant rebuilding in terms of the restoration of morale th improvement of its leadership strength and efficiency these were all identif ied by the hunt enquiry which found that the key need was for ef fective leadership at the highest level2 this figure 33 joint ruc and army patrol chapter 2 214 3 3 2was notable by its absence early in t he campaign new chief constable was brought in from london wit h indifferent results expe rtise was also injected though the attachment of policemen from the ma inland one of whom kenneth newman became the chief constable in due course numbers grew steadily but arguably it was not until kenneth newman took over as chief constable in may 1976 that the ruc really reestablished itself 308 the army had found the ruc to be secretiv and mistrustful of outsiders be they from the army or politicians that changed as the organisation matured by 1976 ruc numbers reached 5268 that year the detection rate for murders rose from 20 to 80 and the number of pira charged for terrorist offences rose from 320 to 690 in september oc tober and november 1976 t he ruc was achieving an average of more than four c onvictions of terrorists per working day the ruc had been successfully rehabilitated and its num bers continued to grow by late 1982 its strength reached over 8000 plus over 2500 parttime reserves 309 ruc special branch sb had the norma l sb responsibility for countering subversion in northern ireland in 1969 this was focussed almost exclusively against the ira its structure wa s entirely inadequate to cope with the massively expanding republican movement its staff was seen as mediocre and was hugely overworked rebuilding the sb was high priority by 1976 or so that had largely been done although further structural improvements were required in the 1980s to coordinate all sources of information properly and enable such information to be acted on in timely and effective manner 310 however the ruc remained largely protestant organisation and was seen as needing further reform chris patten form er conservative minister and governor of hong kong oversaw review in 1998 and 1999 which recommended the formation of new police force which was more broadlybased and accountable3 the ruc was awarded t he george cross for its services during the troubles it was stood down and replaced by new service the police service of northern ireland psni some of the recommendations of the patten report mirrored those in the hunt report 30 years before 311 the b specials were stood down in apr il 1970 and allowed to apply to join new force the udr which was to be part of the army enlistment was not automatic as the army took time to vet all applicant s and exclude those with extremist views or connections like the ruc the udr never attr acted as many catholics as it should have the udr was initially almost exclusiv ely parttime force of seven battalions it had cadre of regular officers and soldie rs mostly posted from other infantry regiments 1800 udr soldiers were avail able on 1 april 1970 and over 4000 year later by february 1971 t he udr was capable of large scale operations such as controlling movement into and out of belfas t in support of major operation in the city its role was principally that of stat ic security guards local patrolling and control of vehicle movement its cond itions of service were broadl similar to the territorial

nonetheless security breaches by members of the udr and hsf were rare the udr and hsf chains of command were generally able to assess the reliability of individual members of the regiments and acted accordingly the udr and hsf performed critical role releasing units of the regu lar army for service in harder areas they also did major service by reassuring the protestant population that was not just matter of law and or der it was probably also factor in ensuring that extreme loyalist violence was relatively rare because the protestant community largely did not feel itself to be at risk in other words the udr served significant operational as well as tactical role4 figure 34 r irish hsf the seven the ulster defence regiment the udr was raised on 1 apri l 1970 in response to the hunt

largest infantry regiment in the british army and the regiment which spent the longest period on active duty of any regim ent since the napoleonic wars neither statement is entirely true during the first world war many regiment s had more than 11 battalions however regiment served on active duty throughout the napoleonic wars wh ich only lasted for 23 years 17921815 counting the hsf with the udr

initially rest ricted to guarding key point s and carrying out patrols and however as its capability improved so did its responsibilities within ten years of it s formation eight of the 11 udr battalions had their own areas of responsibility aor with fu ll responsibility for ll operations except for crowd and riot control which were excluded from udr tasks it was originally envisaged that the strength of the udr would be 6000 men and women but at its peak in november 1972 it was 9000 strong with gradual drop in numbers thereafter despite being accuse d in some quarters of being native levies in the pay of the london government the udr played major role in the campaign and its contribution should not be forgotten as well as relieving the pressure on the regular army the soldiers of the udr provided vel of continuity and local knowledge not achievable even by resident battalions this understanding of the local s always appreciated or drawn on by roul ement units not least it provided an opportunity to those who wanted to make difference and who might otherwise have joined loyalist extremist groups undoubtedly the soldiers of the udr provided an invaluable service to the cam paign despite the fact that t heir actions were always under scrutiny by the republican pr ess and politicians very few cases of offduty udr soldiers involved in loyalist paramilitary acti vity were seized upon by its opponents but most udr soldiers both permanent cadre and par ttime accepted that they could not r military role and were constantly subject to intimidation and the threat of

lisation and professi onalism that had begun with the establishment of the udr permanent cadre in the 1980s hs battalions had the same is skills and responsibilities as regular units 314 the existence of the bor der brought other parties into the conflict the government of ireland which had cooperat ed with stormont during t he ira campaign of 195762 was deeply antibritish in the late 1960s nd 1970s initially t herefore there was virtually crossborder cooper ation internal politics in the republic were major factor the republic was set up in terms per ceived as the liberation of the catholics from british oppression of which loyalism and unionism were key parts thus whatever dublins immediat political postur domestic opinion would tend to militate against cooperati on or collaboration with whitehall and stormont furthermore whether fianna fa il or fine gael was in government in dublin the opposition party could always play antibritish sentiment as political device in the dail examples of where the government of ireland may have acted to appease domestic opinion were its attempt to bring case against the british government in 3 6 the european court of human rights relati ng to internment and the prosecution of eight sas soldiers for illegal possessi on of weapons when they had crossed the border inadvertently due to map reading error dublin also brought case against the united kingdom in 1977 relating to alleged inhuman treatm ent of arrested persons the case was rejected by the cour t the border issue took long time to overcome the murders of the british ambassador to d ublin in july 1976 and lord mountbatten near sligo on 27 august 1979 the same day as the warrenpoint bombs created waves of public sympathy and dislike of the pira which allowed some progress by the 1980s relations hips at government level were much improved tactical co operation along the border largely followed suit5 315 the irish police service the garda is generally highly respected within ireland and enjoys different place in society from t hat of the ruc ira members fled south of the border from the beginnings of the troubles and h ad some support from the local population it was widely beli eved in the north that the garda co lluded or at least turned blind eye as long as ira men did not break the w in the republic whilst there may have been some sympathy at an individual level the ira and sinn fein espouse radical socialist political model and the unification of northern ireland with the republic these two aspects set t he republican movement apart from much mainstream political and popula r opinion in the republic initially the garda did not cooperate with the ruc this posture softened quite early and regular meetings direct telephone lines and similar measures were put in place after 1979 the garda became much more active in prosecuting terrorism on 30 january 1982 the garda found 50000 rounds of ammuniti on in one cache the largest amount of ammunition ever found in one operation dur ing the troubles there we re other equally important successes such as the arrest of the pira bomb maker desmond ellis in may 1981 however the garda did not deal di rectly with the british army 316 the irish army was by british standar ds very small and not well equipped for much of the campaign it had at most two infantry battalions in the northborder area and these were not deployed fulltime on oper ations in fact such operations were quite rare and the irish army always operated in support of the garda cooperation with the british army was developed slowly and indirectly by measures such as inviting the attendance of student s at the british army sta ff college or at the school of infantry however joint irishbritis h military operations along the border which might have done much to deny pira its sa fe havens in the republic were never conducted 317 the rest of the world was by and large little more than an audience to the drama of northern ireland belgium the netherlands and germany were drawn in by the pira campaign in europe france was in volved indirectly by links between inla and the french terrorist group action direct and directly through the french navys seizure of the mv eksund on 31 may 19 87 eksund was carrying 3500 crates of arms and ammunition including 20 sa7 s 1000 aks ten dshkm heavy machine guns and two tonnes of semtex commercial high explosive the french authorities believed that libya was involved in the prov ision of this material pira also had links with the basque terrorist group eta another country with less than desirable connections with northern ireland terrorist s was colombia three republican chapter 4 paras 411414 3 7 5suspects were arrested by the colombian au thorities in 2001 and were convicted of having dealings with the terrorist group farc 318 the biggest foreign contributor to norther n ireland was the population of the usa the us organisation noraid collected large amounts of cash for pira for example about 100000 in 1974 the am ount peaked during the hunger strikes in the early 1980s with 250000 being raised in six mont hs however the quantity varied considerably and dried up whenever republican terrorists committed major atrocity such as the enniskillen or omagh bombs there was at times view in britain that us extradition procedures favoured members of pira who were on the run in the usa however even at the height of the hunger strikes 60 of all media reporting in the us was probr itish director of nora id was charged in the us with terroristrelated offences in october 1981 that same year ronald reagan at the time presidential candidate public ly announced handso ff approach with regards to northern ireland fo r his administration policy broadly fo llowed by all us administrations during the troubl overall us aid to irish republicans was limited and largely restricted to the efforts of fe w individuals the ev ents of 11 september 2001 in new york and washin gton largely removed american sympathy for terrorism worldwide and this effect keenly felt in northern ireland forced irish republicans further towards pursuing their cause in the po litical rather than the military arena 3 8 chapter 4 strategic and operational level issues strategic issues 401 since most of the world appeared largely content for brit ain to conduct its affairs in northern ireland without interference it is not clear what strategic questions were at stake the general line of strategic dire ction from whitehall appears to have been to resolve matters in northern ireland at reas onable cost and wit hout undue distraction to the normal conduct of business to that end the direction given to gocs at least until late 1971 was to keep stormont in bus iness if possible the border see paras 411414 was potentially strategic issu but was not r egarded as such in westminster for much of the troubles 402 the question of the positi on of northern ireland within t he united kingdom should therefore be considered under the ir eland act of 1949 nort hern ireland would remain part of the unit ed kingdom as long as storm ont wished it to be so however stormont could be and was disso lved the ireland act could potentially have been repealed or amended by an act of the westminster parliament other part of the uk had its own par liament in 1969 the est ablishment of governmental institutions in northern ireland in 1921 gave the impression that whitehalls role was effectively custodial the westminster convention of 1928 meant that events in northern ireland would not normally be disc ussed in the house of commons thus it could be said that in whitehall nd westminster there was general lack of interest in northern ireland which persist ed after 1969 geography also played part for much of the british population s eeing the violence brought to their tv screens northern ireland was remote place wi th which it had li ttle affinity on reflection it seems unlikely that the level of violence seen in londonderry or belfast would have been tolerated for as long if it had occu rred in say bristol or birmingham figure 41 the ardoyne belfast 1971 painting by david shepherd 4 1 403 goc northern ireland reported to the chief of the general staff cgs daytoday direction in whitehall was conducted by br anch of the armys di rectorate of military operations mo4 subsequently mo2 until the last years of the campaign cgs was responsible to the secretary of stat for defence the prime minister of northern ireland was in effect and subsequent ly secretaries of states for northern ireland ssni were in fact answerable to the british prime minister the chief constable of the ruc and later the psni were answerable only to the law thus in fact not even the british pr ime minister had complete authority over policy for northern ireland the consequences of this will be considered in chapter 81 operational level issues 404 operation banner is effectively large sc ale instance of military assistance to the civil power whilst stormont was in being the goc was required to render assistance to it however given its parti san composition stormonts intentions would tend to be partisan for example the urge to sort out the falls fortunately the goc could interpret such requests for assi stance in the light of his directive from cgs and act evenhandedly 405 unfortunately this political and oper ational situation could lead to tragic consequences for example military advice was consistently against the reintroduction of internment in 1971 the northern ireland prime minister the rt hon brian faulkner managed to persuade t he british prime mini ster the rt hon edward heath to support its introduction his grounds were that it was increasingly difficult for him retain confidenc in stormont in the face of rising violence that is to say internment was introduced largely as result of pressure from unionist politicians the british prim minister stated that it was political decision for stormont that could not be justified on security grounds the consequences were severe in practice much of the activi ty of the northern ireland joint security committee in 196971 focussed on tactical iss ues such as control of marches or the removal of barricades rather than higher level matters 406 when stormont was dissolv ed this lack of unified approach was not resolved ssni was not viceroy nor gov ernor general and the goc was not responsible d irectly to him in the mid1970s it was apparent that successive ssnis were pursuing political initiatives with varying degrees of success but were inconsistent between that activity and their duty as ministers of state the net result was incoherence for example during internment successive ssnis were ordering the release of detainees whilst the security forces were rounding them up in many cases the same individuals were rearrest ed having broken the law again2 the goc and the chief constable both requested that rel eases be linked to some behavioura l advantage for example there might be fu rther releases until ceasefire was in place that did not occur the terro rists took advantage of this confusion and viewed it as sign of weakness 1 chapter 8 paras 812817 2 at the time 60 of released detainees rejoined pira which had an explicit rehabilitation programme for them 4 2 figure 42 londonderry 1969 407 the formal relationship between the army and the ruc was not well defined after the way ahead paper of 1976 the army wa s to act in support of the ruc the form of that support was never clear in large areas of northern ireland the ruc could operate freely and so the question wa s largely academic however in the most difficult areas such as west belfast and south armagh the ruc could not operate without very considerable support3 in practice the army led operations in those areas until the early 1990s although the form of ruc support developed continuously between those two extremes there was considerable grey area tactically this was reflected in the extent to which the army acted in figure 43 rural patrol accordance with the rucs wishes issues for example police car patrols were reintroduced in south armagh for the first time in 17 years in 1995 the same year saw the first drinkdriving operations in south armagh at the time all army patrols in that aor were accompanied by policemen which gave the ruc practical veto over the patrol programme whereas the ruc would not patrol u nescorted except within sight of the security bases and then only occasionally ironically the register of shotgun licences was always thoroughly up to date because terrorist suspect wished to risk being rrested for firearms offence 4 3 3 included the extent of ruc input into t he patrol programme and whether all patrols had to be accompanied by policeman 408 at stage in the campaign was there an explicit operational level plan as would be recognised today this may appear surpri sing but two major factors should be considered the first is that campai gn planning tools only appeared formally in rudimentary form in british army doctrine in 19944 and then in joint doctrine thereafter it had been entirely normal to conduct campaigns such as the mau mau or the malayan emergency by series of directives the modern understanding of the operational level of war did not exist in the british army until the mid1980s the consequences are considered later5 the second factor was that senior officer had the authority to wr ite or impose campaign plan across all the necessary lines of operation 409 if operation banner wa s campaign without cam paign plan how was it conducted gocs received directives from cgs they were not the strategic directives of modern doctrine but many of thei r features can be seen in them gocs and clfs then issued directives for tactic operations within the theatre the gearing of tactical operations to strategic or operational purpose was generally not particularly close coordination with ot her government departments was also of variable quality the indepen dence of the ruc and psni in being answerable only to the law has been mentioned as has the poor leadership displayed by some chief constables the lack of coher ence between political activity on the part of ssni and the nio on the one hand and the security forces on the other has also been described in terms of stru cture and process there were regular highlevel security meetings such as the norther n ireland joint security committee initially they were poorly run agendas were not circulated in advance and minutes were not kept 410 in practice much depended on individuals their persona lities and how they got on together overall the picture is of gener ally able and wellintentioned men doing what they believed best wit h generally similar common pur pose in practice too many things that were everybodys job were nobodys job it could have been better this is considered further in chapter 86 the border 411 the border with the irish republic was problem at the strat egic operational and tactical levels from august 1969 to the later stages of the campaign republican terrorists used the republic as safe ven although as has been seen that became less safe as the campaign progre ssed the scope of the problem was considerable in the late 1970s it was considered that pi ra simply could not survive without refuge in the republic and the bo rder also offered opportunities for fundraising from smuggling activities in 1988 ten of the 16 pira asus operated from south of the border at the strategic level the lack of cooperation with the dublin government until the later 1980s has been mentioned persuading the dublin government to change its policie s regarding the border area would have 4 adp vol 1 operations army code 71565 part 1 chapters 3 and 4 and vol 2 command army code 71564 chapter 6 paras 06280644 5 see 409 and see also chapter 8 paras 812814 and 816 6 ibid 4 4 been politically very difficult and whitehall ght have had to consider sanctions in some form or other the key internationa l security issue at the time was the cold war eire was not part of nato and in the 1970s the republic was moving towards entry into the european community in gr and strategic terms di plomatic standoff between the uk and eire on border issues was not realistic there was in addition guarantee that any possible dublin government measures in the border areas would have been effective the garda and iris h army forces available were small and republican extremism was destabilising factor and potential threat to the dublin government those living in the border areas had ideas for their future governance that were unacceptable to both the westminster and dublin governments the alternative patient diplomacy and political engagement over the long term proved effective and local c ooperation between the ruc and the garda improved progressively th is lack of strategic approach did imply that consideration of the border as an operational level issue for the british army was priority7 412 the british militar doctrine with its renewed emphas is on the operational level did not appear until 1989 the border was clearly an operational level issue the border had political dimension it had material influence on the overall situation owing to the safe havens in the republic and acti on there would contribute directly to the strategic goal the question of the border was revisited by gocs and clfs on several occasions but few lasting military init iatives resulted to some extent this revisiting of the border is positive refl ection of mindset that continues to probe and revisit issues in order to seek new solutions as the situation evolves however in the absence of an explicit campaign plan it also suggests the reinvention of the wheel by successive senior officers bec ause the issue was never definitively addressed it is notable that the same candidate solutions were considered and discarded three times at roughly fiveyear intervals that is not to criticise the individuals involved it was probably consequence of the absence of single unifying authority coupled with the lack of developed understanding of the operational level of war in the british army at the time 413 of the candidate solutions considered the most common was that of closing the border with fence and security force estimates of up to 29 battalions were considered to be required for the security fo rce one proposal was to lay minefields along the border that was rapidly dismissed at va rious times dozens of minor crossings were closed by royal engineer unit s after while this would be found not to work because if not kept under cont inuous observation the local population would lift the obstacles or bypass them the policy would be discontinued and then rediscovered few years later closing border crossings was generally unpopular with the local population m any of whom had legitimate farming or other business interests and family links on both sides of the border the border between northern ireland and the republic was more obvious and clearly defined than say that between hampshire and wiltshire in places it ran along streams hedges the side or middle of roads and in some plac even the middle of farm yards other minor strategic benefits included the agreement to allow overflight of irish territory in certain circumstances 4 5 7414 all of these options can be seen with hindsi ght to have been tactical with one exception there was never any operational level considerat ion of the border the exception was the decision in the mid1988 to reorganise aors to create border brigade 3rd infantry brigade responsible for long strip of territory along the border although wellintenti oned it did not work in pa rt because of the resulting geography of the brigade aor with hinds ight an operational estimate of the campaign as whole might have identified that the border area was critical to the conduct of pira operations and therefore should hav been the geographical focus of the campaign where cro ssgovernmental social and economic measures were to be focussed and where in operational level terms the pira was to be engaged and defeated in practice excessive im portance was attached to the immediate tactical aspects of the border itself rather than to the t heatrelevel aspects of cross border operations the techniques of inte lligence preparation of the battlefield were unknown until the 1990s and the compre hensive approach was not developed until more recently8 it is not that the personalitie s involved were not capable nor that these issues were not understood to some exten t but that the explicit understanding of how they might be linked into cohe rent plan at the operationa l level was missing command of operations 415 in august 1969 hq northern ireland consiste d of the goc brigadier general staff bgs two so1s four so2s three so3s and very little else from 14 august nobody had much sleep for week the hq was rapidly expanded the bgs became the chief of staff as major ge neral and second major general was brought in as director of operations ho wever the division of responsibilities between the two major generals was flawed and the quality of staff was generally insufficient both shortcomings were addressed but the process took about two years to complete this reinforces the need to conduct an estimate of command arrangements at the beginning of campaign or major operation and to revisit that estimate subsequently9 416 there were three deployable infantry brigade hqs in brit ain at the time10 s northern ireland was reinforc ed with individual units thes three hqs were deployed for short tours in various locations for example to command part of the belfast taor during operation motorman at the same time second permanent brigade hq hq 8th infantry brigade had been blished in londond erry followed by hq 3rd infantry brigade in february 1972 short tours by brigade hqs had been useful expedient initially but did not provide the continuity required for long counter insurgency campaign since the great majority of regular units in theatre were roulement in the early 1970s up to 25 as against four resident it is difficult to see how the operation could have been conducted effectively without permanent brigade hqs as the campaign progre ssed the brigade hqs provided fixed 8 in the event elements of an operational level soluti on did emerge the economic regeneration of newry in the 1980s did much to reduce the economic and soci problems in south armagh and south down and in the republic through eu grants and reduced the issue to manageable proportions the police and customs drive against some notorious republican racketeers in south armagh and the border areas in 2005 06 is evidence of progress such operations were not considered practicable in the 1980s and 1990s 9 adp land operations army code 71819 chapter 6 0659 10 hqs 5th infantry 16th airportable and 24th infantry brigades 4 6 infrastructure into which roulement uni ts and reinforcement companies passed between units as required dropped relative ly easily hqs also developed very efficient working practices in which for example the authority to task assets such as ato was routinely delegated to watchkeepers it was observed that after the 1990s previously high levels of staff efficien cy had largely disappeared from northern ireland brigade hqs this was the result of the staff officers and watchkeepers through fault of their own not havi ng the experience of the many and varied incident characteristics of the higher intensity campaign which was winding down in the early to mid1990s figure 44 public order the ardoyne 2001 417 as will be discussed later11 the training system put into place from 1972 was highly effective in preparing units for northern ir eland soldiers and junior commanders were well trained up to company level as were operations and intelligence staffs at company and battalion levels however several former senior officers have remarked that the preparati on of company and battalion commanders was less good these were generally capable officers and many had served in theatre before however they were not well trained or educated as to how to run an aor as opposed to what drills to underta ke in what circumstances in practice they often did well as result of their personal ability and their prior experi ence but their wider education could in retrospect have been better it is also probably fair to remark that an explicit campaign plan which linked strategic and operatio nal level objectives logically to tactical activities would have bee n of considerable benefit in this respect chapter 7 paras 724727 4 7 11418 with very large sample of unit formation and theatre commanders available some remarks can be made about command style at the very lowest level the army relied very heavily on its ncos and junior officers with the benefit of extremely effective pretour training the great majority re sponded admirably indeed it could be said that its experience in nort hern ireland has been landmark in the development of the british army in this regard given t he emphasis on the indivi dual fire team within multiple patrolling operat ion banner was perhaps not so much corporals war as lance corporals war that expe rience has already stood the army in good stead in other theatres and will probably continue to do so for long time 419 at unit and brigade level the early years can be described as laissezfaire many units reported arriving in thei r aor and being told simply to get on with it as the brigade structure became more permanent this evolved to the point where brigades had very clear expectation as to what wa s required in which unit aor and how it should be achieved for example in so uth armagh in the early 1990s battalions were directed as to how many multiples were to deploy into which company aor and to what purpose for example perm anent ops patrols base defence and reserves some former commanding office rs co have observed that this severely limited their freedom of operation others observed that this was necessary for the sake of continuity and to limit r einventing the wheel this issue will be addressed further in chapter 812 420 at brigade and higher levels much app ears to have depended on the individuals concerned by the 1980s several gocs and clfs had commanded units brigades or both in northern ireland two trends can be identified with hindsight the first is tendency to overcommand by the doc trine of the 1990s and later the goc commanded at the strategic level or perhaps the strategicoperational divide the clf commanded at the operational level or perhaps the operat ionaltactical divide number understood this and acted accord ingly there is ample anecdotal evidence to suggest tendency to delve into ta ctical issues down to the level of the private soldier this is clear ly matter of balance senior officers should visit units and talk to soldiers in order to understand what is actually happening at that level but they should not involve themselves wit h the daytoday runni ng of units unless something is terribly wrong if it is action is probably required at higher level to resolve it13 421 however this is not just an issue of per sonalities for much of the campaign subunit commanders confidential reports were coun tersigned by the clf this was seen as an opportunity and indeed duty to get to know every major individually that was significant task given such large numbers of roulement units another aspect was that given lack of understanding of the operational level hq northern ireland sometimes concerned itself with matters th at were probably the remit of brigades an example is daylong brie fing in the 1980s to the cl f on the future of tactical operations in the armagh roulement battalion aor in retrospect it appears that that should have been the business of the relevant br igade commander 12 chapter 8 840 13 fm slims saying that there are bad soldiers only bad officers is apposite 4 8 422 personality was an issue in another way it is fair to observe that the leadership of some senior officers had negative effect on their subordinates to the detriment of operational effectiveness this was exacer bated under the stress of operations and had ripple effect throughout the chain of command separate and perhaps lesser problem was the tendency of individuals at various levels to seek shortterm tactical results through positive acti on where more measured approach was probably required operati on banner presents sufficiently large sample to be able to suggest that both issues were pr oblems at times which was exacerbated by the perception that formation command appoi ntments in northern ireland came second after those in the british army of the rhine in the central region which did represent the main effort of the uk defence posture 423 in the early phases of t he campaign some unit commanders felt it appropriate to play up local difficulties in order to appear to make significant progress during their tour this short term approac h was soon seen to be counterproductive one senior officers guidance to incoming cos was along the lines of this is good place to get dso as long as you dont try to earn one 424 the committee structure was critical aspect of the exercise of command in northern ireland oper ational and intelligence committ ees were established right at the beginning of the campai gn and persisted throughou t right down to company level in some cases at higher levels th ere were the security policy meetings at goc level and security coordina tion meetings at clf level traditional terminology such as district or divisional action committees dac and subdistrict action committees subdac also persisted this joint system was the everyday mechanics of coordination pr incipally between the uniforme d army and the ruc at higher levels it included ruc sb and other agencies it w ent some way to mitigate the effect of having single authority for the campaign as whole another facet was the broad range of professional worki ng committees at hq and brigade level which considered everything from land use through electromagnetic spectrum management to flight safety across northern ir eland for civilian and military users coterminous police and army boundaries 425 one further issue at the oper ational level or on the operat ionaltactical divide took very long time to resolve the value of the army and the police using the same boundaries was obvious and was well known to the army from previous campaigns apart from tactical and teamwork advantages and agreed priorities key factor relates to the gathering and sharing of intell igence the police in the form of the ruc had long established boundar ies and for them it should be noted terrorism was only one of several aspects of law breaking against which they were acting the armys deployment was based around the areas where there was greatest need for tactical activity to defeat terrori sm and to support the ruc however intransigence and lack of pr eparedness to recognise the requirements of other organisations together with ck of political will and an abs ence of single campaign authority mentioned above meant that this issue took over 25 years to resolve the military principle in counter insurgency and counter terrorism and lesson from this campaign remains that est ablishment of coterminous bound aries for the police the army and intelligence agencies is an early prerequisite for campaign success 4 9 legal issues 426 several strands of legal issues related to operation banner can be identified the first was the legal powers available to the curity forces generally and the soldier in particular operations in northern irel and were always conducted under the law but there was considerable legislative activi ty primarily in the 1970s to equip the security forces with sufficient powers to be ab to do the job required of them the emergency powers act14 was one result another was the prevention of terrorism act of 1974 powers had to be clarified and legal loopholes closed all of which took time 427 for the soldier the main issue was the guidance for opening fire which was known as the yellow card the yellow card itself has force in law but seeks to reflect the law of self defenc and identify the circumstances when potentially lethal force may be used it was effectively the ru of engagement fo r most operational circumstances it was intended that so long as soldiers adhered to the contents of the yellow card then they would be acting within the law and that was proven to be the case the card was subjected to cont inuous review and scrutiny but since it was written with legal pur poses in mind it was not genera lly found to be user friendly at least in the early days what seemed to be required wa s some form of situational trainer perhaps similar to that produced to teach the contents of the law of armed conflict or perhaps computer based by the early 1980s gocs and clfs were expressing content with the powers available under the yellow card figure 45 urban search 1974 actually the northern ireland emergency prov isions act of 1973 and as subsequently amended 4 10 14428 there was less contentment with the powers available for the prosecution of terrorists although by the 1980s it seems to have been accepted that further extension of power was likely there were two broad areas of discontent the first and most obvious was that the organisers of terrorism were able to place themselves beyond the effective reach of the law whilst still living openly in northern ireland some of those same individual s still do this obvious sour ce of frustration should be balanced against the wish to avoid introduci ng exceptional powers in way which either distorts the structure of society or which is obvious ly discriminatory if either case had occurred the security forces would have appeared to be better than the terrorists 429 however the second caus of frustration which does not appear to have been made explicit at the time was an inability to coopt the legal machinery effectively to produce sensible changes in the law for example in the 1970s there was discrepancy between maximum sentences for the possession of firearms in northern ireland and on the uk mainland maximum s entences on the mainland were actually higher it was suggested in whitehall that this discrepancy should be removed the westminster attorneygenerals response wa s to the effect that any attempt at formal comparison would tend to throw doubt on the northern ireland judiciarys competence the pm postponed any further decision and the matter was dropped however within three years the di screpancy was removed by different government figure 46 snap vcp early 1980s 4 11 430 there are two issues here the first is difference of perspective to many soldiers the law is tool to support the establis hment and sustainment of public order and with which to conduct the cam paign to many lawyers especially government law makers the law is not tool but the fundamental basis of society it is not to be manipulated at will reflec tion suggests that these two perspectives can both be accommodated however the second issue is that the machinery of government was clearly not coordinated in practice those two view s were rarely synchronised with each other this is another example of the effect of not having single campaign authority figure 47 routine police operations 431 further strand of legal issues concerned the soldier who killed or injured in the course of his duty these cases were in vestigated by the ruc and the numbers that came to court were very few dozen or so serious cases over more than 30 years one infamous case known as the pitchfork murders15 was not an operational shooting as t he name suggests it was murder those responsible were tried convicted and jailed other cases centred around the key issue of whether the soldier had the right to open fire in the particular circumstances pertaining at the time this resulted in some convictions16 but in the vast majority of cases the director of public prosec utions for northern ireland directed prosecution or the soldie rs were acquitted at trial17 the basis on which these directions were given or acquittals made was broadly that the soldier had acted 15 r v hathaway byrne chesnutt and snowball 1981 16 r v thain 1984 r v clegg 1993 and r v fisher and wright 1995 clegg was subsequently acquitted on retrial in 1999 but his case which went to the house of lords remains key case in the use of force 17 r v foxford 1974 acquitted on appeal r v jones 1974 r v macnaughton 1975 r v bohan and temperley 1979 r v elkington and callaghan 1992 4 12 reasonably in the circumstances pertaining at the time and this was the case even if the soldier had in fact been mistaken the yellow card attempt ed to interpret the law of self defence so as to give clear guidance to soldie rs as to the circumstances in which they might use potentially lethal force what might be considered as reasonable in the circumstances is not however categorical there was therefore tensi on between the need for simple clear instructions and the less clearcut concept of reas onable behaviour this tension does not appear to have been resolved definitively its resolution ap pears to be matter of education rather than training 432 the concept of the flying lawyer wa s first developed during operation banner flying lawyers were army legal services offi cers who were held at high readiness to move rapidly to the scene of any serious in cident involving servicemen they gave immediate legal advice in the manner of defence lawyer thus protecting servicemen from either making inadvertent admissions or from possible abuse of legal rights 4 13 chapter 5 the tactical conduct of land operations 501 tactical operations during operation banner can be broadly divided between counter insurgency or counter terrorist oper ations and public or der operations with limited overlap between the two in turn counter insur gency or counter terrorist operations can be divided into overt framework operations and covert operations the whole campaign rapidly became dominated by consider ations of intelligence by 1972 or so most operations in norther n ireland had some intelligencegathering function or were tasked according to some form of information received 502 there was very little actionable intelli gence before the introduction of internment the ruc sb was almost completely ine ffective and the traditional source of humint the b specials had been dis banded the udr was originally not allowed any role in intelligence activities without actionable intelligence of any appreciable quality or quantity the security forces main offensive option was to search occupied houses usually conducted on the basis of lowgrade tipoffs 503 internment saw the development of cons iderable quantities of intelligence but perhaps more importantly of intelligence or ganisations and processes there was huge expansion in the numbers employed in intelligence collection collation analysis and dissemination with the gr eatest quantitative emphasis being on collection infantry battalions were di rected to form close observation platoons cop in may 19771 these were tasked with uniform ed covert surveillance small highly specialist units were raised to conduct covert surveillance and to collect humint by the end of t he 1970s one regular soldier in every eight serving in northern ireland was directly involved in intelligence 504 considerable emphasis wa s initially placed on screening p personality checks and pub checks detaining individuals for few hours to allow screening was useful since some individuals were quite happy to pass information in privacy if they had been detained however it was considered hi ghly invasive of personal liberty p checks were equally intrusive and pub che cks were often highly and unnecessarily confrontational as the campaign progressed these methods were largely replaced by less intrusive methods training in pect recognition and chatups it took little time to realise that the best chatterup wa s not necessarily the most senior member of patrol 505 the scope and scale of intelligence operat ions should be noted in the mid1970s an operation was targeted at t he hq of the pira belfast brigade the chance arrest of four terrorists at vc p whilst they were in the pr ocess of conducting bombing attack was exploited to rrest the officer commanding c belfast brigade his second in command who was also his technica l officer the brigade operations and explosives officers the qm the brigade intelligence officer and then the next brigade oc were arrested in followup operati ons in march and april 1974 total of 106 pira officers were arrested includi ng three successive ocs of the belfast brigade this was major factor in the defeat of the 1974 summer bombing campaign and helped destroy the remainder of the insurgent pira at one stage the active tour of duty of pira officer from appointment to ar rest was about four uniformed close observation specialists had exis ted in other organisations well before that date 5 1 1weeks roughly the same as the average time that subaltern might survive during the battle of the somme2 the quality of intelligence became very good indeed by the end of the 1980s pira was unable to m ount bombing operati on in belfast for about two years 506 the term framework operations was dev eloped in the 1980s to describe the routine activities of the uniformed army alt hough most of those activities had been undertaken or developed considerably earlier the list includes vehicle check points vcp routine patrolling searches and manning ops r15 was at 0200 hours it was heading the jcb wire leading into the van vehicles away from it the van was used as marker to alert the firer when the van was on target 10m the soldier inside died of head in juries injured attack on permanent ve hicle check point r15 on friday 1 may 1992 well planned and i ngenious pira attack was launched on the cloghogue permanent border crossing point r15 on the main a1 r oad south of newry so located alongside the belfast to dublin railway line patrol from 2nd battalion the ro yal regiment of fusiliers observed what appeared to be brown transit van travelling south to rth along the railway line there was an interior light on in the front of the van and it was traili ng wire behind towards the east sangar of r15 adjacent to the railway at the same time the soldier manning the east sangar report ed on the pvcp intercom proxy bomb back gate just prior to the explosion at newton bridge 2 km s outh of the pvcp renault van stolen in dundalk two weeks earlier and containing about 2000 lbs of explosives had been converted to run on rails by modifying its road wh eels metal bars had been wel ded to the wheels to make them run flush with the tracks jcb digg er stolen 15 minutes earlier was used to knock down wall beside the road and create ramp up to the railway line then lifted the van onto the rails it is asse ssed that the van was driven down the railway line to point 17 km from the pvcp where the firing pack was attached to command at the same time the terrorists set up ro adblocks north and south of r15 to divert the southern gro up were disguised as gardai then left in low gear to run slowly down the track the interior light would have been the force of the blast ripped the east sangar of r15 off its mountings and threw it over the rest of the pvcp with the exception of the hardened accommodation block was tota lly destroyed and 23 other soldiers were after the attack the checkpoint wa s rebuilt on the other side of the road and designed for maximum automati on with minimal troop presence 507 experience from other theatres such as aden had indicated the value of snap or shortterm vcps conducted at irregular times and places this was massively expanded in northern ireland to reflect great er numbers of civilian vehicles snap vcps were far more likely to capture rrorists and materiel than permanent vcps the indirect advantage was that prol onged programme of snap vcps had the fortunately for the individuals concerned most of the pira officers were arrested rather than killed or wounded 5 2 2general effect like most framework operations of deterring and constraining terrorist movement pvcps were also used extens ively unfortunately pvcps although useful as ops and to an extent as patrol bases rapidly became targets for terrorist attacks and were the targets of two of the more notable terrorist incidents of the whole campaign the attacks on the derry ard pvcp in 1989 and on the buncranna road pvcp in 1990 snap vcps also risk ed being the target of attack if their location and timing became predi ctable and if the tactics used were poor in addition snap vcp has short useful life afte r few cars had passed through it word would get round and even innocent traffic would avoid it figure 51 the divi s flats belfast 508 patrol tactics showed very rapid evol ution in the early stage s of the campaign initially typical patrol would be of secti on strength with so ldiers moving in file or single file it rapidly became apparent that this was vulnerable particularly in urban areas to gunman engaging an individual soldier at shor t range and making quick getaway terrain screening usually prevented other soldiers from returning fire from their own positions the initial response wa s parallel patrolling in which two groups would operate along parallel rout typically streets th is presented uncertainty to the gunman as to the location of the ot her group and allowed th group not in the initial contact to react quickly 509 pira rapidly developed scouting observation and early warning techniques universally known as dicking which limit ed the effectiveness of parallel patrolling the next development was multiple patr olling in which number of small teams typically three or four teams each of f our men would operate on separate but related routes crossing and recrossing doubling back and acting in what appeared to be highly unpredictable but mutua lly supporting manner such patrolling became common and the multiple semipe rmanent organisation typically half platoon became the standard tactical buildin g block within the company multiple patrolling rendered dicking very difficult assu ming that patrols did not use the same 5 3 routes on regular basis mult iple patrolling was very diffi cult to overcome further uncertainty was created in the mind of the rrorist by varying t he number of teams in the multiple the immediate benefit was that few casual ties were suffered by the unit the longerterm benefit was that it tended to deter shooting attacks 510 another common pira tec hnique was the lure commonly called the comeon decoys sometimes crude and sometimes hi ghly sophisticated were also used alertness sound drills and experience helped limit their effectiveness 511 after one patrol in which soldier was killed in the early 1980s it was discovered that patrols had used the same route and the same formation at the same time each day for several days within the patrol teams had developed the habit of following each other up the same street in formation known as duck patrol this left the rear team vulnerable and it was soldier in the rear team who died the officer in charge of the patrol resigned his commission this salutary example was used for long time in northern ireland training ad visory team nitat briefings 512 in practice the avoidance of setting patterns became major aspect of tactical operations the recording of patrol rout in both urban and rural areas assumed considerable importance it saved lives and aided terrence pira developed considerable patience and was prepared to wait for weeks to see whether units were setting patterns once pattern had been i dentified and verified pira could mount an attack however they were quite prepar ed to call it off at moments notice if any change to the pattern was detected primarily because they believed that the attack had been compromised figure 52 armoured patrol vehi cles apv with topcover sentries 5 4 513 vehicles could either be valuable part of patrol programme or dangerous liability humber 1ton armoured perso nnel carriers apc universally known as pigs were used at first some saracen apcs were also used they were replaced by armoured landrovers initially the armoured patrol ve hicle apv and then the purposebuilt snatch the at 105 saxon was procured in the mid1980s for use both in northern ireland and by uk based nato reinforcement brigades3 armoured vehicles were very useful for th rapid movement of troops typically to deploy or recover patrols or for quick re action forces operat ing around the fringes of foot patrol they added both speed of reaction and further degree of unpredictability to patrol movements howe ver when operating on their own singly or in pairs with foot elements they were vulnerable to attack pira developed at least two improvised antivehicle weapons such as the improvised antiarmour grenade iaag and horizontal pr ojectors which they deployed in some numbers until counters to them were found iaags were often dropped from overhead walkways or roofs counters included avoiding such areas with vehicles deploying topcover sentries and covering movement through such areas with foot patrols 514 searching was major activity its im portance varied throughout the campaign number of techniques were developed and used for differing purposes at different times the terminology can be confusing simple description is given here in the early years of the campaign with very li ttle actionable intelli gence house searches were major aspect of framework operations they were normally conducted on the basis of information received which was ften of poor reliability occupied house searches were hugely unpopular due to the invasion of privacy and inadvertent or sometimes deliberate damage that accompani ed them they tended to focus on catholic households largely because there were more republican suspects than loyalist and were perceived as evidence that the army was biased they probably contributed significantly to t he alienation of the ca tholic population in the early years of the campaign the balk an street search was probably the largest but in the months immediately following it largescale planned search operations typically covering whole street were being conduct ed at rate of about one month although occupied house searches were unpopular in the early years of the campaign the army could not simply let th hiding of weapons and explosives go unhindered the techniques of systematic search and the range of search equipment improved markedly in the 1970s and 1980s s earching tended to inhib it the supply of terrorist arms and equipment at the oper ational as well as the tactical levels 515 unoccupied house searches were far less contentious but became far more dangerous pira quickly realised that boobytrapping unoccupi ed houses was an effective way of attacking the army with relati vely little risk of injury to civilians there were thousands of burntout and dere lict houses in belfast and londonderry in the early 1970s in addition in the years before gorete x waterproof clothing there was strong tendency for patrols in rural areas to shelter from the rain in derelict barns and sheds the rule of dont go into derelicts wa s strongly reinforced during pretour training and saved lives 3 1st and 19th infantry brigades there were minor variati ons between the and natoroled vehicles 5 5 516 unoccupied house searches were one factor that led to the development of highrisk search techniques these were conduct ed by specialist royal engineer search teams rest another factor was the pira habit of boobytrapping improvised explosive devices ied and the areas around them not least in the hope of killing an ato thus tasking rest rapidly bec ame part of the normal response to finding suspect ied 517 an array of allarms search techniques was also developed it became normal for each infantry company to have trained s earch adviser typically the csm and search team and each battalion to have unit search adviser typ ically the rsm or pioneer platoon commander allarms sear ch teams had limited range of skills and equipment but were useful contributi on to the search effort in general once they confirmed the presence of suspect device rest or ato was called in all arms search teams were particularly usef ul for route clearance operations in addition every soldier in the infantry role was trained in lowlevel rummage searching rummage searches resulted in number of impor tant finds they also reduced the number of effective ied attacks on patrols and further constrained the terrorists freedom of operation winthrop searching named after the subaltern who invented it was particular technique which effectively go t into the mindset of the terrorist hiding the equipment or device procedures were developed whereby in some circumstances the soldier making find would not reveal the fact the location would be passed confidentially to his co who would consider whether or not covert operation should be mounted 518 search policy became an important part of tactical guidance to commanders changes to policy had dramatic effect on sear ch activity reflected in table 51 ser year building searches area searches b c d 1 1977 20724 7908 2 1978 15449 2729 3 1979 6452 1951 4 1980 4106 2218 5 1981 4104 879 6 1982

of scale if typical search was of one multiple of about 20 men working fo r eight hours the figure of 20724 man hours in 1977 would represent the equivalent of about 130 searches per week across force of about 13 battalions that is about ten searches per battalion per week on average 5 6 520 permanent overt ops became feature of life very early in the campaign they provided both degree of protection to other installations and source of valuable intelligence two in particular became most famous that on the top of the main block of the divis flats in belfast and the one in the market s quare in crossmaglen the borucki sangar4 the latter was installed in 1977 to keep the square under surveillance after it had been used to mount mortar attack on the nearby army base it was then manned continuously for over 20 years 521 covert ops had been feature of operat ions along the border from th beginning of the campaign although generally effective they tied up cops in semipermanent tasks and their locations became predictable over the years in the mid1980s it was decided to erect series of permanent hilltop ops in south armagh initially the high romeos known by their callsigns such as r21 r23 in the forkill area under operation condor and then the lowlying golf towers g10 g20 etc covering the approaches to crossmaglen under operation entirety figure 53 permanent op south armagh r21 subsequently operation magistrate 522 the towers were manned by rifle com panies as routine part of framework operations they provided seve ral benefits firstly they provided 24hour weather and largely bulletproof cover for surveillanc operations secondly they allowed the use of more sophisticated surveillance equi pment such as supernikon binoculars and mstar radar thirdly they suppo rted the development of an advanced communications network not least because thei r hilltop sites typically provided very good antenna locations fourthly they allowed for continuity of observation across wide areas sightings of terrorist suspects could be passed from tower to tower over wide areas the towers had mutually sup porting arcs minimising problems of dead ground sightings were also passed to helic opters operating in the area lastly the towers provided degree of ov erwatch for foot patrols named after private borucki of the parachute regiment killed by an ied in crossmaglen square on 8 august 1976 see figure 55 5 7 4523 there was tendency in periods of high th reat for the towers to concentrate on supporting foot patrols to the detriment of general surveillance and also for observers to become mentally fixed on obs erving given locations modest amount of work study conducted in 1995 demonstrat ed that it was easy to treble the effectiveness of the towers if the soldiers were clearly briefed and trained in their tasks of systematic visual scanning search ing incident reporting and logging 524 the towers were also unpopular with th local population the republican press repeatedly called them visibl sign of the occupation of ulster by the army and called for their removal this was at least in part because south armagh pira developed an information operation to have them removed or in schools during holidays and at weekends out at first li gauge local reaction with insertion covered by normal patrol activity once established in the op the three to summer 1972

when other intelligence sources had not been developed valuable information was gained from urban ops including bits of wanted terrorists movement of arms and ammunition location s and times of

search was in progress six gunmen appeared from house and started to move tactically towards where the search was in the op waited til suitable target was presented the opportunity occurred when one gunman began to cross the road at range of 300 metres sharpshooter fired one round hitting the gu nman who fell and was quick 5 8 childrens riot below arrive gunmen two sharpshooters were on top of

development of the mark 10 which was fi rst used in 1979 but not deployed in large numbers until 1985 526 there were three main kinds of ieds radio controlled ieds rcied command wire ieds cwied and vict im operated ieds voied boobytraps timedelay fused ieds were also used particularly early in the campaign bu t the lack of manin theloop control presented probl ems for the bombers in very simple terms rcieds could be defeated by ecm cwieds could be defeated by photographic reconnaissance planned searches rummage searches and other aspects of patrol tactics and voieds could be defeated by high level of awareness of the threat and good drills such as checking under cars before using them the effectiveness of all ieds was to some extent reduced by good drills particularly by avoiding bunching with the exception of very few incidents which are discussed in chapter 75 after 1980 very few ieds killed or wou nded more than one or two soldiers at time 527 gunmen were often described as snipers but very rarely did any terrorist display the skills of properly trained sn iper four broad patterns of attack by gunmen can be identified in the early 1970s gunmen would simply engage security forces with any number of weapons and blaze away for while this was largely ineffective up to 1972 terrorists wounded soldier on foot patrol in an aver age of one in s ix attacks for attacks on sangars the rate was one in 30 that is to say in about 390 shootings on sangars only 13 soldiers were hi t the tactic was rapidly countered by the army by superior numbers several ba ttalions reported conducting what were effectively company attacks in urban areas in the period from 1970 to 1972 terrorists rapidly learned that to stand and s hoot it out with the army did not work the army was better trained equipped organised and could produce greater numbers given time 528 the result was to switch by 1972 or so to relatively quick shoots by small firing party rarely more than three and often only one at short range and then make rapid getaway often with the weapon or weapons being removed covertly by someone else6 this tactic was effectively count ered by multiple pat rolling army teams not directly involved in the shooting would move rapi dly to attempt to cut off the gunmans withdrawal improving the chance of apprehending him pira obtained small number of m60 machine guns7 and used them in urban shoots as prestige weapon however their size meant that it was difficult to conceal their 5 chapter 7 715 6 often woman since male soldiers were not allowed to search women 7 initially seven weapons stolen from us national guard arsenal t hey were all recovered by 1982 but more were obtained subsequently 5 9 removal from the firing point and hence they were of limited effectiveness overall eight members of the security fo rces were killed by m60s 529 the third pattern was longrange mu ltipleweapon shoots in rural areas this developed in the late 1980s it often in cluded machine guns and was sometimes conducted from across the border between 1 january 1987 and 19 december 1991 there were 34 such incidents only four were at less than 200m over half were at more than 500m and five we re at over 1500m range all employed automatic fire they were very ineffective however on 16 march 1990 barrett 50 heavy calibre rifle was used on patrol on the outskirts of crossmaglen only one shot was fired and one soldier was hit the range was 850m subsequent events suggest that this was an extremely lucky shot few of the subsequent attacks hit at over 200m8 ingle shot attacks in south armagh often described in what came to be known as the south as check points the attacks affected to covert operations least two helicopters burden on the usage of helicopter hours an overt army

posts targeted security forces on their lik ely movement routes near bases and vehicle many of the shots were from the back of specially converted car which was immediately driven away to avoid leaving any forensic traces republican information operations such as t he sniper at work signs see figure 54 combined with media hype helped build the myth of the sniper security force operations and

there is concrete evidence of sniping reducing the effectiveness of army operations in south armagh there is considerable evidence of units reviewing their tactics and drills and ensuring that they were properly conducted the co of the unit involved in the first attack has said that if the patrol d deployed properly it would have been very difficult for the gunman to engage c hange to aviation tactics in 19919 severely inhibited the ability of the terrorist to get away the combination of good tactics planned covert operations and aviation seems to have defeated the south armagh gunmen 531

hundred yards and were oneshot or single salvo weapons relatively simple counters were found to be effective they included surveyi ng possible firing points keeping them under surveillance from cctv and sangars and patro lling them irregularly mortar alarms and attack drills and hardening security force bases the latter was hugely expensive and done in only few locations such as crossmaglen and forkill 532 the provision of explosives for the terro rist was major issue search of all quarries in northern ireland was undertaken by the security forces on 16 may 1971 the use of explosives for quarrying wa s strictly controlled by the ruc and effectively dried up the source of commer cial explosive to t he terrorists the response was the use of hme mostly bas ed on ammonium nitratebased fertiliser with nicknames such as anf and annie dependi ng on their particular ingredients because hme is much less effective than co mmercial or military explosives it was used in much larger quantities this led to the use of cars to deliver the bomb hence the proliferation of t he car bomb in the ear ly 1970s it also led to massive culvert bombs using milk churns or sim ilar containers to store and transport the explosive another response was the use of very small incendiaries typically in music cassettes for attacks on commercial property etc these were sometimes strapped to plastic petrol containers for enhanced incendiary effect suicide bombs were not used vehicleborne bombs were sometimes delivered by drivers under duress eg where the terrorists held family member hostage this tactic caused considerable public outrage particularly when the driver was kill ed by the bomb and was discontinued figure 56 bomb ttack loughgall police st ation 8 may 1987 5 12 533 explosive

of hme was stopped at vcp figure 57 ato at work 5 13 535 such then was the broad extent of framewor k operations the term framework operations developed during t he 1980s to describe overt activities which were already being conducted and exp licitly to link them to co vert activities analogies such as that of the beater s and the guns were used t he doctrine of reassurance deterrence and attrition was adapted to explain that by and large framework operations reassured and deterr ed whilst covert operations caused attrition this was simplistic many covert operations served to deter and reassure whilst most attrition was in the form of overt arrest operations 536 this lack of clarity in the concept of oper ations can be identified in retrospect through the framework of doctrine and particularly the philosoph of mission command this will be considered later11 however it should be noted that there was lack of longrunning planned systematic and clear thread of purpose for much of the campaign that thread of purpose should have explicitly lin ked tactical activities to the overall concept of operations at the campaign level its absence seems to have resulted in much seemingly purposeless ac tivity several former senior commanders have pointed out that much patrolling was apparently done fo r the sake of it and to dominate the ground reassu rance and deterrence did hav value but the way in which patrol programmes achieved reassurance and deterrence was often unfocussed and inefficient an element of that inefficiency was at times due to ruc attitudes to patrolling12 however it is difficult to measure the deterrent effect of patrolling and the consequences of not doing so 537 the army deployed in 1969 because of huge public order probl em with which the ruc could not cope initially p ublic order was the major tactic activity by the late 1980s the ruc had taken over responsibility for most public order activities with the army in support this was greatly helped by t he fact that the scal of disorder very rarely reached that of the early years 538 it is true that the box formation used in colonial policing was initially used in northern ireland in 1969 and that the banners used to order the rioters to disperse were written in arabic this appears to have happened in both londonderry and belfast to at least two different units though amusing it is more useful to observe what happened thereafter the box had work ed where the major tactic was to shoot the ringleaders this was not consider ed appropriate in northern ireland and therefore arrest or snat ch squads were used t he box was found to be unmanoeuvrable and made it difficult for snatch squads to exit and reenter quickly in addition the box presented very easy target for gunmen the army rapidly adapted to combination of manned shield walls and snatch squads the gunman threat was countered by placing marksm on roofs and in u pper storeys for planned operations teams of marksmen were infiltrated behind the main body of the rioters the marksmen w ould make their presence known once the riot had fully developed making it very difficult for any gunmen to make getaway this tactic was generally successful but on at leas t one occasion the extraction of the army marksmen proved to be challenging 539 republicans and loyalists rapidly developed techniques of their own including the ability to call out large number s of rioters at short notice for example in response 11 chapter 8 paras 831840 12 chapter 4 407 5 14 to an occupied house search rioters soon realised that soldie rs with batons were outranged by bricks and petrol bombs th ey were quite prepared to use hockey sticks cudgels and baseball bats in return the security forces responded with cs gas and water cannon cs gas became unpopu lar because it drifted into and hung around in nearby homes wate r cannon had limited effect initially once rioter is wet he is wet and can choose to carry on rioting 540 the next response was baton rounds the first were made of wood but splintered and were therefore unsuitable the next were rubber but these were relatively ineffective because the range at which they would knock man off his feet was less than the range of brick or petrol bomb the first generat ion of polypropylene baton rounds was not much better the later generation of more powerful polypropylene baton rounds were certainly effective but ran an increased risk of serious injury to the rioters this resulted in court cases including referral to the european court of justice the need to have nonlethal wea pons in the armys armoury was clear before the northern ireland ca mpaign the lesson was that process of research and development for such weapons is requi red in order that effectiveness can be maintained largescale rioting was ev entually countered by combination of measures skilful siting of shield walls c ontaining the riot on the rioters home ground where they were less likely to cause dam age to property threatening the rear of the rioting body with m obile patrols allowing routes fo r the rioters to disperse and limited use of cs and baton rounds to keep t he rioters at an appropriate distance 541 for time petrol bombers were consider ed to be threat to life and therefore legitimate target for opening fire under the yellow card the counters to petrol bombers were combination of baton r ounds to keep the petrol bomber at distance and the deployment of fire extinguishers behind shield walls 542 tactical operations in northern ireland developed into complex mixture of overt and covert active and passive techni cal and human measures some of the technical aspects are considered further late r the way in which this overall process was developed is one of the major lessons of operation banner and is discussed in chapter 813 chapter 8 paras 822827 5 15 13chapter 6 operations in the maritime air and electromagnetic environments maritime operations 601 coastal minesweepers and later mine countermeasures vessels mcmv were employed from october 1969 in maritime security operations role to counter seaborne smuggling of arms or personnel at first the maritime patrols were periodic but their obvious utility and succ ess led initially to units being held for tasking at 48 hours notice following the imposition of direct rule in 1972 permanent coastal patrol1 was established supported by naval sea king helicopters based at prestwick in scotla nd operations were conduc ted within the threemile territorial limit although the provisions of hot pursuit permitted boarding confirmed or suspected offenders in international wate rs this effectively extended the area of operations thus reducing opportunities to evade arrest once permanent footprint had been established the maritime securi ty task grew in stature and led to the formation of the northern ireland squadron in the mid1980s initially operating three birdclass vessels the squadron wa s supplemented in 1986 and eventually replaced by huntclass mcmvs to provi full time presence operational effectiveness was enhanced by vessels oper ated by the royal naval reserve and the addition of royal marine rm small boat teams operating from parent vessels rn sea king helicopters flying out of prestwick were augmented by wessex v detachment in 1977 and subsequently lynx fl ights for direct tasking by naval authorities these were employed to provide information on activity beyond the limits of territorial waters and to gather low grade shipping in telligence in the form of routes and concentrations in support of mariti security patrols similarly from 1975 submarine support was employed ccasionally for covert surveillance operations largely based on intelligence cueing 602 in 1972 the landing platform docks lpd hms fearless and hms intrepid were allocated to support operat ions motorman and glasscutter2 whilst exercising off scotland with elements of 3 commando brigade rm and 848 nava l air squadron embarked hm s fearless lifted 4000 troops and 200 armoured vehicles including roya l engineer avres to northern ireland the planning for and execution of this complex task was achiev ed within 56 hours hms intrepid was rapidly brought up to operational readi ness and moved personnel and equipment from portland to belfast in addition to landing troops and armoured vehicles through the port of belfast the lpds nd their landing craft conducted riverine operations in poor weather to land and recover avres at an inland security force base with marked ingenuity mino r war vessel was employed as communications relay platform in support of the maritime offload when satellite communications were not available although the royal navys amphibious capability was instrumental to the success of operat ion motorman the most notable aspect was the navys ability to deliver sizeable land force 603 the royal navy provided variety of other support th roughout the northern ireland campaign this included co untering water borne surfacetoair missile threat on 1 operation grenada in addition to the grenada task operation interknit was mounted specifically to cover carlingford lough on the border between northern ireland and eire 2 chapter 2 paras 226227 6 1 lough neagh3 training and education of army per sonnel in the conduct of riverine water borne and small boat

of hours flown the contributi on of air and aviation assets to operation banner was firstly army air corps aac helicopters secondly raf support helicopters sh thirdl aac beavers and islander s conducting airborne reconnaissance and lastly rn support helicopters however this simple numerical assessment conceals the reality of what became truly integr ated airland campaign in which all elements played critical part 605 aac helicopters originally scout and siou x later gazelle and lynx were primarily used for airborne reconnaissance surveillance and limited troop lift they were fitted with variety of observation and surveillance devices at various times this included realtime tv from quite early in the campai gn and eventually realt ime colour video manned airborne surveillance made consi derable contribution to the overall intelligence effort with aircra ft taskings originating from wide variety of units and the product going to similarly wide list of users 3 operation lawful 6 2 figure 62 vcp operation over fermanagh 2003 606 the deployment of the lynx in 1979 enabled much easier mo vement of small tactical units the deployment and movement of vcp parties by helicopter had been conducted from the early stages of the campaign howeve r the early generation of aac helicopters were too small and raf support helicopter s were rarely available sufficiently often to make this significant tactic by the early 1990s lynxes were armed with doormounted gpmgs pair c ould fly patrol large enough and for long enough to conduct snap vcps over wide area these flights known as eagle patrols developed into significant part of framework operations particularly in south armagh helicopters transiting through bessbrook mill4 or forwardbased there were included in the intelligence pi cture together with sh and given that overt road movement was forb idden in south armagh for m any years army aviation contributed to genuinely airmobile conc ept of operations in south armagh and several other places 607 however rn and particularly raf sh were needed to meet the sheer scale of troop lift required raf wessexs then pumas and small but impo rtant number of chinooks gave the security forces considerable advantage through operational mobility raf helicopters belonged primar ily to 72 squadron wessex and 230 squadron puma 230 squadron arrived in northern ireland in 1992 whilst 72 squadron served there in part or whole between 1969 and its disbandment in 2001 in t he early 1980s 72 squadron was the largest in the the hq of the armagh roulement battalion 6 3 4raf with 24 aircraft in addition to rout ine insertion and extraction of patrols sh conducted considerable am ount of logistic movement into and out of remote sites roulement units deployed to forward locations from raf aldergrove or occasionally direct from the mainland by chinook after the ballygawley bomb of 20 august 1988 which was target ed at bus full of servic emen going on leave the routine movement of some families was co nducted by sh supp ort helicopters also flew many hours of manned airborne surveillance missions for several years northern ireland was allocated more than half the total of l uk sh flying hours rn wessexs and later sea kings also flew support missions but generally with fewer aircraft perhaps four compar ed with 12 to 16 raf aircraft at one time sea kings were the only aircraft equipped and trained for night operations out of reconnoitred sites they could be used to deploy and recover patrols at night much more flexibly than other aircraft types and t herefore often came on task late in the afternoon or early evening figure 63 raf wessex mk 3 workhorse of the campaign 608 airmobility also enabled significant ta ctical development t hat of operations boxes these were relatively large ar eas of ground perhaps 20m by 10km which were saturated with foot patrols typically delivered by helicopter such operations often involved several rifle companies si multaneously patrols would conduct an extensive pattern of snap vcps rummage s earches and framework patrolling the direct effect of such operations was oft quite limited however they frequently prompted terrorist activity either in or ar ound the fringes of the box which would be detected by other agencies they could be used to disrupt terrorist operation cover the deployment of cop patrols or several other options overall the effect of air foot and vehicle patrols creates tact ical synergy which is hard to counter 6 4 609 beaver and islander aircraft were used primarily for airborne reconnaissance they were closely integrated with the rec onnaissance and intelligence centre ric5 at raf aldergrove it became entirely routine for plan ned search operation to be supported by uptodat aerial imagery 610 although number of helicopters were forced down by gunfire or occasionally mortar fire6 it appears that aircraft was ever shot down with the loss of all or most of those on board thus the security forces retained control of the air throughout the campaign that was due in large part to continued pr ocess of upgrading aircraft and reviewing flying tactics in response to changes in the threat after shooting incident in 1983 helicopt ers changed to flying either below 50 feet or above 500 feet notwithstanding the possible threat of sa7 ir jammers were introduced to lynx and puma from 1985 an sa7 was used on 19 july 1991 but missed its target flying in pairs also contributed to defeating the threat any loss of control of the air would have seriously impeded t he conduct of security force operations on the ground the effort expended in defending it was well spent figure 64 gazelle over harland and wolff shipyard belfast 611 deployment patterns changed throughout t he campaign aac s quadrons initially undertook roulement tours but this was sl owly changed to an allresident force 5 g for geographic was added late in the cam paign hence rigc to describe the integration of cartographic and survey elements 6 for example landing or taking off from security force base 6 5 although this reduced disrupt ion to the army elsewhere it concentrated operational experience almost exclusively in resident squadrons and required an increase in the number of aircrew deployed raf and rn aircrew deployed individually for short deployments typically of six weeks for the raf this allowed them to maintain currency and training standards whilst on the mainland and to concentrate on operational flying whilst deployed however it limited their local knowledge and their integration with support ed army units 612 such differences were perhaps inevit able given different service practices and backgrounds they were not helped by occasional riva lry and turf wars the formation of the joint helicopter command and the joint helicopter force northern ireland contributed to overcoming such diffe rences and required those involved to focus on the delivery of airborne capability 613 further change in deploy ment patterns was that fr om forward basing which optimised the speed of reaction of aircraft deployed to centralisation at raf aldergrove at any stage neither case was entirely correct there were always some aircraft at aldergrove and some forward parti cularly at bessbrook mill which in the late 1980s was reputed to be one of the busiest heliports in the world centralisation allowed for better use of as sets but was probably only possible once longerrange longerduration aircraft and number of forward refuelling sites became available forward refuelling with rotors running was introduced by the raf in 1972 by 1990 aircraft were rarely more than 15 minutes away from fuel and only five minutes in south armagh this m ade major difference to availability on task overall centralised control rather than centralised basing was the key to greater effectiveness 614 control of the air grant ed freedom of movement and wit h it the ability to conduct logistic movement and resupply howeve r such operations consumed scarce flying hours it became an example of being fixed perationally and tactically through terrorist activity degree of g3 rigour and discipline was required to impose workable degree of logistic inconvenience so as to free up helicopter hours for operations the electromagnetic dimension 615 one of the first problems faced by units deploying to northern ireland was that their combat net radios cnr did not work in urban areas where almost all operations took place initially this was major pr oblem but not new one for the army cnr initially of t he larkspur and then cl ansman series is t optimised for urban areas and the laws of physics impose st rict limits on the capabilities of communications equipment nu mber of specialtotheatre measures were taken pye westminster and storno radios and pocket phones working through talk throughs were introduced these comme rcial offtheshelf systems were the everyday means of communications and none of them were truly satisfactory other than their technical limitations there were recurrent problems with scalings maintenance spares and training as well as interoperability with other users such as the ruc 6 6 616 it was rapidly realised that some form of fixed communication s infrastructure was required the provision of that infrastructure its maintenance and evolution was major operation over many years in involv ed some interesting and novel challenges issues included the vetting of civilian aeria l riggers where used the security of riggers working on exposed sites in danger ous areas and the balance between operational considerations and practica l health and safety measures the infrastructure became highly complex and s ophisticated frequently employing what was at the time state of the art technology by 2000 or so northern ireland could be said to be britains first fully networked theatre of operations at more basic level it was the deployment of cougarnet across northern ireland from the mid1980s that first gave most units robus t reliable deployable and cure means of tactical communications 617 however the fight to communicate wa s but one aspect of the electromagnetic struggle terrorist organisati ons were also involved in w hat was genuinely electronic warfare from early in the campaign for example yalists were found to be jamming the bbc from uda club in belfas t in the early 1970s royal signals electronic warfare team loca ted the jammers using elec tronic support measures esm equipment the club was raided th individuals arrested and the equipment seized 618 rcieds presented another c hallenge early pira ieds used commercially available model aircraft components simple counters could be devised but manufacturing fielding and using the equipment by all t he troops at risk was major operationa l challenge the situation rapidly evolve d into continuous struggle between development and counter the security fo rces developed policies to manage this process initially the response was largel technical based on the four strands of detection inhibition initiation and surveillance this was developed into more sophisticated process which linked tactical and technical measures tailored to the threat and is discussed further in chapter 87 it is also linked to the wider subject of scientific support to operations discussed in chapter 78 619 patrollevel electronic counter measur ecm equipment was introduced almost as soon as the rcied threat was understood since th it has been rapidly and continuously developed to keep pace with t he threat general principles were also been developed to guide that proc ess when new threat was identified the first response was generally the deployment of detectors as technical counters were found equipment switched towa rds the use of inhibitors another issue was that wherever possible equipments should be integrated into single item this was important both for manpack and vehicle configurations it was generally found that equipment should be designed for the man pack role and then adapted for vehicle use not the reverse 620 on one occasion soldier lost piece of patrol equipment which fell into the hands of pira which analysed it and developed counter which then killed at least one soldier that is one reason why the loss of equipment was and remains in this type of campaign serious issue however the problem was hugely compounded 7 chapter 8 paras 822827 8 chapter 7 paras 707711 6 7 because the unit involved did not report the loss of equipment until the end of its tour that gave pira head start which was more than long enough 621 search and eod ecm equipment went through parallel processes of development and two management issues were observed t he first is that an artificial division between ecm for eod and that for other purposes is not helpful in t he long run the second is to highlight the inescapable need for organisations and processes to coordinate the use of the elec tromagnetic spectrum this is required not just across the security forces but also with the wide vari ety of civilian users from fire brigades to air traffic controllers doctors on call hospitals and medical users all of whom have legitimate call on portions of the spectrum 6 8 chapter 7 wider aspects of the campaign organisation and deployment 701 the organisation and deployment of regul ar army units can be considered under three broad headings strength arms plot and roulement tour length and interval and choice of units in august 1969 there we re three resident inf antry battalions in northern ireland and one armoured reconnaiss ance regiment reinforcement was initially by large numbers of units on short t ours of four months or less neither the resident nor the first reinforcement battali ons had received any internal security training troop strengths are summarised in figure 1 30000 25000 20000 15000 10000 5000 0 1969 1974 1979 1984 1989 1994 1999 2003 year l regular army udr r irish hsf tota figure 71 graph of total troop strength of the regular army in northern ireland note the total does not show shortterm deployments such as the commitment of the spearhead battalion for operations glasscu tter and motorman the shortterm total for 1972 exceeded 28000 702 the army had an establishment of about 155 000 for most of the period until the end of the cold war operat ion banner was major strain on its resources there was continuous pressure to reduce troop str ength with the result that numbers in theatre were as low as was considered fe asible and most units were worked very hard tours for resident units were init ially 18 months and for roulement units four months greater continuity was necessary so tours were extended to 24 months for resident units and four and half months for roulement uni ts the latter allowed for handover of week at each end of the tour whilst only using three units per aor per year the pressure and pace of operational duty was such that roulement tours were only extended to six months in the early 1990s resident infantry battalions 7 1 could only deploy two or at most three co mpanies for operations not least because of the need to guard their own barracks and married quarters whereas roulement units deployed four however resident battalions developed depth of skill and local area knowledge that r oulement units could not match and provided much needed continuity there was therefore gradual move towards more resident infantry battalions peaking at six in th mid1980s in addition one resident battalion on the arms plot for two years to ok the place of six roulement units the effect of that on the interval between oper ational tours the t our interval was considerable figure 72 coy 1 glosters deploys into londonderry 1970 703 the tour interval is the result of the operational need for units the tour length and the number of units available more units needed and very short tours from given number of units resulted in very short tour intervals one unit complained of being bored on its fifth short tour in 1972 the gener effect was to make it very difficult to train for general war roles since most of operation banner t ook place during the cold war royal armoured corps royal artillery or royal engineer unit deploying in the infantry role for four months fr om baor was considered unavailable for its primary role for roughly year once pretour training deployment recovery leave and retraining were considered the net re sult of multiple short tours at short intervals was that units we re only able to regain their expertise due to the residual knowledge of the sncos for example if an artillery battery commander did two deployments to northern ireland during his tour of command he might never get to fire his guns let alone exerci his battery in major fo rmation training exercise 7 2 almost all largescale colle ctive training ceased in baor for time during the early 1970s 704 at one stage the average tour interval for ukbased infantry battalions was 13 months however the average is always misleading as late as 198992 one infantry battalion did four short tours in th ree years whereas during the early 1980s one baorbased mechanised battalion did not depl oy for 41 months from early on the army tried to achieve an average tour interval of 24 months this figure was based on empirical observations in the 1970s but then achieved mythical status there was research that demonstrated its effect on for example soldier retention it does seem to have been reasonable target but was seldom achieved as operation banner ran dow n in the 1990s other commitments such as bosnia increased 705 the other way of increasing the tour inte rval was to increase the number of units noninfantry units were used from very early on they made major contribution to the campaign but suffered accordingly both the first and the most recent soldiers to be killed on active duty on operation bann er were gunners the depth of skill of noninfantry units in the infantry role was never as deep as that of regular infantry units and senior commanders were well aware of degree of risk in using them gurkha units were never deployed to norther n ireland royal marine commandos were deployed for numerous short tour s and at one stage an raf regiment wing deployed to run battalion aor irishrecruited regiments1 were not deployed for many years the eventual decision to deploy them wa s taken on casebycase basis one regiment stated th at it did not wish to serve in northern ireland at the same time that another was volunteering officers from the gurkhas and irish recruited regiments served with other units throughout the campaign 706 although roulement g enerally worked well it did result in lack of continuity at unit level which was never entirely resolved few officers and noncommissioned officers did serve for longer tours in continui ty roles often in intelligence sections individuals became known as concos wi th hindsight greater use could have been made of intheatre elements to provide continuity for example resident or udr battalions might have provided small num bers of operations intelligence and logistic personnel to support the handover of units scientific support 707 scientific adviser sciad was attached to hq northern ireland in 1969 there has been dedicated sc iad and staff in theat re continuously since then as civil servants they have served on long tours som etimes for several years and provided useful contribution to contin uity in their ability to derstand developments to the threat and how to respond they have deve loped significant body of corporate knowledge not least of initia tives that have been tried and failed in the past coupled with the objectivity to know why they faile d and why they might or might not succeed in the future 1 before 1992 the 5th royal inniskilling dragoon guar ds the queens royal irish hussars the irish guards and the royal irish rangers 7 3 708 sciad was initially largely concerned with operational analysis oa and provided some very useful insights considering issues such as the development of tactics the best way to schedule tactical rese rves and the optimum balance between pvcps and snap vcps sciads advice in 1977 was that th optimum balance was pvcps at all largely on the grounds that as far as was known pvcp had ever detained known terrorist suspects or captured any terrorist arms or equipment terrorists simply avoided them converse ly snap vcps had det errent value as well as contributing to attrition in addition permanent vcps became targets themselves the suggestion t hat there should be pvcps was initially rejected by military staff on several grounds some that can be seen to have flawed logic the reasonable point that pvcps provide reassu rance to elements of the population although there are other ways of providing reassurance and apparently wilful misinterpretation of sciads advice it is also interesting to note that the officer responsible for taking that decision re turned to northern ireland later and the consequences of the decision were visi ted on him when pvcp in his aor was attacked pvcps had still not resulted in any arrests or find s the result of sciads studies was often counterintuitive to the military it requires perception and imagination on the part of military staff to see that the counterintuitive option may well be the best 709 the development of the ied as major threat drew scia ds attention almost entirely away from oa and into electronics inve stigation of developments in the threat designing counters building prototypes s upporting the production of field equipment and advising on its deployment became major activities these activities were closely linked to those of other sta ff branches such as intelligence and communications in some areas sciad an d his staff could pr edict probable future developments by pira technicians which enabled the initiative to be taken in the technical struggle2 710 research and development wa s required in many different scientific disciplines for example after the bomb attack on the pv cp at buncranna road in october 1990 human factors experts made considerable improvements to the ergonomics of ops and pvcps they advised on issues such as the number size and location of video screens location of alarm buttons and so on improved workspace layout and therefore better overall effectiveness wa s significant contribution to force protection 711 sciad had production capability and limit ed resources of his own however he was closely linked to mainland research and development organisations and to operational requirement s ubsequently equipment capability staffs the scale of support available on the mainland wa s considerable and was coopted when needed at one stage the campaign against the rcied was coordinated at twostar level and the number of establ ishments and scientists dire ctly involved both grew more than sevenfold significant fundi ng was directed to many aspects of equipment for northern ireland and reaction times were gener ally far faster than that for general service equipment duri ng the 1990s hq northern ireland became toplevel budget holder which required it to undertake oa in support of investment appraisals for new equipment sciad moved back into oa to some extent 2 chapter 8 paras 822827 7 4 towards the end of the operation sciad d evolved broadbased scientific and analytic capability it is highly significant that scia d worked in hq northern ireland and reported directly to the goc force protection 712 some of the earliest images from oper ation banner show soldiers wearing flak jackets and deploying from humber pigs force protection grew from there into concerted programme across many indivi dual disciplines flak jackets were replaced by the effective but unpopular improved northern ireland body armour iniba with ceramic chest and back plates developm ents elsewhere led to the general service combat body armour being adapted to carry the iniba plates this was more comfortable hence more likely to be worn and more effective women found it far more comfortable 713 the arming of servicewomen was an issue that took time to resolve at first servicewomen were not to be armed under any circumstanc it was not until the policy to arm all women in the services was taken in the early 1990s that equivalent measures were taken in northern ireland 714 developments in ecm and armoured vehi cles have been described elsewhere force protection engineering developed considerably from the early days of sandbagged sangars through bu lletproof prefabricated san gars to mortarproof accommodation the design and constr uction of more mundane items such as sight screens was also developed and optimised3 evolutionary design and fabrication led to highly advanced structur such as those built for what was effectively an annual series of sieges at drumcree in the 1990s figure 73 construction of the roadblock at drumcree for the 2003 marching season sight screens are high walls designed primarily to gi ve cover from view in some locations they have to be very high to prevent the inside of security base being overlooked 7 5 3715 two bombs exploded at wa rrenpoint on 27 august 1979 sixty deaths or 37 of all army deaths due to terrorist action in nort hern ireland from that date onwards were the result of just nine bombs4 twentyone servicemen were killed in england by further three bombs5 thus almost half of all servicemen killed by republican terrorists since 1979 were killed by 12 bomb s although significant in themselves these statistics suggest the considerable importance of force protection issues6 they and the nine members of the security forces killed by the south armagh sniper7 reinforce the need for comprehensiv multidiscipli nary approach to counter terrorist operations8 this comprehensive approach produced virtuous cycle of effectiveness in northern ireland as advances in any one discipline created benefits elsewhere information operations 716 for several reasons information operatio ns were probably the most disappointing aspect of the campaign in the early st ages soldiers and junior officers given appropriate training did very good job of appearing on camera in the immediate aftermath of an incident the army cert ainly learned hard ssons regarding media handling in the early 1970s ho wever with that exception information operations were generally poorly conducted they were illcoordinated wit h other government bodies they were reactive and often miss ed significant opportunities the absence of government information line was often exploited by the terrorist sometimes with operational or strategic cons equences constant criticism in the republican media notably the an phoblacht newspaper was not seriously challenged by government nio or army information operations part of the reason for the ineffectiveness lay in the lack of single unitary aut hority for the campaign and t he lack of joint forum to agree information operations priorities messages and means of dissemination differing viewpoints on the need for positive information operations in stormont and the nio the police and hq northern ireland militated against effective information operations9 community relations 717 when the army arrived in 1969 civilmilit ary operations were rapidly seen as way of maintaining the confidence of all secti ons of the community but particularly the catholics units ap pointed community relations cr officers who established links with local opinionformers in catholic areas these were ften priests however due to the very high turnover of roulement units with up to eight in belfast alone none of which stayed for more than four mont hs initially lack of continuity and consistency was inevitable number of valuable cr proj ects were put in place 4 18 killed at warrenpoint four killed at glenadush on 16 december 1979 11 soldiers and six civilians at the droppin well inn near ballykelly on 7 december 1982 six killed at lisburn on 15 ju ne 1988 eight killed at ballygawley on 20 august 1988 five killed at camlough on 19 may 1981 three killed at mayobridge on 18 november 1989 and five killed at the buncranna road pvcp on 24 october 1990 5 the hyde park and regents park bombs of 20 july 1982 and the bombing of the rm barracks at deal on 22 september 1989 6 it cannot be entirely coincidental that all but two of those ten events took place in the second half of the year the others took place in may and june the 5th and 6th months 7 chapter 5 paras 529530 and box 8 chapter 8 paras 822827 9 chapter 8 815 7 6 such as sponsoring youth clubs or running summer youth camp s in the early years the stormont authorities appear ed broadly indifferent to th plight of the catholics and thus calls for longterm assistance wit h facilities such as community centres tended to go unheeded 718 the imposition of direct rule and the fo rmation of the nio changed that the nio established network of local government representatives known as civilian representatives civrep usually northern irish

army units they were anxious not to be seen as government spies and needed to exercise discretion not least to retain the trust of the communi ty one reason why they were popular was that t hey were conduit for civili an compensation claims personnel and l ogistic issues 719 personnel and logistic issues can be review ed under fairly broad headings many personnel issues should be seen in the co ntext of an army gradually modernising itself under the social pressures of the late 20th century in 1969 pay and allowances had only just been modernised under the comparability process issues such as operational servic pay extra leave warrants welfare and recreation facilities were all relatively new innovati ons in the 1970s northern ireland was the first theatre for which operational service pay was authorised domestic legislation is different in northern ireland in some cases from that on the mainland and therefore the administration of families of resident units had to be conducted on slightly different basis 720 the treatment of injured soldiers develop ed significantly the in jured could be flown directly to the military wing of the royal victoria hosp ital belfast which rapid ly developed worldwide reputation for the tr eatment of bomb and bullet injuries battlefield first aid also developed rapidl with the creation of team medics on the scale of one per fire team trained only to give immediate lifesaving first aid they kept the injured alive until the regimental medical office r rmo arrived the rmo stabilised the casualty for evacuation to hospita l typically by helicopter the golden hour was met in the great majority of case s and the survival rate of the seriously injured was very high this gave units considerable confidence in very broad terms roughly one soldier was discharged fr om the army due to injury for each soldier killed by terrorist action 721 the key issue of logistics was that of developing permanent operational infrastructure in country where englis h is the spoken lan guage but where most activity outside security bases had to be covert this had several consequences the general lesson for the future is the need to think through the implications of the environment rigorously and act on the deducti ons examples include the need for covert recovery of brokendown vehicles nd the need to procure license service and rotate fleets of covert vehicles such vehicles were needed for many different purposes vans to deploy patrols trucks to deliver food rubbish trucks school coaches and so on movement control into out of and within theatre all had to be done covertly that required special arr angements with ferry operators airlines and so on the british forces post office was used throughout the operation for private 7 7 mail in order to conceal domestic addre sses on at least one occasion royal engineers unit adopted ci vilian equipment clothing wo rking practices and even site signs in order to build something without drawing attention to its activities 722 however there were also occasions wh infrastructure and logistics had to be conducted as overt military operations the construction and later refurbishment of the hardened accommodation at crossmaglen were both br igadelevel operations involving up to nine battalions operation tonnage major route clearances had to be undertaken the route pi cketed engineer plant and materials moved in by road the construction site protected and ever ything removed again on completion 723 all this required adaptation to loca l conditions specialtotheatre standing operating procedures sop we re required particularly to cater for roulement it was found that equipment s upport was best done by perm anent station workshops local manufacture was often required requiring both engineer and equipment support skills rarely practised elsewhere overall much of the combat service support to operation banner was not ma tter of the normal considerations of demand distance and duration as much as adaptation to the local conditions of the theatre training 724 the first units arrived in northern ireland with specialtotheatre training as described 3rd battalion the light infantry arrived in just over 24 hours it had maps and none were available at the time it was not obvious that the campaign would go on for years and it was not until 19 72 that pretour training was formalised largely under nitat at hythe and lydd this quickly became nitat uklf when second team was established at sennelager in germany these teams trained units deploying to northern ireland fo r residential or roulement t ours northern ireland reinforcement training team nirtt was tablished in theatre to train individuals on trickle postings or those joining units midtour attendance at nitat or nirtt was mandatory for all individual s posted to northern ireland 725 there seem to have been four main reason s for nitats success first of all the operational need was obvious and that ac ted as huge incentive for hqs instructors and units undergoing tr aining to take it seriously secondly it was closely tied to one theatre and therefore had si ngle focus although it delivered standardised training it was able to optimise that traini ng for specific unit aors thirdly the staff was of high qua lity and had firsthand knowledge and real credibility the great majority of instruct ors colour sergeants to captains had just completed an operational tour in theatre themselves the training team leaders captains had the personalit knowledge and credibility to be able to debrief ocs and cos and to comment on t he suitability of subordinate commanders to cos that must be rare in almost any army perhaps most importantly oc nitat in the rank of major for much of operation banner and his instructors visited northern ireland frequently and ensured that they were fully up to date with developments in theatre 726 nitat and nirtt ensured t hat all troops deploying to t heatre were properly trained and briefed as to what to expect in norther n ireland the professional standards set 7 8 and achieved in few weeks of training were high pretour training saved lives and was war winner 727 whatever the formal command and budgetary relationships the nitats were in practice owned by hq northern ireland critically that hq controlled nitats syllabus particularly the tactics tech niques and procedures and other aspects of doctrine nitat and its successor th operational training advisory group optag was major success it produced welltrained confident and highly motivated units fit for deployme nt one former senior office r pointed out that in his experience the character of units in theatre varied considerably but he rarely found bad one nitat helped develop and standardise tactics across northern ireland it was major contributor to the speed at which tactical and eq uipment developments were brought into practice 7 9 chapter 8 major findings overview and conclusions 801 this chapter presents the major findings of the study an overview of operation banner and the main conclusions the early stages 802 there was insurgency in august 1969 the ira was not credible force and took significant part in the ev ents of that month for several reasons the ira was allowed to develop into an effective insurg ent organisation over the next two years this suggests that the early stages of an apparent breakdown in social order however it is described are absolutely critical to the subsequent nature of campaign all subsequent decisions and ac tions by all parties are conditioned by these early events furthermore violence in the early stages creates bitterness hatred and extreme views which can last for generations looking at the events of the troubles in retrospect it is apparent t hat many of them c ould have been avoided or reduced in impact if effective measur had been taken early on and that similar patterns can be seen in many situations elsewhere figure 81 public order operations in the falls road 1970 803 thus there is an important requirement to identify situations which are likely to lead to social unrest insurgency or civil war in northern ireland this should not have been difficult junior officers present in rthern ireland in 1969 were well aware of 8 1 the discrimination and depriv ation and asked themselves at the time why the government did not do anything about it 804 however the critical issue is the nece ssity of engaging all relevant agencies in early substantive visible action for reform in order to prevent insu rgency or civil war breaking out or potential insurgents exploiti ng the situation this is likely to be difficult lack of knowledge of the situatio n lack of perception vested interests and political impasse will all militate against the chance of such preventive action being taken for example in 1969 the britis h cabinet saw much of the problem of northern ireland as being stormonts responsi bility however given its composition stormont was most unlikely to take subs tantive action indee d it would probably have seen that as being contrary to its ow n interests stormont was part of the problem and could have been so recognised at the time 805 when engaged in such situat ions british commanders have been fully aware of the need for substantive multiagency action unfortunately military commanders are often the only people in aut hority with the understanding of the broad situation and the technical knowledge to appreciate the risks and wider implications but they are not the people who must take the key acti ons required to recover what might be bad and deteriorating situation the armed fo rces initial mandate is likely to be to prevent greater breakdown of order they will typically have very limited resources to deal with the wider issues of so cial political and economic unrest however the circumstances will often suggest that those senior comma nders deployed on the ground have the duty and the obligation to attract at the earliest opportunity the attention of government ministers or po litical administrato rs to the range of problems and to recommend nd enable nonmilitary as well as military action in order to address the underly ing causes of the unrest one else in authority in situation of public disorder can be guarant eed to have better view the political context will dictate what t he military can achieve and what limitations are imposed but the requirement for strategic and oper ational commanders to guide and inform political decisionmaking is clear 806 there will be in tandem requirement to monitor dev elopments across number of areas political social economic cultural an d possibly religious the ability to detect and analyse potential and emerging insu rgent groupings will be particularly important 807 the initial period after t he arrival of military force in peace support or peace enforcement operation has been described as the honeymoon period that suggests that there is period variously given as 100 days or three months in which to put things right the rm honeymoon period is misnomer it is not honeymoon it is the most import ant phase of the campaign addressing the causes of insurgency 808 the underlying causes of an insurgency will tend to be social or political economic religious or mixture of these in surgent bodies feed off disaffection and vice versa from whatever cause in the case of northern irel and the ira fed initially off discrimination and deprivation and then exploited the perception that the army and 8 2 ruc were partisan and anticatholic the truth was not necessarily important dissatisfaction is sentiment and feeds off perceptions 809 security forces do not win insurgency ca mpaigns militarily at best they can contain or suppress the level of violence and achiev successful endstate they can thus reduce situation to an acce ptable level of violence level at which normal social political and economic activities can take place without intimidation acceptable level of violen ce as term should be used carefully since violence should have place in developed society what is required is level which the population can live with and with which local po lice forces can cope security forces should bring the level of violence down to the point at which dissidents believe they will not win through pr imarily violent strategy and at which political process can proceed without significant in timidation if possible the situation should not be allowed to come to that stage 810 however unless the causes of unrest ar addressed insurgency or serious unrest will continue in northern ireland this did happen over period of years the northern ireland housing executive did clear the great majority of the victorian slums money was invested in to the economy to create jobs it took time and it could not have been done without substantial reduction in the levels of violence of the early 1970s but simplistically the ngterm solution was not to deploy three battalions into the divis flats but ra ther to bulldoze them and build decent respectable homes with proper amenities1 811 addressing the causes of the insurgency wi ll not generally be wit hin the remit of the armed forces they can achi eve limited but crit ical security task but that will not be the solution to the overall problem in addition they should avoid making the situation worse it could be argued that the army did make the situation worse by in practice alienating the catho lic community in 1970 and 197 1 in this regard it should be acknowledged that wh ile material improvements can be delivered in some cases it may be much more difficult to change emotions perceptions or deepseated grievances and beliefs single campaign authority 812 by 1980 almost all the milit ary structures which eventua lly defeated pira were in place it is revealing to examine why it then took another quarte r of century to end the campaign2 in retrospect some signs are visi ble there was single authority in overall charge of the direction of the campaign but rather three agencies often poorlycoordinated stormont followed by the nio the mo d and the ruc from military perspective for most of the campaign there was little coherence and synergy there was little evidence of stra tegic vision and longterm plan below the level of westminster wh ite papers there was clearlyarticulated strategy or view of the future and how to achieve it wh ich involved all the relevant agencies as result the wheel was often reinvented and progress was unnecessarily slow action against terrorists was not linked closely to addressing the causes of the problem 1 chapter 5 figure 51 2 the insurgent form of pira was defeated however it adapted and evolved into terrorist organisation see chapter 2 paras 227 and 231232 8 3 813 ministers and civil servants were so metimes reluctant to engage in the comprehensive fully coordinated crossgov ernment activity which the army would recognise as campaign plan that is good reason for the need to take very firm action to ensure that they are engaged in and convinced of the need to abide by the process this will not be easy 814 the events of the troubles provide evidence for the ut ility of the current set of campaign planning tools because they were not used however they indicate very strongly that they or something like them are required and should be applied across all lines of government activity t he resulting plan will probably be loose ly developed at first however there should as minimum be some mechanism of agreed endstates lines of operation interm ediate objectives and responsibility to coordinate3 815 particular efforts are likely to be needed to overcome the inher ent lack of synergy between government departments and agencie s in northern ireland this was never more the case than in the area of in formation operations many contributions to this analysis have described the informati on campaign in terms such as woeful pitiable and grossly inadequate in simple terms rarely would anybody in authority other than in the army take posit ive proactive stance the result was regular series of information failures in which pira and occasionally loyalist paramilitaries held and exploited their advantage as early as the mid1970s over 80 of the violence was perpet rated by pira but even that simple and categorical fact was never exploited since in surgency feeds off dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction is sentiment which feeds off perceptions shaping the perception of the population is critic ally important the absence of unified proactive information strategy for most of the campaign was major failing 816 it has been said that pira was engaged re gularly and generally successfully by the army at the tactical level in northern ireland but it wa s almost never engaged at the operational and strategic levels cam paign plan should integrate strategic operational and tactical activities through the superior commanders intent and its translation into coherent missions for subordinat at each level with hindsight one can detect throughout the campaign incidents where tactical activity lacked apparent purpose or where activities were not coor dinated and did not achieve synergy that is probably the clearest militar justification for single campaign authority and plan process by which the strategic intent is translated quickly and effectively into tactical activity is clearly required 817 many senior officers called for the ap pointment of some form of supremo for northern ireland right up until the mid1980s such appointment was made and the troubles drifted on for another 20 years there are arguments for and against such an appointment which are discussed later4 it was not important that the supremo should be military but rather there be single fi gure of authority 3 this issue is being addressed june 2006 through the generic strategic campaign plan work being led by mod in whitehall some positive progress has been made 4 chapter 8 paras 852853 8 4 intelligence 818 one distinguished comment ator has suggested that in peace support or counter insurgency operations information is the cu rrency not firepower the logic is simple once an adversary has been identified to allow his removal by arrest or attack the security forces normally have more than sufficient physical resources with which to strike the difficult part is t he information required particularly where the terrorist or insurgent hides himself in the dst of the population and in blizzard of irrelevant information the intelligenc aspects of operation banner were discussed in chapter 55 their importance is hard to understate the insurgency could not have been broken and the terrorist structure could not have been engaged and finally driven into polit ics without the intelligence organisations and processes that were developed the logic of local conditions 819 counter insurgency and peace support campaigns tend to be subject to local factors which do not necessarily accord with overt gic for example during the troubles there were almost attacks on the ta in northern ireland nor on the families of policemen or soldiers lawyers were seldom attacked by terrorists on either side the few bombs placed in service married quarters areas appear to have been placed to tie down troops rather than to kill or maim this seems paradoxical as they were clearly relatively easy targets6 the reasons probably lie in the lfimage of the ira as an army with its own sense of morality honour and just ice there were local ground rules in the troubles and they did not necessarily have obvious logic the same woul d apply in any other complex social situation the security forces need to learn what the local conditions are analyse why the local conditions are as they are and finally try to understand the implications figure 82 local conditions belfast 1969 820 it was often said that the british did not understand ireland in part this may have reflected ignorance and an willingness to try to understand for the many commanders who did attempt to understand the roots of the troubles any number of 5 chapter 5 paras 502505 and 537 6 as another example see chapter 4 foot note 3 concerning shotgun licences 8 5 perceptive books were available with hi ndsight what those books could not easily convey nor the british easily understand were the deepseated beliefs myths and feelings held by the local population in some cases the perceived and perhaps actual grievances were centuries old lectively taught histor or partisan use of events provided rallying cries and strong motivato rs such cultural issues tend to be unspoken and even subconscious they are i nherently difficult to comprehend in the absence of such deep unde rstanding the british tended to underestimate the differences between the irish and themselv one commentat or observed that englishmen especially tend to view the iris hman as variant of briton rather than as foreigner 821 without effective cultural understanding the security fo rces in any theatre cannot conduct truly effective information campai gn and arguably therefor an effective counter insurgency campaign additionally many militar activities may be flawed because the reaction of populat ion cannot be properly pr edicted there is need both to gain intelligence and to understand local perceptions7 this links to the idea that insurgency feeds off dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction is sentiment based on perception perception is framed by culture processes rather than lessons 822 there appear to be few concrete and directly exportable lessons from operation banner reflection suggests that where particular organisations or methods have been exported to other theatres their success lies in the extent to which they are adapted to local conditions apparent indi vidual lessons appear to reflect wider issues and it is those wider issues which this publication attempts to capture an example is the observation that the presence of armed he licopters deters terrorist attacks this was identified quite independently by the us armed forces in iraq in 2003 however it only applies where the security forces have control of the air the more general issue in that case is that of manoeuvrist approach to operations8 figure 83 trainin g aid principal trainin g area british mainland december 2003 7 humint sources can gauge local reactions but this is not the same as being confident of the populations likely response to an event 8 chapter 8 833 8 6 823 conflict is complex adve rsarial and evolutionary which suggests that in the longer term the advantage goes to the side whose military and nonmilitary processes adapt and evolve fastest two processes devel oped or employed in operation banner are noteworthy 824 the first is the very closely linked loop responsible for the dev elopment of counter terrorist response measures all of w hose components were effectively under command of the theatre hq hq northern ireland this evolved from the very earliest days of the campaign and was war winner that loop included all aspects of intelligence including technical intell igence forensics scientific research and development the development of organisations and minor unit tactics the conduct of operations procurement training constant review and feedback it was very much threatdriven although where possible commanders and staff sought to predict changes to the threat and ther eby gain the initiative tabletop wargaming was an important aspect this sought to step through all aspects of terr orist attack from reconnaissance rehearsal and event ual forensic clearance so as to understand its dynamics identify weaknesse s and suggest counters t he counter would then be wargamed and so on particip ants from wide range of disciplines should take part in any future wargames in order to devel op an understanding of all dimensions of the problem 825 one example is that of multiple patro lling its development as response to the gunman has been described9 it was also optimised to counter the ied patrol equipment was deployed to protect individuals against threats to given distance to protect fire teams against the threat to greater distances and the multiple as whole to yet greater distances spacings were opt imised to retain tactical control whilst reducing vulnerability to explosions fo r most of operatio n banner multiple patrolling proved to be an effective and relatively safe tactic it should be stressed however that the precise detai ls of multiple patrolling we re optimised for the balance of threats present in norther n ireland at the time the si tuation in other theatres would probably require modifications to those details 826 chance finds of ied components led to ot her rapid response deve lopments in the 1980s pira device was found and analysed by scientific experts within one week tactics had been adjusted to mitigate the ffectiveness of the device technical modification to patrol equipment was developed and fielded withi n month the particular device was effectively obsolet within three months such device functioned against patrol again after t he countermeasure was fielded 827 such speed of reacti on had an operationa l benefit it continuously undermined the terrorists apparent initiative eroding his will to pursue new devel opments the long term erosion of piras will to sustain the campaign was possibly significant in bringing pira to negotiate an end to the campaign it also boosted security force confidence and morale the close link ages between response measures and the fact that the key agencies were under co mmand of the operati onal level hq was mentioned above it would not have been possible for example had nitat not answered to hq northern ireland on issues of tactical doctrine or if sciad had not been an integral part of the same hq this overall lesson would seem to be 9 chapter 5 paras 508509 8 7 applicable to other theatres th key is not the scale or va riety of the threat nor the breadth of agencies needing coordination it is the organisation and the coordination processes which make them work together efficiently in the case of northern ireland success led to greater willingness to work together creating virtuous cycle of further successes 828 the second process that stands out as being key operational factor is that of the military appreciation subsequent ly called the estimate detailed review of great many operations indicates that it was rarely wrong in so far as very few decisions had consequences that were immediately negative at the operational or strategic levels in fact several decisions wh ich had negative consequences were taken contrary to military advice which wa s drawn from the systematic examination process inherent in the estimate the decision to reintroduce internment was one example and the decision to attempt to brea k the fuel tanker drivers element of the uwc strike was another in both of those two examples the decision was made for expressly political reasons 829 only two examples of poor military decisionmaking stand out as having serious operational and even strategic consequences which were unforeseen at the time the first was the decision to undertake t he balkan street search and to impose the subsequent falls curfew10 with hindsight it seems hasty and did not sufficiently consider the wider public relations and operational level consequences of the decision the second exam ple was the manner in which the arrest operation on bloody sunday was conducted using vehicles to approach the crowd the decision to do so was not hasty but with hindsight seems heavyhanded 830 in raising these criticisms it should be reiterated that those reviewing the events years afterwards cannot tr uly understand all the factors per taining at the time in addition any criticism should consider what ternatives were available if any it should also be pointed out t hat the armys current awar eness of the operational level and the integration of lines of operation were not deve loped until long after the two events in question developing the mano euvrist approach 831 the broad purpose of doc trine and campaign analysis is to improve or sustain military effectiveness at the conclusi on of every campaign or major operation professional army should review its doctrine in the light of lessons identified in 2006 the key elements of british army doct rine were the manoeuvrist approach and mission command 832 that doctrine was extended in to nonwarfighting op erations in the army field manua l volume 1 part 10 the army doctrine publication adp series of the 1990s11 broadly differentiated between war and perations other than war whilst the lowerlevel army field manual afm in its various parts either related to warlike operations12 or largely updated older doctrine13 the manoeuvrist approach and 10 chapter 2 paras 216217 11 particularly adp vol 1 operations army code 71565 and adp command vol 2 army code 71564 12 for example afm vol 1 part 1 formation tactics army code 71587 and afm vol 1 part 2 battlegroup tactics army code 71648 8 8 mission command were not fully extended into nonwarfightin g operations some of the tenets of the manoeuvrist approach were being applied in northern ireland before they entered doctrine for example the trust and decentralisation that was being practised within rifle companies14 aided the development of mission command secondly the terminology and some of the practices of the manoeuvrist approach were adopted within northern ireland as soon as they were published the framework of deep close and rear perations was applied to the concept of northern ireland framework operations in 1995 thirdly many manoeuvrist approach and mission command tenets apply directly to counter insurgency and counter terrorism 833 for example the manoeuvri st approach is an indirect approach which seeks to pit strength against weakness and win at least cost15 almost all counters to terrorist tactics have strong indirect element examples include rummage searching to counter cwieds moving to threaten the gunmans withdrawal on foot or by helicopter rather than trying to shoot it out and attacking terrorist finances rather than the terrorist himself16 834 winning or achieving successful tactical outcome at least cost is important in order to reduce ones own casualties and to aid mo rale it denies the terrorist the publicity which security force casualties bring and thereby denies him success it also releases troops to enable force to be concentrated elsewhere 835 the core functions within the manoeuvrist approach are to find fix strike and exploit17 the importance of intelligence in fi nding the terrorist or insurgent was described above he was typically fixed through framework operations which denied his freedom of operation or through operati onal security opsec measures so that he did not realise he was being ta rgeted striking by arrest or attack was relatively easy once he was found and fixed exploita tion in this context was often not done but should have been successful strikes agai nst terrorists or insurgents could have been followed up through information operat ions there were few occasions where local successes were followed up vigorously due to prior planning and intelligence gained from the initial activity18 836 the initiative is stressed in doctrine19 but it is commonly held that the terrorist always holds it that is to some extent true in that he normally chooses the time and place of attack however he can be deni ed it by framework operations to limit or remove his freedom of action the terrorist also lacks the initia tive in particular sense at the operational level in that he must continue to conduct attacks if he does not his credibility authority and public ity begin to diminish to deny the terrorist success through limiting his ability to inflic t casualties is significant operational level issue 13 for example vol 1 part 10 counter insurgency operations army code 71749 14 chapter 4 418 15 adp land operations army code 71819 chapter 2 paras 02060207 16 while not an army organisation the formation of the terrorist finance unit in the late 1980s was significant step in the broad approach to counter terrorism and this small unit gained significant successes in attacking the financial activities on which terrorist groups depended 17 adp land operations army code 71819 chapter 3 paras 03090323 18 for example see chapter 5 505 19 adp land operations army code 71819 chapter 2 0228 8 9 837 much of the motivation of the terroris t came through wish to glamorize somewhat thirdrate way of life through esteem amongst the republican community or more simply in bars or with women denying rrorists the opportunity to commit terrorist activities will tend to undermine that aspec t of motivation the insurgents or terrorists motivation will however t end to be different in other theatres 838 the manoeuvrist approach ge nerally stresses manoeuvre rather than attrition whilst accepting that some destruc tion is inevitably required20 operation banner supports this approach the massive and sustained attrition against pira in the mid1970s did not destroy it but drove it to reorganise and restructure the attritional aspect of reassurance deterrence and attrition in the 1980s had relatively little effect on pira attrition did have other effects which reinforce key tenets of the manoeuvrist approach the first is the sho ck effect of major st rikes against pira the second effect was that of shaping pira s perceptions that it would not win by the continuation of the armed st ruggle and that it was in fact losing in particular it was losing some of its mo st experienced terrorists21 figure 84 indicates the immediate effect of the shock of loughgall on pira22 the reduction in pira activity is clearly visible however shock is transi ent and should be exploited in this case it was not exploited and lasted about two months 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 may86 aug86 nov86 feb87 may87 aug87 nov87 feb88 may88 ingsincidentsbomb shootings loughall occured on 8 may 1987 hence it appears to affect statistics for may and june by july incidents had returned to earlier levels month figure 84 pira attacks before and after loughgall 839 loughgall did however hav another effect on pira it did not conduct another operation of similar size for more than tw years the next being the attack on the derryard pvcp in december 19 89 in addition to internal inquiries and mistrust 20 ibid chapter 2 paras 0206 and 0222 21 ibid chapter 2 paras 02160217 and 0237 22 chapter 2 243 and chapter 5 figure 56 8 10 which corrode morale and mutual trust it appears that loughgall made pira very cautious about the conduct of what were to the organisation largescale operations 840 mission command is useful in counter insurgency operati ons since it promotes the trust and decentralisation which are suit able in campaigns of this sort23 and since it requires commanders intent and statement of purpose24 clear statement of intent supports freedom of operation which might have freed roulement units from some of the restraints noted in chapter 425 and would have helped focus many of the seemingly pointless aspects of framework operations26 the manoeuvrist approach should therefore be formally and explicit ly extended into the full range of doctrine for nonwarfighting operations the key factor the army 841 although in some ways seriously ill prepared for the events of 1969 the army responded quickly and effectively this indica tes that whatever t he precise details of organisations and tactics current at the time it was basically highquality robust and professional force which was able to adapt and evolve rapidly 842 although the britis h army has clearly benefited from the lessons it learned in northern ireland not all of these were ent irely new many had been identified before 1969 but were then applied by new generation of soldiers for example the co of the first unit to come under fire went to great lengths in his postoperational report to stress the need not to return fire until the firing point could be positively identified as result his battalion did not return fire until one hour and 40 minutes after the first round had been fired at it thus restraint in the use of force and the discipline required to achieve it were lessons fr om earlier conflicts operation banner ensured that such lessons were learned institutionalised and if necessary relearned by the whole army 843 the behaviour which the british army displayed was key factor the israeli historian martin van creveld has said that the british armys selfdiscipline and particularly restraint and forbearance in the fa ce of grievous provocation was key factor the army rarely overreacted it did not respond with tan ks on the streets it generally displayed humanity and humour although during the ear ly 1970s this was difficult to sustain and desire to sor t the micks out was often apparent 844 other military virtues were also important on at least two occasions junior non commissioned officers led counterattacks against pira gun teams equipped with automatic weapons27 such action must have made considerable impression on the terrorists involved both nco s were decorated for bravery 23 chapter 8 832 and also scsi occasional 45 the big issue chapter 7 24 adp land operations army code 71819 annex to chapter 6 25 chapter 4 409 26 ie in order to and chapter 5 536 27 in west belfast on 25 march 1982 and at derryard on 13 december 1989 the 1982 incident involved the use of an m60 machine gun the nco involved reached the door of the house from which the fire was coming by the time the gun team withdrew 8 11 845 the intellect and adaptability of commander s and staff were also important factors the clarity of thought demonstrated in the timate or appreciation process and the ability to think into the logi c of the theatre to the ext ent to which that occurred reveal level of intellect that not all rmies display the mental adaptability shown in developing organisations and processes r apidly in the face of changes to the threat is noteworthy and not displayed univ ersally elsewhere the history of the campaign reveals large number of botto mup initiatives however as the operation progressed hqs we re increasingly able to innovate by themselves permanent hqs at brigade and theatre level s eem to have contributed to this figure 85 unit signs bessbrook mill 2003 8 12 846 it is notable that very few quite junior individuals were responsible for the basic ideas behind many of the developments seen in the camp aign for example one captain in the early 1970s was largely resp onsible for the introduction of the indoor pipe ranges and the armys first ever operational shooting policy lieutenant richard winthrop rrf develope d highly successful approac h to searching which still carries his name today another captain was the first to develop the concept of chains of permanent ops in south armagh the intelligence and initiative shown by young officers such as these is commendable equally important however is the readiness of the chain of command to cons ider such ideas select the winners and implement them supporting them to the highest levels where appropriate 847 such human factors and others such as the determination and sheer pragmatism shown throughout the campaign do not ju st happen they are products of the culture of the army and the training and ex perience which it gives its officers and soldiers the operational experience of mu ch of the army was relatively high in 1969 and this process became selfsusta ining towards the end of operation banner the generally positive experience of northern ireland stood the army well in theatres such as kuwait the balk ans sierra leone afghanistan and iraq decisive points 848 could the campaign have been concluded earlier decisive points which are part of the contemporary estimate process c an be identified from campaign analysis although such an exercise is subject to the caveats surrounding hindsight the exercise must recognise the art of the possi ble both in political and military terms of those times there were decisive points few months after the breakdown of public order in 1969 when the situation might have been prevented from developing into an insurgency in the mid1970s when the defeat of the insurgency might have led to the longterm neutralisation of the pira before it became skilled terrorist organisation and in the early 1980s deci sive points exerci is not purely academic of the 3600 or so people who have died due to the troubles over 1400 died in the quarter century after 1980 849 in each case mentioned above the subs tantive action required to address the underlying political and social causes of the unrest in addition to what was actually done would have been considerable this would have meant major political upheavals and farreaching changes to estab lished political views and structures by all the parties concerned effective soci and economic remedial measures wou ld have been very costly at time when the national econo my was not buoyant there was guarantee of early ccess on the political social and economic fronts despite the real efforts at the time the problems were deepseated and not amenable to quick fix the view of the dublin governm ent was also key factor in addressing support for the pira and longterm political solutions 850 it has been suggested that enhanced legal powers could have been sought in order to remove the upper echelons of the pira in the 1980s when the organisation was able to exist independently of the catholic comm unity certainly in logistic terms in theory the pira in norther n ireland could have been separ ated from its popular support the political implications of enhanced legal powers in the united kingdom including doubt selective longterm internment would have been very 8 13 considerable it would have been difficult to enact the legislation as proponents of the 60day remand proposal found in west minster in 2005 release of those interned would have been inevit able at some stage and the information operations opportunities afforded to sympathisers and libertarians in dem ocracy would have been huge as the us authoritie s are finding over the g uantanamo detainees in addition without the active support of t he authorities in dublin and with porous border pira leaders in the republic could not have been removed and clean sweep could not have been achieved 851 equally the political implications of great britain re linquishing its custodial role for northern ireland would have been immense the mainland population was not involved in decisionmaking related to nort hern ireland not least due to the cross party consensus that has applied almo st without excepti on throughout the troubles28 as late as 1988 an economist survey indicated that 28 of the mainland population wanted the troops wit hdrawn immediately and further 29 within preset period to tal of 57 favouring withdrawal only 27 wished northern ireland to remain part of the uk however these statistics reflect british attitudes and do not cover repub licannationalist or loyalist views or significantly the opinions of interested external parties in the republic or in the united states conclusions 852 the analysis of decisive points reinforc some key lessons for those charged with countering mass unrest and subsequently in surgency and terrorism albeit in national rather than coalit ion context the army with essential support from the royal navy royal air force and government agencies was as an instrument of the governments of the day each of whom were contending with range of issues with differing levels of political and economic resource s at their disposal this what if analysis reinforces the great importance t hat should be attached by decisionmakers to the early stages of breakdown in public order and the need to address the causes of unrest rapidly and with visible substantive measures the art of the politically possible both at home and abroad and the influence of key political groups for example unionist mps in westminster must be recognise d but it is essential to take long view as well as to direct the immediate crisis response measures this long view may need to encompass diplomatic and political efforts in order to gain the support of allies and countries adjo ining the theatre of operations 853 if deployment is order ed then commanders following ssons drawn from severa l campaigns are likely to press for an effectiv unitary campaign authority in order to coordinate the range of polit ical economic social legal cultural information operations and security measures security representing military police and intelligence contributions laid down in the comprehensive approa ch the campaign authority supremo or vicero does not need to be military this is not an issue that field commanders can resolve they can however make such recommendations to the service chiefs of staff and to ministers coherenc across the various departments and agencies of government is ssential some of the results of not achieving this in northern ireland ar mentioned above and these not only delayed achievement of successful endstate but also had significant human cost 28 the lessons of ulster t utley london j m dent 1975 passim 8 14 854 coherent effective highlevel in formation operations campaign will be prerequisite for success information operat ions are crucial in world with an insatiable desire for information and news and where the internet blogger can broadcast as powerful images and messages as the white house or downing street the army learned hard lessons about good media relations in the 1970s but this is an area that needs as much att ention as the capabilities of potential opponents and the highlevel information operations effort was during the campaign as rule weak information oper ations should be conducted at several levels they are not just tactical military activity 855 martin van creveld has said that the british army is unique in northern ireland in its success against an irregular force it s hould be recognised that the army did not win in any recognisable way rather it achieved its desired endstate which allowed political process to be established withou t unacceptable levels of intimidation security force operations suppressed the vel of violence to level which the population could live with and with which the ruc and later the psni could cope the violence was reduced to an extent whic h made it clear to the pira that they would not win through violence this is major achievement and one with which the security forces from all three servic with the army in the lead should be entirely satisfied it took long time but as van crefeld said that success is unique 856 the british army should be proud of it s achievement in the conduct of operation banner errors were made however and some lessons both from general operations and from norther n ireland perspective have been identified above at the time of writing the campaign is not yet over and the definitive history and strategic judgements will have to wait until some time has elapsed that said the major military issues appar ent at this stage are recognition of the need for sensitive approach to the use of military force and avoiding overreaction from the outse t of an emergency deployment the restraint shown by british servicemen despite significant provocation was notable popular perceptions will be form ed in the first 100 days of campaign and they will be critical to military success the requirement to act vigorously across all lines of government activity to address the causes of major unrest as soon as it is apparent to prevent disorder turning into an insurgency terrorism or ci vil war this requires not only pan government comprehensive appr oach but also single campaign authority so that responses are coordi nated effectively the co mmander on the ground may have to raise awareness in whitehall of the requirements for successful campaign the importance of developing first rate intelligence structures processes and capabilities so that military operations ma be intelligenceled and nonmilitary initiatives properly planned and directed effectiveness will be judged by what can be gathered and by how well the product is shared and used the effectiveness of hq northern ireland as theatre hq able to offer longterm continuity during an emergency with set timescale the hq established and maintained under its command and its bud get the closely linked loop embracing 8 15 intelligence sciads tactical planners and training staffs which could react quickly to and rapidly neutralise terrorist ta ctical and technical initiatives the need to conduct an estimate of command arrangements at t he beginning of campaign or major operation and to revisit that estimate subsequently should not be overlooked the need to ensure that doctrine is amended so that th tenets of the manoeuvrist approach and ssion command are fully re flected in the guidance for nonwarfighting operations the value of dedicated operational training team system nitat nirtt and later optag with high quality instructors and frequent visi ts to theatre so that troops deployed with confidence after traini ng in appropriate tactics it is important however that th is preoperational tour tr aining is complemented by further education related to the theatre and the campaign for commanding officers company commander s and key staff officers 8 16 list of acronyms1 afv armoured fighting vehicle aor area of
