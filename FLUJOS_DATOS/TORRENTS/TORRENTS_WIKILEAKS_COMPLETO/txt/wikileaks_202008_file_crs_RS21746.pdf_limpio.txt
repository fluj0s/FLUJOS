advertising can be controvers ial if it conflicts with citizens views about the proper role of gove rnment yet some governme nt advertising is accepted as normal part of government information ac tivities according to an industry estimate the federal government spends over 1 billion year on advertising however government advertising expenditures are di fficult to estimate because 1 there is governmentwide definition of what constitutes advertising and 2 there is central authority to which agencies are required to report advertising expenses agencies discretion to advertise is limited primarily by restrictions imposed by congress in authorization and appropr iations statutes and by the prin ciples set forth in volume 1 of the government accountability offices gaos principles of federal appropriations law any oversight of government adver tising expenditures rests with agencies inspectors general gao and congress in may and june 2004 s 2416 and hr 4639 were introduced both

long been of mixed nd about advertising on the one hand advertising is beneficial inso far as it provides information on the other hand advertising be it private or governmental often attempts to persuade individuals to alter their behavior this can create paradoxically an image problem for advertising advertising has always been the pecks ba d boy of american business urging us to buy things we probably dont need and often cant afford1 unease with advertising can be magnified if the advertiser is the government especially should an advertisement conflict with widely held beliefs about g

should not needlessly or wantonly spend taxpayer money that citizens should be thrifty and selfreliant in light of these beliefs it is not surprisi ng that controversies have arisen around government advertisements that attempt to dissuade individuals from using marijuana2 that are expensive such as the u s postal services sponsorship of lance armstrongs professional bicycling team3 or that promote social service programs4 however not all government advertising is controversial few complain when the government advertises to announce job openings5 to announce competitions for contracts6 or to announce the disposal of surplus government property7 these sorts of advertisements likely are viewed as part of governments duty to inform the public about its activities as one of the hoover commissi on task forces wrote halfcentury ago apart from his responsibility as spokesman the department head has another obligation in democracy to keep the public informed about the activ ities of his agency how far to go and what media to us in this effort present touchy issues of personal and administrative integrity but of the basic obligation to inform the public there can be little doubt8 and not all advertisements that tell people what to do are ill regarded few have criticized government advertising campaigns that enc ourage citizens to buy war bonds or avoid inadvertently setting

advertising expe nditures may be found in number of places such as annual appropriations acts the us code and the code of federal regulations for example 10 usc 728 limits the use of appropriated f

that whether an agencys appropriations are available for advertising like any other expenditure depends on the agencys statut ory authority whether to advertise and if so how far to go with it are determined by the precise terms of the agencys program authority in conjunction with the necessary expense doctrine and general restrictions on the use of public funds for the various antilobbying statutes17 under the necessary expense doctrine an agency may use general appropriation to pay any expense that is 1 necessary or inci dental to the achievement of the underlying objectives of the
