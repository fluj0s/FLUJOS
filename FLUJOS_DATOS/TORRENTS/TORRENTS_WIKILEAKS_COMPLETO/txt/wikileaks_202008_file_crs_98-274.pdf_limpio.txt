law division summary this report discusses the supreme courts decision in united states v winstar corporation 518 us 839 116 sc 2432 1996 in which the court ruled that the united states had breached contracts made by the federal home loan bank board with various savings and loan institutions before the federal courts are two separate lines of cases claiming damages for legislation affecting agreements by regulators in the 1980s with investors in failing thrifts as to treatment of goodwill and change in tax law in the goodwill cases in december 1997 the united states court of federal claims ruled against the government on many common issues in the over 200 similar cases before that court in may 1998 that court ruled on the basis of the facts of one of those cases that the federal deposit insurance corporation could maintain claim against the united states as successor to failed institution and that private investors in that institution would be limited to restitution damages and not expectancy damages by july 2001 various other rulings at the trial court level in the court of federal claims and at the appellate level in the court of appeals for the federal circuit have added more complexity to these precise issues good will cases whatever the causes of the thrift crisis in the 1980sinflation deregulation poor investments fraudthe results were that the number of troubled institutions and failures ultimately meant insufficiency in the deposit insurance fund that was designated to handle the thrift industry that was the nowdefunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic fund without adequate funding to close down troubled and failing institutions and pay off depositors the funds regulator the federal home loan bank board fhlbb embarked on forbearance program to induce new investors to purchase or merge failed thrifts it permitted them to take advantage over 30 or 40 years of favorable accounting treatment for intangibles such as goodwill in calculating regulatory capital the net effect of including goodwill which came to be called supervisory goodwill appears to have been that of saving the regulator or the acquired institution from having to transfer tangible assets or cash to cover the deposit accounts transferred in the transaction httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98274crs2 what was happening therefore was an agreement by the government to allow the investors in failing thrifts to treat what was deficit in the thrifts capital as an asset the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1987 firrea pub l 10173 103 stat 183 set twentyyear limit for phasing out supervisory goodwill 12 usc sections 1464t3a and 4t9b it therefore nullified the agreements between the investors and the government in winstar the court decided that these agreements could be found to be binding on the government the government could be held liable for breach and could not assert four defenses that might have been available in other circumstances 1 the need for an unmistakable waiver of sovereign authority 2 need for an express delegation of authority to the federal home loan bank board to bind the government 3 the involv ement of sovereign powers that may not be waived and 4 the existence of public and general law firrea that could serve to bar damages claim essentially these were all inapplicable because the court did not interpret winstar as involving question of the united states having waived its right to change conditions governing the savings and loan industry it had not waived the authority to enact legislation the court viewed the case as involving an assertion that in making the agreements the government waived not its power to modify the agreements but its power to do so without having to pay contract damages the court treated these agreements as closer to ordinary runofthemill government contracts than to regulatory orders there are 120 cases involving similar situations before the federal courts with total damage claims in the 20 to 30 billion range as of july 2001 of the 120 cases before the trial court only 15 have been concluded9 dismissed and 6 settled five cases are on appeal and 95 remain before the trial court in various stages of litigation the trial court the united states court of federal claims scheduled 38 of these cases for accelerated treatment in december 22 1997 opinion california federal bank v united states 39 fed cl 753 1997 the court ruled against the government on series of legal issues common to many of the cases it charged the government with raising weak arguments and suggested that settlement discussions should proceed it noted the complexity of managing these cases with distinct factual ingredients and varied issues and that single group of issues will resolve all the cases the claims court selected four cases to air representative contract defenses presumably to stimulate the government to soften its litigation strate gy the december 1997 decision deals with these consolidated defenses many of the defenses involved alleged inconsistency reflected in the multitudinous documents and collateral agreements that constituted the deals by which the investors were induced to take over the failing institutions some of the issues were virtually identical to those raised in the supreme court others involved different factual situationssuch as whether or not the fact that the institution would have been adequately capitalized on the date of acquisition with or without the forbearance agreements was critical to finding the existence of contract after examining the issues the court ruled for the plaintiffs and criticized the government and its arguments subsequently the government preserving its right to appeal filed motion to proceed with discovery and insisted that many of the cases involve factual circumstances that differ from winstar as these cases have proceeded the government has argued that some of the deals were not arrang ed or induced by fhlbb or involve breaches by the thrifts before firrea and the governments breachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98274crs3 in may 1998 in one of the winstar cases the court of federal claims ruled that the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic could pursue its goodwill claims as successor to failed thrift and possibly recover damages for rights it received as assignee of the receiver but that it could not recover for payments it made in its corporate capacity to meet deficits in the receivership among the reasons was the avoidance of tying up the courts docket with an intragovernmental dispute the treasury being the creditor of 99 of the receiverships deficit the court also ruled that the private plaintiffs damages claims would be limited to restitution damages representing return on their investments expectancy damages would not be allowed as they represent general damages recoverable by the institution and presumably by the fdic as its successor statesman savings holding corporation v united states 41 fed cl 1 1998 as cases are reviewed on appeal issues as critical as whether or not to allow various types of damages are being reexamined in glendale federal bank v united states 293 f 3d 1374 fed cir 2001 the appellate court refused to allow restitution damages vacated the trial courts 909 million judgment and remanded for calculation of the cost of actual reliance it disallowed lost profits and restitution claims as being too speculative in california federal bank v united states 245 f 3d 1342 fed cir 2001 the appeals court refused to allow restitution as being too speculative but found that the plaintiffs had presented sufficient evidence to raise factual issue as to the existence of and quantity of lost profits it therefore remanded the case for findings on the issue of lost profits tax benefits cases in addition to the 120 good will cases there are at least eight cases according to the wall street journal july 17 2001 b76 col 2 involving tax benefits available to investors who acquired failing thrifts in the late 1980s only to have the tax provisions repealed in 1993 like the goodwill cases the tax benefit cases involve agreements between investors and thrift regulators in the context of acquisition of failing thrifts in the tax benefit cases the plaintiffs entered into agreements with fslic and the fhlbb providing that the regulators would reimburse them for the losses they sustained when disposing of certain assets that they acquired in the transaction under provisions of the tax law then in existence specifically applicable to fslic the acquirers could take advantage of the tax losses and were not required to include the fslic reimbursement in calculating their income subsequently this tax benefit was repealed by enactment of section 13224 of the omnibus budget reconciliatio n act of 1993 pub l 10366 in centex v united states 2001 usclaims lexis 123 july 6 2001 decision which encompasses five separate cases the court of federal claims ruled that the agreements with fslic were contracts and that they were breached by enactment of the 1993 legislation thereby subjecting the united states to liability for contract damages in reaching the decision the court said that the paintiffs here legitimately expected that the covered asset loss deduction would not be eliminat ed through retroactive legislation targeted specifically at assistance agreements entered into by the fslic and the fhlbb this expectation was protected by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that was contained in the assistance agreement 2001 us claims lexis 123 73 unlike the goodwill cases however the tax benefit cases are at preliminary stage in the litigation process the centrex case may be appealed by the department of justice there has been supreme court decision comparable to winstar construing the repeal of the particular piece of legislation in question as breach of contract if and when the appellate process ends the issue of damages awaits discovery and trialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98274crs4 funding costs of the litigation damage awards and settlement amounts
