and the public at large as to whether borrowers were fully informed about the terms of their mortgage loans some observers have suggested that some borrowers in the subprime market may ve been victims of predatory lending practices or other discrimin atory activity bills intr oduced in the 110th congress such as s 1299 senator charles schumer et and s 2452 senator christopher dodd et would seek to remedy percei ved abuses particularly with higherpriced mortgage lending this report describes current issues and recent changes to the home mortgage disclosure act hmda of 1975 also incl uded are

act pl 90301 81 stat 146 as amended by 15 usc section 1601 et q tila requires lenders to disclose the cost of credit and repayment terms of mortga ge loans before borrowers enter into any transactions the federal reserve board implements tila through regulation z reporting issues under the home mortgage disclosure act introduction recent mortgage repayment problems and subsequent increases in foreclosures have generated concern in congress as to whether borro wers are taking out high interest loans that they cannot afford1 there are at least four possible explanations why some borrowers receive higherpriced ans first borrowers with weak credit histories may face higher borrowing costs than borrowers with better credit histories if lenders require more compensation for taking on greater credit or default risks second the actual costs of the mortgage may have been hidden or simply not transparent when borrowers entered into the lending transaction hidden costs can surprise borrower and cause financial di stress which may lead to foreclosure third borrowers may have entered into high cost loans as result of discrimination according to the federal reserve board minorities are still more likely to pay rates above specified pricing thresholds prior to controlling for some related borrower characteristics2 fourth recent mortgage repayment problems may reflect rise in various forms of predatory lending in s hort borrowers may have obtained expensive mortgage loans for variety of reasons which may have resulted in recent repayment problems various legislation has been enacted to oversee lending practices in the mortgage market the home mortgage disclosure act hmda of 1975 requires the disclosure of mortgage loan information so regulators can monitor mortgage lending activity3 in addition the 1994 home ownership equity protection act hoepa enacted as an amendment to the truthinlending act tila of 1968 requires additional disclosure s to consumers for high cost refinance and other non purchase loans secured by their principal residences4 the real estate settlement procedures act respa of 1974 is design ed to protect mortgage borrowers from paying

government regulators and the private sector with the monitoring of antidiscriminatory practices6 hmda is implemented by the federal reserve board via regu lation c 12 cfr part 203 and the public loan data set is available at the federa l financial institutions examination councils website7 hmda data is used to assist with the supervision and enforcement of fair lending compliance8 the office of the comptroller of the currency occ for example is federal agency that uses the hmda data to assist with its fair lending and community reinvestment act cra examinations of nationally chartered banks9 reporting issues prior to 2008 redlining and freque ncy of rejection when hmda was enacted there was concern that less affl uent and minority neighborhoods did not enjoy the same access to financial services as do ot her neighborhoods fi nancial institutions allegedly accepted deposits but did not make mortgage loans in certainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34720crs3 10 see

neighborhoods and these lending practices we re viewed as contributing to further neighborhood deterioration hmda required institutions covered under the law to report home mortgage originations by geographic area financial institution type borrower race sex income and whether the loans were for home purchase or refinance10 this information would show geographical patterns of mortgage originations and help regulators determine where further investigation of redlining or geographical discr imination was necessary in 1989 congress expanded hmda to include the race sex and borrower income of those applicants that were rejected as well as those who were approved11 this change allowed regulators to monitor the frequency that applicants from certain groups were denied mortgage loans relative to other groups12 the hmda data could then be used to track any differences in denial rates by income race and gender riskbased pricing beginning in the 1990s credit became increasingly available for less creditworthy borrowers instead of turning down loan requests for borrowers of lower credit quality lenders began charging these borrowers higher interest rates to compensate for the additional risk as result regulators monitoring discrimination began to show greater concer n about the mortgage loan rates charged to different groups of borrowers congress expanded hmda in 2002 to include ratespread information at the time the ratespread was defined as the di fference between the annual percentage rate apr which is the annual total cost of loan and the rate on us treasury securities of comparable maturity the flat mortgage interest rate was not chosen because by definition it contains only the cost of the principal loan amount expressed as percentage the apr however includes the cost of the principal loan amount insurance and other fees all expressed as percentage the law requiring ratespread inform ation was implemented in 200413 reporting requirement s and coverage all homesecured mortgage loans do not get reported under hmda for at least three reasons first covered institutions or those subject to hmda reporting requirements include only those banks savings and loans credit unions and mortgage and consumer finance companies that meet thresholds regarding asset size or percentage of business related to housinglending activity lenders that do not have offices in metropolitan statistical areas are also not required to report hmda data second regulation c requires lenders to report only loans that m eet certain ratespread thresholds the reporting thresholds for first mortgage ans had been those with spread of 3 percentage points for the second mortga ge loans the reporting threshold was 5 percentage points loans not meeting th ratespread thresholds would not be reported third home equity loans ta ken out for purposes other than home improvements or other home related purposes are not re ported under hmda

reported hmda currently covers approximately 80 of the national mortgage market14 difficulties identifying highpriced lending abuses the hmda data like all databases has its caveats when using the hmda data to identify highpriced lending activity understanding data limitations is important to correctly interpret the empirical findings key issues are presented below lack of credit history information the hmda data has been criticized for not including more variables that coul d be used to either verify or rule out discrimination an example of releva nt variable is borrower credit history information some borrowers pay more for their loans relative to others because they exhibit higher levels of credit risk having credit history information would be necessary to determine if observed pricing di fferentials reflect diffe rences in financial risk or discrimination othe r useful variables include borrower characteristics such as total assets and debts and loan characteristics such as the loantovalue ratio given that hmda data do not include all re levant information that bears on lender risk the basis for individual lending decisions is portrayed incompletely lenders are not required to report every variable used to evaluate applicants because the hmda data is released to the public which could compromise the privacy of individuals holding reported loan s it is possible that public users of hmda data would be able to match collected information with local records and determine the identity of individuals becau federal regulator agencies can obtain loan data from financial institutions they wish to examine more closely the reporting of all borrower information to hmda is not necessary for those agencies that enforce fair lending and fair housing laws federal agencies also follow interagency fair lending examination procedures provided by the federal financial ins titutions examination council ffiec to evaluate unlawful discrimination in the prime market15 these procedures include review of 1 sample bank loan files 2 loan prices relative to compensation of brokers 3 whether the institutions use pricing models that are empirically based and statistically sound and 4 whet her the disparities are substantial16 hence even if more variables were collected hmda data are intended for use in targetinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34720crs5 17 see httpwwwfederalreservegovnewseventspressbcreg20070412ahtm 18 for more information on nontraditional mortgage products see crs report rl33775 alternative mortgages risks to consume rs and lenders in the current housing cycle by edward vincent murphy 19 regulation z requires lenders to assume the interest rate situation at the time of origination will continue for the term of the loan when calculating th apr for adjustable rate loans 20 if investors lenders are promised returns associated with longerterm loans but receive returns associated with shorterterm loans they may be unwilling to make future loans especially if yields consistently fail to meet expectations hence mortgage originators price mortgages using rates that closely match the expected duration or mortgage life lenders may account for prepayment or early termination risk by pricing mortgages using treasury rates equal to or less than 10 yearsinstitutions for closer examination but not as the sole basis for enforcing anti discrimination laws in individual cases17 reporting problems with the apr with greater usage of complex non traditional mortgage loan products the apr may become increasingly difficult indicator to interpret18 the apr tells nothing about balloon payments prepayment options or the length of term that an adjustable interest rate is locked19 in addition closing costs vary by state which means local differences will always persist hence the apr measure may provide little informa tion about relative pricing because the underlying loan products and terms vary substantially movements in interest rates changes in shortterm relative to longterm rates also known as yield curve rotati ons may affect loan reporting to hmda given that mortgage loans are often priced on rates that better reflect the expected lifespan of the loan as opposed to rates that match the entire mortgage term the hmda data can reflect durationmatching problem rather than problem of excessive higherpriced lending20 for example borrowers often sell their homes or refinance into new mortgage before their existing mortgage expires regulation c however had required the ratespread calcu lation for 30year fixed or adjustable rate mortgage loans to use the 30year treasury yield as the benchmark rate suppose treasury market interest rates change so that shorterter m rates rise relative to longerterm rates the ratespread s calculations which may have even been negative under steeper yield curve w ill increase and ma become positive potentially resulting in more loans meeting the hmda thresholds consequently such timing or duration mismatches captured by the ratespread calculations which increase when the differences in duration between apr and benchmark rates are large could result in more 30year fixe d rate mortgages reported as hmda rate spread loans interest rate changes may also affect the reporting of higherpriced lending in particular if the proportion of adjustablerate mortgages arms relative to fixedrate mortgages increases flattening of the yield curve is likely to cause the ratespreads on both fixed rate mortgages and arms to be similar in size as result arms would have higher rate spr eads relative to those computed under steeper yield curveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34720crs6 21 for formal analysis concerning the extent to which the increase in hmda reportable ratespread loans between 20042006 can be attribut ed to the flattening of the yield curve see chau do and irina paley explaining

through regulation z 25 the 561 figure is for 2008 the federal reserve board adjusts this number nnually continuedand there would be an increase in the number of arms reported as highpriced loans21 recent modifications to regulation c to address some concerns described above the federal reserve has changed the benchmark rate used to calculate the ratespread for reporting hmda loans22 the federal reserve proposes use of the av erage mortgage rates found in the primary mortgage market survey pmms conducted by freddie mac as the benchmark rates for ratespread calculations23 the reporting thresholds for first mortgage loans will now be those with spread equal to or greater than 15 percentage points for the second mortgage loans the reporting thres hold will be equal to or greater than 35 percentage points the use of an average prime mortgage rate which the pmms reports on weekly basis is likely to follow the rates of prime mortgage rates more closely than treasury rates whenever the yield curve changes ratespread computed as the difference between mortgage rate and an average prime mortgage rate is likely to show less volatility than one computed as the difference between mortgage rate and treasury rate as result of this regulatory change it may become easier to attribute an observable increase in ratespread reported loans to actual changes in lending practices which ultimately is the objective for hmda reporting implications for hoepa loans the 1994 home ownership equity protec tion act hoepa is an amendment to the truthinlending act tila of 1968 tila requires lenders to disclose the cost of credit and repayment terms of all consumer loans before borrowers enter into any transactions24 hoepa imposes additional disclosure requirements for consumers obtaining high cost refinan ce and other nonpurchase closedended second loans secured by their principal resi dences loan is considered to be hoepa loan if either the apr exceeds the rate of comparable treasury security by more than 8 percentage points on first mortgage 10 percentage points on second mortgage or if the consumer pa ys total points and fees exceeding the larger of 561 or 8 of the total loan amount25 should loan satisfy any of these criteriahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34720crs7 25 continued based upon changes to the consumer price index see httpwwwocctreasgovftp bulletin200732apdf and http

hoepa by david h carpenter the borrower must be provided with disclosu res three days before the loan is closed in addition to the threeday right of re scission generally requi red by tila which means total of six days to decide whethe r or not to enter into the transaction in 2002 revisions to regulation c required nders to report hoepa loans in hmda and they must also identify such loans as being subject to hoepa requirements26 hoepa however is implemented via regu lation z 12 cfr part 226 sections 31 32 and 34 hoepa has been extended to cover more loans27 since 2002 coverage has been extended by lowering the price tr igger from 10 to the current 8 percentage points above comparable treasury secur ity the federal reserve board has also amended regulation z to appl hoepa rules to all mort gage lenders and not just those supervised and examined by the federal reserve28 the amended rule added four key protections the first protection prohibits lenders from making loans based upon the home value without regard for the borrowers ability to repay the loan from income and assets second verification of income and assets will be required for determining repayment ability third highercost loans may not have prepayment penalties that last for more than two years and prepayment penalties are not allowed for loans in which the monthly payment can change during the initial four years finally escrow accounts for property taxes and homeowners insurance must be established for all first lien mortgages additional protections covered in the rule are described in the fede ral reserve announcement29 hoepa loans may have been considered subset of the larger set of hmda loans when both rate spread calculati ons relied upon comparable us treasury securities for the benchmark rates now that the federal reserve has modified the benchmark rates used to compute hm da rate spreads hmda and hoepa rate spreads will be calculate d under separate methods the benchmark rate for computing hoepa loans is defined by fe deral statute and modification of the benchmark rate for hoepa loans would be left for congress to decide loans meeting the existing hoepa thresholds may still simultaneously meet the newly adopted hmda thresholds hoepa rate spreads however will now be more sensitive to treasury yield curve movements than hmda rate spreads httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34720crs8

either downpayment or home equity of at least 20 of the property value prime or conventional as well as subprime homebuyers may purchase private mortgage insurance the federal housing administration fha is federally operated mortgage insurance program that primarily serves firsttime and less creditworthy borrowers30 should the borrower default on fhainsured mortgage loan obligation the lender will be reimbursed for the loss the fha is selffinancing program under which premiums must be fficient to cover its costs and expected losses fha fees are collected via an upfront premium charge when the loan is originated and an annual pr emium charge thereafter after passage of the housing and economic act of 2008 fha received the statutory authority to charge up to 3 in its upfront pre mium and 055 annually31 consequently the bulk of the total mortgage insurance premium must be collected upfront and fha has little flexibility to collect larger portion of the insurance fees via the annual premium mechanism fhainsu red mortgage loans therefore run the risk of hitting the 15 threshold of repor table hmda ratespread loans the fha upfront premium charges would likely be calculated in the apr of the mortgage loan which would cause the ratespread to be higher the flexibility to shift how the fha insurance fees are collected or more specifically to make greater use of the annual premium mechanism arguably has at least three advantages first annual pr emium collections would reduce the risk of fha loans being incorrectly identified as higherpriced loans under hmda reporting requirements second computing refunds or premium reducti ons via th annual premium may arguably be easier shoul d fha borrowers become eligible for rebates32 third under certain circumstances an annual premium mechanism may also reduce financial burdens on fha borro wers for example borrowers planning to reside in their homes for relatively short period of time would not incur additional interest costs due to financing large insurance premiums into their mortgage loans
