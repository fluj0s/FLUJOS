bahrain wanted to be part of the solution to the gccs defense integration challenges lt gen hostage and the charge thanked him for bahrains commitment to contribute small contingent for the effort in afghanistan end summary iran and regional air and missile defense 2 s on october 12 us air forces central usafcent commander lt gen mike hostage and charge daffaires called on the crown prince the cp commended comafcent for now being forward deployed to udeid air base in qatar because it was important to spend time with the us counterparts in the gulf if more us troops were added into afghanistan and iran tried to delay the process begun in geneva shaikh salman commented that there would be tough months ahead for the region as the p5 1 pursued its carrot and stick approach with iran salman wondered if tehran would pursue tit for tat in its military posture because of the lack of sophisticated intelligence gathering among the gulf states the cp observed that the press plays propaganda war into our psyche he decried irans interference in iraq 3 s lt gen hostage explained that because of the threat posed by iran to the region his primary goal was to work on establishing regional integrated air and missile defense riamd between the us and the gcc states first this involved integrating the us own air and missile defense assets navy aegis army patriots etc then he would offer to link each gulf state into shared early warning sew common operating picture cop to the extent that each government was willing to participate the us would share the same picture to all and each could add as much information as it liked while keeping data it did not wish to share behind secure firewall 4 s the cp responded that this would be the largest game changer because it would be permanent fixture and would affect irans ability to project power he thanked the us for the two us patriot batteries stationed here and said he would like to help further integrate the gulf states into riamd project because it would not be enough without everyones participation he cautioned however that the us would have to lead the effort and it would have to be bilaterally with each government with multilateral system as the longterm goal he asked whether and where the us would deploy thaad theater high altitude air defense system to the gulf gen hostage replied that the location was not yet certain but yes thaad would be deployed within year and would prove to be very capable midcourse intercept system prince salman worried that in an attack scenario iran would try to swarm and overwhelm specific targets and we would all have to be ready for that 5 s lt gen hostage pointed to the air warfare center in the uae as center of excellence coe coe for riamd could be established there as well as training vehicle to help the gulf states get comfortable with the technical solutions so they could share information shaikh salman said he wanted bahrain to be part of the solution he noted that bahrain had been the first gcc government to participate in task force 152 and it liked to be leader consider us serious partners he stated iran to degrade or deter 6 s lt gen hostage asked for the cps views of irans willingness to deal in good faith with the p5 1 shaikh salman said his views had not changed irans behavior would continue to be problematic however he speculated that the reason iran had changed course and cooperated with the p5 1 in geneva was due to russian president medvedevs comment at unga that sometimes sanctions were unavoidable cda pointed manama 00000611 002 of 002 out that as the p5 1 pursued dual track strategy of engagement and preparing for sanctions the gcc countries roles would be important confirming that bahrain would do what it could to keep the pressure on iran the cp lamented that gulf countries had few levers on china he thought that if saudi arabia were to sell more oil to china it would help provide some leverage 7 s the cp asked whether russia had shipped its s300 air defense system to iran yet lt gen hostage said salman said he was sure that the international community would have to wait until the next election in iran to see real internal changes the regime was still in firm control and ahmadinejad was consolidating his power even as the economy was failing the world would need strategy led by the us we are still ways away from knowing whether force is necessary the cp stated bahrains contribution to the effort in afghanistan 9 c the cp asked whether the us was changing its goals in afghanistan to strategy of reconciliation and power sharing with some elements of the taliban while targeting senior qaeda figures lt gen hostage said way had to be found to let the afghans live in their not our version of peace but he wondered whether it could be done on our timeline shaikh salman counseled patience as with the implementation of the surge in iraq lt gen hostage and charge thanked him for bahrains commitment to contribute company from its security forces to provide inner perimeter security at coalition base in afghanistan shaikh salman stated that his father king hamad had approved budget of usd 13 million for the deployment the day before so the troops would have the necessary equipment 10 c the cp asked whether the us would still need to deploy aerial refueling tankers to isa air base
