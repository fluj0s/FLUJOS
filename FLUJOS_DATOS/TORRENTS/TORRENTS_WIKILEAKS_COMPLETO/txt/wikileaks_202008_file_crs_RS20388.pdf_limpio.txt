officials those paid at ex level ii generally have been in parity since the executive schedule was established in 19641 the member salaries were in parity with those of district judges from 1955 to 1969 and have been again since 1987 during the period 1969 to 1987 member pay was often in parity with the pay of federal appellate judges there is constitutional or statutory requirement other than the provision of law establishing the commission procedure discussed below that the salaries of federal executive branch officials and federal justices and judges be limited by the salaries of members of congress or that member pay be limited by the salaries of these federal executive and judicial officials 2 the ethics reform act of 1989 includes two provisions under which pay rates for members the vice president federal officials paid under the ex and certain federal justices and judges can be set the first of these provisions provides for quadrennial review of the salaries of federal officials by citizens commission on public service and compensation 3 the commission is to make recommendations to the president the law requires the commission and the president to submit recommendations to congress providing that the salaries of the speaker of the house of representatives the vice president of the united states and the chief justice of the united states shall be equal majority and minority leaders of the house of representatives and the senate the president pro tempore of the senate and level i of the executive schedule cabinet officers shall be equal and senators members of the house of representatives the resident commissioner from puerto rico delegates to the house judges of the us district courts judges of the united states court of international trade and level ii deputy secretaries of departments secretaries of military departments and heads of major agencies of the executive schedule shall be equal 4 although the law establishes the salary parity stated above upon quadrennial review it is unclear what effect if any the provision has since the commission has never been activated the commission was initially funded in the 1993 treasury postal

revises the adjustment or the annual base pay adjustment for gs employees is established at rate less than the scheduled increase for members in which case members would be paid the lower rate 11 the pay adjustment for federal officials paid under the ex also takes effect automatically unless congress takes similar action such congressional action has generally occurred during consideration of the

adjustments under the ethics reform act chief justice william h rehnquist stated that because judges are appointed for life and expected to remain on the bench increases in judicial compensation should not be tied to increases for noncareer public servants22 in 2003 report the national commission on the public service citing the compelling need to recruit and retain the best people possible to serve as executive branch officials and on the federal judiciary also recommended separate salary adjustments as an interim step toward impl ementation of its recommendations the commission stated that congress should grant an immediate and significant increase in judicial executive and legislative salaries to ensure reasonable relationship with other professional opportunities and its first priority in doing so should be an immediate and substantial increase in judicial salaries 23 chief justice john g roberts jr reiterated the commissions recommendations in the 2005 annual report on the federal judiciary24 his 2006 annual report focused solely on the issue of judicial pay and stated that inadequate compensation directly threatens the viab ility of life tenure and if tenure in office is made uncertain the strength and independence judges need to uphold the rule of laweven when it is unpopular to do sowill be seriously eroded 25
