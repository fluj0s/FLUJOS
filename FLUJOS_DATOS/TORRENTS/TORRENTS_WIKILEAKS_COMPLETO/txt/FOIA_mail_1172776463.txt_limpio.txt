from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re ppt date thu 1 mar 2007 141423 0000 gmt replyto tosbornueaacuk cc tosbornueaacuk here is the old version for you to compare with the only noticeable difference is for the uralsyamal region which previously had higher peak near 1000 ad although that was quite big change once you average it with the other two series the overall mean series shows very little difference cheers tim on thu march 1 2007 157 pm keith briffa wrote tim am back and looking at this now thanks keith at 1223 01032007 you wrote hi again please see the attached pdf file ive not yet put it into powerpoint because i wanted to check whether it matches what you want or if you want fewer lines on it etc each page is identical layout for the 3 regions and then the 4th page is for the average across all the data on each page you have the scatter graphs and correlation between the unfiltered and the 10year smoothed trw and summer temperature plus the 3 calibration lines our normal regression in black variance matching in orange and inverting the regression of trw onto temperature in brown thin lines between unfiltered data and thick lines between 10year smoothed data the solid blue scatter plot points are those used in the 19001990 calibration period the blue circles with cross in are from outside the calibration period the top panels show the full 2000yr reconstructions with the line colour and thickness coordinated to match the calibration lines in the bottom panels the only exception is that i have omitted the inverse regression between unfiltered data the line is shown dotted on the bottom left panels because this resulted in such huge variance that the curves went way off the vertical scale in this top panel all series including the instrumental blue are 50year smoothed in the scandinavian panel theres also the longer tornedalen summer temperatures overlaid in green so i can put each of these into powerpoint slide easily i could also repeat them for shorter period and less smoothing eg 1500present with decadal smoothing or 1800present with smoothing i could also omit some of the curves if you think 5 reconstruction alternatives per panel is too many with slightly more time i could make it so that the powerpoint built up with 1 alternative reconstruction at time until all 5 were there ill call you soon and we can talk about it cheers tim on thu march 1 2007 1017 am keith briffa wrote hi tim thanks i would be happy with only the usual regression but the plots with different timescales shown for each and the average series would be great cheers keith at 0951 01032007 you wrote hi keith i forgot to describe the contents of the ppt file i sent yesterday basically it starts with few comparisons of the modern period between the mxdbased recons and the instrumental data first 3 show data only up to 1960 1 full mxd reconstruction 2 masked mxd reconstruction masked by availability of instrumental temps 3 masked temperatures masked by availability of mxd all with 5year filter then the same as above except the next 3 show data up to 1995 to illustrate the decline then couple more repeating the above masked mxd then masked temperature but this time without any timefiltering so you can see individual warm and cold years then finally the full mxd reconstruction back to 1400 but only up to 1960 im working from home today ill redo the calibrated northern eurasian stuff do you want all the options again ie forward and inverse regression variance matching prepostcalibration averaging of the regions low and high pass filtering then we can make any final slides friday morning if thats ok with you cheers tim professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa attachment converted ceudoraattachold_eurasianpdf
