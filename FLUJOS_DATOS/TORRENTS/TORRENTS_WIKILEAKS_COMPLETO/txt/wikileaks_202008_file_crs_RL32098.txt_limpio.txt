authorized the establishment of the federal governmentss first performancebased organization pbo the office of federal student aid fsa1 the legislation to create the pbo responded to widespread belief that the us department of education ed and fsa specifically needed significant restructuring congress designated fsa as pbo to release it from many of the traditional constraints associated with government agency and to enable fsa to focus on programs and customer service as pbo fsa receives wider discretion in areas such as hiring of personnel and equipment acquisition in exchange for establishing measurable performance goals and objectives reducing the costs of administering the student financial assistance programs and improving customer satisfaction this report provides an overview of pbos in general and fsa specifically including fsas purpose structure and goals the report concludes with discussion of selected program and policy matters related to fsas status as pbo over the last 5 years transforming student financial assistance fsa becomes pbo performancebased organizations pbos in the united states federal government are modeled after the british public service reform efforts of the late 1980s pbos are resultsdriven organizations that attempt to deliver the best possible services to their customers pbos are to have clear objectives and measurable goals that are intended to increase the agencys accountability and improve performance in exchange pbos are granted discretion to operate more like private sector corporations having more control over their budget personnel decisions and procurement2 the establishment of pbos in the 1 hea title i sections 141143 2 for additional reading on performance based organizations see alasdair roberts continued crs2 united states government was part of the government reform efforts during the clinton administration under the auspices of the national performance review npr also known as the national partnership for reinventing government vice president gore proposed the establishment of pbos as means of saving money and providing more efficient and improved services to customers npr literature on the implementation of pbos quotes the vicepresident endorsing pbos for these pbos were going to toss out the restrictive rules that keep them from doing business like business all the red tape personnel rules that keep managers from using people effectively the budget restrictions that make planning or allocating resources almost impossible3 although the executive branch did not initially consider fsa candidate for conversion to pbo congress designated fsa as pbo in the 1998 amendments to the hea making it the federal governments first performancebased organization improving student aid delivery fsa manages and administers all federally funded student financial assistance programs authorized under title iv of the higher education act when congress enacted the hea in 1965 two new financial aid programs were also created guaranteed student loans and education opportunity grantsand administration of the federal workstudy program was assigned to the office of education over the years congress established additional federal financial aid programs which produced an operation that annually provides an estimated 55 billion in grants and loans to students and interacts with approximately 5300 schools 4100 lenders and 36 guaranty agencies4 furthermore this operation uses 13 separate computer systems and several contractors in addition fsas programs continue to be included in the general accounting offices gao list of high risk programs5 during the 1998 reauthorization congress acted to improve eds management of the federal financial aid programs6 the 1998 amendments to the hea created the pbo as way to more effectively administer the programs as noted in the house committee on education and the workforces report on hr 6 higher education act amendments of 1998 the

documents contact the advisory committee on student financial assistance at httpwwwadv_comsfaedgov crs3 arises from the inability of the department of education to adequately manage over 40 billion in student financial aid also the departments budget for student aid information systems has tripled over the last 5 years and instead of consolidating its existing data systems the department has increased the number of system contracts that cannot share data with each other the committee maintained that converting fsa to pbo managed by chief operating officer coo would significantly improve the efficacy and efficiency of student aid delivery and make it less expensive as noted in the hea section 141a2 fsas purposes as pbo are to improve service to students and other participants in the student financial assistance programs authorized under title iv including making those programs more understandable to students and their parents reduce the costs of administering title iv programs increase accountability of the persons responsible for administering the operations of these programs provide greater flexibility in the management of the student aid programs integrate the information systems supporting the student aid programs implement an open common integrated system for student aid delivery and develop and maintain student aid system that contains complete accurate and timely data to ensure program integrity fsa operates as discrete management unit within ed but the secretary of education maintains responsibility for the development and promulgation of policy and regulations relating to these programs however the secretary is directed to consult with the chief operating officer of fsa in developing policies and regulations that pertain to these programs discussed later in this report fsa maintains independent control of its budget allocations and expenditures personnel decisions and processes procurement and other administrative and management functions organization upon receiving pbo designation all of the operations and employees from the office of postsecondary education ope that pertained to student financial assistance were relocated to the newly created pbo congress specified that fsa should be headed by nonpartisan independent chief operating officer each coo is to be appointed by the secretary of education and serve for term of not less than 3 years and more than 5 years however heshe can be reappointed for subsequent terms with the same time restrictions the coo is expected to have demonstrated management experience and ability in information technology and financial systems the coo serves under the terms of prespecified performance agreement that identifies measurable goals and expected results crs4 as mentioned earlier as pbo fsa has sole discretion over its personnel decisions the coo is authorized to determine the number of senior mangers that heshe needs as well as make appointments the selected senior managers are appointed without regard for the provisions of the federal governments competitive service rules under the first coo greg woods fsa was organized into channels that focus on types of customers as opposed to programs the channels are schools students and financial partners by organizing the offices and services by customer types as opposed to program areas customers receive single point of contact for all financial aid matters which is expected to improve customer satisfaction for example the schools channel is responsible for all aspects of the financial aid process that pertain to schools such as financial aid origination and disbursement each of the channels is headed by general manager who is responsible for overseeing all of the activities in hisher respective channel congress also required that the newly appointed coo select student loan ombudsman who is responsible for providing assistance to student loan borrowers the ombudsman is charged with informally resolving complaints regarding student loans and compiling and analyzing data and making policy recommendations as necessary to support the efforts of all of the newly established divisions an enterprise service division was created this division consists of offices such as human resources that are responsible for hiring new personnel training and developing current personnel and acquiring technology equipment similar to private sector corporations fsa also has chief financial officer cfo who is responsible for management of fsas finances and chief information officer cio who handles the acquisition and management of the information systems within fsa as illustrated by figure 1 prepared by ed the offices shown at the bottom of the chart constitute the enterprise services they provide support and assistance to all of the offices within fsa further ed places the channel managers at the top of the organizational chart to highlight the importance of their work serving fsas

had three broad measures to gauge its success customer satisfaction employee satisfaction and reduction of the administration costs for the student financial assistance programs in consultation with the secretary each year the coo prepares an annual performance plan that outlines the tasks that fsa expects to accomplish in the upcoming year currently in its fifth year fsa continues to work towards achieving these objectives with varying degrees of success in each customer satisfaction as noted earlier fsas customers are students financial institutions and schools although each of these groups has common interest financial assistance the organization of ope poor communication between programs and poor customer service were general complaints from all groups of customers prior to 1998 because the interests of customers varied different systems were required to cater to each channels respective customers in addition to aligning the offices and therefore the programs within each office to address the needs of its customers general manager was appointed to each channel and given specific and measurable objectives to improve service for example in the 2003 annual plan the cfo was charged with addressing the existing weaknesses and conditions that were reported from previous audits specifically the cfo is charged with improving the conditions that have contributed to the federal aid programs being included on gaos list of high risk programs7 this task is intended to improve customer satisfaction reduce costs and improve program integrity 7 according to eds fy2002 performance and accountability report although fsa has made and continues to make considerable progress the federal aid programs remain on gaos list of high risk programs crs6 to measure customer satisfaction fsa utilizes the american customer satisfaction index acsi survey developed by the university of michigan acsi provides organizations with score 0 to 100 that is based on customer satisfaction with the companys services to ascertain its performance fsa surveyed 250 customers from each channel about specific practices and procedures according to eds annual program performance report fsas last reported score was 729 for 2001 the average annual score for federal agencies is 6898 employee satisfaction the initial coo greg woods believed that employees had become mechanical in dealing with the work they were performing he felt that many employees viewed their jobs as simply processing loan and grant papers rather than helping their customers realize their dreams after he developed mission statement we help put america through school he sought to ensure that all employees understood how their job contributed to the overall mission and became more dedicated to their work woods utilized fsas score from survey conducted by the national performance review fsa ranked 33 out of the 49 participating federal agencies in terms of how employees viewed the agency as benchmark to gauge the state of employee satisfaction when he arrived woods was the director of npr at the time the survey was conducted the npr survey also indicated that only 60 of fsa employees were satisfied with their jobs one out of four could not identify any of the organizations goals that related to satisfying customers and half of the respondents indicated that they needed more training9 one of the solutions fsa implemented to deal with the disconnect between employees understanding of hisher position and the agencys overall mission was the use of balanced scorecards balanced scorecards enable the agency to retain traditional measures of success such as reduction of costs and supplement them with nontraditional measures such as employee satisfaction fsas model consists of the original three measures of success customer satisfaction employee satisfaction and reduced unit costs added together the output is the performance score it is expected that by placing equal emphasis upon each measure all employees including senior managers will work to ensure success is achieved in all three areas in addition to emphasizing balance the scorecard also includes roster of the names of all persons working on particular project the scores they received in previous years on each of the measures and delineated list of all projects that the team is working on the scorecards are intended to provide concise and unambiguous measure of how the group is performing and how each employees work relates to the agencys mission in 2000 fsa began utilizing the gallup survey of workplace management instead of the previously used npr survey the last reported gallup survey score for 2001 was 374 out of possible 5 the private sector average is 36 reducing costs reducing costs is measure of performance that did not exist at fsa prior to the agency being designated as pbo as previously noted the financial aid programs have been listed on gaos list of high risk programs since 1990 one of the main reasons the programs have been included is due to the high 8 us department of education strategic and annual reports at httpwwwedgovabout reportsannualindexhtmlsrcln 9 brian friel great expectations govexeccom mar 1 2000 crs7 costs of administering the financial aid programs as noted by table 1 the administration costs have risen from 438 million in fy1992 to the current administrations fy2004 request for 947 million for further discussion see following section fsa has implemented several programs and procedures to assist with reducing costs and two in particular have received significant attention implementing webbased version of the free application for federal student aid fafsa and reducing the multiple technology information systems used to administer the financial aid programs table 1 student aid administration appropriations selected years dollars in 000s fy1992 fy1995 fy1998 fy2001 fy2004 student aid 43870 345660 578482 875634 947000 administration denotes presidents requested amount not the amount appropriated free application for federal student aid on the web students who are interested in applying for federal financial assistance and for many state forms of assistance must complete and submit the free application for federal student aid fafsa the fafsa can be submitted via webbased application paper form or electronically with the assistance of school financial aid administrator the information that students and parents provide on the fafsa is utilized to determine their eligibility for financial assistance10 in an effort to reduce the costs associated with administering federal financial aid programs webbased financial aid application was introduced the webbased application allows applicants to complete and submit their financial aid application online in addition the webbased application has internal endofentry data edits built into the application that eliminate many of the mistakes associated with the paper version the internal edit system prevents applicants from omitting essential information that is used in calculating the expected family contribution and reduces the possibility of entering illogical information for example if family has an adjusted gross income of 25000 it is not possible to have paid the same amount in taxes the internal edits force the applicant to resolve these inconsistencies prior to submitting the application as result ed spends less money processing multiple applications and returning applications due to errors in draft performance plan for fsa it was noted that electronic applications are as much as 25 times less likely to contain errors than paper applications11 10 for more information on the need analysis system used to calculate eligibility see crs report rl32083 federal student aid need analysis background and selected simplification issues by adam stoll and james b stedman 11 us department of education office of federal student aid the performance plan for student financial assistance at httpwwwedgovpdfdocs5yrbodypdf crs8 but the conversion to the webbased fafsa has not gone smoothly at the 2001 national association of student financial aid administrators annual conference the coo urged administrators to stop ordering so many paper applications and to instead direct their students to the internet greg woods stated that because colleges and universities continue to request the same quantities of paper applications as they had in previous years students are not being encouraged to use the webbased application this in turn prevents fsa from reducing the number of applications produced12 as result of this and other contributing factors such as increased student participation the costs of administering the financial aid programs have actually increased in 2002 report by gao13 fsas unit costs14 for fy1999 were 1872 per aid recipient and in fy2001 the most recent data available the unit cost increased to 1957 technology systems the addition of federal financial aid programs at different times produced multiple nonintegrated technology systems to operate the programs as well as multiple contractors to manage the systems because the systems are nonintegrated they cannot communicate with each other which requires fsa to access multiple systems to retrieve accurate information for each applicant and in many instances there is information redundancy this is also true for the institutions utilizing these systems institutions are often required to access multiple systems to enter and retrieve student financial aid data for one student in 1993 the national student loan data system nslds was developed as way to integrate these data and simplify the process however nslds functions as repository for each of the separate databases as opposed to one integrated database because the systems cannot communicate with each other each database must first be updated and then transferred to nslds and with different contractors and different scheduled database updates conflicting data are still possibility maintaining multiple systems with several contractors also significantly contributes to the costs of administering the financial aid programs rather than purchase one system that could manage all title iv programs an expensive alternative fsa opted to utilize middleware middleware is system that serves as conduit between multiple technology systems and enables them to communicate with each other if used in conjunction with webbased interface middleware presents the user with an integrated view one of the most important features of middleware is that data can be retrieved from multiple sources in timely manner fsas technology modernization effort has taken several steps to achieve full integration and interoperability of existing systems thus far the actual savings of these efforts has not been fully realized or reported15

as the amount of money spent on administering the financial aid programs divided by the number of recipients 15 for additional reading on middleware usage at fsa see general accounting office report student financial aid use of middleware for systems integration holds promise gao027 crs9 rewarding results the chief operating officer and the senior managers of fsa are authorized to receive bonuses for the achievement of the prespecified goals and objectives discussed earlier the coos bonus is based on the secretarys evaluation of hisher performance and cannot exceed 50 of the base salary for the position in addition the coos total annual compensation including the bonus cannot exceed the presidents salary currently 400000 senior level managers are also authorized to receive performance bonuses their total compensation including locality pay cannot exceed 125 of the maximum basic pay for members of the senior executive service currently base pay for es6 is 134000 the bonuses serve as an incentive for the coo and all senior managers to insure adequate progress for their respective goals and those of the pbo fsa as pbo 5 years later the office of federal student aid has functioned as pbo for 5 years during this period several issues have arisen regarding fsas pbo status this section presents brief discussion of selected program and policy matters policymaking and promulgation authority title i part d section 141b of the hea states that the secretary shall maintain responsibility for the development and promulgation of policy and regulations relating to the programs of student financial assistance under title iv this language has been interpreted to define fsas responsibilities as programmatic or operational and eds or more specifically opes as policy oriented in the early development stages of the pbo some concern was expressed that the delineated roles for the pbo and ope were being blurred16 offices such as guarantor and lender oversight service were moved to the pbo although these offices clearly dealt with policy and promulgation subsequently many of the offices were moved back to ope however few offices with policymaking and promulgation functions such as institutional eligibility remain in the pbo the advisory committee for student financial assistance acsfa contends that all policymaking functions should reside with ope in letter to senator kennedy january 10 2002 acsfa recommended that all policy functions should be returned to ope but that the assistant secretary of ope should consult with fsa to ensure that proposed policy decisions support the operations of the financial aid programs alternatively former secretary riley maintained that having the coo oversee interrelated tasks of student aid delivery such as program management and oversight enabled fsa to achieve aggressive performance standards17 16 letter from representatives goodling hoekstra and mckeon house education and the workforce committee to secretary of education riley dec 16 1998 17 letter from secretary riley to chairman goodling jan 12 1999 crs10 independence in 2001 the change in administration and the appointment of new secretary of education introduced the question of how much independence fsa possesses an article in the chronicle of higher education18 describes memorandum from education secretary paige to the coo of fsa that prohibits the office from awarding contracts in excess of 100000 or hiring seniorlevel employees and consultants without prior department approval section 141b4 grants the pbo independent control over its budget allocations and expenditures personnel decisions and processes procurement and other administrative functions however the pbo is also subject to the direction of the secretary to address the issue of independence former secretary riley drafted memorandum of understanding mou that articulated the specific functions the pbo would oversee in addition the mou details how the pbo interacts with other offices in ed for example because the coo has sole discretion over its personnel decisions subject to the direction of the secretary mou between the coo and secretary riley specified that fsa could hire needed personnel but must consult with the department about changes that impact eds collective bargaining agreement see footnote 13 according to the aforementioned gao report employees of both fsa and ed admitted that the absence of mou between the two under the current administration has presented struggle over the pbos independence and how it fits into the agencys structure fafsa on the web fsa promotes the usage of fafsa on the web as means of reducing the costs of administering the financial aid programs in addition because the webbased application provides an efficient and reliable way to complete and submit the financial aid application institutions and applicants are strongly encouraged to utilize the online application while the number of online filers continues to increase yearly there are still numerous families that do not have access to the internet in recent pew internet and american life survey april 2003 it was found that individuals with lower incomes and less education are still significantly less likely to use the internet students from families with lower incomes and less education are also more likely to need financial assistance to attend college the advisory committee on student financial assistance recommended that ed continue to make the paper fafsa available ed must continue to make the paper fafsa available in timely and efficient manner firstgeneration college students and their families may be uncomfortable completing the webbased form and prefer to complete the paper form19 the tension that the pbo confronts is between cost reduction and ensuring that the financial needs of lowincome students are addressed 18 rift emerges over independence of federal financialaid office oct 19 2001 19 letter from advisory committee
