eu while approving the eus request for tariffs the eu began to pha in tariffs on us goods in march 2004 in october 2004 congress pproved legislation pl 108357 that repealed eti while implementing mix of business tax benefits not explicitly related to exports while the eu lifted its tariffs it also lodged complaint with the wto objecting to the repeal legislations phase out provisions and in 2005

on the wtos dispute settlement process see crs report rs20088 dispute settlement in the world trade organization an overview by jeanne j grimmett provided tax incentive to export although its design was different in certain respects it was thought that tax incentive for ex ports was desirable to stimulate the us economy to offset the tax codes deferral benefit which posed an incentive for us firms serving foreign markets to produce overs eas rather than in the united states and to offset export benefits other countri were thought to give their firms1 disc soon encountered difficulties with the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt trade agreement to which the united states and most of its trading partners were signatories members of the europ ean community ec submitted complaint to the gatt council arguing that disc was an export subsidy and th erefore contravened gatt the united states however filed c ounterclaim holding th at the territorial income tax systems of france the netherlands and belgium themselves conferred export subsidies under territorial tax system nation does not tax the income of its corporations if that income is earned by branch located abroad gatt panel issued reports in 1976 finding that elements of both the territorial systems and disc constituted export subsidies prohibited under gatt in 1981 the gatt council adopted the panel s findings but with an understanding aimed at settling the dispute countries need not tax inco from economic processes that occur outside their borders territorial tax sy stems in other words do not by themselves contravene gatt the understanding also held however that arms length pricing2 must be used in applying the territorial syst em to exports nevert heless the controversy continued to simmer the united states never conceded that disc was subsidy but was concerned that the issue threatened brea kdown of the dispute resolution process to defuse the issue the us treasury propos ed the fsc provisions fsc was designed to conform to gatt by providing an export ta x benefit incorporating elements of the territorial tax system countenanced by the 1981 understanding although the united states does not operate territorial system it taxes uschartered corporations on their worldwide income it taxes foreign corporations only on their ussource income firms availed themselves of the fsc benefit by selling their exports through fscs that were required to be chartered offshore fsc eti and the world trade organization the european countries were not fully sa tisfied of fscs gattlegality still the controversy remained below the surface until november 1997 when the eu requested consultations with the united states over fsc thereby taking the prescribed first step in the dispute settlement process established under the new wto3 the united states and the eu held consultations without reaching solution and in july 1998 the eu took the next step in the wtoprescribed dispute resolution process by requesting panel to examine the issue the panel made its findings public on october 8 1999 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20746crs3 4 world trade organization united states tax

rl32066 taxes exports and international investment proposals in the 108th congress by david l brumbaughthe panel generally supported the eu holding that fsc was indeed prohibited export subsidy and that fsc violated s ubsidy obligations under the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures in particular article s 31 and 11 of the subsidies and countervailing measures scm agreement prohibit subsidies contingent on export performance and provide that subsidy exists if government revenue that is otherwise due is forgone or not collected nd benefit is thereby conferred the panel found that the fsc provisions carve d out particular exceptions to various parts of us tax law that would otherwise have generally resulted in taxation of the fsc export income4 the wtos appellate body esse ntially upheld the initial finding on appeal by the united states in the united states replacement legislation was developed to head off retaliatory measures its basic provisions received bipartisan support in congress and were supported by the administration the final version of legislation revampin g the tax benefit was passed by congress in november 2000 as hr 4986 the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act the president signed the bill and it became pl 106519 even before the eti provisions were passed the eu made known that it was skeptical of their wtocompatibility and maintained that like fsc they provide tax subsidy that is contingent on exporting5 the eu asked the wto to authorize imposition of 4 billion in tariffs on us products nd asked the wto to rule on whether the eti provisions are wtocompliant on august 20 2001 wto panel issued report concluding that the eti provisions vene the wto agreements the wto appellate body denied us appeal on august 30 wto arbitration panel authorized the eu to impose up to 4 billion of tariffs on us imports in the 107th congress chairman thomas of the house ways and means committee introduced hr 5095 which proposed both rep eal of eti and range of tax reductions for the overseas business operations of us firms but the bill was not taken up by the full house in the 108th congress representatives crane and rangel and senator hollings introduced bill hr 1769s 970 that woul d replace eti with tax benefit linked to domestic us production income rather than to foreign investment chairman thomas introduced hr 2896 which contains provisions similar to hr 5095 in the 107th congress but with the addition of several tax benefits for domestic investment along with the bills benefits for foreig n investment in october 2003 the senate finance committee approved s 1637 containing its own mix of benefits and the house ways and means committee approved hr 28966 congress did not act on the bills in 2003 but in may 2004 the senate approved an am ended version of s 1637 in the house representative thomas introduced modified eti bill as hr 4520 and the full house approved the measure in june conference committee version of the bill was approved in october for its part the eu indicated it would not apply tariffs as long as the united states made progress towards wtocompliance ho wever in november 2003 it set deadline of march 2004 and on march 1 be gan phasedin application of tariffs on us productshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20746crs4 7 for further information on the application of tariffs see crs report rs21742 european trade retaliation the fsceti case by raymond j ahearnthe tariffs began at an initial rate of 5 but were scheduled to increase by 1 each month for year reaching ceiling of 17 in march 20057 following enactment of us legislation phasing out eti the eu suspended its tariffs but also lodged new complaint with the wto objecting to the legislation s transition rules providing for twoyear phase out rather than immediate repeal of eti and to provisions allowing eti to apply to exports made under existing contracts on august 12 2005 wto panel ruled against the united states the united states app ealed the ruling but on february 13 2006 the wto appellate body upheld the pa nels ruling eu officials stated that tariffs would be reimposed beginning may 16 however on may 9 conference agreement on the tax increase prevention and rec onciliation act tipra pl 109222 included provision repealing part of the eti transition rules the eu did not reimpose its tariffs and the long dispute apparently came to an end how fsc worked in general the united states taxes corporations chartered in the united states on their worldwide income and ordinarily us corporation could expect to be taxed on its export income regardless of whether the inco were adjudged to have foreign or domestic source in contrast the united stat taxes corporations chartered abroad only on income from the conduct of us busine ss us firms used the fsc benefit by selling their exports through specially qualifie d subsidiary corporations fscs organized abroad as foreign corporations fscs would ordinarily be subject to us tax on the part of their export income determined to be from us sources however the fsc rules deem specified portion of fsc income not to be from the active conduct of us business and thus to be exempt from us tax the size of the fsc benefit resulted from rules governing how much of the fscs income was tax exempt and on the rules governing how the combined parentandfsc export income was allocated between the two as result of these rules firm could exem pt 15 30 of export income from taxes the fsc provisions and its successor are only one of two alternative tax benefits for exporting in the us tax code the second be nefit known variously as the sales source rule the inventory source rule or the export source rule permits export firms in some cases to exempt 50 of their export in come from us tax but its use is dependent on an exporter possessing surfeit of foreign tax credits generated by foreign taxes on nonexport income thus the sales source ru can be used only by firms that have foreign operations and income th at have borne foreign taxes the extraterritorial income exclusion the eti provisions provided ta x benefit of the same basi c magnitude as fsc firms can exempt between 15 and 30 of export income from tax using the eti provisions the eti provisions however went beyond fs c and also provided their 15 30 tax exemption to limited amount of income from foreign operations it was the extension of the exemption to foreignsource income th at was apparently desi gned to incorporate elements of territorial systems and on which the us officials based their belief in the provisions wtocompatibility the mechanics of eti provisions also differed fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20746crs5 fsc longer was an exporter required to sell through subsidiary to obtain tax benefit the eti benefit resulted from two rules one specifies the type of income to which its tax exemption applied the sec ond dictated the size of the applied tax exemption the provisions set the scope of taxfavored income by first stating that extraterritorial income was exempt from us tax and went on to define extraterritorial income as income from the sale of property that is sold for use outside the united states the provisions also stipulated that not more than 50 of th value of qualifying property could be attributable to articles produced ab road and foreign labor costs thus the amount of foreignsource income that qualif ied as extraterritori could exceed the amount of export income that qualified or vi ewed another way th eti benefit applied to firms exports and matching amount of its foreignproduced goods the provisions set the size of the tax exemption by specifying that only part of extraterritorial income is taxexempt the provisions set forth several rules that have the effect of limiting the exemption to between 15 and 30 of qualif ied income depending on the circumstances of the exporter the economics of fsc and the eti provisions both fsc and the eti provisions increased the after tax return of investment in the export sector and thus attracted investment to exporting as consequence us exports were probably higher than they would ve been without the provisions how much higher depends on the extent to which expor t supply increases in response to the tax benefit that is how much of the tax benefit us suppliers pass on to foreign consumers as lower prices and on how responsive fo reigners are to the reduced prices beyond this effect however traditional ec onomic theory indicates that the export benefits produced effects that are perhaps surprising to noneconomists first because of exchange rate adjustments the fscetiinduced increase in exports was diminished and us imports also were in creased sales of us import competing industries thus fell economic theory indicates that while the pr ovisions increased the overall level of us trade they did not change the balance of tr ade or reduce the us trade deficit the adjustments worked as follows the tax benefits increased foreign purchases of us exports but to buy the us products foreig ners require more dollars the increased demand for us dollars drove up the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets making us exports more expensive this partly offset the effect fsc and eti had in increasing us exports but also made imports to the united states cheaper which caused us imports to increase the result wa s higher level of both imports and exports but change in the balance of trade this result is better seen by stepping back from the exchange rate mechanisms and recognizing that when country runs trade deficit it is using more goods and services than it produ ces to do so it must necessarily borrow from abroad by importing more foreign investment than it exports countrys trade deficit in other words is mirrored by deficit on capital account and countrys trade balance changes only if the balance on capital account changes thus if we assume that the export benefits do not change the balan ce on capital account they cannot change the trade balance the export benefits also affected us economic welfare traditional economic analysis indicates that they reduced overall u s economic welfare because at least part of the tax benefit was passe d on to foreign consumers in the fo rm of lower prices this price reduction can be viewed as transfer of economic welfare from us taxpayers in generalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20746crs6 8 crs report rl30684 the foreign sales corporation fsc tax benefit for exporting wto issues and an economic analysis by david l brumbaugh to foreign consumers these effects howe ver were probably not large according to crs estimates based on 1996 data fsc increased the quantity of us exports by range of twotenths of 1 to fourtenths of 1 nd increased the quantity of imports by range of twotenths of 1 to thr eetenths of 1 the shift of economic welfare to foreign consumers is equal to an estimated onetenth of 1 of exports8 the impact on the trade balance was probably negligible the joint committee on taxation estimated etis cost in foregone tax revenue at 48 billion for fy2003 the eti provisions introduced new wrinkle to this economic analysis but probably not large one their extension to limited amount of foreignsource income probably provided tax incentive for some exporters to increase their overseas investment the size of this new incentive however was probably not large because of several factors first the amount of fore ignsource income that received the benefit is limited by firms exports second existing us tax law provided an alternative tax benefit for investing abroad in the form of an indefinite deferral of us tax on income reinvested abroad by foreign subsidiaries of us companies for some exporters this deferral benefit was probably larger than that available under the eti provisions if economic analysts are generally critical of tax benefits like fsc and eti support for them can be found in the business community reason for the divergence in views may be perspectives economic analysis looks at the benefits impact from the perspective of the economy as whole attempting to account for its full range of effects and adjustments in all markets supporters of the provisi on however are frequently businessmen whose exporting firms likely faced declining sale s profits and empl oyment upon elimination of the provisions for economists there is denying that fsc and eti boosted employment and increased incomes in certain sectors of the economy but they also resulted in contraction of othe r parts for example firms that compete with imports and transfered economic welfare to foreign consumers fsc and the eti provisions were also defe nded as counter to subsidies provided to foreign producers by their own governments purported subsidy that is sometimes cited is the practice among european and ot her countries of rebating the valueadded taxes vats that would otherwise apply to export sales however from an economic perspective such border adju stments do not distort trade and are in fact necessary if exported goods are to be part of the same re lative price structure as other goods in the importing country in addition us sales nd excise taxes do not apply to exports while european countries do not have formal system for forgiving corporate income tax on exports however under territorial tax syst ems lax administration of transfer pricing rules may result in export subsidies
