financing vehicles lessor unlike lender remains the owner of the asset and bears many of the risks associated with ownership in particular residual value risk in conventional lease lessee can acquire use of equipment without tying up its working capital or assuming equipment ownership and financial risks thes advantages by themselves may be significant for certain segments of the market such as startup businesses at the same time special tax benefits generated by leasing transactions often play an important role in selection of this financing technique in some transactions called leveraged

business practice3 lilos silos and qtes4 are special cases of leveraged leases but the treasury and some legislators view them as having undesi rable features that set them apart from other leveraged leases general idea behind leasing transactions with taxexempt entities how do silos lilos and qtes work and how do the participants benefit from them when forprofit corporation owns piece of equipment it may deduct its cost from taxable income over certain period of time depreciate it thereby reducing its tax liability similarly if the corporation rents the property instead of purchasing it it may be able to deduct the rental payments furthermore if the corporation takes out loan to finance the sale or lease it may be able to deduct the interest payments in contrast taxexempt or more preci sely taxindiffere nt entity cannot take advantage of any of these deductions because it does not owe any taxes in the first place5 thus the tax deductions are wasted without bringing any benefit to the equipment owner this situation creates an incentive for the transfer of tax benefits generally participants of li silos and qtes achieve such transfer when taxable participant becomes eligible to claim the tax deductions related to the equipment although the deta ils and legal environment ar somewhat different for each kind of transaction the benefits to the participants in these transactions come at least in part from the reduction in the present value of federal taxes paid by the taxable participant from an economic standpoint the deferral of taxes is equivalent to their reduction due to the time value of money the total benefit distributed between all participants is equal to the present value of the reduction of the tax due to the transactionrelated deductions less

treatment of leases provide desirable or necessary s upport for the leasing industry and does it constitute an optimal means of channeling federal aid to state and local governments and other taxexempt entities do the benefits to taxexempt and taxable participants of these transactions outweigh the revenue losses tax base erosion and the overall equity of the tax system in other words the question is where to draw the line separating allowable and abusive transactions brief overview of taxexempt leasing legislative and regulatory history congress has addressed the i ssues of leasing for taxbenefit transfer several times since 1981 before 1981 such transac tions were not allowed and leasing transactions had to satisfy special test designed to weed out the deals whose only purpose was tax reduction however in 1981 congress changed its stance and allowed such arrangements as part of the tax cuts for investments in the economic recovery tax act pl 9734 by adoption of the safeharbor leasing rules the intent of the measure was to encourage i nvestments by means of transferring tax benefits rather than to serve the purpose of determining which person is in substance the owner of the property10 the policy on the issue changed again year later with the passage of the tax equity and fiscal responsibility ac t of 1982 pl 97248 when congress concluded that it was necessary to reduce safeharbor leasing and ultimately to repeal it the principal considerations were the tax avoidance the adverse public reaction to the sale of tax benefits the revenue loss11 the 1982 law shut down such deals with certain exceptions afte r the end of 1983 and reduced the benefits available to participants in the meantime in 1984 the deficit reduction act pl 98369 addressed th leasingrelated issues again among other changes it adopted the socalled pickle rule12 the rule provides that the depreciati on deduction relating to propert leased to taxexempt entity socalled

has put on hold bout 15 deals that already were in the works which would have netted benefits of about 262 million to the transit agencies according to the apta23 the data on the transportationrelated tr ansactions volume and their benefit to localities appear to be bit inconsistent among themselves most sources estimate typical benefit to locality at about 48 and rarely as much as 10 of the transaction value the numbers in the pr evious paragraph imply an average benefit of 10 or more this inconsistency opens the possibility that either the volume of transactions is being underestimated

administration and the environmental protection agency for similar information27 leaseinleaseout transactions it is useful to consider the mechanisms of each type of leasing transaction separately beginning with the oldest of them almost extinct by now lease inleaseout in this case us taxpayer leases piece of property eg power plant traffic control system or railcars from tax indifferent party such as foreign municipality or taxexempt organization under headlease and simultaneously leases it back to the sa party under sublease or leaseback in practical terms the taxindifferent pa rty continues to use the property as it did before the transaction the us taxpayer meanwhile is able to defer its tax liability by deducting its rental payments amortizin g certain transaction costs and depending on its financing arrangement ducting any interest payments the irs believes that in the late 1990s there were hundreds of deals with billions of dollars at stake conducted by 56 customers with some taxpayers participating in as many as 30 to 60 deals28 according to some estimates during lilos heyday the volume of us leases to foreign entities increased from 3 billion to 20 b illion between 1994 and 199829 in 1999 the irs issued regulations and revenue ruling 9914 that effec tively stopped the practice of lilos30 on the other hand some transactions closed as recently as august 2002 while structured as silos for federal purposes were li for state income tax purposes31 consider an example assume that the us taxpayer is corporation x and the taxindifferent party is municipality fm32 x leases certain property from fm under headlease with 34 year term x immedi ately leases it back to fm under 20year sublease with buyback option the h eadlease requires x to make just twohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32479crs9 payments 89 million as prepayment in the beginning of the first year and postpayment at the end of the last year of the headlease fm would deposit most of the prepayment in separate account nd pledge it to x as security for the municipalitys obligations under the sublease the excess of the prepayment over the pledge constitutes fms fee for participation in this deal fms obligations under the lease and buy back option are completely covered by xs prepayment the sublease requires fm to make annual rental payments to x in equal installments the payments would come from the pledged part of the 89 million prepayment at the end of the sublease fm has an option to purchase from x the right to use the property for 14 year s that would still be remaining under the headlease at that time this buyback option s cost would be at or slightly above the fair market value of the headlease residual and also can be paid from the money received with xs prepayment x is relieved of its obligation to make the postpayment if fm chooses to buy back the headlease residual in reality fm always exercises its buyback option and the postpayment is never made the discrepancy in the timing of the payments between the headlease prepayment and regular sublease payments would allow x to defer its tax liability and generate net gain for x x woul d be able to amortize the first 89 million payment over the first six years of the l ease or about 15 million each year at the same time it would have to recognize revenues from the sublease but these revenues would be much smaller than 15 million thus xs taxable income becomes lower in the first six years and it can pay less in taxes in the later years x may not be able to offset the revenues from this deal and th erefore may have to pay higher taxes but because of the time value of money the present value of the deductions exceeds the present value of the rental income in reality the deals are usually more complex and generate additional tax savings for x for example x could fi nance its 89 million prepayment with loan from bank in this case x would deduct its interest expense in addition to the prepayment xs interest payments would be frequently set equa l to fms sublease rental payments x would thus be simply transferring funds from fm to the bank in addition x could get the loan from the same bank that fm would use to deposit the prepayment in this case the actual funds would never even leave the bank for the duration of the lilo finally both sides would sign an agreement as part of the contract to ensure that neither one of them becomes exposed to dditional risks throughout the transactions length in doing so the parties have to strike balance between limiting their exposure to risks on one hand and making sure the provisions do not disqualify the transaction as lease on the other under us legal doctrine the economic substance doctrine transaction is respected for federal tax purposes if there is genuine multipleparty transaction with economic substance which is compelled or encouraged by business or regulatory realities is imbued with taxindependent

rev rul 200269 modifying and superceding rev rul 9914meaningless labels attached33 there are number of factors to consider and the parties advisors try to ensure that the legal requirements are satisfied and the deal will pass regulatory muster nonetheless in 1999 the irs significan tly undermined lilos value as tax shield when it issued regulations that treat rent prepayment as loan34 additionally the irs has issued rulings cerning lilotype transactions where the agency disallows deductions for rent and interest due to the finding of lack of economic substance35 as result leaseinlease out transactions were largely discontinued and replaced with saleinleaseout deals silos sometimes referred to as saleleasebacks or saleservice contracts note of caution is in order there is set terminology and these rms do not always designate the type of transaction described below saleinleaseout transactions the parties to saleinleaseout transaction agree to either an outright sale by taxindifferent to taxable entity of piece of property or headlease for term exceeding the propertys useful life such lease would be considered sale for federal tax purposes taking this route helps to avoid the pure sale restrictions often imposed on municipal property the property is immediately leased back to its by now former taxindifferent owner f m for 12 to 20 years who continues to operate it the transactions are based on the same general idea of the tax benefits transfer as lilos but achieve it in somewhat different manner in silo the us taxpayer x can deduct depreciation rather than rental payments interest deductions would also be available to x just as in lilo deal as long as the sum of the depreciation and interest deductions exceeds rental income x receives net reduction in taxable income and pays lower income taxes the present value of the benefit to x is greater the sooner it receives the deductions relative to the rental income in return fm keeps an accommodation fee of 410 of the transaction value which may be implicitly included in the original purchase price or as rent reduction the exact fee value is dete rmined by the individual deal conditions such as an asset class and valu length each sides relative bargaining powers as well as the prevailing interest rates it is common for the transaction value to exceed the fair market value of the property making it even more attractive to the participants from the financial gain standpoint it is to xs benefit to deduc t as much of the depreciation as soon as possible however as noted above the pickle rule in irc 168g prevents accelerated deductions by requiring straight line depreciation over the longer of the propertys assigned cla ss life or 125 of the lease term including

setting the record straight tax notes april 12 2004 p 244contracts whose important role in the silos structure is discussed further in this section are included in the lease term36 this ambiguity means that the irs may have to make special determination in ev ery individual case which is not practical the contract includes special defeasance provisions requiring the parties to set aside cash or bonds sufficient to service th eir obligations typically fm would be required to pledge enough funds from an initial sale to meet its commitments under the lease usually fm wants to be sure that there is chance of losing the property upon the lease termination for example tr ansit authority would like to be certain that it never loses control over its railcars or ticketdispensing machines typical silo would include provision for fm to have an option to buy the property at fixed price at the end of the lease the funds sufficient to exercise it also have to be set aside at the beginning of the deal on the other hand x is interested in shie lding itself from any risks related to the property ownership after the lease expires so the silo would include service contract provisions to protect xs intere sts at the time of the lease termination usually the provisions stipulate that fm has to find service contractor to take over the management of the property and is required to buy the property if such contractor is not found this arrangemen t ensures that if for some reason the property declines in value fm cannot simp ly walk away from it leaving x with all the burdens of ownership presence of the defeasance provisions is one of the controversial features of the silos the opponents of the practice point to it as one of the indicators of the circular nature of these deals in their view the provisions eliminate default risks for the lessor one of the determinants of tr ansactions economic substance to counter that the advocates point out that similar arrangements are present in many other business transactions for example when one of the parties has poor credit and their mere presence does not automatically rid the transactions of their economic substance37 it might appear more logical to have simple mandatory buyback clause at the leases end instead of combination of the buyback option and service contract provisions however the mandatory buyb ack provision would vi olate the genuine ownership doctrine and indicate that fm rath er then x is the true owner of the property for tax purposes entitled to the deductions this would make the silo pointless thus the service contract rrangement becomes very convenient as an alternative to the mandatory buyback and at the same time as an incentive for fm to reacquire the property without slow ing down the deprecia tion deductions under the pickle rule in the words of one expert us lessors enter into these transactions with the understanding that to be entitled to the tax tr eatment that is an

qualified technological equipment qualified technological quipment leases qtes are essentially silos for special equipment classes defined in the internal revenue c ode section 168i2 computer hightechnology telephone and dical equipment this equipment is explicitly exempt from the pickle rule and can be depreciated over five years much faster than most other types of equi pment the rationale behind this exclusion was the relatively short useful lives of ma ny types of technological equipment but it also made this equipment prime property for leasing purposes this is one of the reasons why the qtes appear to be the fastest growing segment of the market today another reason for qtes growth is technological change which broadens classes of eligible equipment as computers become an integral part of what previously was lowtech infrastructure the assets become eligible for the qtes the leasing industry is very enthusiastic about these developmen ts and is constantly searching for new qteeligible asset classes39 although the internal revenue code s distinguished qualified technological equipment since 1984 qtes were relatively rare occurrence til recently according to some sources the first qtes appeared in 199540 u s t r n s i t authorities completed the first domestic qte leases in 2002 for rail signaling control and communication equipment according

ually very large in terms of underlying asset values th ey normally run in hundreds of million dollars and some may exceed 1 billion43 financiers say first time entrants to the qte market should be looking at deal s of 150 million or higher even though commercial banks have been known to consid er deals as small as 50 million44 there are indications that since publication of th quoted article small value deals became more common possibly because the costs of arranging an individual transaction decreased as the practice became more popular some examples included deals as small as 2 million although this is probably an exception45 the leases normally extend for more than 16 years and require asset lives of over 20 years which is one of th major barriers to their growth46 for instance mri equipment satisfies the definition of the qualified technological equipment but the assets five year useful life makes qte deal uneconomical47 on the other hand new potential asset classes include

the bush administration proposal mentioned in an earlier section of this report the most important exception was the effective date of sec 476 limiting the allowable deduction it specified that the

ealing with service contracts would be effective for leases entered into after december 31 2003 the final engrossed language of s 1637 was different from the reported versions sec 472 and sec 476 the repor ted version did not apply to qtes and transactions with foreign nongovernment entities on the other hand it did not contain the five conditions of the admin istrations proposal that would exempt certain transactions from the limitations of the bill there were also differences in effective dates the revenue estimates reflected the evolution of the measure the administration initially estima
