operationsthe nato operation in bosnia and the coalition operation in southwest asiabeginning in fy1996 has not resolved the problem because changes in the plans for those operations have required the administration to draw on funds planned for other activities supplemental appropriations which require recission of previouslyapproved funding if they are not to increase the budget continue to play large part in funding these operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98823congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congressreceived through the crs web98823 f updated march 29 1999 military contingency funding for bosnia southwest asia and other operations questions and answers nina m serafino specialist in international security affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary for several years members of congress have been concerned by the strains tha t military contingency operations have placed on the us armed services and the departmen t of defense budget because the costs of such missions rarely are funded in advance problems arise when funds must be shifted from training maintenance or weapon s modernization to cover their costs the administration has proposed mechanisms that would ease the strain but congress has re jected them as an unacceptable curtailment of congress influence over such operations congress unprecedented funding i n the annual budget of one or both of the current large scale ongoing operations the nat operation in bosnia nd the coalition operation in southwest asia since fy1996 has not resolved the problem because changes in the plans for those operations have required the administration to draw on funds planned for other activities supplementa l appropriations which require recission of previouslyapproved funding if they are not to increase the budget continue to play large part in funding these operations as can be seen from the discussion on page 4 and the charts on page 5 page 6 details the incrementa l costs of us military contingency operations from fy1991fy1999 in chart prepared by stephen daggett specialist in national defense foreign affairs nd national defense division this report will be updated as needed q what costs do peacekeeping and other contingency operations entail and how are they funded department of defense dod annual appropriations contain funding for norma l peacetime operating expenses funds for other operations ie contingency operations normally are not budgeted in advance for the past several years congress has appropriate d some 4050 million per year in fense funds that the military can use for small disaster relief efforts however largescale natural disasters and other contingencies to which the military responds with humanitarian assistance nd peacekeeping operations can easily run into hundreds of millions of dollars httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98823crs2 reprogrammings between accounts require the consent of the house and senate armed services1 committees and the appropriations defense subcommittees transfers of more than 10 millio n within accounts require dod notification to those committees through the fy1996 dod authorization act pl 104106 of february 1996 congress attempted to tighten control over contingency ope rations by specifying the amount of funds and the accounts from which they could be transferred to cover contingen cy operations proponents viewed this funding method as one means to protect training and maintenance accounts and to enhance congressional control over peacekeeping expenditures the administration however opposed it as an unw arranted restriction of the presidents national security and foreign polic prerogatives this provision was not renewed in subsequent dod legislationsuch contingency operations almost always entail extra costs for operations an d maintenance for personnel and for equipment these are known as incremental costs ie costs over normal peacetime operating expenses incremental operations an d maintenance costs include fuel and supplies used in such operations beyond amounts normall used in training and other regular deployments and additional maintenance required becaus of longer or more difficult operations incremen tal personnel costs include hazardous duty pay special pay for overseas deployments or pay of reserve personnel called to act ive duty incremental equipment costs include replacements for weapons losses beyond norma l peacetime losses and higher than usual consumption of ammunition or other materiel incremental costs sometimes can be difficult to ascertain because of us budget laws the executive usually must find funds elsewhere in the defense budget to cover at least temporarily these incremental costs or seek additional funding from congress incremental costs are normally financed in three ways 1 dod can absorb the costs in its regular accounts by transferring fund s budgeted for other purposes within the personnel or the operation and maintenan ce om account to cover the costs of contingencies 2 dod can transfer money between accounts eg personne l procurement om and research development test and evaluation in an action known as reprogramming with congressional approval as necessary1 3 congress can approve supplemental appropriations these can be new appropriation s or offset by rescissions in other dod accounts q what problems ensue from funding contingency operations in this manner when incremental costs are low funds can be transferred or reprogrammed without unduly disturbing other spending plans when these costs are high however th administration and congress are faced with difficult choices absorbing funds within om accounts can mean canceling previously planned traini ng and maintenance activities and sometime disrupting the previously planned budget by cutting other accounts r increasing the deficit the problem of maintaining budget stability is exacerbated when incremental costs start or result in unanticipated costs l ate in the fiscal year particularly the fourth quarter then even moderate costs can be particularly disruptive tw accounts troop training and maintenance and repair are the main sources of unobligated funds to cover suc h costs late in the fiscal year thus training activities and maintenance must be canceled rathe r than just postpo ned until supplemental appropriations become available to cover costs in order to provide f unds for peacekeeping operations this can create another problem anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98823crs3 the most recent precedent for funding an ongoing contingency operation through annua l2 appropriations was for the vietnam war when funding was provided through supplemental and annual appropriations in the late 1960s and through annual appropriations in the early 1970s the administration proposed that the first gci account for fy1994 contain 448 million with3 300 million of that intended for peac ekeeping that amount was relatively small when compared to the cost of contingency operations in fy1994 and subsequent years immediate deterioration in military readiness ie the militarys ability to respond rapidly to threats to the nation covering the costs of contingency operations has also disrupted the procurement budge t in recent years many of the recissions made in the defense budget for recen t supplemental appropriations were t aken from funds intended to modernize weapons systems this has led many defense analysts and policymakers to express concerns about future readiness q what mechanism has congress adopted to cope with this problem the first session of the 104th congress took an unusual step by providing funding in advance for ongoing operations in southwest asia swa ie in and around iraq in the dod fy1996 appropriations bill pl 104 61 these funds were to be made available2 after costs were detailed in the fy1997 budget request subsequent ses sions of congress have followed this precedent for swa operations in fy1997f y1999 and for fy1997 fy1998 operations in and around exyugoslavia ie mainly the nato operation in bosnia congress set aside funding in the annual appropriations measures in an oversea s contingency operations transfer fund ocotf the administration must advise the appropriate congressional committees of any overall redistribution of funds amon g contingencies that differs from the original distribution plan despite this mechanism which congress may chose to use an administration still may have to seek dditional funds if circumstances change in fy1997 and fy1998 the clinton administration had to request supplemental appropriations for both ongoin g operations for bosnia where the annual appropriations had only covered part of the fiscal year in fy1997 and fy 1998 supplemental funds were needed to cover extensions in the us commitmen t of forces in swa additional funds were needed for an unanticipated troop buildup in fy1999 congress was willing to set asi funds for swa anticipated costs through this mechanism but dec ided to fund all anticipated bosnia costs through an emergency supplemental appropriation q what mechanisms had the clinton administration proposed to fu nd contingency operations such as peacekeeping before congress approved the creation of the ocotf the administration had propose d two alterna tives for contingency funding congress rejected both in 1993 the clinton administration proposed setting up global cooperative initiatives gci account to be used to fund the costs of vari ety of dod missions which might arise during the year including peacekeeping disaster relief humanitarian assistance and promoting democracy3 in 1995 the administration pr oposed fy1996 budget request to address the socalled fourthquarter problem through the creation of readiness preserva tion authority thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98823crs4 the supplemental apppropriations measures were4 for fy1992 dire emergency supplemental appropriations act 1992 pl 102368 for fy1993 supplemental appropriations act of 1993 pl 10350 for fy1994 emergency supplemental appropriations for fy1994 pl 103211 for fy1995 emergency

emergency supplemental appropriations act for fy1998 pl 105174 and for fy1999 omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental approp riations act for fy1999 pl 105277would have enabled dod to obligate during the last half of fiscal year funds for essential readiness activities without prior appropriation up to certain limit q why did congress reject these proposals congressional opposition to the gci proposal centered on the checks and balances of interag ency and interbranch prerogatives many members were not willing to create blank check special fund enabling the pres ident to deploy troops in as yet unspecified and undetermined military operations thus potentially depriving congress of one means of control over the timing and purposes of new peacekeeping operations also stat department and foreign affairs policymakers objected to establishing special dod accoun t that would i n effect erode state department powers the 104 congress rejected th eth readiness preservation act for similar reasons many judged that it would lessen what leverage the congress has over peacekeeping operations through the appropriations process q how are ongoing operations in bosnia and in southwest
