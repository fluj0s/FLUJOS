r3m current rundown by steps lecture given on 26 february 1963 well how are you tonight this i think is the 26th of february ad 13 and saint hill special briefing course lecture all right the subject of this subject matter is very important to you weve always had very precise technology leaving as little as possible to chance in processing but frankly with the advent of routine 3m you move into new level of precision this is the type of precision that if you dont do it you get involved more than you possibly could imagine all youve got to do is do this wrong and it is longer precise therefore dont go plowing ahead with it until you can do it right the other part of it is is of course if you dont do it you wont learn how to do it theres the old gag you know about my little boy jimmy cant go swimming till he learns how and im afraid thats the case here well the place to learn listing is in 212 and the place to learn auditing is in an academy and the place to learn the finishing touches of auditing is the saint hill special briefing course once youve been over those jumps why you should be able to do 3m without too much trouble but in actual fact routine 3m is going to be done on an awful lot of people and by an awful lot of people and that means that you are going to be involved actually in straightening out lot of cases so all you have to know to straighten out case in actual fact is where wasnt routine 3m done now right now i sympathize with you youve been doing routine 3m up until this time without an immediate step rundown of routine 3m and thats arduous thats probably very difficult probably nothing more difficult than picking your information from several different bulletins and sources the rules of 12a as far as listing are concerned apply to routine 3m and all the material has already been released it has not however been assembled with tremendous precision until this exact moment and we have hco bulletin of 22 february ad 13 which is routine 3m brief rundown by steps as the first actual bulletin of this thisll be in your hands shortly but theyou notice that 23 februarywell thatspardon 22 february you notice that that is few days ago this is the 26th and it seldom takes that long to write bulletin but in this particular case ive been going over this thing and throwing away all of the nonessentials youll be quite interested how very simple in actual fact that routine 3m turns out to be it is only your idea of how complicated you ought to get that will keep you from doing 3m in actual fact the more figurefigure you do and the more figuring you do and the more worryworry and this sort of thing you do the less 3m youre going to get done 3m will not compromise with the exact precise following of its steps theres compromise for this and when you dont follow its steps you start to worry now 3m is very rapid process and the only time that youll find that it becomes lengthy process is when you have not done it and when you havent done it it will become very lengthy i have already seen whole session devoted to straightening up one goof where in actual fact you should have been ablein that sessionyou should havethe auditor should have been able to find 3 or 4 ris actually the whole session was just burned up with one goof didnt do what it was supposed to have done and then therefore it was worry goof upset and so forth well the way not to worry with thisbecause worry is something that will go along with thisthe way not to worry with this is to know it and you do have these steps on hcob 22 february and there will be much more information out on this but in actual fact id like to impress upon you that most of this other information is just in the line of keeping you from worrying ill give you piece of information that isnt in this bulletin so you can get the level of magnitude although the pc has represented rocket reading item while listing although the pc has done this the appearance still of two rocket reading items on the list or two rsing items on the list means the list is incomplete now thats something you might worry about dont you see you say well theresthere is big bad man and very terrible man and the pc is trying to get across concept there and when it was listed why big bad man read and then immediately very terrible man it also rocket read and its quite obvious there that he had the concept of vicious being and he has given two titles to it now you go back to nulling see thats all righttwo rocket readsall the rocket reads you want on listing youthat you see going down on your meter i mean thats the point but now youre nulling now you come to this item big bad man and it goes pshewwrocket reads and then you check it terrible man you see that was the nexttothelast item they lay both together the next tothelast rocket reading item you read that it goes psheww and then you get your next item very terrible man and you say well theres something wrong here but of course that actually is represent of one for the other so you say to yourself well its all right so you read very terrible man and it goes psheww and the pc says well theyre both the same item and you buy this youll notice that it is variation and difference from your bulletin it says there mustnt be two rocket reading items on the list now ive actually seen this and ive actually tested it and if two variations of the same item read the list is incomplete in other words the rule does not get jumped the only thing that gets jumped there is you figureyou figure yourself into hole well actually there arent any of these figurefigures to be done and thats one of the first things id like to impress on you there arent any to be done you say all right well he said big bad man and then of course he had this concept of this person he said very terrible man so therefore if he said big bad man and then very terrible man they of course would both rocket read and when i read these two then that of course is an exception to the rule it isnt it isnt an exception to the rule see thats howhow bound in concrete this is and thats why i made my opening remarksyouve been used to precision but youve been used to exceptions to the rule and there arent any exceptions to these rules something very fantastic has happened here we actually have the total anatomy of the gpm we have its frequency we know what its supposed to do and what itwhat it isnt supposed to do and routine 3m just parallels it just like that goes right straight down if it doesnt work just like that youve goofed thats all youve done something in 3m that is wrong you go back and you look at it youll find out what it is you didnt take the tone arm action out of the list who or what would oppose catfish thats all and there was wild tone arm action there and you didnt complete the list and you go over the list and you find that the third rocket reading item from the end is the item and it goes psheww and it was the third from the end well thats variation from the rules and you say well i got rocket reading item so i went ahead and used it and then you find out about two items later the whole basket folds up thats it its gone you havent got any rocket reading ris and you list the list and nothing reads and you extend the list and nothing reads and you sweat and swear and go into nervous prostration and have to get processed for ulcers and what have you got well you just havent done it by the rules so the rules dont apply in fact nothing applies in fact its case of why did you ever get up that morning because you actually will spend now the time spent on 3m is when you havent done it right and then you will find well this week well try to get the pc straightened out and we will prepcheck and we will do this and that and we will do another big goals oppose and we will do this and the pc is still arc broke and we cant get anything much to read lets do something new yeah lets lets now find another goal letlets go back to 212 letlets do something else something new letlets be wonderful lets invent something new letslets run him on ow on mouse we had mouse at some time thats the way not to do it you just go back and you find out where 3m jumped the rails and you pick it up at that point and you put it back on the rails and it then will run and the only thing that happens is the frequency of the bank gets upset whereas your twentyfive item plus see doesnt work every now and then from here on through that particular gpmitll fortunately only last that one gpmyou will confidently complete list to twentyfive items beyond the last rr or rs and ta action you get it all complete and you read the last rock slamming item you read the next to the last rocket reading item you read the rocket reading item huh and it doesnt fire and you read the one above it and it doesnt fire and you read the one below it and it doesnt fire oh my god what have i done well dont blow your brains out you made mistake someplace up the line earlier which you have corrected but now the frequency is thrown out and your whole action as it tells you in this bulletinwhen that sort of thing happens you go back and make sure that something wasnt opposed backwards thats your first step and make sure that it wasnt the item above it and the item below it and two above it and two below itthats item not rocket reading itemmake sure that you didnt goof there make sure it doesnt exist on there between that one that didnt read that was supposed to and the end of the list you can do all those things but theres test that gets you out of this read the item youre listing from and if it gives the faintest tick your list is not complete its all taken care of in here if you just do it right you get the idea you get the idea thats the only thing thatll happen it wont upset the frequency of the bank to the point where its longer the last rocket reading item you know itsalways goes on being the last rocket reading item that you saw while listing its just that it shook things up and the pc now has to list further you dont now add fifty on it or something stupid like that you just have to cope with this in other words thats the only thing that goes wrong another ruleanother rule that goes throughout thisits also stated in this bulletinis when youve got your hands on an ri you keep going if youve got an ri you keep going now strangely enough that doesnt mean an ri that came from list where five ris came from you understand that means an actual ri gotten by the rules youve got this thing firing i dont care whether it was goals oppose or otherwise youve got this thing going youve got it going well there it is it came up properly it checks out it gives you nice rocket read bang use it as long as youve got one of those things dont go getting one from the goal you understand now you know what happens youve got beautiful ri and it goes psheww every time and you say well i dont know i just dont know it just came up terminal when it should have come up an oppterm and figure figure yourself to death see youve already goofed someplace or another and then you upset the frequency of the bank the other thing that upsets when you get the frequency is you sometimes start getting terminals when you should get oppterms and so forth that doesnt matter you just go on and test them and use them each ri that comes up can be terminal or an oppterm you always have to test it it isnt how it was listed it was how it tested always so you say well thatthat isnt so good as matter of fact i got cable this morning from somebody who just left here and he got out to very far place and he sent cable this morning and he said i have just done goals oppose list on certain pc and the goals oppose list came out and the rocket read was only half an inch long so i think its best that i go back and do another goals oppose list well you know what hell get from new goalsthat old goals oppose list if he does another one he may or may not get the one that comes up next he will get fundamental and you probably could do goals oppose and get the item and the next goals oppose and get the next item and another goals oppose and get the next item and another goals oppose and get but how tough do you want to make it because you see the item can appear anyplace on goals oppose list and only appears as the last rocket reading item on an ri list goals oppose lists take longer in addition to that it might not join up and if it didnt join up huhhuhhuhhuh youre left there with two rocket reading reliable items well now the bestlaid auditors can make themselves sick gasping and so forth worrying about all this the point is what do you do well im afraid you take the biggest rocket read that you can get at any time you understand when you make choice choose it by the length of the rocket read you will make these goofs they will occur thats sure whats inexcusable is not knowing when you have goofed and in not doing something about it to straighten it out so you do wind up with two ris letsheres one way to get them this was done on by accident one way to get two ris is you get right down to the endthe goal is to catch catfishand the last terminal that you get from the pc is the goal to catch catfish and the oppterm is catfish and the pc says but thats it thats it as matter of fact if you happen to be looking at your meter if you had looked at your meter that session you would see the thing swinging with free needle might only be free for moment but it would have been free and there it would be weird phenomena free needle and he says the goal to catch catfish would oppose catchingno catfish yeah perfect youve already gotten about twenty items on this you see its never the first two you got about twenty items the pc says thats it its blown itseverythings disappeared all these catfishcant smell thing everything is beautiful i mean imfeels wonderful and you say well im not sure just to make sure i better oppose this big beautiful ri i still have an ri on catfish its not mistake its not mistake because nothing bad will happen so you say catfish and you test it out and you make it just exactly what it is and you make it just exactly its an oppterm and you say all right were going to list now who or what would oppose catwho or what would catfish opposeoppose catfish excuse nice oppterm we list this who or what would oppose catfish and we go on down the line pocketa pocketapocketa pc says some new mass is coming in well look doesnt say anything about it in here so you just keep going its all right so mass comes in its perfectly all right do it every time who or what would oppose catfish and who or what would oppose catfish is the right line and you land with aa horseshoe curve and you say what happened horseshoe curve well dont worry yourself to death youve got the basic rule the fundamental rule is when youve got an ri you determine if its terminal or an oppterm and you oppose it so you determine this thing horseshoe curve you determine that that happens to be aits another oppterm and you say who or what would oppose horseshoe curve and you come up with blinking millionaire where the hell are these catfish not fish market in any direction pc smells different everythings different well the rules say go on and oppose it so you say blinking millionaire all right and it happens to be terminal so who or what would blinking millionaire oppose and it winds up with the whole wide world boy you never could have gotten further from catfish and you say to yourself oh my god look what ive done i mean i had free needle had free needle and i didnt prepcheck it i didnt do anything at all and i didnt straighten it out and i had firstgoal clear and hes gone anand now ive got this other thing and i dont know what its all about and i dont know where ive gone and what its done and in this bulletin it saysit says it says uh well something in here someplace must cover the thing golly when the needle goes free just tell the pc and keep going dont bother with prepcheck just keep doing steps 8 to 13 as long as you can but realize that you are probably nowyou are probably now on new goal channel when you have 2 or more ris that the pc knows by step 13 above do not fit the old goal do brief new goals list for an rr goal oh yeah well all right uhhaha ooooh you say all right the pcsthe pcs been sitting thereand he doesnt know about this you knowand you say whatwhatwhat goal do those fit and the pcthis is how fast this takes this is ten or fifteen minute step see you say what goal does that fit and he says oh to be rich to have lot of money to be broke to have nothing pshseww you say thats it thank you very much to have nothing to have nothing to have nothing psheww psheww psheww so you take that down and you right away put it down quick on the auditors report and go right on with that next ri you understand and its as easy as that you can just work yourself to death you can just worry yourself to death with this stuff it looks terribly complicated look dont kid yourself you do it wrong and not follow this bulletin youre not only going to worry yourself to death youre going to cost the pc his next two hundred trillion see hes going to slog along in the horrible mess that hes in now but as far as thats concerned if you do it right its just bangbangbang and dont godont go finding things to worry about now lets examine why why auditors and even people you know by the way by the way do you know we had some staff members here the other day administrative staff members who were trying to rejoin the human race can you imagine it as if theyd have them you know pretty wild and they said in view of the fact that the administrative scientologist is not professional auditor but only scientologist why i think we ought to be permitted to do simple process you know i received the shock of my life thats the first time i ever heard that scientologist could exist that wasnt an auditor real scientologist or somebody who had an hpa or an hca that didnt consider himself capable of handling processes he wanted simple process well this is simple process this is very simple process thats all right wellwell cut this out of the tape after this lecture and so forth so it wont go all over the world i was ashamed of it myself you know i was ashamed of it iactually prepchecking is difficult compared to this now lookahere pc has got bank first we called it the reactive mind then we found the anatomy of this reactive mind its the gpm its whole sequence of gpms which make up ze grande gpm each one of those things is fundamentally founded on goal and theyre conglomeration of identities which are counteropposed and these identities are hung up on the postulatecounterpostulate of problem and theyre hung up with great delicacy actually theyre killing the pc but theyre hung up with great delicacy in two hundred trillion years hes had very finite number of these things hang up they arent an infinite number theyre very finite some kind of wild guesstimate of the number of rocket reading reliable items to be found in the first and second goal seventyseventy ris wow thats not very many but thats because its only this accidental hangup that gives him this fantastic charge between one and the other thats what youre trying to take apart i dont care whether you are doing general ow or the cchs or prepchecking or anything else youre trying to take the charge off of the case and as long as that charge stays there that case is going to go wog and it is simply that charge it isnt the knowingness of the pc it isnt how the pc makes up his mind it isnt the new postulates the pc recovers it isnt this it isnt that it isnt anything all it is is get the charge off between those two what happens theyre carefully balanced postulatecounterpostulate actioncounteraction masscounter mass there they arecrush and they hold this tremendous quantity of mass in suspension and you discharge that read between them by finding them and opposing them and finding new one and opposing it and finding new one and opposing it thats the whole action and this charge will go posheww and it can longer maintain itself its impossible itd take him another two hundred trillion years to stack it up again and lets hope after hes been scientologist hed be smart enough not to lets hope he runs out his overts well what happens its just that mechanism in the bank heres goal and this gives him something to do and he becomes rrruph to do it and the rrruph is opposed to this over here but then this rraaha that opposes him over here demands that he become wikk and then the wikk of course to get on in life finds itself very involved with splat and there we are bangbang its got spiral staircase he lives from one type of identity to the next trying to achieve this goal and trying to get rid of its opposition thats all hes doing now look if you had it on the clock how long ittaken to make that explanation to you that is all there is you understand now out of this comes fantastic complexity fantastic out of this we get locks and we get engrams and we get secondaries and we get the emotional tone scale and we get this and we get that and we get the service facsimile and we get everything that we have ever had out of that mechanism where it pertains to aberration the other directionlike the philadelphia lectures the examination of thetan back in 52 postulates counteror just postulates the anatomy of thetan as thetan just you know thats him what he can do what he consists of thats truth that isnt aberration but as far as weve handled mechanisms of aberration were still talking about the gpm and were just talking about this charge item item brrhuhthe charge one to the other oddly enough you dont have to do single thing to them you dont have to run their withholds off against each other you dont have to do this you dont have to do that all youve got to do is get the charge off it psheww theres the charge when youve got it off the meter and its listed down those things cant stay together anymore and you find the pcs longer interested in them he cognites and theyre gone it isnt the cognition that makes them gone its the fact that you blew the charge its all it is its totally mechanical operation its very interesting to the pc he comes up with all kinds of phenomena in fact an auditor if he sat and went through the phenomena the pc comes up with could practically go blahw he could go mad trying to catch up with these phenomena because its fantastic quantities of phenomena but what hes trying to do is just get the charge off between item and item b item c item d item opposes item f item f is opposed by item g so on and so on and so on and so on its the number of items you get and they very mechanically surrender one hundred percent surrender through routine 3m now you list pc too long without finding his goal and hes going to start getting uncomfortable hes going to wonder what has blinking millionaire got to do with horseshoe curve what does this refer to he has point of referral oddly enough although it pesters him and it upsets him you possibly could go fifteen twenty thirty items ri to ri to ri to ri hed be more and more upset you understand and his mass wouldnt be asising well and youd have more trouble with it without knowing his goal and all of sudden he says aaaaahh he says to have nothing and you say whats that well thats the goal thatsthats the goal of all thisto have nothing so all right and youll see that you have been building little bit of mass on the tone arm and this will now drop off youre operating without the goal builds up mass because if you know the goal of course it helps asis the mass but what youre into here is an action which is tremendously repetitive in its action you do this and you do this and you do this now as you as you look this thing over you say well there must be more to it than that and thats one of your downfalls there isnt more to it than that there are certain rules of auditing and there are certain best ways to do it and there are some opinions about whether the auditor should smile graciously as he receives an item or smile grimly if he sees an item or not smile youll find schools developing along the line but actually it doesnt matter so theres lot of figurefigure here that doesnt matter now why does an auditor do more than hes called on to do well im afraid that he has tendency being human for while here short time you want to take last look at being human by the way id take good look at being human id go out and be human for little while you wont get chance very shortly and whats he doing well let tell you law the physical universe is built on games condition and the optimum game in the physical universe is described by exactly these rules minimum ease of entrance followed by maximum involvement that are the two steps of game thats the physical universe idea of game that now that isnt the ideas of game in scientology im just telling you how the physical universe treats this thing in other words if you have something thats trouble to enter trouble at all to enter and youve gotyouve got with this difficulty of entrance you9ve got an immediate involvement which becomes more and more and more and more involved and theres just way of getting out of it and eventually you look around and its justwere all locked in here and theres doors theres chicken that theya guinea hen out in the midwest that they used to capture because the chicken never looked down and you could get it to pick corn off the ground right in through tunnel and as long as you had box there that had hole for them to walk in at the bottom the guinea hen would never walk back out the hole again because theyre just built that way thats total mest universe bird the bird would just look up after that and be trapped and you reach in through the hole and pick out the guinea hen you see that bird had been too well educated the bird itself was cooperating with the involvement now these are just two steps thats the only requisite to successful quote miest universe game unquote thats totally successful you just have something that takes trouble at all to enter and gives maximum continuing involvement after its been entered which has end product and youve got it now i was talking to reg the other day hementioned this to him and he says huh he says well he says theres good example of that he says fellow stops on the street and looks in the window of store and if that window is just all kinds of stuff piled all over the window everything going up this way the guys sunk of course its terrific involvement of his attention he walks in some other store tiffanys something like that why theres single pearl sitting on an ocean of black velvet and you never find anybody stopping and if they do stop they say isnt that nice and walk on tiffanys involvement has to do with are you member of the four hundred can you afford to pay far more than you should pay the involvement is is your credit good enough you see all of those those are all involvements but they use different type of involvement than some merchandising house that is chain store macys or something like thatyou go by the window and heres some babys pants and down here is hot water bottle and then theres machine gun peeking out from underneath pair of lacetrimmed pedal pushers you know and theres beach ball over there in the corner and so forth and back of the beach ball are live alligators and isnt that intriguing you see and the guy looks the next thing you know hes walking into macys see theres difficulty in stopping in front of the window and he gets maximal involvement in the thing get the idea well these are the rules by which you havecan measure any continuing game that is purely mest universe game income tax the ease with which governments entered in upon income tax i swear theres probably slightest difficulty where it began which is in karl marxs from each according to his ability to pay to each according to his need that was the marxian rule of taxation which has been written in all through the west now about 1909 1 think it was and i swear ithe probably had difficulty whatsoever writing those words he wrote them in german difficulty there wasnt the slightest difficulty writing them he probably threw himself off another bowl of hashish or whatever he used to do and wrote those words there was difficulty there there was difficulty reading those words finally lot of people say oh thatsthats very easy theres nothing to that and they amended few constitutions and passed some laws and the years went along and you had this thing called income tax and everybody gotstarted to get poorer because you didnt dare make profit because youd pay it out in tax andand then the government started hiring more and more people and more and more people theyfinally they got one income tax collector per citizen which was the optimum ratio and then they finally involved in income increment of increase profits return thats filed in addition to form 6892bhup and then that of course has to be filed only by the professional accountant the unprofessional accountant files 168244ump thats the form he files you see only that has to be then refiled because it is always kept on the other file and finally do you know nobody can pay an income tax they talk about tax evasion it isnt tax evasion its just impossible to pay an income tax you say impossible you say its easy you go down and pay an income tax if you work nine till five and have your pay deducted by your employer hes got all the difficulty if you yourself are making your own coffee c s and the government cant put the bee on some employer or something like that youre in trouble the whole way you talk about involvement now just try and walk down to an income tax office and say heres my income tax give quitclaim for all taxes if you did that youd probably precipitate complete investigation of your affairs going back to why your grandmother had to marry and it just is impossible you pay tax of this year therefore youve got to pay next year another type of tax but more tax because you paid the tax this year and so on you finallyguys get so desperate they cant pay the tax dont you see its all total involvement so then they start tax evasion because if they pay the tax then theyre hooked not just hooked but you cant pay the tax so they had better evade not tax paying but tax collection and theyre evading an involvement of tax collection you see that idea now you look over any one of these corny games that has gone on and on and you say isnt the world mad you know the world has gone utterly mad the world hasnt gone utterly mad the world has gone utterly mest universe and the lower on the scale thetan gets the more he starts approximating the laws of the mest universe thatsyou can count on that the more he acts like the laws of mest and the only time youre going to get anything done with anybody as thetan and so forth is somebody who still has some section that doesnt act according to the laws of mest he can still think mest does not think but this law of involvement is definitely there and it waits as trap for the unwary auditor and hes liable to follow it unconsciously and unknowingly he is liable to follow it the ease of entrance you know get any old goal the pcs apparently happy everything is fine and then you get any old goal and you list this goal and you list the goal on down its perfectly easy for the pc to have sat there in the chair you see and then the auditor unconsciously starts following dramatization of the law of involvement and he just starts throwing new things into the session you see its anything but this goals list see he didnt really check out the goal he didnt do this he didnt do that hes involvingit was very easy for him to become involved its very easy for the pc to become involved so this will become more and more involved and the immediate impulse of the auditor is to do something new and more involved you understand that thats mest characteristic of game becomes more involved and more involved and more involved and more involved and we go on and on and on and youll find out that very bad auditor whos pretty mesty will just keep involving the pc more deeply every time he does something wrong he will do something else that is new and do something wrong with it and then do something else that is new and then do something wrong with it and then do something else that is new and do something wrong you get the involvement and the next thing you know the pc is going ohhhowwww fortunately for us 3m is sufficiently strong that all you have to do is go back and take the earliest step of 3m that was donewhich is probably in this case as i was just describing to you goals listget that list listed down properly and do it right and all the liability comes off it supposing you had the pcs right goal and got wrong item off the source list because somebody was real knucklehead and so forth you only have to find the right item off that i dont care if 3m was done for seventyfive consecutive hours by complete knucklehead that wrapped the pc around not only telephone poles but fireplugswe dont care about that you go right back to the earliest wrong area that you can find and work out in that area3m wherever you can get into that area and get the proper 3m action the rest of it straightens out because weve whipped this game of the mest universe but theres still to some degree here and there more frequently than you would believe at first glance going to be some impulse to just involve the pc more deeply you see that youjust dramatization you understand youll see somebody sitting down and the person just isnt thinking right and they just will think in the direction of deeper involvement not straightening out anything lets just do something new lets just do something different lets just do something wrong lets do this and that involves the pc more and more deeply and more and more deeply and more and more deeply and more and more deeply and it involves the auditor in more and more worry and more and more worry and more and more worry and eventually the pcs running fever of 190 and the auditor is running ulcers that are foot in diameter and so on thatsjust recognize it just recognize it youve taken very powerful technique which is addressed to an individual and youve followed the mest universe curve of game which is ease of entrance and increasing involvement the thing to do is go back and put 3m on the road now 3m at first glance appears to go along this line and thats fooler and thats why its going to be very successful its very easy to start it you just say to somebody whats your goal ohho whats my goal oh boy oh gee you know and hell answer one of the ways of involving him is get him all interested in what his goal is and then write out 8642 goals and get whole long overlisted listthe tone arms long time been stuck on the goals list and so forth and then get him all blah and so on and then lose the goals list dont expect to say youre good boy if you do that dont expect to do anything about that but swear 1 by the way have recovered several languages in which to swear so you better bewatch out anyhow the crux of the situation is that as you go along this line there appears to be deeper and deeper and deeper involvement yeah the pc is getting good and involved and you can start worrying about how deeply the pc is involved while the case is running perfectly all right now get that see theres the other danger see not only can the case run all wrong and the auditor sit there with total complacency but you can get reverse of this of the case is running beautifully youre getting ris the pcs going oh my god you know ahhh what terrible mass that is you know and then he gets another ri and so on and he changes his mind about it and he goes on and hes getting lighter colored and that sort of thing but the tone arm starts going up ohoho ohooooo ohooooo the tone arms oh its up to 50 5 0 and the blowdown on the new ri was only to 475 oooooooh oh god andandandand the new rias we list the thing the tone arm goes to 575 oh god so we go on here and weve got blowdown to 56 ahhhhhhh this is something to worry about see you look at the pc pcs all right hes going along quite hap but look at that tone arm man and we get the next item and it goes to 575 and theres tone arm action at all ahhhh andandand we get only blowdown of 56 say anything about it in here then what you worrying for you understand what you worrying for it says blowdown when you get the ri how much is blowdown well its as much as blowdown is how long is piece of string let tell you something this is pure phenomena you dont need it desperately but itll keep you from worrying most of the stuff you see released now will just be in the direction of keeping you from worrying because i know what youwhat youll worry about everyevery single one of these gpms goes cycle every single one of them goes cycle the pc starts in down here and he usually rides around 325 and its perfectly all right he goes up and he gets little bit of 375 and it blows back to 325 and then your next couple three four ri lists that you get the thing has been going up to 40 and has been blowing down to 35 and you get couple of more and it goes up to 50 and it blows down to 45 and then it will go up to 5 0 and it will blow down to 3 to 47 5 and itll go up to 5 0 and itll blow down to 35 and then it will go up up up up upup to 475 and itll blow down to 325 and then the next rithree or fouryou get it will go up to 425 and itll blow down to 20 and then it will come up here and as you list go up to 325 and then blow down to 30 and then it goes up to 375 as you list and then when you find that ri it blows down to 30 and then it sits there and you list and it sits at 30 and it blows down to 30 from 30 and you say god im not getting any blowdown therestheres one you could worry about you know its just sitting on clear read and im not getting blowdown and the needleoh god go up to the d of t oh my god do youdo youdoi cant read the needle now it just keeps going floppityfloppityflop from one side to the other cant read it cant even get the rudiments in on the pc and all the pc does is sit there and grin hmmm youll do it youyoull say to this girl or something look you cleared him oh so she says thats fine so she gets into the next gpm see same cycle repeats the tone arm goes up and it blows down and it goes up higher and it blows down less and it goes up higher and it blows down less and it goes up higher goes up higher and even higher than youve seen it before i dont know and then finally blows down and then starts to blow down closer and closer to clear read item after item behavior in other words theres point in any gpm where youve got high stuck mean tone arm that doesnt blow down much what you worrying for its just phenomena youre going to sweat yourself to death on lot of things you say this pcthis pcs eyes black black black you know oh my god the pcs eyes are black every morning shed come in black black black as the ace of spades every morning by god i found out she was using mascara honest she cant run out mascara until the persons fourth or fifthgoal clear youre going to find all kinds of things to worry about but ill tell you what youd better worry about ill tell you what youd better worry about and this is fact you better worry about doing departure from these brief rundown by step rules thats what you worry about worry about departing from that and when you do something and it doesnt come out with this result then youve goofed how do you know you have departed from the brief rundown by steps routine 3mor any other concise 3m bulletin as they come out along the line therell be more of them issued they will be lengthier more concise theyll be this theyll be that theyll be the other thing how would we know now that we have departed well it didnt come out right so wed better go back and find out what isnt being done and where wasnt it done first and get it done there first and then we find out that what weve just done wrong will come out right pc can take quite beating now theres one other piece of phenomena that i can give you that will save you lot of worry when you first find the pcs goal and you do source list all this business about the pc turning black or something like that or getting offcolored if something is wrong is violated by that original step when you get pcs goal when you get pcs goal and that pc is listed out on source list all the way through dont be very amazed if the pc gets black because most of them will the gpm is moving out of them and their skin tone goes awfully sooty ive seen it now case after case what you start worrying about as you find ri after ri they arent getting any lighter there must be something wrong there so you go back and find your brief rundown by steps look it over and find out where you where you departed from this line and you generally will find that you didnt pick the right ri off their four rocket reading items on the source list all rocket reading source list incomplete there are various conditions theres the condition of overlisting oh you can be complete idiot on overlisting you can list ninety pages when you should have listed ten you just list the list list is as long as it should be and how long should list be well actually you ought to get ta motion and thats relative statementbut ta motion and fifty items beyond that and fifty items beyond the last rs on the list or rr on the list whichever is last youll find out that that is how long list is and your item will be on it there are two types of lists one of the things you havent looked at yetthere are two types of lists in 3m and in 212 there are two types of list one is the goal oppose list or the source list and that has entirely different rules of operation and mechanics and then theres the ri oppose list which is the reliable item list and that has different mechanics and youll find out in the brief rundown by steps that steps 1 to 7 of this 3m step rundown are devoted to source list and handling of source lists and getting the thing started and steps 8 to 13 are totally dedicated to an ri list theyre two different types of list they behave differently all you have to know is the behavior for each one there arent lot of randomities going to jump up and put them in the face ive been auditing and getting audited and doing research auditing and watching folders here and working and working and working with this for very very long time and i had terrible time whipping up enough constants there had to be enough constants so there wouldnt be lot of variables and fortunately i found these constants and put them down here and be guided by the constants not how variable they get out around the perimeter and you will do fine now youve only got one clearing procedure and i wish you had eight or nine or ten but in actual fact theres only one and that is 3m and it doesnt have very many steps this thing has only got fifteen steps probably the absolute rules of one kind or another boil down to being less than twenty something like that theyre very few bank behavior is very constant its not actually very much to learn the thing that you want is familiarity the thing that you want is confidence the thing that you want is to know that is the way it is and see it in front of you operating that way and know that you can pull it off thats the main thing you need and im afraid an auditor has to go through all of these steps of the horrors of it all and worry and chew his fingernails to the elbow and give it all up and try to blow the brains out and just this oh you know because its just all too difficult and i had an auditor left hereyou remember irene she wrote from perth i got the letter today and shes had cognition for all of her training three years of very hard intensive auditing shes had cognition that its very simple activity and the more simply you do it the more results you get and the less complication you add into it why the better it is and its taken her three years and shes now cognited more or lessi think that was the paraphrase of it anywaythat auditing is simple activity now now shes already done the cognition it isnt necessary for you to cognite just know it realize its simple and youve got it made and youll make clears now what you want out of this is clear what you want out of this is to be clear what i want out of this is for you to be clear and for you to make clears we can do that it just all depends on your constancy carrying forward the ethical approachif something reads it reads and if it doesnt read it doesnt readand youll produce them the technology is there youre there lets get the show on the road and realize that when you get pc involvedi already know the mest rule of games which is easy entrance and deep involvement remember i already know that so ill be looking at you but basically what i want to look at is the number of clears you make and i want you so clear that when they tap you on the shoulder you just ring for hours okay thats it thank you very much good night
