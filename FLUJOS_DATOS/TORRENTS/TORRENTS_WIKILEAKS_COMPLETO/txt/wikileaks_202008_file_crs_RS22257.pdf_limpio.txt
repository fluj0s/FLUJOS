industry division updated september 13 2005 abstract hurricane katrina damaged the nations leading gateway for the import and export of many bulk materials in addition to oil and gas suppliers grain producers and the steel chemical and rubber industries are highly reliant on the ports along the lower mississippi river while commercial shipping has been restored on very limited basis it is still uncertain when the region will be able to return to normal shipping operations obstacles to full operation include lack of power displaced port workers missing channel buoys and submerged debris in some ship channels with the exception of one gulf port most ports suﬀered only minor damage to their terminal equipment the extent of the damage how soon normal port operations can resume and which shippers in particular will have the hardest time adapting should the disruption continue for an extended period are of signiﬁcant interest to congress because these ports potentially aﬀect the trade of 33 states that depend on the mississippi river and its tributaries for shippinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs222571 for more specific information on hurricane ka trinas affects on oil and gas supply see

disruptions john frittelli specialist in transportation resources science and industry division summary hurricane katrina damaged the nations leading gateway for the import and export of many bulk materials in addition to oil and gas suppliers grain producers and the steel chemical and rubber industries are hi ghly reliant on the ports along the lower mississippi river while commercial shipping has been restored on very limited basis it is still uncertain when the region will be able to return to normal shipping operations obstacles to full operation include lack of power displaced port workers missing channel buoys and submerged debris in some ship channels with the exception of one gulf port most ports ffered only minor damage to their terminal equipment the extent of the damage how soon normal port operati ons can resume and which shippers in particular will have the hardest time adapting should the disruption continue for an extended period are of significant interest to congress because these ports potentially affect the trade of 33 stat that depend on the mississippi river and its tributaries for shipping introduction the port of new orleans and its neighbors ju st upriver the port of south louisiana and the port of baton rouge are unique because they c onnect with the nations most extensive and heavily used inland waterway system for the transport of bulk materials the mississippi river oil and gas1 grain steel chemicals and other primary products are transferred between ships and barges at these three ports damage caused by hurricane katrina has temporarily disrupted operations at these ports the critical questions are how long will shipping be disrupted what are the obstacles to resuming normal operations which economic sectors w ill be most affected if the disruption to shipping continues for an extended periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22257crs2 2 for the latest information on the condition of th ports mentioned in this report as well as all other ports in the central gulf region see h ttp wwwaapaportsorg nd click on hurricane katrina port updates 3 the ndrf is fleet of militarily useful ships usually used to support the us armed forces in time of war or national emergency this is the first time that these ships have been activated to assist in recovery from domestic disasterdamage assessments ports three of louisianas ports on the wer mississippi river rank in the top ten in terms of total tonnage handled at us ts the port of baton rouge and the port of south louisiana between baton rouge and new orleans on the mississippi river suffered minimal structural damage both ports report that their grain elevators and other cargo handling structures are intact both ts are key to grain exporters and petroleum importers the port of sout h louisiana also handles impor ted aluminum ores and exports of lime timber sugar cane cotton rice and re sins the port of baton rouge additionally handles forest products steel products che micals and molasses the port of new orleans reports that while it has been damaged the port is workable all four of its container gantry cranes are intact but two are not operational because of damage to electrical components some warehouses have sections of roof missing but are useable while repairs are made the port handles containerized fre ight imported coffee rubber metals cotton and oil among other commodities all three lower mississippi river ports are currently handling ships carrying relief supplies the port of new orleans be gan limited commercial car go handling on monday september 12th the ports president is hoping that the port will be operating at 50 of normal operations by the end of the month and back to full operations within six months the port of gulfport mississippi suffere d direct hit from the hurricane and has the severest structural damage gulfport is leading gate way for containerized imported fruit and vegetables from latin america it will have to be completely rebuilt the ports of mobile alabama and pa scagoula mississippi experienced some damage to port buildings but their infrastructure is basically intact the port of mobile exports forest products imports iron ore nd transfers coal and petroleum products in both directions the port of pascagoula handles steel refrigerated meat and wood products among other commodities2 power and workers with the exception of gulfport which took direct hit from the hurricane the greatest impediment to the other ports operations may be the lack of power and the fact that many of their workers are without housing the maritime administration has mobilized seven ships from the national defense reserve fleet ndrf to assist the ports3 three of the ships will be us ed to provide temporary housing for port and petroleum industry workers one ship already stationed in new orleans is being used as the headquarters for port of ne w orleans staff and the remaining ships are designed to provide cargo handling capabilities in damaged ports shipping channels up to the port of baton rouge the mississippi river is dredged to accommodate oceangoing ships with 48foot draft

september 7 2005 p4rouge the river accommodates barge transport with 12foot draft the downriver mississippi shipping channel is currently open to twoway traffic but restricted to vessels with up to 39foot draft reportedly there may be over 100 vessels of varying types submerged in the river there are two unknow n obstructions in the channel towards the mouth of the river which is the reason for the current limit on vessel draft of 39feet the channel is open only during daylight hours becau many of the channel signal buoys are missing or displaced ships normally trans it the channel on 24hour basis the coast guard is in the process of replacing repair ing or repositioning navigational aids on the channels the coast guard the army corps of engineers and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration are surveying ship channels for potential shoaling and underwater debris until the channel surveyin g is complete and obstructions are removed ships are proceeding at minimum speeds from baton rouge to new orleans the shipping channel extends about 172 miles from new orleans to the gulf of mexico the channel is about 70 miles long the channel to the port of mobile is only slightly limited as to draft but nighttime traffic is suspended because channel markings are not in place the port of pascagoula reports that it has experienced only minimal shoaling in its channel4 truck routes key truck links to the ports in the region are damaged interstate 10 across lake pontchartrain is severely damaged as is the causeway across the lake in mississippi bridges on i10 and us 90 are demolished railroads new orleans is an important ra il hub because like other cities in the middle of the country memphis st louis and chicago it is an interchange point between the western and eastern rail networks all five major u s railroads and one canadian owned railroad ve tracks running into new orleans therefore new orleans is not merely an origin or destinati on point for rail cargo but also an interchange point for eastwest cargo passing through new orleans railroads with track coming into new orleans from the west union pacific bnsf and kansas city southern and from the north canadian national have reportedly suffered little damage5 however railroads with track coming from the east suffered considerable damage norfolk southern has replaced its track on bridge over lake ponchartrain the bridge was not damaged but the track was washed off the brid ge by the hurricane and one of its railyards in new orleans was flooded csx suffered the most severe damage csx lost track and bridges that run parallel to us highway 90 along the gulf coast and its railyard in new orleans was flooded due to the damage of track east of new orleans rail cargo normally interchanged in new

further information on the hurricanes impact on us agriculture see crs report rl33075 us agriculture after hurricane katrina status and issuescargoes will be easier to reroute than others bulk cargoes are more heavily dependent on the lower mississippi river ports than other cargo types bulk commodities are closely tied to the lower mississippi river ports because these ports are set up for barge to ship transfer nonbulk commodities which more often move by rail and truck to make port connections can more easily find feasible alternative because rail and highway connections are common at most majo r ports including neighboring ports in the gulf region dry bulk cargo in addition to energy imports much of the concern surrounding the potential impacts of hurricane katrina on sh ipping centers on the export of bulk grain bulk grain exports are particularly depende nt on the ports of south louisiana baton rouge and new orleans these ports serve as the primary transfer point from barges to ships for exported grains carried by barg down the mississippi river from areas of production in the midwest if the louisiana ports are not able to operate at full capacity in the coming weeks some of this cargo may be diverted to other markets that do not utilize these ports for example some pr oduct could be moved by rail from the upper midwest to ports in the pacific northwest to great lakes ports or ports on the east coast but at significantly greater cost porti on of the product could also move by rail to texas gulf ports or to mexico and canada another possibility is that greater portion of the product may be sold domestically at re duced prices however it is improbable for number of reasons that these alternatives w ould be able to absorb anything approaching the volumes that would otherw ise be handled by the louisiana ports first these alternative routes are traditionally used mostly by farmers located farther from the mississippi river and its tributar ies second while railroads ar an alternative they are more costly than barges railroads also do not have the capability to suddenly handle substantial amount of additiona l agricultural cargo for the large export shipment sizes carried by barges trucking is not practical alternative limited alternatives for grain exporters may mean that the most attractive option in the short term is to hold their product until further information on th ports availability is known getting the ports and the river channel back into service quickly are critical for the export of bulk grain the wheat harvest has already begun but much of this product is shipped by rail to ports in the pacific northwest normally at this time of year grain elevators are shipping out the remainder of last years crop in order to empty their elevators in anticipation of this years harvest hurricane katrina has delayed this process the peak of the corn and soybean harvest begins in late september so the potential impact of hurricane katrina will depend on how quickly the ports and ship channels on the lower mississippi can return to normal operating tempo the upper mississippi river and st lawrence seaway are cl osed to navigation in the winter if it is matter of few days before the ports are at full operating capacity it may not significantly impact the grain markets but if it is matter of few weeks it will have significant impact6 in addition to grain products other bulk cargoes heavily dependent on the lower mississippi river ports are coal chemicals fertilizer cement scrap metal and coffee httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22257crs5 7 figures on the economic impact of the port of new orleans are available at httpwwwportnocomcontainer and breakbulk cargo relative to bulk cargo containerized and breakbulk cargo may more readily find altern ative shipping routes marine containers carry wide variety of goods but imports nd to be dominated by consumer goods and manufacturing parts marine container is about the size of truck semitrailer break bulk is cargo that can not fit in containe r so it is handled on pallets slings or in individual pieces examples in clude steel products rubber c onstruction materials large machinery and forest products because the port of new orleans is the closest to the gulf of mexico of the three lower mississippi ports it is the prefe rred port for container steamship lines gulfport mississippi is also container port that handles bananas and other perishable goods however due to th relatively easier transf erability of containers among ship rail and truck mode s it is less problematic to find alternatives routes for containerized cargo in addition container sh ips and breakbulk ships to lesser degree tend to call at more than one port within co astal region therefore the solution to port closure is usually to divert the cargo to th next closest port on the schedule eg houston or florida port however this option w ill add costs to the freight movement because it most likely entails longer inland connection conclusion mississippi river commerce and the th ree southern louisiana ports are interdependent as are the port of new or leans and the city of new orleans 2001 study of the economic impact of the port of new orleans on the state of louisiana amounted to 107000 jobs and 134 billion in annual spending7 port disruptions may include much higher shipping costs as well as transport capacity shortages in terms of grain exports the economic impact will depend on how quickly vessel traffic can resume key factors appear to be how quickly the coast guard and army corps of engineers can restore th shipping channels to full capacity and how quickly the ports can restore power and mobilize their workforce at the same time port traffic is likely to rapidly increase as ne w orleans begins to rebuild
