protect the us tax court as provided for in sec 104 of the bill he expressed concern that usms resources to protect the federal judiciary could be strained if funds were not provided for this purpose and suggested that usms protective services for th us tax court be reimbursed by that court he further suggested if the committee believes it is necessary to provide expanded protection to the us tax court we respec tfully request that the provision be more narrowly tailored replacing the phrase any ot her court with us tax court as so amended in the senate bill s 378 also on be half of the conference judge sentelle stated opposition to provision sec 504 to amend the federal magistrates act by mandating that senior judges have the right to vote on candidates for magistrate judge positions along with active district judges of the court becaus such change would unduly restrict the flexibility of district courts in this area see httpjudiciaryhousegovmediapdfsse ntelle070503pdf

strides in consultation between usms and the conference had been made with regard to the installa tion of home detection systems in judges homes but that such consultation needed to be formalized in

information usms provided to the author on february 19 2008 via electronic communication3 usms national institute on judicial security to provide court professionals with education and technical assistance78 concluding observations in the two years following the chicago and atlanta murders federal and state officials raised concerns about judicial security and several proposals for improvement were considered or dopted the judicial conference made recommendations and took actions to enhance security for court fac ilities and provide offsite protection for judges legislation was enacted providing funds to usms for the installation of intrusion detection syst ems in the homes of federal judges who requested them in november 2007 in stallation of all these systems was completed79 the house and senate judiciary co mmittees have conducted hearings both houses introduced and passed gislation to improve overall federal judicial security the president signed the court security improvement act of 2007 bill into law pl110177 as congress conti nues to consider efforts to enhance judicial security by authorizing programs appropriating funds and conducting oversight the following are some of the issues congress might choose to address resources and staffing budget requests for the federal judiciary and usms would provide funding staff and resources to maintain and enhance the security of the judiciary even if th budget requests are fully funded subsequent events eg possible gaps in security reveal ed later in the event of further tragedies or acrosstheboard reductions in spending may lead some to suggest the need for additional funds or staff congress may consider whether continuing resolutions could lead to funding delays and aff ect implementation of needed security enhancements any potential changes in fps funding and jurisdiction for the security functions it provides to the j udiciary may have short and longterm administrative staffing and other implica tions for the judiciary usms and fps consultation nd coordination as evidenced by testimony presented at congressional hearings there have been l ongstanding questions raised about the degree and quality of communications between the principal entities charged with protecting the judiciary provisions in both house and senate bills now enacted discussed in this report call for usms to consult on continuing basis with the judicial conference of the united states there is however requirement in the law that formal report be submitted to congress on actions taken on such consultation both directors of aousc and usms have been in their positions for over year and the new leadership app ears to have created potential opportunities for enhancing judiciaryusms consultati on and coordination issues concerning adequate fps protective services for the perimeter of judicial facilities are also ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33464crs25 concern that may require continued c oordination and comm unication or other remedies the 18month pilot program for usms to assume security functions from fps at selected courthouses will begin late r in the year following the pilot an evaluation of the program will be submitted to congress consideration may be given to an informal or formal evaluati on of the pilot at midpoint to determine whether adjustments if any are needed federal and state collaboration as noted in this report there have been several instances of fede ral and state courts collaborating and communicating to address judicial security issues build ing on those relationships perhaps through partnerships to establish national clear ing house on judicial security information might help to enhance security at the both the national and state levels the sharing of information and resources eg either through technolog ical means or at regularly scheduled seminars involving fe deral and state officials and others might also prove more costeffective than less collaborative relationship the establishment of the national center on judicial security may provide more opportunities for collaboration on various levels to enhance judicial security continued focus and oversight the challenge to federal and state officials is continuing to ma ke judicial security issues priority generally after tragic events such as the murders in chicago and atlanta and the shooting in reno immediate efforts are taken to address the issue as time elapses however the momentum generated in the aftermath of those tragedies is often difficult to sustain therefore continued congressiona l oversight and legislative action may be critical factor to enhance the security of the judiciary and to build on the progress that has been madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33464crs26 80 however hr 4472 the childrens safety and violent crime reduction act was ultimately passed and signed into law without the court security provisions of hr
