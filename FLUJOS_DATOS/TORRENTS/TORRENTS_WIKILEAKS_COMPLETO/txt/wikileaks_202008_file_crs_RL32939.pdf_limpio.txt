summary future 911 systems will use internet prot ocols ip to fac ilitate inte roperability and system resilience and to provide better connections between 911 call centers emergency responders and aler t and warning systems mo re robust capacity and the flexibility to receive calls for help in any format the national emergency number association nena began planning fo r these changes under the banner of next generation 911 or ng911 in 2000 s upport for ng911 with its emphasis on ip protocols to provide interoperability and redundancy now comes from broad base that includes public sa fety associations state nd local 911 managers industry the congressional e911 ca ucus and the department of transportation dot among dots contributions to ng911 is the funding and supervision of six pilots to test key components of ng911 with public safety answer ing points psaps psaps are the call centers that receive and direct the response to 911 calls three major bills supporting improvement s in the handling of 911 emergency calls have become law the wireless communications nd public safety act of 1999 pl 10681 the enhance 911 act of 2004 pl 108494 and the new and emerging technologies 911 net 911 improvement act of 2008 pl 110283 passed as hr 3403 as amended from the perspective of national policy an important provision of the 2008 law is the requirement for the preparation of national plan for migrating to an emergenc network using intern et protocols ip the plan is to be prepared by the 911 implementation coor dination office created to meet requirements of the enhance 911 act provisions in other recently enacted laws have also contributed to th growing base of legislation in support of 911 the value of this base may be diminished however unless additional measures are taken to assure an ongoing national policy the ng911 project sponsored by dot is expected to end by early 2009 the e911 implementation coordination office is scheduled to terminate on ptember 30 2009 although the national plan is likely to be completed by septembe r 2009 this would leave time to implement recommendations many other goals set for the office by congress will likely also not be met if the e911 implementation coordination office and dot programs are not extended or replaced the only federal agency with role in implementing national policies to improve 911 system s and services will be the federal communications commission fcc the f cc has so far used its powers primarily to regulate wireless carriers and more recently voip service providers with requirements for provi sion of 911 connecti ons it is the e911 implementation coordination office that cong ress has charged with the responsibility of developing national policy and planning for psaps the national plan could provide the framework for deploying ng911 and fo r other policy decisions congress may choose to revisit policy questions and suppor t for 911 to assure that 911 systems and networks are upgraded to

see crs report rl33747 emergency communications legislation implications for the 110th congress by linda k moore 4 pl 10681 wireless communications and public safety act of 1999an emergency communications safety net integrating 911 and other services there is growing realization among public safety officials policy makers and others that 911 services could be part of larger solution for emergency communications that links citizens with fi rst responders and with emergency services such as hospitals through an interconnected system of communications networks and call centers 911 networks might be part of nationw ide capacity that provides communications interoperability they might be linked to other networks that also receive citizenactivated calls for help or assistance they could also be incorporated into emergency alert broadcasts proposal s for how to provide fully integrated emergency response system have not crystallized into consensus the 911 commission report recommended that 911 call centers also called public safety answering points or psaps be include d in planning for emergency responses1 congress which has since 1999 passed two b ills to further the deployment of 911 is reviewing ways to expand 911 capab ilities and make it mo re accessible and effective congress is also evaluating ways to improve emergency alerts2 and interoperable communicati ons for public safety3 operational convergence of emergency communications seems to many to be inevitable question of when not if this report deals primarily with 911 and its recent history it discusses the existing situation of 911s capacity to re spond in emergencies some proposals to improve the system and recent legislative activity proposals include better connections between 911 call centers nd emergency responders building more robust capacity incorporating internet protoc ols developing the capacity for backup call centers after disasters have occurre d and coordinating 911 with other types of call centers such as the 211 centers that provide municipal services 911 legislation and regulation to facilitate the effort to provide comprehensive 911 services nationwide congress in 1999 passed the 911 act4 which mandated 911 as the emergency number nationwide and made numerous pr ovisions for its implementation among other provisions the law requires the federal communications

study the hatfield report delays and complications in implementing we911 prompted the fcc to commission study to examine the state of 911 capacity in general and th cause of problems with wireless 911 in particular report on tec hnical and operational issues impacting the provision of wireless enhanced 911 services known as the hatfield repor t was submitted to the fcc on october 15 20029 the author dale n hatfield formerly chief office of engineering and technology at the fcc was assisted in his research by staff in the fccs commercial wireless division of the wireless telecommunications bureau as its title indicates the repor ts focus is primarily on technical and operational issues observations in the report that later became the basis for congressional initiatives included the critical nature of location information in enhanced 911 in supporting first responders in emergencies the seriously antiquated cond ition of the infrastructure that underlies 911 for both wireline nd wireless emergency calls the need for national 911 office to act as champion at the federal level hatfield report update in 2005 dale hatfield began followup study on 911 topics which was discontinued in 2006 on april 10 2007 mr hatfield testified regarding the work he had begun for the fcc10 he provided five preliminary conclusions that would have been part of the report if it had been completed

an industry group11 the enhance 911 act congress responded to the issues raised in the hatfield report and by the 911 commission and others with the nhance 911 act of 2004 pl 108494 it created e911 implementati on coordination office within the federal government it also addressed number of concerns that had been raised about the deployment of 911 including compliance coverage in rura l areas and the use of fees levied by states and localities to help cover the cost of providing 911 services the act designated the director of the nationa l telecommunications and information administration ntia and the administrator of national highway traffic safety as coadministrators of an e911 implem entation coordination office once the office was established the coadministrators were required to report to congress annually on activities to impr ove coordination and comm unication with respect to the implementation of e911 services authorizations of up to 250 million annually for program activitie s and grants were established for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 with authority for authoriza tions set to expire on october 1 2009 leadership in its 1996 blueprint for implementing we911 the fcc noted that introducing the service nationwide w ould require coordina tion and cooperation with state and local governments and othe r stakeholders the fcc nonetheless has limited its leadership role to encouraging states and communities to work together in developing coordinated plans for we911 charged in the 911 act to take positive steps to address the impleme ntation of 911

be addressed by the e911 implementation coordination office or independently through the department of transporta tion the fcc also continues to take regulatory steps to improve the delivery and availability of 911 several bills have been introduced in the 110th congress to address some of the issues raised in this report these are summarized in the next section problems with compliance in rural areas wireless carriers face specific problems in implementing loca tionfinding technology and providing coverage in rural areas problems include the use of analog as opposed to digital cellular services digital technology provi des significantly better locationfinding capability the difficulty of installing sufficient number of cell towers to provide triangulation for location technologies and the predominance of cell towers placed along major highways sometimes referred to as string of pearls also complication for proper triangulation for these and other reasons location identification

systemwide carriers that specialize in meeting the market needs of rural customers do not have the option of averaging their systems accuracy with betterperforming data from urbansuburban areas as

locate the ca ller within specified number of meters market penetration for example all new handsets and timeliness for example complying with psap request within six months to avoid penalties carriers that cannot comply with we911 requirements mu st request waivers for enforcement purposes the fcc has divided wireless carriers into three tiers small tier iii and midsized carriers tier ii are treated as one group with its own administrative schedule for compliance tier i carriers are the largest carriers verizon cingular tmobile and sprint nextel that collec tively have over 80 of the wireless market nationwide these are considered as parate group and closely monitored by the fcc for compliance because of difficulties in meeting f cc requirements for wireless e911 coalition of tier iii companies asked the fcc to ease standards for location accuracy for tier iii carriers especially those in rural areas18 reflecting concerns that some carriers would stop serving remote areas rather than invest in improving location identification capabilities the enhance 911 ac t directed the fcc to grant waivers in situations where strict enforcement would decrease access to emergency services19 the enhance 911 act also required the fcc to study the situation of tier iii wireless carriers regarding the waiver proce ss and to provide information on effective technologies for implementing phase ii of we91120 the fcc submitted detailed report in april 2005 but made r ecommendations regarding technology21 in the same time frame the fcc granted blanket waiver to tier iii

the fcc by ctiathe wireless association22 and the rural communications association rca summarized the difficulties being met by carriers depending on handset t echnology to comply with phase ii23 t h s include 1 lower replacement rate for phone s than anticipated by the fcc 2 lowered churn rates as more customers remain with existing wireless carriers keeping the phone s they already have and 3 unwillingness to repl ace phones in order to obtain location technology capabilitie s customers apparently are satisfied with the current features in their cell phones and are reluctant to replace them with phone in order to gain locationidentification technology in rural areas the primary reason might be desire to keep an analog cell phone because it provides better local coverage analog signals travel greater distances than digital ones which is significant in areas with limited number of transmission towers phase ii location technology requires digital phone among other possible reasons are consumer awareness of low penetration rates of phase ii capabilities at local psaps rendering the location technology in effective for 911 purposes and privacy concerns many citizens are uninformed about how location technology works and some fear that anyone will be able to know where they are at any time without their consent24 reflecting the difficulties reported by carriers some analog telephone users have encountered service problems when th ey have switched from analog to digital phones an undetermined number of custom ers in suburban and rural areas find that their new digital phones place them out of ra nge of towers that can receive digital signals calls including 911 calls th at went through on their analog phones can longer be completed because of comp liance
