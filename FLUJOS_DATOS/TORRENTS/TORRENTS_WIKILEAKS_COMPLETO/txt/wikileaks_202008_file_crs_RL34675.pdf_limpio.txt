safetealu the safe acc ountable flexible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users pl 10959 119 stat 1144 authoriz ation of federal highway and transit programs expires at the close of fy2009 consequently the 111th congress is expected to take up surface transportation legislation during the first session of the new congress both highway title 23 usc and mass transportation title 49 usc chapter 53 programs are financed by revenues drawn from the highway trust fund htf roughly 20 of the transit progra m is also funded from the us treasurys general fund the authorization of ex penditures from the htf also ends on september 30 2 009 the highway account of the htf however was rapidly approaching insolvency in september 2008 mo re than year before the end of the safetealu authorization congress re sponded quickly and passed pl 110318 providing an 8017 billion transfer from the treasurys general fund to the highway account to continue federal highway programs and activities this infusion of funds highlights the riousness of the problems of the trust fund financing mechanism which has supported much of the nations surface transportation spending for more than five decades the sufficiency problem has called into question the assumption of evergrowing spending in surface transportation authorization bills as well as the reliability of fuel taxdependent funding given this finding an answer to the funding dilemma is central issue that congress faces suggestions for treating the htf shortfall include increasing existing taxes implementing new vehicle miles traveled vmt tax reducing the highway programs size emphasizing private sector initiatives and devolving most of the federalaid highway program s responsibilities to the states the outcome of many other authorization issues will be influenced by how the longterm trust fund sufficiency issue is dealt with within the context of the federal high way program there are number of issues likely to be addressed by c ongress including the recurri ng debate on the appropriate state rateofreturn on each states highway users transportation tax payments to the htf commonly referred to as the donor donee state issue proposed changes in highway programs their funding formulas and project eligibility requirements the degree of flexibility to be given states to move federal f unds among programs proposed increases in highway bridge fundi ng and inspection the role of project earmarking and the consideration of so new programs such as for freight corridors issues of federal aid to mass transit include the appropriate overall level of funding both within the context of needs nd in comparison with federal spending on highways the degree of support for tran sit from treasury ge neral fund revenues private participation in transit the use of federal funds for operating costs and the issue of modifying existing programs or creating new programs to serve currently unserved or underserved

issues that are expected to be debated during the upc oming reauthorization of the federal governments highway and transit programs and activities2 following some introductory remarks the repor t is divided into two parts section on highway issues followed by section on transit issues although the federalaid highway program provides federal money for highways and highway bridges the money itself is normally under the control of the states the state departments of transportation state dots within the federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34675crs2 3 us dept of transportation 2006 status of the

composed of two accounts th highway account which funds the programs and activities of the federal highway administration and the mass transit account which funds most of the programs and activities of the federal transit administrationprogrammatic framework determine for the most part which projects and activities are funded with the federal funds most of the federalaid hi ghway program money provided to the state dots is apportioned to them through several large core formuladriven programs there are also number of much smaller discretionary programs but their funding has often been earmarked in r ecent years unlike the federalaid highway progra ms federal transit administration fta funding for major transit systems does not pass through the states but is apportioned to the local transit authority or other controlling local entity reauthorization bills generally build off the existing programmatic structure there is point of view that sees the division of federal transporta tion efforts into programs that pursue national goals or are mode specific as creating programmatic structure that constrains the ability of states and metropolitan areas to adopt i nnovative policies to solve transportation problems such as traffic congestion major highway reauthorization issues the department of tran sportation has estimated th at the average annual investment on bridges and high ways by all levels of g overnment needs to increase 122 or more annually over 20042024 to maintain existin g highways and bridges at their current condition and level of performance3 under current revenue sources the highway account of the htf is projected to have insufficient resources to fund even the current authorized levels let alone an expanded highway program4 because of an unexpected decline in gas tax revenues and an increase in outlays during the summer of 2008 the highway account was expected to approach insolvency in september 2008 the secretary of tran sportation on september 5 2008 announced mechanism to restrict highway acc ount outlays to prevent the nearterm insolvency and also called on congress to pa ss pending legislation to transfer roughly 8 billion from the treasury general fund to the highway account congress quickly passed pl 110318 to provide th requested funds this transfer is intended to keep the highway account solvent through the end of fy2009 when the current authorization expires the outcome of vi rtually all of the reauthorization issues discussed below will depe nd on how the longterm trust fund sufficiency issue is dealt with treatment of the highway account shortfall there are variety of approaches that may be considered during the reauthorization debate to assure the sustainability of the highway accounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34675crs3 raise the rates of existing taxes that support the trust fund fuel taxes provide about 90 of the re venues and were last raised in 1993 raising the gas tax is seen as difficult and probably unlikely in the current economic and political environment increase the use of tolling and publicprivate partnerships ppps to decrease reliance on the highway account for the funding of highway projects most observers in the transportation community however think that tolling and ppps can only provide from 5 to 10 of estimated system needs also most ppp proposals rely in part on federal funds and taxex empt financing both of which impose cost on the federal budget allowing widespread tolling of the heretofore mostly free federal interstate highway system could also become major issue replace or supplement the existin g federal highway tax and fee structure with more direct user fee such as vehicle miles traveled tax vmt this tax would through the use of global positioning system technology charge road us ers for each mile they drive most see this as not being nearterm solution due to organizational privacy and fee evasion issues vmt may also be viewed by some citizens as national toll on any vehicle movement on any road establish freight related taxes or fees such as freight waybill tax container fee or terminal facility charge these revenues could be used to address freight bottlenecks reduce the highway programs size restricting it to programs that fulfill clear national needs such as the interstate maintenance program or the federal lands high ways program and devolve any other highway program res ponsibilities to the states increase the funding that supports innovative financing such as state infrastructure bank sib progra ms or establish national infrastructure bank program to leve rage federal grant funds some have also proposed the use of ta x credit bonds to fund infrastructure projects however others argue that such mechanisms are ultimately more expensive than direct spending authorize an annual general f und contribution for highway programs thereby reducing th eir dependence on the highway account some express concern that this would weaken the historic link between the revenue derive d from taxes and fees paid by highway users and spending on th nations highways and bridges some argue that customs duties which are deposited in the general fund should be made available fo r portofentry infrastructurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34675crs4 5 states that receive more than they contri bute to the highway account are referred to as donee states states that receive less than th ey contribute are referred to as donor statesrateofreturn issues the donordonee state debate states seek high rateofreturn on their highway users tax and fee contributions to the highway account5 since the 1980s guaranteeing minimum rateofreturn has been major point of debate during each reauthorization cycle the current program is the equity bonus pr ogram eb and is designed to even out the rateofreturn on program spending across all states to more equitably reflect each states highway users trans portation tax contributions to the highway account for fy2009 all states are guaranteed 92 re turn on payments to the highway account for programs listed in the eb program the provisions also included guaranteed overall increase for all states over the previous reauthorization bill and number of holdharmless provisions that were intended to mitigate the impact on certain donee states of the shift in funding to th donor states under the bill fulfilling all of these requirements is done by providing sp ending overlay across all of the programs listed in the eb program in way that gives spending increases to all states but larger increases to the donor states this is very expensive the eb program is the largest formula program in safetealu 41 billion over five years number of policy issues are expected to surface although the equity bonus mechan ism could be re tained other means of assuring an equitable di stribution could be considered and devised an increase in the guaranteed ra teofreturn percentage above the 92 level could be considered expanding the scope of the equity provisions to incl ude all federal aid highway programs could be proposed the hold harmless provisions th at protect certain donee states from losing share could be retained modified or eliminated to reduce the cost of the equity bonus apportionments needed to bring all donor states up to th minimum rateofreturn the core program formulas could be modified to be more heavily weighted by states share of the total tax and fee contributions to the highway account the reauthorization bill could forgo an equity provision altogether and allow the program formulas to determine the distribution of highway funds to the states state maintenance of effort historically federal f unding was provided to supplement state spending on highways not to substitute for it government accountability office gao studyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34675crs5 6 government accountability office federalaid highways tr ends effect on state spending and options for future program design august 2004 available at httpwwwgaogovnewitemsd04802pdf looking farther back the report found that states used roughly half of the increases in federal highway grants since 1982 to substitute for state and local highway funding and that the rate of substitution increased during the 1990sfound evidence that since the mid1990s states as whole have failed to maintain financial level of ffort proportional to fede ral spending increases6 some in the transportation community believe that reauthorization should include provision that would make any authorized increase in st ates federal highway spending contingent on the state demonstrating that it is maintaining its capital investment spending on highways and is not substitutin g federal for state funding devolution to the states as far back as the 1980s there have been some that have argued that the federal program could be greatly reduced in si ze and most of the current federal responsibilities could be returne d to the states in tande m with this reduction of the federal program would be reduction in the federal gas tax the states would accordingly be free to raise their state gas taxes or find some other means to make up for the federal reduction the combination of the current constrai ned budget environment the pervasive use of funding flexibility among highway programs and the demands for higher minimum guarantee under the equity bonus prog ram in the view of some observers makes the federalaid high way program little more th an passthrough of funding from highway users through the federal treasury to the states in the view of these observers this significantly weakens the ar gument for federal highway program and strengthens the arguments for devolution programmatic structure the federalaid highway program has alwa ys been partnership with the state dots states have great deal of cont rol over the selection planning construction and oversight of federally f unded highway projects within this context number of programmatic i ssues could arise program scope and intent as we ll as the makeup of program funding formulas may be reexa mined some programs could be consolidated modified or eliminated historically the states have argued for increased flexibility for using federal funds by transferring funds across the federal highway programs however some in the transportation community argue that there is too much flexibility and the spending of federal f unds is often on projects that have evident national purpose in addition some highway supporte rs advocate the elimination ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34675crs6 7 the national transportation safety board has yet to complete its final report on

the highway and mass transit programs project eligibility changes may be considered for example some construction interests are arguin g for broadening of project eligibility under the congesti on mitigation and air quality improvement act cmaq that would allow more projects designed to increase road capacity to improve traffic flow in congested areas much of the federal program could be replaced by block grant program providing block grants to the states some argue that if given increased flexibility states and metropolitan areas could be allowed to spend transportation funds as they wish and simply be held to certain performance standards congress is likely to consider some new programs or realignment of existing programs some for exam ple have pressed for programs to improve major freight corridors and address bottlenecks to what extent freightspecific programs might include rail facilities which are mostly privately financed could be an issue bridge policy in 2007 roughly 72000 bridges were desi gnated by fhwa as structurally deficient although there were discu ssions of major infrastructure spending increases following the collapse of the i35w bridge7 in

federal highway brid ge program hbp that was included in the fy2008 thud appropriations bill8 issues that may arise include the following programmatic changes to the hbp as well as proposals increasing bridge spending could be incorporat ed in reauthorization legislation the rate of repair and replacement of deficient bridges and the funding needed to support any proposed acceleration of the rate could be an issue changes in bridge inspection and inventory are likely to be proposed the flexing of hbp funds to other highway programs for non bridge uses may be an

productivity and efficiency rail interests oppose increases in truck size and weight and argue that rail is the more efficient mode of transportation for heavy freight safety advocates also have concerns about allowing bigge r and heavier trucks on the roads earmarking issues over the 50year life of the htfsuppor ted federalaid high way program the congressional designation of numerous specific projects in highway authorization bills is relatively recent phenomenon until the late 1980s earmarks amounted to only about 1 of authorized federalaid highway spending10 in safetealu almost 22 billion or roughly 11 of th 1995 billion total contract authority in title i the highway construction title of the bill was earmarked the debate over highway project earmarking at times reflects the broader pro and arguments that apply to th discussion of the appropriateness of congressional earmarking in ge neral supporters of earma rking often argue that the framers of the constitution believed that congress not the president ie the executive branch should allocate funding for the functions of the federal government and ending cong ressional earmarking authority would be major transfer of power to the executive branch supporte rs also argue that members of congress have better sense of their constituents needs than executive branch bureaucrats opponents of earmarking make number of general arguments including that congressional earmarking under mines the intent of the programs and activities that congress itself has authorized many earmarks are designated for political reasons rather than for demonstrated needs earmarking may foster corruption many earmarks are inherently local and shortch ange projects of national interest andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34675crs8 11 department of transportation review of congressional earm arks within department of transportation programs report av2007066 2007 131earmarks unduly enhance the role of lobbying firms in the spending process issues more specific to the federalaid hi ghway program include the following earmarking distorts the operati on of the federalaid highway program according to dot report11 among the reports findings are the following that the earmarking can reduce the states core transportation programs many low priority earmarked projects are being funded over higher prior ity nonearmarked projects and projects that do not meet eligibility requirements are sometimes funded if significant number of earmarks are allowed one issue that will be considered is how the earmarks will interact with the eb distribution the high priority project hpp earmarks in safetealu were within the sc ope of the equity bonus and because of this these earmarks merely displaced formula program funds this meant that states receiving hpp earmarks not only received net increase in f unding as result of their hpp earmarks but also experienced reduction in the formula program funds that they rely on to implement their state transportation improvement plans the issue is whether earmarking should be inside or outside the scope of the eb program keeping the earmarks outside the eb program however would dilute the impact of rateofreturn guarantee if congress chooses to include earmarks in the upcoming reauthorization legislation it could require that all earmarks meet the federalaid highway program eligibility requirements despite the growth in the numbe r and amount of funding dedicated to highway earmarks there is certainty that the same levels of earmarking will be allowed in the upcoming reauthorization bills although local officials businesses and interest groups who benefit directly from particular earmarks are pleased when member is successful in obtaining cong ressional designa tion and sometime even pursue such earmarks by hiring lobbyists it does not necessarily follow that the public in general supports earmarking the safetealu earmarks for the so called bridges to

program issues in surface transportation reauthorization and crs report rl34171 public transit program issues in surface transportation reauthorization both by william j mallettmajor transit reauthorization issues the department of transportation estimates that spending from all sources on mass transit needs to increase by about 25 annually over the next 20 years just to maintain existing transit systems at their current condition and level of performance12 the mass transit account of the ht f is in somewhat better financial shape than the highway account but is also projected to go into deficit within few years the federal transit administr ation fta is funded 80 from the mass transit account and 20 from the treasury ge neral fund historically when the fuel tax rates have been raise d 20 of the increase has been dedicated to the mass transit account of the htf the reau thorization outcome of the trust fund sustainability debate di scussed in the prior section is therefore also pertinent to fta programs and activities within this context there are both funding and programmatic issues that coul d arise during reauthorization13 transit funding issues some of the following issues are pred icated on funding availability and others are predicated on expectation of constrained budgetary environment how much to spend overall on transit is the main issue in the upcoming reauthorization trans portation construc tion business and public transit interest groups argue that there needs to be significant increase in federal investment in transit infrastructure others dispute this and argue th at current spending trends if continued are sufficient still others argue that the federal government spends too much on tr ansit relative to highways given that transit receives about 16 of federal funding but only 2 of trips are made by this mode the lowering of the maximum federal matching share below the current 80 is seen by some as means of spreading constrained federal funds across more transit projects they also contend that larger local match would help ensure that only the most important projects are supported by state nd local officials opponents of lowering the federal maximum share dispute this contention encouraging private participati on through private development or publicprivate partnerships is s een by some as way to support transit improvements with less fe deral financial involvement while still creating many indirect community benefits others howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34675crs10 14 general accounting office now the

finance only relatively small number of projects relative to total needs14 encouraging more use of innova tive financing is likely to be considered as with highways innovative finance for transit generally involves leveraging fede ral funds to provide for funding through lending rather than grants state infrastructure banks and grant anticipation notes gans ar examples of innovative finance mechanisms given that trust fund balances in the mass transit account are trending downward some may sugge st expanding the general fund portion of the fta budget above th historical 20 as means of increasing the available funds for tr ansit another possibility is to cut program funding to lower the demands on the mass transit account and thereby extend its sustainability broadening the eligibility of federa l funds for transit operating costs could become an issue program structure the budgetary environment is expected to have an impact on the scope of programmatic change should there be major increase in funding the existing structure may remain essen tially the same funding decline or even nogrowth budget scenario could increase the likeli hood of program modification under such scenario number of chan ges could be considered congress could consider an acr osstheboard cut of all fta programs and activities program restructuring could narro w the focus of the programs to concentrate federal efforts on the rehabilitation and expansion of transit service in densely populated areas and the most congested cities ie the areas that would most efficiently utilize transit on the other hand the restructuring could simply refocus policymakers on maintaining and rehabilitating the existing systems and services this would mean possibly reducing the role of the new starts
