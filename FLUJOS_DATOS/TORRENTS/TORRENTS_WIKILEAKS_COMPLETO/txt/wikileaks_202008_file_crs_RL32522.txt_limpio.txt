the 911 commission report summary on july 22 2004 the 911 commission released its final report the report calls for changes to be made by the executive branch and congress to more effectively protect our nation in an age of modern terrorism and provides fortyone concrete recommendations generally the recommendations of the 911 commission as they relate to strategy content and implementation appear consistent with and supportive of the national strategy few question the 911 commission reports overarching premise that us counterterrorism structure strategy and implementation can be improved some however see certain commission recommendations as incomplete if not flawed they suggest that the commission is often focused on the last war and not future one and suggest that the commission consciously avoids tackling some of the more complex yet pressing issues for example the commission as its first recommendation stresses the need for identifying and prioritizing terrorist sanctuaries with focus on failed states some assert however that terrorists are increasingly returning to their politically stable home countries for sanctuary where they blend into local communities where their training camps are in civilian housing complexes and where their bomb factories are in private residences although number of the commissions recommendations fall within the category of preventing the growth of islamic extremism none addresses directly the issue of confronting incitement to terrorism when promoted countenanced or facilitated by the action or inaction of nation states with terrorists able to change targets tactics and weapons on short notice many argue that successful counterterrorism strategy and institutional structures will need similar flexibility the degree to which such flexibility will be built into strategy and into any new institutional structures recommend by the 911 commission is yet to be determined on december 17 2004 president bush signed the intelligence reform and prevention act of 2004 s 2845 pl 108458 establishing the position of national intelligence director position separate from that of the cia director to serve as the presidents principal intelligence advisor overseeing and coordinating the foreign and domestic activities of the intelligence community established as well is national counterterrorism center designed to serve as central knowledge bank for information about known and suspected terrorists and to coordinate and monitor counterterrorism plans and activities of all government agencies the center will also be responsible for preparing the daily terrorism threat report for the president contents introduction 1 national strategy for combating terrorism 2 framework 2 strategy elements 3 the 911 commission report 6 issues regarding the 2003 national strategy and the 911 commission report 8 us antiterror strategy and the 911 commission report introduction central to global strategy for combating terrorism is defining the threat and understanding who the enemy is terrorism as generic concept is too vague and amorphous to design strategy against moreover terrorism though often perceived as threat is perhaps better characterized as tactic or process an important point made by the 911 commission is that the strategic threat faced by the united states and its allies is from an enemy consisting of certain groups and with specific ideology and with stated objectives in the words of the commission the enemy goes beyond qaeda to include the radical ideological movement inspired in part by qaeda that has spawned other terrorist groups and violence thus our strategy must match our means to two ends dismantling the qaeda network and in the long term prevailing over the ideology that contributes to islamist terrorism1 comprehensive national antiterror strategy must address many issues included are the appropriate roles for military force law enforcement intelligence diplomacy economic development education promotion of social and political equality and nation and institution building within the context of policies promoting national security tactically in the short term how does one employ the wide portfolio of tools available to policymakers to reduce pressing and immediate threats strategically in the long term how does one win hearts and minds in addition strategy ideally attracts allies how does one both maximize international buyin and national effectiveness the national strategy for combating terrorism addresses these issues2 the recommendations of the 911 commission as they relate to strategy content and implementation appear consistent with and supportive of the national strategy3 1 the 911commission report executive summary p1617 httpwwwgpoaccessgov911indexhtml 2 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200302200302147html 3 note that in contrast to the 911 commissions recommendations the national strategy does not deal with the issue of government organizational structure to combat terrorism crs2 national strategy for combating terrorism framework on february 14 2003 the white house released the national strategy for combating terrorism 30page interagency document4 the intent of the strategy is to stop terrorist attacks against the united states its citizens its interests and us friends and allies around the world as well as to create an international environment inhospitable to terrorists and their supporters the strategy emphasizes that all instruments of us power diplomatic economic law enforcement financial information dissemination intelligence and military are to be called upon in combating international terrorism the strategy fits into the wider strategic concept of defenseindepth which projects four concentric rings of defense against terrorist attacks against the united states5 the national strategy for combating terrorism is designed to complement other elements of the national security strategy6 including substrategies for homeland security weapons of mass destruction cyberspace critical infrastructure protection and drug control while the national strategy for homeland security7 focuses on preventing terrorist attacks within the united states the national strategy for combating terrorism focuses on identifying and defusing threats before they reach us borders incorporated in the national strategy for combating terrorism is strong preemptive component strong focus on reducing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and defenseindepth framework while preemption and military force remain important components the strategy recognizes that the war on terror will not be won on the military battlefield and gives policy emphasis to strategic longterm policy components earlier bush administration draft versions of the strategy had placed even heavier emphasis on international law enforcement cooperation as policy pillar 4 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200302200302147html 5 the outermost ring consists of diplomatic military and intelligence organizations operating mostly overseas one goal of these organizations is to help preempt attacks on the us homeland in the 2003 plan organizations such as the customs service immigration and naturalization service and the coast guard all of which are now incorporated into the department of homeland security constituted the next ring which focuses on us borders and the goods and people that cross them the next ring includes federal state and local law enforcement first responders such as the fire service and the national guard these operate for the most part within us borders and are responsible for protecting towns and cities private citizens who are being asked to report suspicious activity and take preventive action to reduce vulnerability to perilous situations are part of this ring also the final ring includes the private sector and federal agencies that play key role in safeguarding the facilities that comprise critical physical infrastructures eg transportation financial telecommunications and energy systems see httpusinfostategoveiarchive2003dec31646035html 6 httpwwwwhitehousegovnscnsspdf 7 httpwwwwhitehousegovhomelandbooknat_strat_hlspdf crs3 the strategy details desired end state where the scope and capabilities of global terrorist organizations are downscaled to such an extent that they become localized unorganized unsponsored and rare enough that they can be almost exclusively dealt with by criminal law enforcement to accomplish this mission emphasis is placed on international action by working with the willing enabling the weak persuading the reluctant and compelling the unwilling8 one aspect of the strategy is that economic development is formally enumerated as an important factor in reducing conditions that terrorists exploit the strategy also raises the priority of using information programs to delegitimize terrorism strategy elements the administrations 2003 national strategy for combating terrorism is founded on four pillars defeating denying diminishing and defending together with us allies defeating terrorists by attacking their sanctuaries leadership command control and communications material support and finances components include 1 identifying and locating terrorists by making optimal use of all intelligence sources foreign and us and 2 destroying terrorists and their organizations by capture and detention use of military power and through employment of specialized intelligence resources as well as international cooperation to curb terrorist funding denying terrorists state sponsorship support and sanctuarysafehavens central strategy objective is to ensure that other states take action against such elements within their sovereign territory elements include 1 tailoring strategies to induce individual state sponsors of terrorism to change policies 2 promoting international standards for combating terrorism 3 eliminating sanctuaries and 4 interdicting terrorist ground air maritime and cyber traffic in order to deny terrorists access to arms financing information wmd materials sensitive technology recruits and funding from illicit drug activities diminishing underlying conditions that terrorists exploit by fostering economic social and political development market based economies good governance and the rule of law emphasis includes 1 partnering with the international community to alleviate conditions leading to failed states that breed terrorism and 2 using public information initiatives to delegitimize terrorism and defending us citizens and interests at home and abroad to include protection of physical and cyber infrastructures 8 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200302200302147html introduction crs4 inherent in these four pillars are the following components first and foremost is an intelligence component counterterrorism requires sound intelligence since 911 the united states has sought to identify and implement measures designed to better merge domestic with foreign intelligence9 increasingly us counterterrorism strategy incorporates law enforcement component subject however to restrictions found in the posse comitatus act and the homeland security act that limit involvement of the military in domestic law enforcement10 central to the national strategy for combating terrorism is law enforcement cooperation for example since september 11 2001 the fbi has initiated cooperative programs with singapore malaysia thailand indonesia and other nations aimed at apprehending suspected terrorists and has shared expertise and technology with the law enforcement agencies of these nations an increasingly important component of law enforcement cooperation involves curbing terrorist financing11 us counterterrorism policy also has strong economic component with both defensive and preemptive characteristics on the defensive side much attention is being given to minimize disruption of the american economy by protecting economic infrastructures major function of the department of homeland security dhs is to assess the vulnerability of critical infrastructures supporting such efforts is growing use of risk analysis and threat matrices on the preemptive side of the economic component since 911 combating global terrorism has become one of the top priorities of us foreign assistance12 the bush administration has launched new foreign aid program the millennium challenge account which would increase foreign economic assistance starting in fy2004 to level which would be 5 billion higher by fy2006 currently us economic aid worldwide totals 1287 billion aid would go to countries that have demonstrated sound development practices and over time the new aid would be limited to countries with per capita annual income of less than 2975 for 9 for example the usa patriot act was passed and signed the interagency terrorist threat integration center ttic was formed as was the 911 commission 10 see crs report rs21012 terrorism some legal restrictions on

september 11 2001 crs5 fy2004 congress appropriated 994 million for this account the fy2005 budget proposes 25 billion with commitment for 5 billion in fy200613 also evident is growing counterdrug component in the wake of the events of september 11th the international community has placed emphasis on curbing financing of terrorist groups and has dramatically enhanced efforts to limit and seize sources of terrorist funding14 this has spawned renewed focus on the narcotics trade as source of funding for such groups even in instances where groups do not actively work together the synergy of their separate operations and shared efforts at destabilization pose an increasing threat15 in addition there is military component this military component is reflected in the war in iraq16 us operations in afghanistan deployment of us forces around the horn of africa to djibouti and the former soviet republic of georgia and ongoing military exercises in colombia the us is also undergoing shift in overseas base locations to tactically support more flexible strategy allowing for extended global military reach17 on the home front us policy increasingly has homeland security focus the department of homeland security was the biggest reorganization of the federal government in americas history incorporating 22 government agencies and some 179000 people into single organization charged with coordinating the nations domestic response to terrorism the budget of the new department is roughly equal in amount to 10 of the nations defense budget for fy2003 approximately 44 of federal law enforcement positions and 48 of federal law enforcement funding were transferred to dhs18 central to the us government approach to combating terrorism is globalizing threat reduction and counterproliferation of wmd and delivery systems on may 31 2003 president bush proposed proliferation security initiative psi aimed at keeping wmd materials out of the hands of terrorists and rogue nations19 13 see crs report rl32427 millennium challenge account implementation of new us foreign aid initiative by larry nowels 14 on may 14 2004 ministers from 33 nations announced reauthorization

report on july 22 2004 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states 911 commission issued its final report21 included are fortyone recommendations for changing the way the government is organized to combat terrorism and how it prioritizes its efforts many of the commissions recommendations are consistent with elements of the administrations february 14 2003 national strategy for combating terrorism22 such as diplomacy and counter proliferation efforts preemption intelligence and information fusion winning hearts and minds including not only public diplomacy but also policies that encourage development and more open societies law enforcement cooperation and defending the homeland23 the 911 commissions recommendations generally fall into the categories of 1 preemption attacking terrorists and combating the growth of islamic terrorism 2 protecting against and preparing for attacks 3 coordination and unity of operational planning intelligence and sharing of information 4 enhancing through centralization congressional effectiveness of intelligence and counterterrorism oversight authorization and appropriations 5 centralizing congressional oversight and review of homeland security activities and 6 increasing fbi dod and dhs capacity to assess terrorist threats and their concomitant response strategies and capabilities the report specifically recommends confronting openly problems in the us saudi relationship read by some to include such issues as terrorist financing and the issue of ideological incitement the report also recommends sustaining aid to pakistan and afghanistan which are perceived to be vital geostrategic allies in the global war on terror prominent in the report are specific recommendations calling for 1 creation of more unified congressional committee structure for oversight authorization and appropriations involving intelligence and counterterrorism eg joint committee or separate committees in each chamber possibly combining authorizing and appropriating authorities 2 creation of single principal point of congressional oversight and review for homeland security 3 creation of position of national intelligence director nid in the office of the president and 4 creation of national counterterrorism center the national intelligence director as envisioned 20 see crs report rs21881 proliferation security initiative psi by sharon squassoni 21 httpwwwgpoaccessgov911indexhtmlm note that many of the commissions findings are consistent with generic findings contained in series of pre911 reports

control of intelligence agencies across the federal government propose and execute unified intelligence budget and serve as principal intelligence adviser to the president24 the national counterterrorism center in the view of the commission should be the central office for intelligence gathering analysis and overall counterterrorism operations mirroring commission recommendations on august 2 2004 president bush urged congress to create the position of national intelligence director position separate from that of cia director to be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate and to serve at the pleasure of the president the director would serve as the presidents principal intelligence advisor overseeing and coordinating the foreign and domestic activities of the intelligence community the president also announced plans to establish national counterterrorism center move envisioned as building on the analytical work of the terrorist threat integration center the new center is envisioned as serving as central knowledge bank for information about known and suspected terrorists and would be charged with coordinating and monitoring counterterrorism plans and activities of all government agencies and preparing the daily terrorism threat report for the president and senior officials25 on december 17 2004 president bush signed the intelligence reform and prevention act of 2004 s 2845 pl 108458 establishing the position of national intelligence director position separate from that of the cia director to serve as the presidents principal intelligence advisor overseeing and coordinating the foreign and domestic activities of the intelligence community established as well is national counterterrorism center designed to serve as central knowledge bank for information about known and suspected terrorists and to coordinate and monitor counterterrorism plans and activities of all government agencies the center will also be responsible for preparing the daily terrorism threat report for the president some however are concerned that the newly created national intelligence director nid as an integral part of the presidents team might be more vulnerable to political pressure26 central to this debate is desire to maintain the independence 24 note that the prickly issue of the extent of the nids authority over agencies and their budgets is as of yet undetermined see crs report rl32506 the proposed authorities of national intelligence director issues for congress and sidebyside comparison of s 2845 hr 10 and current law

political violence august 8 2004 for purposes of historical assessment note that examples of close relationship between the director of central intelligence dci and the white house are arguably documented in plan of attack by bob woodward new york simon schuster 2004 467 p see also crs report rs21696 us intelligence and policymaking the iraq experience by richard best crs8 of objective intelligence from administration policy goals27 as the proposed national intelligence director would have access to both domestic and foreign intelligence another concern is the overall power wielded by the proposed position and its potential for abuse28 issues regarding the 2003 national strategy and the 911 commission report given the potential access by terrorists to weapons of mass destruction designing effective responses to terrorism may well be the greatest challenge facing governments today bedeviling policymakers is how to combat effectively this growing global phenomenon with sufficient intelligence support and at sustainable level of economic social and political cost inherent in this policy debate are two overarching issues 1 how to ensure protection of civil liberties while enhancing security and 2 how to deal with the seemingly unending costs of enhancing security29 critical to both these issues is the development of methodology to measure the adequacy of antiterrorism efforts an issue not addressed in the 2003 national strategy or in the 911 commission report recommendations in this regard some raise concern that creation of positions or structures in government where domestic and foreign intelligence are coordinated or fused such as the national intelligence director and national counterterrorism center will result in encroachments on civil liberties clearly as nation they say the united states does not seek to defend freedom abroad and ignore it at home on the other hand others counter that providing security in todays increasingly borderless world is basic responsibility of governments to their citizenry without intelligence gathering and analysis that adequately detects an increasingly intertwined continuum of threats of both foreign and domestic origin they say policymakers may find themselves at major disadvantage in implementing strategies to counter such threats 27 see press release of senator carl levin the intelligence community was only half the problem july 15 2004 httplevinsenategovnewsroomreleasecfmid224062 28 see generally august 4 2004 hearing of the house permanent select committee on intelligence on the september 11 commission recommendations 29 for variety of material relating to the 911 commission report see the crs website httpwwwcrsgovproductsbrowseisterrorismshtml for the 911 commission report seehttpwwwgpoaccessgov911indexhtml note that the 911 commission recommendation on p 391392 of the 911 report refers to hard choices in allocating limited resources and refers to use of risk based priorities for evaluating and identifying transportation assets needing protection moreover the recommendation on p396 begins with the wording homeland security assistance should be based strictly on assessment of risks and vulnerabilities such recommendations are based however on the premise that threat based vulnerability assessment methodologies exist or can be developed which are able to assess terrorist risk crs9 concern also exists over the potential for seemingly limitless economic costs of security associated with homeland defense sizeable nation can afford the cost of fortifying every square inch of its territory from terror attacks so as the 911 commission recommends both strategy and implementation policies must wisely prioritize allocation of resources for counterterrorism and homeland defense30 complicating these efforts governments and terrorists may be fighting different wars policymakers often view success against terrorism in terms of minimizing physical damage death injury and destruction of property and concentrate their energy and resources in this area on the other hand terrorists while seeking physical damage may also view success in abstract or ideological terms for example what is the impact of an action on recruitment how does it affect government policies or the stability of the government in power what is the impact of an act of terrorism on the economy of nation or on global economic networks what is the impact on behavioral patterns of target population might the public pressure government to pursue policies that appease terror the question arises how long can democratic governments pursue policies that pressure terrorists if such policies are seen as bringing on terrorist retaliation breaking or weakening this political will is likely to be central terrorist goal some well thought out strategies promote holding the line on terrorism or setting it back but potential danger in formalized strategies such as the national strategy for combating terrorism31 is that the strategy may rigidly dictate the response instead of the threat dictating the response as the threat is often rapidly evolving one option for policymakers charged with combating terrorism is to design flexibility into strategies organizational structures and funding utilization while strategies or changes in governmental organizational structures such as those recommended for the intelligence community by the 911 commission may accelerate success against global terrorism other factors are equally critical as well strong national leadership and high quality of rankandfile personnel and technology are central as is the strong political will of leadership and the general population hence one potential pitfall of relying on strategies and reforms involving restructuring of government organizations is that focus on implementing strategies or administrative changes may overshadow other important factors such as quality of personnel and technology in particular this human factor may warrant more attention in an environment where organizations may feel pressed to find personnel to fill plethora of newly created counterterror related positions overall the 911 commission recommendations share many features of the administrations national strategy for combating terrorism the theme of using portfolio of all elements of national power resounds in both documents both documents emphasize the core importance of timely and actionable intelligence both emphasize need for preemptive strategy for attacking terrorists and their organizations for international cooperation for foreign economic assistance for winning hearts and minds for strengthening counterproliferation efforts for 30 see 911 commission recommendations on pages 391992 and 396 31 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200302200302147html crs10 attacking terrorist financing for denying sanctuaries and for border security32 pursuit of government policies that draw potential recruits away from terrorist agendas is core recommendation of the 911 commission report33 some however see certain commission recommendations as incomplete if not flawed they suggest that the commission is often focused on the last war and not future one and liken the commissions recommendations to picking the low hanging fruit on the tree while avoiding going after the higher more difficult to reach yet richer clusters34 for example the commission as its first recommendation suggests identifying and prioritizing terrorist sanctuaries with focus on failed states some assert however that terrorists increasingly return to their politically stable home countries for sanctuary where they blend into local communities where their training camps are in civilian housing complexes and where their bomb factories are in private residences in another recommendation the commission suggests that vigorous efforts to track terrorist financing remain front and center yet does not address the prickly and growing issue of use of the hawalah system by terrorist networks35 number of the commissions recommendations fall within the category of preventing the growth of islamist extremism and both the 2003 national strategy and the 911 commission report to large degree equate the terrorist threat with qaeda and affiliated groups however valid question is the degree to which if at all such singleminded approach detracts attention from individuals or groups with other motivations that may soon appear on the horizon another issue central to combating islamist extremism not addressed in the 2003 national strategy or the 911 commission recommendations is that of confronting incitement to terrorism when promoted countenanced or facilitated by the action or inaction of nation states36 although the 2003 national strategy and the 911 commission both support the use of foreign assistance as means of taking away fertile breeding ground for 32 note that it is widely recognized that terrorists are especially vulnerable to law enforcement activity while in transit to exploit this vulnerability targeting travel is given special emphasis in the 911 commissions recommendations 33 see generally 911commission recommendations under the heading prevent the continued growth of islamist terrorism pp374383 of the commission report 34 conversation with peter probst vicepresident and director of research for the center for the study of terrorism and political violence august 8 2004 35 crsprobst conversation august 8 2004 note that commission indicates that an important purpose of targeting terror financing is to gather information on terror networks and coalitions and to raise the costs of raising money in terms of financial expenditures and organizational energy to qaeda and other groups moreover the report p283 suggests that if qaeda is replaced by smaller decentralized groups the assumption that terrorists need financial support network may become outdated another benefit of targeting financing not mentioned in the report is that it may prove useful as coalition building tool 36 see generally commission recommendations pages 374379 and specifically the recommendation relating to the us relationship with saudi arabia p374 crs11 the nurturing of terrorist groups the question of correlation between standard of living levels and terrorism is open to debate37 nevertheless there is growing recognition in us antiterrorism strategy that poverty can breed ignorance and despair and that despair can be exploited to support terrorist goals38 37 the question arises to what degree is it economically sustainable for even the richest nations to raise world standard of living levels to plateau where social ethnic religious economic or political grievances do not vent themselves in terrorist movements or acts note also that usama bin ladin can hardly be characterized as poor nor can many of his major financial supporters
