presidency classified by ambassador craig stapleton for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 c summary segolene royals overwhelming firstround victory in the november 16 socialist party ps presidential primary makes it official she will be the candidate of the centerleft in next years presidential election likely in tight race against the centerrights nicolas sarkozy the win is testament to royals ability to confound frances purveyors of conventional political wisdom and her own party establishment both regularly underestimated her and discounted her ability to go the distance royals success has been her ability as blairlike socialist to deal with issues nonideologically through the prism of their impact on ordinary people with focus on concrete operational proposals that she is willing to jettison if they prove unworkable 2 c summary cont royal has demonstrated these same traits in the foreign affairs arena where her recent statements in support of the democratic government in iraq and against even civilian nuclear program in iran were met with condescension by elites but seem not to have hurt her with ps voters if she were to be elected president we would expect criticism of us unilateralism environmental policies and more but her years working in mitterrands elysee also portend an openness to pragmatic cooperation with the us end summary the primary election results 3 c on november 16 in an overwhelming vote of confidence in her ability to win over 60 percent of ps party members endorsed segolene royal as their partys candidate in the 2007 presidential race of the 176220 votes cast by ps party members throughout metropolitan france royal received 106839 former finance minister dominique strausskahn 36714 former prime minister laurent fabius 32667 ever since royal launched her bid for the presidency frances purveyors of conventional political wisdom have been discounting her ability to go the distance royal has proved them wrong each time the sarkozy camp now understands it will be facing formidable opponent whom they would underestimate at their own peril throughout the race royal displayed the energy conviction charisma and physical stamina that have made her leading contender to be elected frances next president fifty percent chance of being frances next president 4 c royals clearcut victory in the firstround of the ps primary election confirms her as the unchallenged leader of the centerleft in france it sets up showdown between her and interior minister sarkozy for frances presidency in 2007 analysts agree that if the dominance of the presidential field by these two major candidates holds the second round runoff between them will be very very close though the unexpected including major missteps by these leading candidates during their campaigns could still reconfigure the electoral landscape dislodging one or the other becomes more and more difficult as the election draws nearer fusing her popularity and her current organization with her party 5 c royals primary victory gives her allies in the ps unchallenged control of the party apparatus party chief francois hollande who is also royals longtime domestic partner will be instrumental in putting the party fully in the service of royals campaign the next step for royal is making the party headquarters my campaign headquarters according to one of her closest allies in the party hierarchy her campaign strategy projects two key lines of action continuing to be what has made her popular while bringing to bear the partys electioneering expertise and energizing the partys dense network of elected officials throughout the country 6 c royals upcoming campaign will continue to feature paris 00007424 002 of 003 the personal characteristics on which her popularity is founded while also working to improve some of her weaknesses as candidate she has shown vulnerability to getting rattled during tv appearances or before hostile publics because she has not had toplevel experience in some issue areas particularly foreign affairs deepening her command of these briefs will be top priority the core of the segolene phenomenon 7 c ps party spokesman and long time royal ally julian dray recently enumerated to us the four personal characteristics that make royal so popular they are the key elements of the segolene story that connects so powerfully with such wide electorate first shes mom royal has raised four children with hollande that experience according to dray gives ordinary people confidence that she might be genuinely caring towards them also very different from the subliminal sentiments towards ordinary people associated with members of frances aloof and inbred political class second she has successful marriage even though royal and hollande have never legally married their longstanding relationship is viewed as an exemplary success in love and people admire that wishing for the same in their own lives third shes beautiful woman this element of novelty and of gender equality with touch of feminist revanchism in an electorate that is 53 percent female thrown in are part and parcel of royals success finally shes highly competent royal has distinguished herself through her professional achievements her rise notwithstanding her familys modest means and very traditionalist social values ie women become wives not presidents through frances witheringly competitive educational meritocracy are recognized by voters as those of an extraordinary individual worthy of consideration for frances highest office critical of us approach yet often still in synch on substance 8 c royal as is to be expected from the standard bearer of frances centerleft socialist party can be quite direct even harsh in her assessments of us foreign policy initiatives as is the case nearly across the board left and right among the members of frances political class royal has made clear that she opposed the usled invasion of iraq in 2003 and what she saw as the highhanded us dismissal of multilateral unled efforts to defuse the crisis however in some of her more recent statements on iraq royal has clearly broken with the conventional wisdom in france particularly that of the french left after meeting with iraqi president jalal talibabi in paris last november 3 royal told reporters that despite all the problems there iraq is getting back on its feet she underlined that the iraqi government not outsiders should decide when the time has come for withdrawal of foreign forces from the country reflecting her penchant for seeing war and peace problems in terms of their effect on the lives of everyday people first rather than in terms of balance of power among states regional stability etc royal stressed the importance of swift reconstruction of that country which was so ravaged by dictatorship so that the iraqi people who have suffered so so much emphasis hers might recover their dignity and their selfconfidence and desire to get back on the road to success 9 c repeatedly in her pronouncements on international issues royal has insisted on the legitimacy and preeminence of the in acting against threats to international peace and security royals statements on the conflict in lebanon last summer for example reflected the view that ending the suffering of the conflicts civilian casualties on both sides should be the first priority addressed by an immediate ceasefire to be followed by unmediated disengagement and the disarming of hezbollah in addition she proposed that former president clinton be considered as special mediator for the conflict royal advisor pointed to this proposal as illustrative of her inclination to personalize political issues royals reaction to the israelhezbollah confrontation seeing the crisis first and foremost through the prism of its impact on ordinary people paris 00007424 003 of 003 while advocating the empowerment of the to seek longerterm solution reflect what is likely to be royals approach to international conflicts in drays words spoken as close friend of royals for many years shes not interested in the theory and approaches problems in terms of whats being proposed to solve them if true this would certainly represent refreshing break from the ingrained french preference for the theoretical over the empirical 10 c in her recent statements specifically about the us royal has not been shy about criticizing what she has repeatedly termed the attitude of the us americas willingness to act outside of the consensus of the international community royals americabashing however concerns more the form of us policy than its substance in fact to the extent she has expressed herself on them her views on some key issues are in fact quite close to those of the us striking example of this is the way royal has been the most outspoken of frances major political figures about the danger posed by irans nuclear weapons ambitions she has spoken explicitly about the threat to israels existence of nuclear weapons in the hands of the current iranian leadership and has gone so far as to suggest that irans civil nuclear program because it is steppingstone to weapons program is illegitimate in light of irans reneging on its nonproliferation obligations comment 11 c if elected and that is big if that is still long way down the road royal appears to be someone who would approach world affairs pragmatically and would seek to maintain close if critical relationship with the us there may be fresh opportunity for washington policy makers to take her measure if as we know her staff is considering she goes through with plans to visit the us at some point before the end of january when the presidential campaign begins in earnest end comment please visit paris classified website at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurparisindexc fm stapleton
