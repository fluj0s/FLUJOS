the economy and economic well being crossnational analysis april 5 2006 thomas l hungerford specialist in public sector economics government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress the effects of government expenditures and revenues on the economy and economic wellbeing crossnational analysis summary the fy2006 budget resolution hconres 95 required that mandatory spending be reduced by 35 billion and revenues be reduced by more than 70 billion over the next five years congress passed and the president signed reconciliation bill pl 109171 to reduce mandatory spending by 39 billion between fy2006 and fy2010 revenue reduction reconciliation bill hr 4297 has not been enacted as of the date of this report many argue that tax and spending reductions will stimulate economic growth whereas many others argue that tax cuts will lead to larger deficit with adverse economic effects and that spending cuts will reduce critical government services this report examines the effects of government spending and taxation on economic growth and economic wellbeing by comparing the united states with 20 other industrial organization for economic cooperation and development oecd countries among the 21 oecd countries the united states has the fourth smallest public sector with total government federal state and local expenditures amounting to 37 of gross domestic product gdp total government spending accounted for 34 of gdp the smallest in ireland and 59 of gdp the largest in sweden countries with larger government spending relative to gdp tend to have higher productivity growth rates and lower relative poverty rates there appears however to be relation between government spending and gdp growth public social welfare expenditures are the benefits paid by all levels of government providing support to maintain welfare the level of social welfare spending varies from country to country the marketoriented englishspeaking countries such as the united states tend to have social welfare expenditures equal to about 15 of gdp whereas the welfarestate scandinavian countries spend much more typically about 25 of gdp the evidence suggests that public social welfare expenditures do not have an adverse effect on the economy but these expenditures can improve economic wellbeing countries with higher public social welfare expenditures relative to gdp have lower relative poverty rates the major source of funding for government expenditures is tax revenues taxes have an effect on government budgets and most people would agree that they also have an effect on the economy the evidence suggests however that countries with high tax revenues relative to gdp do not generally experience lower economic growth rates than countries with lower tax revenues some scholars argue that countries with higher taxes to fund higher social welfare spending tend to choose the types of taxes with the smallest economic distortions many scholars argue that longterm budget deficits can have an adverse impact on the economy the evidence suggests that countries with larger budget surpluses tend to have higher economic growth rates and that sustained government budget deficits are likely to reduce longterm economic growth this report will not be updated contents the size of the public sector in the economy 2 public social welfare expenditures 7

on the economy and economic wellbeing crossnational analysis us federal government expenditures in fy2003 were 21599 billion but the federal government is not alone in spending state and local governments also spent 21642 billion the combined federal state and local government budget deficit was equivalent to 46 of gross domestic product although it is recognized that budget deficits created through either spending increases or tax cuts provide shortterm stimulus to the economy it is also generally agreed that persistent budget deficits can have harmful longterm economic effects1 for the past few years there has been vigorous debate at all levels of government on the best way to reduce and eliminate budget deficits raise taxes reduce taxes or reduce spending at the federal level the fy2006 budget resolution hconres 95 required that mandatory spending that is spending for entitlement programs be reduced by 35 billion and revenues be reduced by more than 70 billion over the next five years congress eventually passed and the president signed reconciliation bill pl 109 171 to reduce mandatory spending by 39 billion between fy2006 and fy2010 the majority of the reductions are in medicare medicaid and student loans for higher education revenue reduction reconciliation bill hr 4297 has not been enacted as of the date of this report the presidents fy2007 budget proposal calls for further 65 billion reduction in mandatory spending and making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent the president and the republican congressional leadership argue that the fy2007 proposals will facilitate economic growth and job creation and otherwise ensure strong economy in the future on the other side the democratic congressional leadership argues that tax cuts will lead to ballooning federal deficit with adverse economic effects and that spending cuts will reduce critical government services government spending and taxation can have significant effects on the economy and on the lives of individuals this report examines the consequences of government spending especially public social welfare expenditures and taxation on the economy and the wellbeing of the citizens this analysis summarizes the results 1 see for example the papers in alice m rivlin and isabel sawhill eds restoring fiscal sanity 2005 washington brookings institution 2005 and in federal reserve bank of boston the economics of large government deficits conference series 27 proceedings of conference held in october 1983 crs2 from previous studies and uses data from 21 industrial countries to compare the us experience with that of other countries2 the size of the public sector in the economy government carries out number of important economic functions one of those functions is to correct inefficiencies or distortions in the allocation of goods and services this may take the form of levying taxes or providing subsidies to correct externalities providing public goods such as national defense and police protection or regulating monopolies3 another function of government is to redistribute income and wealth through the use of taxes and transfers lastly government can have an economic stabilizing function to reduce unemployment or inflation in performing these functions however government may also introduce inefficiencies or distortions in the market one issue that often generates vigorous debate is the proper size of government4 mostly this debate is qualitative rather than quantitative in that most argue over whether the public sector is too large or too small there is standard for the optimal size of the public sector and there is agreed upon way to measure public sector size in this report the size of the public sector will be measured by the ratio of government expenditures to gross domestic product gdp us public sector size will be judged by comparing this ratio to the same ratio for other industrial countries government plays significant role in the nations economy but the role varies dramatically from country to country figure 1 shows total government spending as percentage of gdp in 20035 total government spending accounted for 34 of gdp in ireland and 59 of gdp in sweden among these 21 countries the united states has the fourth smallest public sector with government expenditures amounting to 37 of gdp in general the scandinavian and continental european countries have relatively large public sectors which amount to 50 or more of gdp the englishspeaking countries as well as japan and switzerland tend to have smaller public sectors 2 see the appendix for description of the data used in the report 3 prime example of an externality is the generation of pollution during the production of good firm will typically base its pricing policy on the costs it incurs in the production of the good and not on the total costs which includes the cost placed on society from the pollution 4 see crs report rl32162 the size and role of government economic issues by marc labonte 5 total government spending includes spending at all levels of government such as state and local as well as the federal or central government on average central government spending accounts for 58 of total government expenditures for the 21 countries considered in the report the range is from low of 30 to high of 91 given this wide disparity in the importance of the central government spending total government expenditures and revenues are examined in this report crs3 figure 1 total government expenditures as percentage of gdp 2003 sweden

60 70 percent source organization for economic cooperation and development oecd economic theory does not predict an unambiguous effect of government policy on economic growth traditional growth models suggest that longterm growth in output and productivity are due to growth in population and exogenous technical progress which are unaffected by government policy newer growth models however suggest that government policies that increase investment in physical and human capital can raise longterm growth empirical research as well has found that the size of government has ambiguous effects on economic growth some studies find positive effects and others find negative effects one study found that government consumption expenditures have negative effect on economic growth but consumption expenditures are fairly small part of total government spending the same study finds that other government functions such as investment spending for physical and human capital as well as high quality bureaucracy have positive effect on economic growth6 table 1 displays the simple correlation among the 21 industrial countries of the 10year average of total government spending as percentage of gdp with various measures of economic growth and wellbeing7 the first row of the table shows the 6 see simon commander hamid r davoodi and une j lee the causes of government and the consequences for growth and wellbeing world bank policy research working paper 1785 jan 1997 7 the simple correlation between two variables can be between 1 and 1 positive continued crs4 correlation with the 10year average annual real gdp growth rate8 the estimated correlation is fairly small and is not precisely estimated thus correlation of zero cannot be ruled out and the correlation is said to be not statistically significant9 consequently there is apparent relation between these two variables as an example both the united states and finland have experienced average annual real gdp growth rates of 33 over the past 10 years yet finlands government expenditures are equivalent to 543 of gdp compared to 359 for the united states table 1 correlations with 10year average total government spending as percentage of gdp correlation 10year average annual real gdp 015 growth rate 10year average annual productivity 049 growth rate relative poverty rate in 2000 063 source crs calculations of oecd data the correlation of government spending with productivity growth is shown in the next row of the table the estimated correlation is positive of moderate size and is statistically significant this suggests that countries with higher government spending relative to gdp also have higher productivity growth rates lastly the final row of the table reports the correlation between government spending relative to gdp and the relative poverty rate10 the correlation is 063 and statistically 7 continued negative correlation indicates that when one variable increases the other variable tends to increase decrease correlation of zero indicates there is relation between the two variables 8 the 10year averages are used so as to average out the effects of business cycle fluctuations in these economic variables 9 the standard error is also estimated along with the correlation the standard error is used to test the hypothesis that the estimated correlation coefficient is equal to zero that is correlation precisely estimated correlations have small standard errors and the hypothesis of correlation can usually be rejected when the hypothesis of correlation is rejected the correlation is said to be statistically significant 10 the relative poverty rate is the percentage of the population with adjusted family income below 50 of median family income this poverty threshold is commonly used for international comparisons of poverty because there is internationally accepted official poverty threshold using this poverty threshold produces poverty rate for the united states that is about 5 percentage points higher than the official poverty rate the relative poverty rate is available only for 2000 for these countries for discussion and comparison of alternative poverty measures across countries see timothy smeeding poor people in continued crs5 significant suggesting that countries with higher government spending relative to gdp have lower relative poverty rates not only does the size of the public sector vary among these countries but spending priorities also vary considerably among countries table 2 shows the percentage of government spending devoted to five government functions in 200311 the countries are organized into four blocks the continental european countries the englishspeaking countries the scandinavian countries and japan and switzerland12 the average size of the public sector in each block is about what would be expected see figure 1 the scandinavian countries with their large welfare systems have the largest public sector with government spending equivalent to about 53 of gdp the englishspeaking countries which are more market oriented have smaller public sectors that are equivalent to about 38 of gdp the continental european countries fall between these two extremes the public sectors in japan and switzerland are about the same size as the public sectors in the englishspeaking countries surveyed although the overall size of the us public sector is not much different from that of other englishspeaking countries us spending priorities are very different first the united states devotes much greater share of government expenditures to defense than any other country13 part of this is due to the role the united states military plays in protecting europe and japan second the us allocates larger proportion of government expenditures for health and education than do most countries lastly the share of government spending in the united states devoted to social protection is less than in other industrial countries14 10 continued rich nations the united states in comparative perspective luxembourg income study working paper 419 oct 2005 11 important government functions not listed include public order and safety environmental protection and economic affairs among others 12 data on government expenditures by function are not available for australia canada and switzerland 13 defense spending includes military spending civil defense including the national guard and armories foreign military aid and defense rd spending 14 social protection includes social welfare expenditures such as oldage benefits and other transfers it also includes the administrative costs associated with these programs grants for research related to social protection and benefits to victims of natural disasters crs6 table 2

benefits paid by all levels of government to individuals families and households providing support to maintain welfare and are major component of social protection expenditures in the united states these expenditures are provided by such programs as social security supplemental security income temporary assistance for needy families unemployment insurance medicaid medicare food stamps and the earned income tax credit at the federal level most mandatory spending would be included in public social welfare expenditures public social welfare expenditures vary from country to country almost as dramatically as total government expenditures figure 2 shows public social welfare expenditures as percentage of gdp for the 21 countries in 2001 the latest year for which these data are available the marketoriented englishspeaking countries tend to have social welfare expenditures equal to about 15 of gdp whereas the welfare state scandinavian countries spend much more typically about 25 of gdp

its citizens many social programs especially meanstested public assistance crs8 programs have disincentive effects which can affect the economy15 providing people with income if they dont work could take productive people out of the workforce thus reducing output there are two sources of disincentives in many social programs first when income increases individuals tend to purchase more goods and services including leisure that is time not working this is called the income effect and has negative effect on work effort second many social programs reduce benefits as an individuals earnings rise this acts as an implicit tax on earnings for example social security has retirement earnings test which reduces social security benefits to beneficiaries who are under the normal retirement age by 1 for every 2 in earnings above an annual earnings limit16 this benefit reduction is comparable to 50 tax rate on earnings above the limit combined with federal state and local taxes the increase in total income may be only few cents for every 2 earned the price an individual pays for leisure is forgone wages as the wage rate falls because of implicit and explicit taxes the price of leisure falls and the individual will typically work less that is purchase more leisure this effect is called the substitution effect in the case of most social programs both the income and substitution effects act to reduce the work effort of beneficiaries for example research has shown that unemployed workers receiving unemployment insurance tend to remain unemployed longer than other unemployed workers17 in addition social security beneficiaries subject to the retirement earnings test have been found to limit work hours to keep their annual earnings below the earnings limit18 removing workers from the workforce however could boost productivity in two ways first the principle of diminishing marginal returns suggests that as the workforce is reduced holding the amount of other inputs constant both marginal and average productivity will increase19 second some argue that the people receiving these benefits tend to be less productive than current workers consequently economic growth and productivity may not be seriously affected by the provision of social benefits20 for example evidence from oecd countries 15 for discussion of disincentive effects see robert moffitt incentive effects of the us welfare system review journal of economic literature vol 30 1 mar 1992 pp 161 and us general accounting office selfsufficiency opportunities and disincentives on the road to economic

statistics vol 82 1 feb 2000 pp 4863 19 the intuition behind this principle is quite simple as more and more of one input into the production process is used holding the amount of all other inputs constant the increases in output become smaller and smaller and average output per unit of input falls 20 xavier salaimartin positive theory of social security journal of economic continued crs9 shows that higher unemployment compensation is associated with higher productivity21 even though productivity may rise total output may fall as the workforce is reduced figure 3 shows the relation between public social welfare expenditures expressed as percentage of gdp and real gdp growth rates for oecd countries each point represents the data for one of the 21 countries used in this analysis the straight line in the figure shows the fitted linear relationship between the two variables there is slight negative relationship between these two variables suggesting that countries with higher public social welfare expenditures tend to experience lower annual real gdp growth rates22 this relationship however is not very precise in that the scattered data points are not very close to the fitted line23 figure 3 relation between average annual real gdp growth rate and average social welfare expenditures 6 5 real gdp growth rate 4 3 2 1 0 10 15 20 25 30 35 social welfare expenditures as

averages of public social welfare expenditures and annual productivity growth rate as well as the fitted linear relationship is shown in figure 4 in contrast to real gdp growth there appears to be slight positive relation between these two variables the simple correlation is 022 this suggests that countries with higher public social welfare expenditures also tend to have higher productivity

data the evidence so far suggests that public social welfare expenditures do not have large effect on the economy many social programs are perceived as ineffective which prompted president reagan to famously quip that the federal government declared war on poverty and poverty won25 but these expenditures can improve economic wellbeing welltargeted social benefits can be effective in reducing poverty among vulnerable populations26 figure 6 shows the relationship between the 10year average of public social welfare expenditures as percentage of gdp and the relative poverty rate in 2000 the figure shows clear and fairly precise relationship between these two variables countries with higher public social welfare expenditures relative to gdp have lower relative poverty rates27 social welfare expenditures can reduce poverty by 1 increasing income to above the poverty threshold and 2 subsidizing employment and augmenting wages 25 ronald reagan state of the union address jan 25 1988

welfare expenditures as percentage of gdp source crs calculations of oecd data public and private health expenditures social welfare expenditures have effects beyond those on the economy and economic wellbeing but the different components of social welfare expenditures affect different outcomes one large and important component of social welfare expenditures is health care spending since average health outcomes of the population will depend on total health care spending rather than just public health spending both public and private health expenditures will be the focus of attention furthermore although public health spending affects the budget both public and private health spending will affect the economy also since different countries have different ratios of public to private health spending examining both public and private health spending may provide insight into the effectiveness of public versus private spending on average the 21 countries devote the equivalent of about 65 of gdp for government health spending see figure 7 the range is from low of about 5 of gdp in luxembourg to over 8 in germany the united states is at the average of about 65 of gdp the relative rankings change however when private health expenditures are also considered the united states spends considerably more relative to gdp than any other country this is also true when per capita health expenditures are considered total health spending in the united states was equivalent to 146 of gdp in 2002 compared to 112 in switzerland 73 in finland and 62 in luxembourg the 21country average was 90 of gdp crs13 figure 7 public and private health expenditures as percentage of gdp 2002 united states switzerland germany france norway canada australia portugal sweden belgium

calculations of oecd data in general richer countries tend to spend more per person on health care the simple correlation between per capita health expenditures and per capita gdp is 061 which is precisely estimated28 although richer countries spend more on health care health care spending does not appear to be related to either the real gdp growth rate or the productivity growth rate the simple correlations between total health spending and these two economic growth measures are fairly small29 health care coverage in the other countries is either universal or nearly universal in the united states however about 822 of the population has health insurance coverage through an employerprovided plan or government program30 although about 18 of the us population is not covered by health insurance research suggests that the length of time most go without coverage is fairly short typically less than six months and many may be eligible for coverage under the 28 both health expenditures and gdp were converted to us dollars using the purchasing power parities ppps the estimated correlation is statistically significant at conventional confidence levels 29 the correlation of total health spending with the real gdp growth rate is 019 and with the productivity growth rate is 006 neither of these estimates are statistically significant at conventional confidence levels 30 paul

during the year and 9 were uninsured the entire year32 the important feature of health expenditures is not whether or not they affect economic growth but rather whether or not increased expenditures improve health outcomes there is single good measure of health outcomes consequently three measures of health outcomes will be reported the first column of numbers in table 3 presents life expectancy at birth average for men and women in each of the 21 countries by this measure the united states is tied for last with denmark and portugal at 772 years the simple correlation between total health expenditures as percentage of gdp and life expectancy however is small and not precisely estimated there appears to be relationship between these two variables but by age 65 life expectancy for men and women in the united states is about at the average for the 21 developed countries see the next two columns of table 3 the united states also ranks at the bottom in infant mortality33 the market oriented englishspeaking countries tend to have higher infant mortality rates than the welfarestate scandinavian countries the continental european countries japan and switzerland fall between these two extremes lastly the final column of table 3 reports the proportion of low birth weight babies34 japan ranks at the bottom just behind the united states 31 ibid 32 testimony of cbo director douglas

more for health care relative to gdp than any other industrial country but this higher spending does not necessarily translate into better health outcomes looking at the united states over time however shows that increased spending on health care has crs16 improved health outcomes35 but many argue and research suggests that private health spending in the united states is more efficient than public health spending because of poor incentives to control health costs and medical malpractice system that encourages physicians to practice defensive medicine36 tax revenues the major source of funding for government expenditures is tax revenues in general the continental european countries appear to rely on tax revenues as opposed to other revenue sources to slightly greater extent than either the marketoriented englishspeaking countries or the welfarestate scandinavian countries the differences however are not particularly large figure 8 shows tax revenues as percentage of gdp there is of course relationship between tax revenues and government expenditures compare figure 8 with figure 1 countries that spend more also raise more tax revenues37 tax revenues as percentage of gdp in the united states and japan are about half of what they are in sweden 25 compared to 50 the other industrialized countries fall between these two extremes figure 8 total tax revenue as percentage of

proportion of tax revenues from taxes on corporations and from social security taxes38 taxes on goods and services account for 18 to 38 of tax revenues in these countries two relationships stand out first the marketoriented englishspeaking countries appear to rely more heavily on property taxes than the other industrialized countries see the last column of table 4 second countries with higher proportion of tax revenues coming from income and wealth taxes tend to rely less on social security taxes39 38 social security taxes can be paid by both the employer and the employee and are generally based on payroll social security tax revenues are earmarked for social programs such as oldage pensions disability benefits and unemployment assistance 39 the simple correlation is 079 crs18 table 4

they affect work effort investment and saving the effects that taxes have on individuals can be decomposed into the income and substitution effects an increase in the tax on most goods for example has negative income and substitution effect and individuals will typically wish to purchase less of the good an increase in taxes on wages will have income and substitution effects that work in opposite directions crs19 the tax lowers the effective wage which will typically cause people to want to work less40 but the tax also reduces income which will typically cause people to want to work more the ultimate effect on work effort depends on the relative magnitudes of these two effects similar income and substitution effects also apply to saving consequently peoples behavior may change due to tax changes the distortions introduced by taxes can lead to misallocation of resources and lost output the misallocation of resources due to taxes can be measured by the excess burden or deadweight loss of the tax most researchers find deadweight loss from taxes but there is little agreement on the size of the deadweight loss41 yewkwang ng points out that the estimated deadweight loss may be considerably less if the positive effects on the spending side are taken into account42 he also argues that the income taxes themselves may be correcting distortion in the economy and could lead to more efficient allocation of resources for example most economic measures ignore the social goal of environmental quality if there is positive relation between per capita income and environmental degradation then income taxes may reduce this distortion figure 9 shows the relationship between total tax revenues as percentage of gdp and the average real gdp growth rates in the industrialized countries both are 10year averages the figure shows that there is relation since the fitted linear relationship the straight line in the figure is almost flat43 this suggests that countries with high tax revenues relative to gdp do not generally experience lower economic growth rates than countries with lower tax revenues 40 leisure not working can be thought of as normal good with price equal to the wage if the price of leisure falls workers will typically want to purchase more leisure and work less 41 the size of the deadweight loss depends on the extent to which behaviors change as result of the tax see for example robert carroll do taxpayers really respond to changes in tax rates evidence from the 1993 tax act us treasury department office of tax analysis working paper 79 nov 1998 jon

revenues relative to gdp also tend to have higher productivity growth rates tax policy can affect economic growth through several channels which may to some extent offset each other but even with these various channels some argue that tax cuts will stimulate longterm economic growth44 the bulk of the evidence however suggests that tax policy per has had at best small effect on economic growth martin feldstein finds that the 1981 tax cut had very little impact on economic growth45 using data from oecd countries charles garrison and feng yao lee can find evidence that increasing tax rates adversely affects economic growth46 fabio padovano and emma galli also using oecd data reach the opposite conclusion and state that high marginal tax rates and tax progressivity are 44 see for example

tax revenue as percentage of gdp source crs calculations of oecd data the observation that taxes may have little effect on economic growth may be partially due to government spending tax revenues are either spent or are used to retire government debt both of which may boost economic growth many studies do not separate the effects of government spending on economic growth from the effects of taxes in addition some researchers argue that the welfare states tend to rely on regressive taxes as primary source of revenue and these taxes tend to have smaller 47 fabio padovano and emma galli tax rates

issue 2002 and nancy l stokey and sergio rebelo growth effects of flatrate taxes journal of political economy vol 103 3 jul 1995 pp 519550 the authors find that growth rates in per capita real gdp were just as high after large increase in income taxes in the early 1940s as before the increase in addition gale finds that economic growth rates did not change after the introduction of the income tax in 1913 crs22 adverse economic effects than other types of taxes49 peter lindert shows that industrialized countries with higher public social welfare expenditures relative to gdp also tend to have higher average effective tax rates on income higher taxes on consumption and lower taxes on capital he further shows that the welfare states tend to have heavier taxes on consumption goods that may be considered bad such as tobacco products alcoholic beverages and gasoline government budget deficits the evidence presented so far although not definitive suggests that government expenditures social welfare expenditures and taxes do not adversely affect economic growth raising government spending and taxes does not appear to reduce economic growth and reducing government spending and taxes does not appear to enhance economic growth but much of the focus recently and in the past has been on budget deficits especially on how deficits affect longterm economic growth the measure of the budget deficit used is the primary government balance which is government revenues minus government expenditures but excludes interest payments paid to the public the primary balance provides more direct measure of overall government spending and taxes in given period whereas interest payments reflect fiscal actions taken in past years the primary government balance reported here is the 10year average 19942003 expressed as percentage of gdp the 10year average is used because the primary balance fluctuates over the business cycle and different countries tend to be at different points of the business cycle at any given time many scholars argue that longterm budget deficits can have an adverse impact on the economy50 figure 11 suggests that the scholars are correct the figure shows the relation between the primary balance and the average annual real gdp growth rate the fitted linear relationship the straight line is upward sloping and the simple correlation between these two variables is 045 which is statistically significant this suggests that countries with larger primary balance tend to have higher economic growth rates51 recent research on budget deficits in the united states also suggests that sustained budget deficits will impose significant economic costs52 william gale and peter orszag for example project that if the federal budget deficit 49 see peter

government balance 5 4 real gdp growth rate 3 2 1 0 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 primary government balance as percentage of gdp source crs calculations of oecd data conclusion the evidence presented suggests that raising public social welfare expenditures within reason would not harm economic growth and reducing these expenditures would not increase economic growth other research supports this conclusion but changing public social welfare expenditures can have profound effects on economic wellbeing reducing social welfare expenditures would likely increase poverty rates the evidence also suggests that although tax reductions boost the economy in the short term they appear to have little effect on longterm economic growth sustained government budget deficits however are viewed as likely to reduce long term economic growth crs24 data appendix the data used in this report come from various oecd databases which are available online to subscribers the oecd works to make the data comparable across countries most of the data series are available for all the industrial countries considered in the report up to 2003 the data on social welfare expenditures are available only up to 2001 however monetary values for expenditures and revenues are in the currency of the country most of the tax and expenditures data are expressed as percentages of gdp this will provide measure of the resources used or transferred by the government relative to the amount of resources available in the economy government spending and revenues vary over the course of the business cycle and some of this variation may not reflect decisions made by the government the 10year averages are calculated for most of the economic series and these averages are used in the report to average out the effects of business cycle fluctuations in the few instances when monetary values need to be compared across countries the values are converted to us dollars using purchasing power parities ppps ppps convert currency by equalizing the purchasing power of various currencies ppps capture price differences of market basket of goods between countries rather than differences in the value of the currencies that is exchange rates exchange rates fluctuate based on the supply of and demand for currency and can change even when prices are stable in the two countries for other versions of this document see
