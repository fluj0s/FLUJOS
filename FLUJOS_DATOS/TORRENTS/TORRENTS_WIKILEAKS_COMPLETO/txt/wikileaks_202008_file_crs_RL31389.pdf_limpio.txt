afghanistan s role as host to osama bin laden and other antiwestern islamic rrorists requires not only the defeat of the taliban but also the reconstruction of stable effective and ideologically moderate afghan state otherwise the country could continue to be potential base for terrorism and source of regional instability an important milestone was achieved in june 2002 with the generally successful conclusion of an emergency loya jirga grand council which confir med hamid karzai an ethnic pa shtun member of the western educated elite with family ties to the former king as head of transitional administration karzai who previously headed an interim administration formed in december 2001 is charged with organizing government supervising the drafting of constitution and preparing for nationa l elections to be held in december 2003 the loya jirga failed to satisfy many of the participants especially pashtuns who feel underrepresented in distribution of cabinet ministries but more than 1500 afghans from all ethnic groups and walks of life had an opportunity to vent long pent up feelings and engage in free flowing debate about the countrys future karzai has gained the nominal support of major regional warlords but his authority remains dependent on support from th militarily powerful ethnic tajik minority and his status as broadly acceptable figure who can attract international assistance the bush administration and the congress have indicated strong support for humanitarian relief and recons truction but the nature of the longer term us role remains to be deter mined as of mid2002 the administration remained focused on the military campaign and resistant to extensive participation in nation building stance some in congress say is too limited in reality us forces have repeatedly played facto peacekeeping role in defusing conflicts among afghan allies and have sometimes become embroiled in local power struggles some afghan warlords have been accused of causing mistaken att acks on civilians or prokarzai groups by providing false intelligence to american forces major obstacles to the goal of stable and ideologically moderate afghan state include longstanding power aspirations of rival tribal and ethnic groups the long term decline of afghan state institutions that began with the communistsoviet occupation decade of 1979 89 and accelerated under the taliban the recent rapid increase in opium production and local power struggles for control of the lucrative drug trade and the resiliency of politicized islam as promoted both by the taliban and other radical islamist parties which retains appeal to many afghans stable and ideologically moderate afghanistan is unlikely to be constructed without significant nearterm aid to rees tablish security re lieve immediate economic distress and provide alternat employment for former combatants and extensive and longterm reconstruction suppor t from bilateral nd multilateral aid donor

moderate state focus and scope of this report the usled effort to end permanently afghanistans role as base for anti western islamic terrorists re quires not only the defeat of the talibanwhich has been achieved through american allied and afghan military action but also the reconstruction of stable effective and ideologically moderate afghan state otherwise the country could again become base for terrorism failure to achieve stability in afghanistan is also likely to have wider repercussions for the stability of pakistan and the central asian states unlike 1989 when the us government cl osed its embassy in kabul only ten days after the withdrawal of the last soviet forces the bush administration has concluded that the united states has major stake in the creation of stable afghanistan and that it cannot be left to the armed afghan contenders for power alone to decide the countrys future th administration has not yet given detailed indication of what longerterm role it envisions for the united states in the political economic and social recons truction of afghanistan beyond current plans for emergency food and agricultural assistance assistance in the formation of new national army and anti narcotics aid however both the president and the congress have declared that the united states will play major role in conjunction with nato allies and japan the united nations and international financial institutions to promote economic development and encourage political stability in afghanistan1 the stakes for the united states incl ude denying sanctuary and support for qaeda terrorists maintaining positive influence with nucleararmed and politically unstable pakistan curtailing the massive flow of opiumbased drugs from afghanistan and possibly facilitating the cr eation of an alternative to iran and russia as routes for the export of central as ian oil and gas for all of these reasons the future us role in afghanistan and the adjacent region is likely to be an important focus of interaction between the administration and congress in considering foreign assistance and defense budget priorities and policy issues during the spring of 2002 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31389crs2 congress has strongly supported amer ican involvement in supporting the fledgling government headed by karzai and many of the seve ral dozen members of congress

by the more than half of th current population who were born after the overthrow of the last monarch zahir shah2 bonn accord of december 2001 beginning towards the goal of r econstructing stab and moderate afghanistan was made at an international conference near bonn germany during december 2001 when representatives of vari ous parties and ethnic groups agreed to the creation of an interim administrati on and procedure with timetables for drafting new constitution and establishing within two years an elected government as in the case of unbacked effo rt in 1992 which failed the composition of the delegation was more representative on paper than in reality the 23 signatories to the december 2001 agreement repres ented four antitaliban groups the northern alliance representing the ethnic tajik nd uzbek forces then occupying kabul and other northern cities the rome process representing largely pashtun exile followers of former king zahir shah the cyprus group representing largely shia muslim groups supported by iran and the peshwar group consisting largely of pashtun exile factions with headquarters in peshawar pa kistan of these only the northern alliance which b ecame closely allied with us forces in the campaign against the taliban and qaeda commanded significant military power the composition of the rome and peshawar groups was heavily tilted towards western educated professionals and other members of the former urbanized pashtun elite3 pashtun commanders and local shura governing councils in southern afghanistan the home base of the taliban we re

written in the arabic script and in many cases the sounds can only be approximated in english spelling this creates considerable inconsistency pashto often is written pushtu and speakers of that language are variously identified as pashtuns pushtuns or even paktuns mainly in the dialect of the border region with pakistan this report uses pashto and pashtuns the forms most commonly used by the us and british media including the voice of america and the bbcdevelopment of the afghan state under the durrani pashtun monarchy one way to envision the circumstances that might support the creation of stable and moderate afghan state is to c onsider the countrys past political history and the factors that in the past have enhanced or undermined stability and modernization the establishment of afghan istan as nation st ate dates essentially from 1747 when ahmad shah durrani tribal pashtun4 chief of the sadozai line of the abdali tribe gained election by his tribe as the ruler amir of territories approximating the present boundaries of af ghanistan under the durrani ascendancy afghanistan experienced all the vicissitude s of dynastic chance and survived as political entity largely as buffer stat whose northern and southern boundaries conformed to the high water line of the expanding british and russian empires and the periodically resurgent iranian empire in the 20th century afghanistan teetered between bursts of western and soviet aided modernization and recurre nt reaction spearheaded by the twin sources of rural power in the pashtun heartland secular leaders including tribal chieftains local notables or commanders and muslim clerics of various kinds including mullahs and influential pirs spiritual leaders of the mystical sufi islamic sects which predominate in afghanistan and southern asia in many respects the traditional local power structure outside of kabul and few other population cen ters approximated that in the rural preindustrial west w ith men of property or learning exercising governmental power and clergy providing spiritual guidance moral authority and often local political influence in general modernization progressed faster among two sections of the population tajiks and uzbeks in the rth who practiced settled agriculture or carried on commerce and the more cosmopolitan persianized residents of kabul of various ethnic origins including detri balized pashtuns the traditional pashtun tribes of southern afghanistan many of whom are or were nomadic have been more resistant to centralization and modernization but nonethel ess have long thought of themselves as the real afghans pashtun dominance has long been sour ce of resentment among afghanistans minority groups the tajiks uzbeks and haza ras both the afghan tajiks and those in tajikistan have linguistic and cultural connections with iran but usually not religious in matters of religion the tajiks like the pashtuns follow the sunni school of islam the larger of the two main islamic divisions the uzbeks have ethnic and linguistic connections to uzbe kistan and central asia and are also sunn i muslims the hazaras are shia muslim minority with ethnic ties to central asia and religious ties to iranhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31389crs6 5 pashtuns marginalised sic at bonn meeting megastories from outthere news nov 27 2001http wwwmegastor

enforced puritanical version of islam and relied on assistance from qaeda and other foreign supportersfled in face of us bombing and attacks by antitaliban forces growth of national institutions under zahir shah 19331973 the modern afghan state reached its apogee in manner of speaking under zahir shah who ascended the throne in 1933 following the assassination of his father mohammad nadir shah mindful of the fate of his predecessors who were perceived as having sacrifi ced the countrys interests to obtain foreign support or as having too aggressively cha llenged the power of the tribal chiefs and mullahs zahir shah attempted cautious modernization pr ogram while keeping judicious distance or so it seemed at the time from both the united states and the soviet union while accepting aid from both political tensions arising out of modernization8 as in the case of the former shah of iran zahir shahs efforts to promote modernization inadvertently fostered the creation of new social and political forces which ultimately undermined hi s rule zahir shah was nd remains something of an enigma he ascended the throne at age 19 and for thirty years largely left the government in the hands of relativesfirst by uncles til about 1953 and later by his cousin prime minister moha mmad daoud perhaps too late zahir shah finally took charge of the government in 1963 after daouds policy of hostility towards pakistan see below led that country to close th common border cutting of afghanistans southern trade links and devastating the ec onomy despite his effort to reduce the role of the royal family and his promulgation of new constitution with some limited democratic features notably an elected but partyless bicamer parliament with limited powers to check and balance the executive authority zahir shahs liberalization program was stillborn this outcome generally has been attributed to the kings lack of assertiveness and the fear of the countrys social and economic elite of being displaced by popularly elected leadershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31389crs10 9 politically it has been said that new educated and professional classes had failed to see that they had stake in the reforms having been given too little responsibility to develop selfdiscipline and too little power to be totally committed nancy peabody newell and richard s newell the struggle for afghanistan ithaca and london cornell university press 1981 p 44 10 ibid p 45among other accomplishments zahir shah and his new advisors and officials extended the reach of the central government by expanding the army and the national police system enlarging the functions of the civilian bureaucracy expanding the national educational system and bringing central government presence down to the local level although these developments helped to strengthen the state and weaken tribalism their net effect was not wholly positive the army and police were widely regarded as repressive and the bureaucracy and local governmental apparatus were said to be corrupt grasping incompetent and dominated at the upper levels by the kings relatives the latter years of zahir shahs reign brought significant economic modernization but not enough to take afghanistan out of the ranks of the least developed countries on the positive side the middle class in kabul and other cities swelled from an estimate of fewer than thousand at the end of world war ii to almost 100000 by the early 1970s but public frustration grew over the fact that the government bureaucracy was not up to the task of managing and maintaining the economic and physical infrastru cture provided by aid donors9 rise of marxist and radi cal islamist conflict the political opening provided by the 1964 constitution boosted the aspirations of both small leftist intelligentsia and radical islamic counterparts the marxist peoples democratic party of afghanistan pdpa was founde d on january 1 1965 with the explicit goal of contesting the elections held that ear under the new constitutionelections that were officially partyless the radical leftists tended to dominate parliamentary proceedings while moderates who had mo re to lose remained cowed by political repression most of the major figures who later served in the sovietbacked marxist regime notably nur mohamad taraki fizullah amin and babrak karmal were active in the first elected parliament10 the emergence of the radical left was paralleled by the growth of radical islamist movement starting with the foundation of the organization of muslim youth at kabul university in the mid1960s the islamists reacted not only to the rise of the left but also to the long tr adition of cooption of muslim clerics by the government soon after emerging both the marxists and the islamic right split along primarily ethnic lines the pdpa wa s divided between largely pashtun kalq masses movement under taraki and amin and more urban and moderate parcham flag wing under karmal the split in the islamist ranks was both ethnic and generationalbetween the followers of professor burnha nuddin rabbani tajik religious scholar who founded the jamiatiislami islamic society

the leader in an even more radical organization the hezbiislami islamic party both the leftists and the islamists adopted similar authoritarian leninist style forms of party organization11 zahir shahs counterproductive foreign policy afghan foreign policy under zahir shah was characterized by two mutually reinforcing policy pillars that greatly influenced afghanistans subsequent political history the first was the dogged pursu it of the cause of pashtunistan or paktunistan in the dialect of southeast afghanistan and among pakistani pashtuns popular campaign for the return of ethnic pashtun territories previously ceded to british india these territories became part of pakistans northwest frontier province after pakistan and india gained independence in 1947 but remained loosely tied to afghanistan through trade nom adic grazing and family connections12 the second foreign policy pillar was the effort to reap maximum gains from the east west cold war by playing one superpower off against the other chronically strained relations with pakistan the paktunistan campaign was pursued with particular intensity durin g the period 1953 to 1963 when the kings cousin mohammad daoud served as prime minister the diplomatic agitation and frequent border in cidents led to chronic strains in pakistanafghan relations including periodic closures by pakistan of the common border driving afghanistan deeper into dependence on the soviet union for aid trade and military support ultimately daouds policies so harmed the afghan economy that the king sought and received his cousins resignati on decade later daoud would overthrow the monarchy and make himself pres ident of the first afghan republic13 rising soviet and declining us influence the conjunction of afghan irredentism

that the antisoviet campaign by the afghan mujahidin would contribute to the forging of new sense of afghan na tionhood but the war actually had the opposite effect instead of coalescing around common cause the par ticular circumstances of the conflict intensified the existing ethnic tribal religious and ideological divisions of the society and intensifie d power rivalries among individual leaders several aspects of the antisoviet war period were particularly divisive and continue to impede nationa l reconciliation today one was the boost given to islamic extremism which developed in context of ideological conflict with westerneducated secularists and personal power rivalries at bottom the rise of radical versions of islam had roots in reaction against modernization and rising western influences associated with what some islamists viewed as corrupt and decadent monarchy and against the marxists although the antisoviet mujahidin ofte n were perceived as backward albeit admirably dedicated tribesmen most of the principal islamist political leaders in the antisoviet war in afghanistan were men of education and social position more than half of the seven leaders of the socalled peshawar lliance that was headquartered in peshawar pakistan durin g the antisoviet conflict were university educated18 by and large however real power in the antisoviet resistance tended to flow to younger leaders with an islamist orientation but secular background such as gulbuddin hekyatyar and ahmad shah ma sud who had organi zational and military skills and who could command or at least support mujahidin in the field last but not least among the sources of division and increasingly important after the pdpa coup in 1978 was the role of number of foreign powers most notably pakistan

following the soviet withdrawal may provide some lessons for th present especially the effort during 1991 and 1992 of benon sevan the representative of the secretary general to broker peace settlement between the na jibullah regime in kabul and the mujahidin the final version of the plan which had been accepted by most of the parties and commanders and their foreign backers esp ecially pakistan and

and the international community of stable and moderate afghan state will depend on many factors both internal and external most of these factors cannot now be predicted with any certainty but if past

evaluates the prospects of achieving this goal by considering the ma in contributing factors in past periods of comparative stability the status of these factors at present the comparative strength of various claimants to power and four possible scenarios that might result from the actions of internal forces and external actors past elements of stability and current status although many afghans now tend to look b ack to the rein of zahir shah with somewhat rose colored lenses afghanistan did in fact enjoy kind of stability during most of the reign of zahir shah 19331973 even if the conditions that facilitated past stability cannot be recreated it is usef ul to understand what they were if only as an indicator of their pres ence or absence in the current situation also the factors that allowed st ability under zahir shah proved mporary and ultimately led to political instability and the overthrow of the monarchy after three decades of brutal civil war afghanistan today retains fe w of its characteristics under the afghan monarchy or even under daouds republic sources of legitimacy in modern times the king and most senior officials have been members of the durani pa shtun tribe the 1964 constitution which imposed some formal limits on royal au thority nonetheless provided that the succession shall continue in the house of his majesty m ohammad nadir shah20 for most of his reign zahir shahs leg itimacy was perhaps accepted by most of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31389crs18 pashtuns and others who c ounted politically both in kabul and in the countryside by the end of his reign however the legitimacy of the king and his officials was increasingly contested by university student s both on the left and the islamic right and by members of the growing middle and professional classes who were frustrated at being denied meaningful role in nati onal affairs since the overthrow of zahir shah each turn of the political wheel has reduced the legitimacy of the state currently the main sources of legitim acy of the transitional administration with ordinary afghans are karzais pers onal acceptability to disparate elements his ability to attract internati onal support and the promis of future democratic political order opponents of the current government especially current or former taliban radical islamists and warlords do not accept its legitimacy though they may cooperate or avoid ope nly challenging it out of selfinterest karzais connection to the former royal family doe s not by itself convey legitimacy but may appeal to some afghans especially ka bul residents and pashtuns in southern afghanistan who remember better times past among many pashtun royalists he is regarded as turncoat acceptable ethnic balance ethnic and tribal conflict has long been the bane of afghanistan the main fault lin has been between the pashtuns who form plurality of something less than 40 percent of the population and the minority tajiks uzbeks hazaras and others in the best of times the ethnic balance was preserved through kind of informal so cial compact that provided for pashtun control over the main levers of power but left considerable space for the tajiks and to lesser extent the uzbeks to participate in the middle levels of the administration and the army and to dominate the commercial life of kabul and other citieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31389crs19 figure 2 ethnic groups in afghanistan the benefits of the arrangement genera lly did not extend to the hazaras who generally faced considerable discr

the capital this relationship was aided by the fact that relatively few demands were imposed by the central government which carried out limited functions relations between the state nd local forces had become progressively more difficult with the increase of modern ization and economic development the complete breakdown of any semblance of functioning administration starting with the marxist

currently dominate the struggle to define the future of afghanistan most of these tendencies have both positive and negative aspects despite the depth of ethnic and trib divisions all of the contenders for power continue to regard them selves as afghans but pashtun tajik antipathy remains high and pashtuns are especially angry that tajiks hold most of the power in kabul as it did with the taliban the powerful transportation mafia willstrongly support the establishment of government that can secure the highways and confine the coll ection of taxes and customs duties to the border crossings but the government currently has power to provide security and cannot do so until basic power issues are resolved the prospect of 1015 billion in international aid provides substantial

numbering perhaps 100000 largely to north america and europe and the polarization of pashtun society by internal conflict and the rise of the predominantly pashtun taliban the return of king zahi r shah to his country after more than 30 years of exile may lend some support to the political process but cannot restore the previous status quonor is it intended to under the bonn accord bid by relatives of the king and their supporters to give th kingand hence themselvesa direct role in the governance of the country was checked by the exercise of forceful influence by karzai the panjsheri tajik leaders of th northern alliance and reportedly the united states for better or worse the tajiks who are less divided than the pashtuns now appear firmly established in kabul and th northeast and ismail khan another tajik who styles himself emir an arabic word equivalent to prince or ruler and acts independently of the his former northern alliance colleagues has largely uncontested control of herat general dostums control of mazarisharif is being contested but seems insured for the time being on the other hand kandahar jalalabad and other im portant population centers in th pashtun south and southeast show similar coalescence under one leader or group of leaders democratic pluralism necessity not luxury the breakdown of the royalist governing structure and the subsequent inability of either the mujahidin or the taliban to establish stable government suggests strongly that both at the provincial and central levels stability if it is possible seems most likely to come from some form of democratic process after decades of civil war with high level of involvement by nearly the entire society many more afghans have been politically mobilized than ever in the past the idea of returning to traditional autocratic system even benign one seems likely to be rejected by most afghans as discussed below situation involving largely powerless government in kabul coupled with contro

moderation these goals are far more likely to be achieved if the varioushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31389crs26 27 few if any observers believe that the appoi ntment of an aged expatriate pashtun taj

employees afghan police block new minister bbc news june 20 2002 competing groups can agree on workable constitutional model th at provides all of the main ethnic and other interests with fair representation and at least the opportunity to cooperate across ethnic tr ibal and ideological lines to seek to participate in governing majority the future of the afghan state whethe r pluralistic or not depends on number of factors especially the actions of the main afghan contenders for power the policies of neighboring countries with the capac ity to intervene in afghan affairs and those of the united states and the international community at present several different outcomes can be envi sioned four of the more plausible ones are described below in descending order of desirability for the afghans and for us interests 1 transitional regime lead ing to plural istic democracy under present circumstances the most desirable outcome would be the successful formation of broadly repres entative transitional authority leading ultimately to the establishment of pluralistic democracy as envisioned by the agreement reached at bonn in early december 2001 although the june 2002 emergency loya jirga appeared to move the political process in the direction outlined by the bonn agreement number of basic question mark s remain about the nature and effectiveness of the transitional administration and the outlines of the future constitution and political system both the negative lessons of recent history and the attraction of major international aid may cons titute sufficient incentives for cooperation among the current members of the transitional administration in kabul but it is questionable whether these negative and positive incentives will be enough to gain the cooperation of warlords and commanders in the main cities and the provinces likewise an important obstacle to ethnic harmonythe collapse of pashtun political cohesiveness and the related sense of bein g dispossessedis unlikely to be solved by the adjustment of cabinet posts since the tajiks will not willingly give up effective control of the key ministries concerned with defense internal security and foreign affairs27 the best chance of creating government with broadly accepted claim to legitimacy would be one that rests on the foundation of representative legislature 2 northern alliancedominated state the most obvious consequence of the rise and fall of the taliban is the stronger position of the minority ethnic groups of th northern alliance controlling kabul mazarisharif

before lets give him chance carlotto gall and james dao bouyant karzai is sworn in as afghanistans leader new york times june 20 2002 a14their previous internecine conflict and selfserving opportunism remains doubtful at this point some alliance leaders clearly understand that the revival of pashtun power under the banner of the taliban occu rred because of past alliance excesses others notably general dostum and ismail khan still appear to seek to create local fiefdoms and will c ooperate with the other allian ce components only to the extent that it serves their personal power interests the panjsheri tajiks retained their prim acy in the june 2002 northern alliance especially marshal fahim who was conti nued as defense minister and who has been characterized by senior us official as one of the winners coming out of the conclave28 the replacement of yunis qanooni as interior minister by taj muhammad wardak is not viewed as significant reduction of tajik control especially since qanooni was given new post as security advisor in addition to heading the education ministry29 it remains to be seen whether nontajiks appointed to other ministries will actually become part of the governing power structure the karzai administration thus remains at risk of being perceived as simply cover for tajik dominance at the center since the former northern alliance still stands little chance of establishing effective sway ove r the southern pashtun heartland the end result could be facto pa rtition along the lines of the third scenario below 3 disappearance of unified afghan state the complete disappearance of an afghan state which still seems unlikely could occur if current divi sions become unresolvable the regional consequences would be severe it is doubtful whether ne ighboring countries would be able to avoid competing for control or influence over adjacent areas on the afghan side of the border among other consid erations countries challeng ed by islamic extremism or ethnic revolts such as in the case of uz bekistan and tajikista n would not want to allow mans land on their borders russia would have similar interest ie to prevent the overthrow of friendly central asian states or the establishment of havens for chechens and other armed indepe ndence movements in addition if the prospects for afghan unity were to recede russia could decide to give the facto partition push to enhance the prospects that the oil and gas of central asia exits through russia and the loose successor to the soviet union the commonwealth of independent states cis

committee staff pakistan has foresworn any intent to interfere in afghan affairs as part of its current cooperation with the united states but if chaos should ensue islamabad likely would once again deem it necessary to find and support afghan allies who might be able to stabilize the pashtun belt and contest for power in kabul with the northern alliance such potential allies are not now apparent but could emerge out current leaders affiliated with karzai remnants of the taliban orless likely at this pointthe old protege of pakistans interservices intelligence isi organization gulbuddin hekmatyar many analysts and observers are concerne d the current situation looks much like the most benign form of disintegrationie the appearance of unified government but with little real power or resources at its command in addition to regional warlords number of areas are effectivel under the authority of regional or local shuras councils of commanders mullahs and ders from one point of view these bodies represent rough kind of tribal democracy but in many cases they are dominated by rich families andor thos with the most men under arms one particular problem arising out of disintegration is that very little of afghanistan is without significant numbers of minorities hence ethnic cl eansing and voluntary population realignments could create major humanitarian crisis some human rights abuses have already been inflicted on pashtuns living in tajikmajority areas of the north creating thousands of additiona l internally displaced persons idps in refugee camps for in ternal refugees30 the temptation of neighbors to secure their borders and promote the interests of et hnic and religious counterparts would be strong the descent of afghanistan into chao s once again would jeopardize number of important us interests these include access to the oil and gas resources of central asia instability that could spread to the persian gulf further expansion of opium production in afghanistan and the continued use of afghan territory by terrorist groups the already difficult ta sk of maintaining pakistani cooperation against terrorism might become impossible 4 caretaker ward of the international community the potential negative consequences of failure to recreate stable afghanistan could conceivably impel the united states its allies important neighbors such as russia and the international community to seek to set up an afghanstaffed caretaker government backed with fore ign advisors and enough international peacekeepers to maintain security in kabul nd other cities this approach by which international peacekeeping and nationbuilding would become quasipermanent rather than transitional could only work if the afghans themselvesand the warlords in particulardecided that accepting such an effort by the international community was preferable to unending ci vil strife or undesired political outcomes in theory if basic security services and reconstruc tion could be provide d to more densely populated areas afghans outside the reach of the immediate caretaker authority would gravitate to secure areas to seek the benefits of inte rnational support httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31389crs29 31 one model could be the caretaker administ ration in pakistan during 1993 headed by respected pakistani world bank economist the administration headed by moeen qureshi restored stability and prepared the country for new elections after the army had forced the resignation of the president and prime minister owing to power struggle that had created deadlocked government once normal politics resumed so did instability however leading eventually to military takeover led by general pervez musharrafthis scenario likely would require an interim government composed of figures who are acceptable to the major ethnic and other interest groups but who would not themselves be contenders for power31 the most acceptable candidates are likely to be found among the ranks of afghans w ith technocratic qualif ications including former senior civil servants afghan nationals currently or previously with multilateral banks and other professionalsincluding current exiles some of these are already in the transitional cabinet undoubtedly the government would benefit from the assistance of foreign adviso rs either from donor governments or international organizations especially weighing against this option is that given afghanistans history and cu rrent situation such prolonged foreign role could easily become military and political quagmire factors affecting the outcome which if any of these scenarios preva ils likely will be determined by number of key factors some of these are susceptib to external influence others can only be decided by the afghans themselves resolution of disputes on power sharing in the central government little progress can be achieved on other necessary steps until the parties and groups that have the ability to disrupt th process agree on how to share power as of mid2002 it still is not clear that those with the power to disrupt the interim government will cooperate even if stable power bala nce is achieved at the national level the basic instinct of most of the afghan leaders and warlords still is to compete for turf and the opportunities to extract cash from the population in the form of taxes and other levies this will make it very hard to establish effective centralized institutions and extend the reach of th government into the countryside results of the june 2002 emergency loya jirga given the circumstances and obstacles observers generally regard the emergency loya jirga that took place in midjune 2002 as substantially success despite the fact that the sessions were divisive and sometimes chaotic and failed to resolve number of issues concerning powersharing in way that is likely to promote peace and reconciliation there were number of positive aspects to the conclave the assembly easily confirmed karzai as head of the new transitional administration signif icant vote of confidence in his performance to date and tacitly victory for the united states and the

symbolic role new york times june 11 2002 a10a bid by relatives of zahir shah and royalist supporters to drop karzai and promote the candidacy of the exking as president rather than just figurehead was defeated with apparent assistance from us officials32 the delegates engaged in remark ably free and often unruly debate that seems to have brought some gree of satisfaction even to those who saw themselves on the losing end of the outcome islamic extremists evidenced little influence and did not obtainsignificant cabinet representati on although the delegates voted to declare the country an islamic republic despite the presence of numerous regional commanders with retinues of armed followers the conclave featured war of words rather than bullets some 160 appointed women not only participated but were heard frequently in the debates karzai dropped from his cabinet amanullah zadran pashtun formerly minister of tribal affairs whose brother bacha khan zadran notorious warlord has challenged kabuls authority in paktia province the limitations of the meeting also are readily apparent the process for selecting 1501 legates representing 32 provinces and several interest groups and communities was highly uneven and in number of provinces locally powerful warlords reportedly used coercion and even murder to influence delegate selection the outcome reflected continuing domination of the government by two groups who have formed an alliance of conveniencepanjshiri tajiks of the northern alliance and afghans who are associated with the socalled afghan diaspora and who enjoy western support although many of these are detribalized pashtuns with professional backgrounds they are ju st as divided as their tribal cousins and neither groups of push tuns have been able to coalesce in way that would give them meaningful share of power karzais strategy to coopt regiona l warlords by appointing them as vicepresidents appears to ve failed and might even have backfired in the case of haji qadi rs assassination the rejection of the offered posts by ismail khan and general dostum implies their continuing intention to main tain their regional autonomy importantly the delegates failed to reach agreement on any specific plan for creating legislature or deciding whether the country needed true legislature with powers to make w and approve budget or some form of

significant problem is that the families of afghan emigres have grown in the intervening years and in many cases will be too large to be supported by the family farmstead even if it is r eclaimed and brought back into production some level of indus trial development even rud imentary activities such as food processing textile manufact uring and the production of basic farm and household implements would appear necessary to absorb surplus workers and farm labor economic development and the future role islam because most of the afghan combatants have mobilized on the basis of an appeal to islamic sentiment often of radical fundamentalist nature progress towards economic modernization is likely to encounter strong resistance especially with regard to education and the em ployment of women in the workforce nonetheless reconstruction based on the revitalization and modernization of the afghan economy may be the only way to overcome tendencies towards internecine warfare and chaos unless the economy becomes more dyna mic politicized islam is likely to remain the single most powerful ideological force even if radical fundamentalism does not appeal to the majority of afghans assuming that the taliban remain dispersed and do not play visible political role and that other islamist forces remain marginalized religion may not necessarily reemerge as the main rallying cry of anti government forces these are big ifs however the central government may face difficult choices in attempting to prom ote modernization and development along secular lines while not stirring up an islamist reaction httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31389crs32 issues for us policy inevitably us policy will have significant influence on the outcome of the current effort to reconstruct stable afghan state in addition to playing key role in driving the taliban from power in cert with afghan forces on the ground the united states has been the largest donor by far to the feeding programs of the united nations world food program wfp and it is certain to be the among the leading contributors to econo mic reconstruction for the future three roles on the part of the united states would appear extremely critical over and bove humanitarian assistance 1 support for the political process the creation of moderate afghan state requires the establishment of stable political order the cr eation of effective state institutions and the reconstruction of the countrys economic infrastructure and ru ral economy many other countries and international organizations can provide aid technical assistance and even security for kabul and other important cities but most observers believe that only the united states has the international prestige and influence the logistical capabilities and the military power to influence decisively the internal afghan political process the inability of the united nations and humanita rian ngos to stave off afghanistans descent into chaos after the withdrawal of the soviet union makes clear that the reconstruction of moderate afghan state cannot be accomplished without strong us engagement by most accounts the united states played strong behindthescenes role at the june 2002 loya jirga in supporting karzai and shor tcircuiting bid by pushtun supporters of the exking zahir shah to ect him head of state unfortunately the picture of the exking sitting in chair flanked by karzai and us special representative for afghanistan zalmay khalilzad and declaringthrough statement read by his aidthat he would not be ca ndidate tended to rein forced the impression of american interference on the other hand the bid by relatives and supporters of the exking to make elect him head of state was widely viewed as transparent ploy by individuals who are widely regarded as corrupt and out of touch with current afghan realities 2 close engagement with pakistan close us engagement with pakistan th country with the greatest capacity for good or ill will also be critical to the cr eation of stable afghanistan pakistan which by far has the greatest capacity to influence developments in the pashtun south is also the country whose perceived interests are the most threatened by the collapse of the taliban and the rising power of the tajik and uzbekdominated northern alliance islamabad sees several potential sources of danger the primary ones being the possibility of ongoing conflict and chaos in the pashtun belt and heightened indian russian nd iranian influence in kabulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31389crs33 35 cnn fyicom nations pledge billions to rebuild afghanistan

administration and the congress appear to recognize that pakistans military president general musharraf has crossed the rubicon in committing to cooperate closely in the usled anti terrorist campaign the decision which was largely dictated by extreme us pressure was not without number of benefits for pakistan dramatically displayed during musharrafs february 2002 visit to washington apart from various kinds of ne w assistance and debt relief musharrafs crackdown on his own islamic radicals show ed that these groups generally lacked strong public support and strengthened his hold on power on the other hand increasing tensions with india over kash mir fueled by pakistans own alleged support of local terrorist groups has inte nsified islamabads perception of being squeezed between potentially hostile or unstable afghanistan and demonstrably hostile india especially because of the possession of nuclear weapons by both india and pakistan the united states has compelling interest in pressuring both pakistan and india to act responsibly on the kashmir i ssue as was demonstrated during tense standoff in mid2002 while also making sure that pakistan continues to play positive role in afghanistan and in the antiterrorist fight the twin american stakes in cooperation with islamaba d and preventing an indianp akistan appear to mandate the continuing close engagement with pa kistan including efforts to promote support for us viewpoints among parties and lead ers who are likely to influence pakistani policies if and when military rule gives way to elections and the restoration of civilian government 3 bilateral assistance and pa rticipation in international assistance and development efforts both the bush administration and the congress have made clear their intention to provide substantial aid to afghan istan but the actual amount and kind of assistance that the united states provide s could prove highly important to the prospects for recreating stable afghan government the tokyo meeting of aid donors in january 2002 which was cohosted by japan the united states the european union and saudi arabia genera ted nearly 15 billion in nearterm aid pledges including us commitment of 296 million35 the bush administration has allocated about 3113 million for humanitari an assistance to afghanistan for fy 2002 which began october 1 200136 us aid provided through the wfp and ngos will continue to be important in preventing famine reconstructing agriculture and restoring basic infrastructure but visible bilateral american ai d would also appear to be critical to influencing us desired political outcomes in this respect many argue that if the bonn process is to be viable warlords and others who are calculating whether to cooperate with the bonn process or carve out permanent fiefdoms arguably need to see that the interimhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31389crs34 administration and the arrangements for crea ting new pluralistic democratic order have the backing of the united states nd other aid donors observers also note however that it is critical that us support is seen as bringing c oncrete benefits for the country and not just influen ce over the karzai administration conclusion issues for congressional consideration number of assassinations and other incidents of political violence both before and after the emergency loya jirga underscore that events in afghanistan may be coming to head sooner rather than late r as of july 2002 positive developments appear in many cases to be offset by ne gative ones and the overall state of progress becomes matter of individua l judgment or perspective issues of special congressional interest narcotics production and womens rights in hearing statements speeches and in proposed legislation members of congress have stressed their c oncerns particularly about afghanistans status as major opium production area and about the st atus of women both of these are extremely complicated issues given afghanistans social and economic traditions progress on both issues if it is to occu r clearly depends on fundamental economic and social modernization which is most lik ely to occur under government that has both progressive outlook and popular support based on par ticipatory politics narcotics or development the us stake in economic development in afghanistan is even more clear with regard to afghans status as the worlds leading producer of opium many of the poppygrowing areas are the fiefdoms of tribal leaders whose tribes which have for centuries depended on illicit sources of income including drugs and smuggling in the recent past before the taliban takeover international agencies reportedly had some success in gaining cuts in poppy production in nangahar and other poppygrowi ng areas of southeastern afghanistan in exchange for economic assistance but such gains tended to be in consistent at best the karzai administration has announced an ambitious usbacked program to make onetime payments to farmers to destroy their opium crops or face destruction by government agents without compensation the payments are said to amount to something more than for wheat crop but much less than the value of an opium crop reportedly the united states the uk and other western countries have agreed to finance the program but us officials are also said to despair of having any major impact for three major reasons 1 the kabul government simply does not have the staff or reach to have an impact on many of the most important producing areas 2 the crop is nearly ready for harvest and 3 the poppy growers and their affiliated smugglers and warlords will likely fight against any effort to forcefully destroy the crops decree sign ed by chairman karzai on behalf of the interim

tradition the same political conditions that have created support for reactionary religious ideas have foster ed retrogression in the status of women both in the refugee camps and in conflic t areas young men were separated from the company of even their female relatives some analysts believe the lack of ordinary contact with women in the refugee camps across the border in pakistan has heightened sex discriminati on in afghanistan beyond trad itional levels also because of the concerns of women about th eir safety in maledominated society they sometimes themselves embrace the ve il and burka

for possible congressional consideration congress may wish to consider several issues in particular that bear on the ability of the united states to provide time ly and effective ssistance and support to the interim government and the bonn proce ss the first is the reported inability of us representatives in kabul to provide reliable expectations regarding the deliverieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31389crs36 41 see crs report rl30831 balkan conflicts us humanitarian assistance and issues for congress by rhoda margessonof various forms of assistance one sour ce of delay in the delivery of us support to the transitional administration is that funding is scattered over at least six different departments and agencies all of which have their own bureaucratic procedures these bottlenecks have been persistent problem in number of situations including us assistance to bosnia41 it may be possible to bring more order and cohesion to this pr ocess without altering basi c lines of department and agency authority and responsibility which have evolved over long period of time and would be difficult to change tension between dual us objectives from the point of view of afghan politics an even more important issue may be significant level of tension between the objectives of us military operations against taliban and qaeda remnants and the goal of bolstering the pow er of the kabul administration visàvis regional warlords by near ly all accounts us military forces made brilliant use of local afghan militias and other irregular forces thereby advancing the date for the replacement of the taliban government by the interim administration as well as saving many livesamerican allied and afghan unfortunately us military strategy including ongoing operations ina dvertently has tended to bolster the power of some warlords who are resisting the imposition of kabuls authority and also increased the possibility that any renewal of internal conflict will be more intense and deadly start was made in resolving th is contradiction by the recent graduation of the first contingent of new multiet hnic national army but as noted above this will long remain negligible force when compared to those of the regional warlords even those in kabul itself the mistaken air attacks on four villages in uruzgan province in the early hours of july 2 2002 have generated number of calls for reconsideration of us strategy especially the heavy use of air power based on intelligence information provided by local afghan militias and warlords several serious mistaken attacks on civilians including reported karzai s upporters and villages friendly to the government have been blamed at least in part on bad intelligence supplied by local allies of us and other western military forces some suspect that several of these incidents may be the result of deliberate actions by afghan warlords and militia leaders to exact revenge on rivals clearly the us and its western llies cannot operate without intelligence provided by local afghan forces but the use of extremely lethal ordnance makes any error highly costly in human life some analysts and even afghan victims of us air attacks have suggested that too much reliance is being put on standoff air attacks and not enough on using ground troops to reconnoite r or engage suspected targets and verify them

thus far mainly in the neighborhood of kabul internationa l relief officials argue that much more rapid progress could be made in returning both external and internal refugees to their homes if the

the military phase of the war is all but over but that us troops will remain fo r long time in order to keep qaeda and the taliban off balance and prevent them from regaining the initiative under

nd qaeda remnants into an indefinite military occupation afghanistan has histor of reacting harshly to the presence of foreign military forces and interference in afghan politics every local conflict that us forces may defuse has the potential for creating enemies this is an inevitable consequence of peacekeeping but since many ordinary afghans welcome an international presence and the security it provides operating under or other international auspices may provoke less of backlash given many indications from american officials that substantial us forces will remain in afghanistan for long time
