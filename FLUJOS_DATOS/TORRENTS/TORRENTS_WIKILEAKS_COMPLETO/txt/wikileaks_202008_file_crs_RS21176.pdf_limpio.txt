campaign finance law to indian tribes l paige whitaker legislative attorney american law division r sam garrett analyst in american national government government and finance division summary under the federal election campaign act feca indian tribes are subject to contribution limits applicable to persons as defined by the act for the 2008 election cycle these limits include 2300 per electi on to candidate 28500 per year to political partys national committee and 5000 per year to political action committee pac the federal election commissi on fec has found however that fecas 108200 election cycle aggregate limit applicable to individuals as defined by the act does not apply to indian tribes similar to fecas treatment of other interest groups that operate through pacs and are also not subject to an aggregate limit in addition as most indian tribes are unincorporated th ey are not subject to the feca ban on use of corporate treasury funds for contributions and expenditures in connection with federal elections hence unlike corporations most indian tribes are not required to establish pacs in order to participate in federal elections as the result of an fec ruling unlike pacs indian tribes are also not required to disclose the amounts and recipients of any contributions they make with regard to unregulated soft money indian tribes may spend unlimited amounts of money on issue advocacy communications the bipartisan campaign reform act bcra of 2002 made veral significant changes to feca including increasing certain contribution limits from their previous levels bcra also prohibited any person which includes indian tribes from making soft money donations to political parties while feca prohibits corporations and unions from paying for broadcast issue adver tisements that refer to federal candidates within 30 days of primary or 60 days of general election labeled by bcra as electioneering communications unincorporated indian trib are not subject to such

campaigns the term hard money which is not statutorily defined typically refers to funds raised and spent in acc ordance with the limitations prohibitions and reporting requirements of feca3 unlike soft money which will be discussed in the next section hard money may be us ed in connection with or f or the purpose of influencing federal elections under feca hard money rest rictions apply to contribu tions from and expenditures by any person as defined to include an individual partnership committee association corporation labor organization or any othe r organization or group of persons but not including the federal government4 feca provides that person is limited to contributing more than 2000 per candidate per election5 adjusted for inflation to 2300 for the 20072008 election cycle 25000 per year to national committee of political party6 adjusted for inflation to 28500 for the 20072008 election cycle and 5000 per year to pacs7 limits on contributions by and to pacs are not adjusted for inflation feca further provides that an individual is subject to an aggregate limit on all contributions per twoyear ection cycle encompassing ll contributions to federally registered candidates partie s and pacs 95000 per twoyear election cycle with sub limits 37500 to all candidate s and b 57500 to all pacs and parties more than 37500 of which is to state nd local parties and pacs8 as indexed for inflation the 20072008 election cycle limit is 108200 with sublimits 42700 to all candidates and b 65500 to all pacs and parties more than 42700 of which is to state and local parties and pacs in interpreting such statutory provisions the federal election commission fec has consistently found that the acts definition of person includes unincorporated indian tribes thereby subjecting tribes to th 2300 per candidate per election limit the 28500httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21176crs3 9 see federal election commission adviso ry opinion ao 200005 may 15 2000 citing ao 197851 199932 and 199312 where the commission f ound that as pers ons unincorporated indian tribes were subject to the prohibition on contributions by persons with federal contracts if they are engaged in such contracts 10 federal election commission adviso ry opinion ao 200005 may 15 2000 11 for example one commentator estimated that without the aggregate limit an indian tribe in 2000 could contribute 240000 during twoyear election cycle to the two major national parties and their affiliated house and senate campaign committees up to 1 million during an election cycle to the 100 state party committees and distribute as much as 1872000 to every candidate running for the house and senate from the two major political parties edward zuckerman fec lets indian tribes convert government funds to political contributions political finance lobby reporter vol 21 june 14 2000 12 2 usc 441ba 13 2 usc 441bb2c 14 2 usc 441aa1c 15 federal election commission adviso ry opinion ao 197851 sept 1 1978per year limit to national party and the 5000 per year limit to pacs9 on may 15 2000 however the fec found that whereas an uni ncorporated indian tribe is considered person under feca it is not considered an individual and th erefore is not subject to the aggregate electioncycle limit10 as result of that ruling it appears that an indian tribe by making for example an unlimited number of 2300 28500 and 5000 contributions could significantly ex ceed the 108200 aggregate electioncycle limit applicable to individuals11 feca also prohibits corporations labor unions and national banks from using their treasury funds to make cont ributions and expenditures in connection with federal elections12 such entities may however participate in financing federal elections by establishing separate segregated funds so known as political action committees pacs which are permitted to raise voluntary contributions for use in federal elections13 pac contributions are subject to limitations under feca as are contributions from individual citizens and political parties generally as most indian tribes are uninc orporated they are not subject to the feca ban on the use of corporate treasury funds for contributions and expenditures in connection with federal elections accordingly most tribes may make contributions in federal elections directly from their tribal funds without establishing pac this appears to facilitate the ability of indian tribes to make federal election contributions that is while current law limits contribu tions to pac to 5000 per year from any source14 tribe may acquire large amount of funds for use in federal elections more directly ie from its own tribal funds including for example income from tribal enterprises so long as those enterprises are neither incorporated nor government contractors in one key respect the fec treats indian tr ibes differently than pacs although 1978 fec ruling had required indian tribes making contributions to comply with the periodic reporting requi rements of feca15 this requirement was explicitly supercededhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21176crs4 16 federal election commission advisory opinion ao 199511 apr 28 1995 footnote 10 17 politicalmoneyline home page update jan 28 2006 18 2 usc 441aa2a multicandidate committee is defined in 2 usc 441aa4 as political committee that has been registered fo r at least six months has received contributions from more than 50 persons and except for state pa rty committees has made contributions to five or more federal candidates 19 2 usc 441aa2b 441aa1b 20 2 usc 441iaby 1995 agency ruling16 although contributions from tribes must be reported by recipients one must view the fec filings of candidates pacs and parties in order to track the funds given by an indian tribe as well as the irs filings by section 527 political organizations politicalmoneyline found that some 25 million was donated for 2000 20005 federal elections by 212 fede rally recognized indian tribes and that the reporting was made under almost 2000 different variati ons of their names17 thus the ability to track the flow of electionrelated money from indian tribes is more difficult than it is for other large entities several observations ma be made about the ability of indian tribes to spend money in federal elections compared with that of other interest groups which typically operate through pacs like other interest groups i ndian tribes are subject to aggregate limit on their total federal election contributions only individual citizens are subject to this limit unlike an interest group pac however an indian tribe may have more readily available pool of funds that could be used in federal elections that is its own tribal funds as opposed to fund solely comprised of cont ributions that are subject to limitations and source restrictions this dvantage however may be somewhat offset by the 5000 per candidate per election limit applicable to pac which typically qualifies as multicandidate committee18 compared with the 2300 pe r candidate pe r election limit applicable to all other persons including i ndian tribes in one apparent anomaly in feca multicandidate committee may only c ontribute 15000 per year to the national committee of political party wh ereas any other person includi ng an indian tribe may contribute 2500019 or 28500 in the 20072008 election cy cle adjusted for inflation activity not fully regulated by federal law soft money while soft money is not expressly defi ned in federal election law nd regulation strictly speaking it refers to funds that are not regulated by feca ie hard money it may refer to corporate and labor treasury funds that cannot legally be used in c onnection with federal elections but can be used for other specified purposes sometimes referred to as nonfederal funds prior to the enactment of the bipartisan campaign reform act bcra of 2002 pl 107155 march 27 2002 soft m oney often referre d to nonfeca funds raised by the national committees of the two major political parties bcra put an end to this practice by prohibiting national par ties from raising funds not subject to feca whether from individual citizens corporations labor unions or indian tribes20 even after the enactment of bcra however spending on issue advocacy communications remains prominent soft money activity issue advocacy communications are generally paid for by group such as forprofit or nonprofit corporation or labor union for advertisements typically br oadcast on radio or televisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21176crs5 21 prior to the supreme court upholding the constitutionality of bcras regulation of electioneering communications in mcconnell v fec 540 us 93 2003 the prevailing view of the us appellate courts was that supreme court precedent specifically buckley v valeo 424 us 1 1976 mandated that communication contain express words advocating the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate in or der for it to be constitutionally regulated if communication did not contain such express words most courts determined that it could not be regulated effectively overturning such lower court rulings the supreme court in mcconnell held that neither the first amendment nor buckley prohibits bcras regulation of electioneering communications even though ectioneering communications by definition do not necessarily contain express advocacy the court determined that when the buckley court distinguished between express and issue advocacy it did so as matter of statutory interpretation not constitutional command moreover the court announced that by narrowly reading the feca provisions in buckley to avoid problems of vagueness and overbreadth it did not suggest that statute that was neither vague nor overbroa d would be required to toe the same express advocacy line mcconnell 540 us at 189194 22 2 usc 434f3a c 23 2 usc 441bb2 this prohibition does not appear to apply to broadcast ads that would otherwise be considered electioneering communications under bcra if they are paid for by internal revenue code irc 527 or 501c organizations that are unincorporated although 2 usc 441bc2 exempts from the prohib ition irc 527 and 501c4 corporations that pay for ads exclusively with funds provided by individuals who are us citizens or nationals or who are lawfully admitted for permanent reside nce 441bc6 subsequently appears to nullify that exemption by providing that the exception does not apply if the communication is targeted 24 2 usc 434fthat could be interpreted to favor or disfavor certain candidates while also serving to inform the public about policy issue prior to bcra issue advocacy communications were generally unregulated by feca21 therefore indian tribes like corporations labor unions and individuals could spe nd unlimited amounts of money on such communications with the enactment of bcra certain issue ads are now regulated bcra created new term in federal election law elec tioneering communication which describes political ad that refers to clearly identified federal candidate is broadcast within 30 days of primary or 60 days of general ection and if for house and senate elections is targeted to the relevant electorate ie is received by 50000 or more persons in the state or district where the respective house or senate election is occurring22 bcra prohibits the financing of such communicati ons with union or certain corporate funds23 furthermore for permissibl electioneering communicati ons federal election law requires disclosure of di sbursements over 10000 for such communications including identification of each donor of 1000 or more24 therefore while corporations and labor unions are prohibited from engaging in elec tioneering communications it appears that most indian tribes as unincorporated entities may continue to finance such communications subject to th disclosure requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21176crs6 treatment of indian
