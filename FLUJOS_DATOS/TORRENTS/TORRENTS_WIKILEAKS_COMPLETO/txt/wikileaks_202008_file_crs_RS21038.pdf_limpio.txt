that provide some legislative flexibility within such constraints reserve fund provisions grant the chairs of the house and senate budget committees the authority to revise the committee spending allocations and other budget levels after budget resolution has been adopted if certain legislation is reported by the appropriate committee or other conditions are met the fy2002 budget resolution includes nine reserve funds six apply to both chambers one applies only in the senate and two apply only in the house unlike most reserve funds in the past the fy2002 reserve funds do not require that

surplus in any given year through fy2011 this report will be updated as developments warrant background the annual budget resolution establishes the congressional budget for the upcoming fiscal year and at least four ensuing years providing the framework for consideration of subsequent budgetrelated legislation such as direct spending bills appropriations bills and revenue measures it sets forth overall levels of spending and revenues and spending amounts for each of the major functional categories for each year the overall spending amounts are allocated to the committees with jurisdiction over spending1 the house andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21038crs2 1 continued the budget resolution conference report 2 each appropriations committee must report the subcommittee allocations to its respective chamber before any appropriations bill may be considered on the floor the committees may revise their subcommittee allocations at any time as long as the sum of the subdivisions does not exceed the total amount allocated to them 3 for more detailed information on these points of order and their application see crs report 97 865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturno 4 reserve fund provisions may be included in budget resolution under the authority provided by section 301b4 the socalled elastic clause of the congressional budget act of 1974 this section gives congress the option to include in budget resolution other matters and procedures consistent with the purposes of the budget act 5 in some cases the budget resolution overall spending or revenue levels as well as the discretionary spending limits for enforcement purposes in the senate also may be adjustedsenate appropriations committees further subdivide their spending allocations among their subcommittees2 congress may enforce the substantive provisions of the budget resolution through the use of points of order3 generally these points of order prohibit the consideration of any legislation or amendment that would cause violation of the overall levels the committee allocations or the appropriations committees subdivisions for example if the estimated cost of legislation or an amendment would cause committees allocation to be exceeded member may raise point of order against its consideration thus legislation not assumed in the budget resolution generally would be subject to point of order beginning in 1983 budget resolutions have often included reserve funds that provide some legislative flexibility within these constraints4 reserve fund provisions grant the chairs of the house and senate budget committees the authority to revise the committee spending allocations and other budget levels after budget resolution has been adopted if certain legislation is reported by the appropriate committee or other conditions are met5 an example of reserve fund provision from the fy2002 budget resolution is provided in the box below most often in the past they have applied only in the senate and generally have been used to allow for the consideration of deficitneutral legislation that otherwise would be subject to points of order more recently reserve fund provisions usually have applied in both chambers and generally have been used to allow for the consideration of legislation that would use portion of the onbudget surplushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21038crs3 6 the only exception was the internal revenue service irs compliance initiative reserve fund in the fy1995 budget resolution this reserve fund provision required the chairs of the respective budget committees to adjust budget levels to reflect additional spending for irs compliance initiative activities in any fiscal year 7 these are the methods most often used by congress other ways of avoiding the points of order include designating legislation as an emergency requirement or by suspending the budget enforcement procedures with the enactment of declaration of war or joint resolution declaring low economic growth 8 this does not include the fy1999 budget resolution which did not receive final approval by congress in 1998 the senate version of the fy1999 budget resolution included four reserve continuedexample of reserve fund provision fy2002 budget resolution hconres 83 107th congress sec 212 reserve fund for family opportunity act in general subject to subsection b if the committee on finance of the senate or the committee on energy and commerce of the house of representatives reports bill or joint resolution or if an amendment thereto is offered or conference report thereon is submitted that provides states with the opportunity to expand medicaid coverage for children with special needs allowing families of disabled children with the opportunity to purchase coverage under the medicaid program for such children commonly referred to as the family opportunity act of 200 the appropriate chairman of the committee on the budget may revise committee allocations for that committee and other appropriate budgetary aggregates and allocations of new budget authority and the outlays resulting therefrom in this resolution by the amount provided by that measure for that purpose but not to exceed 227000000 in new budget authority and 180000000 in outlays for fiscal year 2002 3035000000 in new budget authority and

legislation described in subsection may not when taken together with all other previouslyenacted legislation except for legislation enacted pursuant to section 211 reduce the onbudget surplus below the level of the medicare hospital insurance trust fund surplus in any fiscal year covered by this resolution although the reserve fund provisions provide the authority to revise the appropriate committee allocation and other budgetary levels if certain conditions are met they do not require the chairs of the respective budget committees to make the revisions6 the chairs have the discretion to use this authority or not if chair does not make any adjustments then legislation or an amendment violating the existing overall committee allocation or appropriations committ ees subdivision levels still may be considered on the house or senate floor by waiving the applicable points of order in the house this may be done by special rule reported by the house rules committee in the senate this may be done by waiver motion under section 904 of the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended which would require the approval of 60 senators7 since 1983 congress has included one or more reserve funds in the budget resolution each year except in 1984 for fy1985 and in 1985 for fy19868 out of the 83 reservehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21038crs4 8 continued funds but the house version included none 9 the number of adjustments related to reserve funds was based on review of the congressional record reserve funds were used from the following budget resolutions fy1984 house and senate fy1989 senate fy1993 senate fy1995 house and senate fy1998 two in the senate and fy2001 two in the house 10 in connection to his national defense review the president submitted request for an additional 185 billion in budget authority and 114 billion in outlays for fy2002 on june 27 2001 11 the cbos update report estimated onbudget surpluses for all fiscal years during the period fy2002 through fy2011 substantially less than its estimates in january 2001 see cbo the budget and economic outlook an update washington august 2001 therefore adjustments are allowed under the provisions of this reserve fundfunds included in budget resolutions since 1983 42 applied only in the senate six applied only in the house and 35 applied in both chambers the fy1995 budget resolution adopted in 1994 included the most reserve funds 13 with 11 of them applied only in the senate about twothirds or 55 of the reserve funds since 1983 did not specify the amount of any revisions to the committee allocations however in most of these cases the reserve fund provision required that the legislation not cause an increase in the deficit thus for example any increase in spending had to be offset by reduction in other spending an increase in revenues or combination of the two the remaining 28 limited any revisions to specific amount as in the case of the example reserve fund presented in the box above although the reserve funds have been available to revise the committee spending allocations and other budgetary levels congress seldom has used them in the senate out of the 77 reserve funds available only six were used in the house out of the 41 reserve funds available only four were used9 reserve funds in the fy2002 budget resolution the fy2002 budget resolution includes nine reserve funds see table 1 six apply to both chambers one applies only in the senate and two apply only in the house most reserve funds are for single purpose or specific legislation but the two that apply only in the house provide for multiple purposes further most reserve funds specify an amount which the adjustments may not exceed two out of the three reserve funds that do not specify an amount however are not openended first the senate reserve fund for additional defense spending ties the adjustments to the recommendations of the presidents national defense review10 second the additional tax cuts and debt reduction reserve fund in the house ties the adjustments to any additional onbudget surplus estimated by the congressional budget office cbo in its budget and economic outlook update that exceeds the onbudget surplus amount estimated in its january 2001 budget and economic outlook report11 unlike most reserve funds in the past the fy2002 reserve funds do not require that any spending increases be offset with other spending reductions revenue increases or combination of the two instead with the exception of the medicare reform reserve fund the fy2002 reserve funds require that the cost of any applicable legislation whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21038crs5 12 the revenues and outlays of the social security trust funds and the transactions of the us postal service fund are offbudget and thus are not included for purposes of calculating the on budget surplus 13 usually the budget resolution baseline would be cbos revised baseline published in march of each year since the presidents budget was not submitted until april 2001 cbo did not publish its revised baseline until may after the budget resolution was adopted therefore the fy2002 budget resolution was based on cbos preliminary baseline published in january however the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report to the budget resolution states the conferees intention that the chairs will enforce the budget resolution with respect to appropriations measures consistent with cbos revised baseline see us congress committee on conference conference report to accompany hconres 83 hrept 10760 107th congress 1st session washington may 8 2001 p 86 14 the adjustment increased the house agriculture committees spending allocation by 28492 billion in additional budget authority and 25860 billion in additional outlays for the period of fy2002 through fy2006 see the house budget committee chairs remarks in the congressional record daily edition vol 147 of october 3 2001 at pp h6175h6176 and h6237combine d with previouslyenacted legislation may not reduce the onbudget surplus below the amount of the medicare hospital insurance trust fund surplus in any given year through fy201112 the updated estimates of the onbudget surplus by the office of management and budget and cbo this summer have raised concerns about whether the onbudget surplus already has dipped below the amount of the medicare hospital insurance surplus effectively preventing any adjustments related to the reserve funds with the exception of the medicare reform reserve fund however the house and senate budget committees historically have used the cbo baseline underlying the budget resolution to make these determinations rather than cbos updated baseline13 the chairs of the respective budget committees as well as congress as whole will need to decide whether the updated on budget surplus outlook warrants using the updated baseline in applying the medicare hospital insurance surplus contingency provision on october 3 2001 in accordance with the authority provided by the agriculture reserve fund provision in the fy2002 budget resolution the chair of the house budget committee adjusted the house agriculture committees spending allocation to accommodate the farm security act of 2001 hr 264614 as of october 2001 the chair of the senate budget committee has not made any revisions and the chair of the house budget committee has not made any additional revisions to committee spending allocations or other budget levels related to the fy2002 reserve fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21038crs6
