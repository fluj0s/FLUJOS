capture and sequestration ccs summary carbon capture and sequestra tion or storage known as ccs is attracting interest as measure for mitigating global climate change because potentially large amounts of carbon dioxide co2 emitted from fossil fuel use in the united states could be captured and stored underground ectricitygenerating plants are the most likely initial candidates for ccs because they are predominantly large singlepoint sources and they contribute appr oximately onethird of us co2 emissions from fossil fuels congressional interest is growing in ccs as legislative strategy to address climate change the 110th congress passed hr 6 the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 whic h expands the department of energy doe carbon sequestration program and au thorizes more than 22 billion for research and development through fy 2013 congress appropr iated 120 million for ccs rd at doe in fy2008 50 increase above the request although half the amount authorized under pl 110140 doe is requesting 1491 million for its ccs rd program in fy2009 25 incr ease over the fy2008 ppropriated level at issue for congress is whether the ccs program at doe will

provisions that would pr ovide other incentives for deploying ccs approaches for capturing co2 are available that can potentially remove 80 95 of co2 emitted from power plant or large industrial source large us power plants currently do not capture large volumes of co2 for ccs owing to the absence of either an economic incentive or requirement to curtail co2 emissions in ccs system pipelines or ships will likely transport captured co2 to storage sites three main types of geological formations ar likely candidates for storing large amounts of co2 oil and gas reservoirs deep saline reservoirs and unmineable coal seams the deep ocean also has huge potential to store carbon however direct injection of co2 into the deep ocean is still experime ntal and environmental concerns have forestalled planned exper iments in the open ocean mineral carbonation reacting minerals with stream of concentrated co2 to form solid carbonate is well understood process but is still experimental as viable process for storing large quantities of co2 doe estimates direct sequestration co sts of between 100 and 300 per metric ton 2200 pounds of carbon emissions avoided using current technologies power plants with ccs would require more fuel and costs per kilowatthour would likely rise compared to plants without ccs in january 2008 doe announced that it was restructuring the futuregen program

reportcarbon capture and sequestration ccs introduction carbon capture and sequest ration or storage known as ccs is capturing carbon at its source and storing it before its release to the atmosphere ccs would reduce the amount of carbon dioxide co2 emitted to the atmosphere despite the continued use of fossil fuels an integr ated ccs system would include three main steps 1 capturing and separating co2 2 transporting the captured co2 to the sequestration site nd 3 sequestering co2 in geological reservoirs or in the oceans as measure for mitigating global climate change direct sequestration is attracting interest because several projects in the united states and abroad typically associated with oil and gas production are successfully injecting and storing co2 underground albeit at relatively small scales also potentially large amounts of co2 generated from fossil fuels as much as onethird of the total co2 emitted in the united states could be eligible for largescale direct sequestration1 fuel combustion accounts for 94 of all us co2 emissions2 electricity generation contributes the largest proportion of co2 emissions compared to other types of fossil fuel use in the united states see table 1 electricitygenerating plants thus are the most likely initial ca ndidates for capture paration and storage or reuse of co2 because they are predominantly large singlepoint sources for emissions large industria l facilities such as cemen tmanufacturing ethanol or hydrogen production plants that produce large quantities of co2 as part of the industrial process are so good candidates for co2 capture and storage3 congressional interest in ccs as part of legislation addressing climate change is growing congress passe d legislation hr 6 the energy independence

direct sequestration is to produce concentrated stream of co2 for transport and storage currently thr ee main approaches are available to capture co2 from largescale industr ial facilities or power plants 1 postcombustion capture 2 precombustion capture and 3 oxyfuel combustion capture for power plants current commercial co2 capture systems could operate at 8595 capture efficiency9 techniques for capturing co2 have not yet been applied to large power plants eg 500 megawatts or more10 postcombustion capture this process involves extracting co2 from the flue gas following combustion of fossil fuels or biomass several commercially available tec hnologie s some involving absorption using chemical solvents can in principle be used to capture large quantities of co2 from flue gases

httpphysicsweborg articlesworld19931commercial electricitygenerating plants currently do not capture large volumes of co2 because they are not required to and there are economic incentives to do so nevertheless the postcombustion capture process includes prove n technologies that are commercially available today and costs can be reasonably estimated for scaling up for largescale application precombustion capture this process separates co2 from the fuel by combining it with air andor steam to produce hydrogen for combustion and separate co2 stream that could be stored th most common technologies today use steam reforming in which steam is employed to extract hydrogen from natural gas11 in the absence of requirement or econo mic incentives precombustion technologies have not been used for power systems such as natural gas combinedcycle power plants precombustion capture of co2 is viewed by some as necessary requirement for coaltoliquid fuel proce sses whereby coal can be converted through catalyzed chemical reaction to vari ety of liquid hydrocarbons concerns have been raised because the coaltoliquid process releases co2 and the end product the liquid fuel itself further releases co2 when combusted several bills have been introduced in the 110th congress that would spur coal toliquid fuels that proponents argue would help reduce us reliance on il imports and alleviate strained refinery capacity and as an alternative use for co precombustion capture during the coaltoliquid process would reduce the total amount of co2 emitted although co2 would still be released during combustion of the liquid fuel used for transportationor electricity generation 12 oxyfuel combustion capture this process uses oxygen instead of air for combustion and produces flue gas that is mostly co2 and water which are easily separable after which the co2 can be compressed transported and stored this technique is still considered developmental in part b ecause temperatures of pure oxygen combustion about 3500o celsius are far too high for typical power plant materials13 application of these technologies to power plants generating several hundred megawatts of electricity has not yet been monstrated also up to 80 of the total costs may be associated with the capture phase of the ccs process14 costs are discussed below in more detailhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33801crs7 15 ipcc special report p 29 16 ipcc special report p 181 17 ipcc special report p 31 18 these issues are discussed in more detail in crs report rl33971 carbon dioxide co2 pipelines for carbon sequestra tion emerging policy issues and crs report rl34316 pipelines for carbon dioxide co2 control network needs and cost uncertainties by paul w parfomak and peter folgertransportation pipelines are currently the most common method for transporting co2 in the united states over 2500 kilometers about 1500 miles of pipeline transports more than 40 mtco2 each year predominantly to texas where co2 is used in enhanced oil recovery eor15 transporting co2 in pipelines is similar to transporting petroleum products like natura l gas and oil it requires atte ntion to design monitoring for leaks and protection against overp ressure especially in populated areas16 using ships may be feasible when co2 needs to be transported over large distances or overseas ships transport co2 today but at small scale because of limited demand liquified natu ral gas propane and butan are routinely shipped by marine tankers on large scale worldwide rail cars and trucks can also transport co2 but this mode would probably be unec onomical for largescale ccs operations costs for pipeline transport vary pending on construc tion operation and maintenance and other factors including rightofway costs regulatory fees and more the quantity and distance transporte d will mostly determine costs which will also depend on whether the pipeline is onshor or offshore the level of congestion along the route and whether mountai ns large rivers or frozen ground are encountered shipping costs are unknown in any detail however because large scale co2 transport system in mtco2 per year for example is operating ship costs might be lower than pipeline transport for distances greater than 1000 kilometers and for less than few mtco2 transported per year17 even though regional co2 pipeline networks currently operate in the united states for enhanced oil recovery eor developing more expansive network for ccs could pose numerous regulatory and economic challenges some of these include questions about pipeline networ k requirements econo mic regulation utility cost recovery regulato ry classification of co2 itself and pipeline safety18 sequestration in geological formations three main types of geological formations are being considered for carbon sequestration 1 oil and gas reservoirs 2 deep saline reservoirs and 3 unmineable coal seams in each case co2 would be injected in dense form below ground into porous rock formation that holds or previously held fluids by injecting co2 below 800 meters in typical re servoir the pressure induces co2 to become supercritical relatively dens liquid and thus less likely to migrate out of the geological formation injecting co2 into deep geological formations useshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33801crs8 19 ipcc special report p 31 20 sedimentary basins refer to natural largescal depressions in the earths surface that are filled with sediments and fluids and ar therefore potential reservoirs for co2 storage 21 see httpwwwfossilenergygovprogramssequestrationgeologicindexhtmlexisting technologies that have been primar ily developed by and used for the oil and gas industry and that could potentially be adapted for longterm storage and monitoring of co2 other underground injection appli cations in practice today such as natural gas storage deep injection of liquid wastes and subsurface disposal of oil field brines can also provide information for sequestering co2 in geological formations19 the storage capacity for co2 storage in geological formations is potentially huge if all the sedimentary basins in the world are considered20 the suitability of any particular site however depends on many factors including proximity to co2 sources and other reservoirspecific qualities like porosity permeability and potential for leakage figure 1 is snapshot of current or pl anned projects most are associated with natural gas production as of 2005 that involve co2 storage in geological formations table 2 lists their characteristics the subsections below briefly describe general characteristics of each of the three types of geological formations oil and gas reservoirs pumping co2 into oil and gas reservoirs to boost production enhanced oil recove ry or eor is practiced in the petroleum industry today the united states is world leader in this t echnology and uses approximately 32 mtco2 annually for eor according to doe21 the advantage of using this technique for longterm co2 storage is that sequestration costs can be partially offset by revenues from oil and gas production co2 can also be injected into oil and gas reservoirs that are completely depleted which would serve the purpose of longterm sequestration but without any offsetting benefit from oil nd gas production co2 can be stored onshore or offshore to date most co2 projects associated with eor are onshore with the bulk of us activities in west texas see figure 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33801crs9 source ipcc special

especially in the united states are considered prime candidates for co2 storage for several reasons oil and gas originally trapped did not escape for millions of years demonstrating the structural integrity of the reservoir extensive studies have typically characterized the geology of thereservoir computer models have often b een developed to understand how hydrocarbons move in the reservoir and the models could be applied to predicting how co2 could move and infrastructure and wells from oil and gas extraction may be in placeand might be used for handling co 2 storage some of these features could also be disadvantages to co2 sequestration wells that penetrate from the surface to th reservoir could be conduits for co2 release if they are not plugged properly care must be taken not to overp ressure the reservoir during co2 injection which could fracture the cap rock the part of the formation that formed seal to trap oil and gas and subsequently allow co2 to escape also shallow oil and gas fields those less th an 800 meters deep for example may be unsuitable because co2 may form gas instead of denser liquid and could escape to the surface more easily the in salah project in algeria is the worlds first largescale effort to store co2 in gas reservoir22 see table 2 at in salah co2 is separated from the produced natural gas and then reinjected into th same formation approximately 17 mtco2 are planned to be captured and stored over the lifetime of the project the weyburn project in southcentral canada uses co2 produced from coal gasification plant in north dakota for eor injecting up to 5000 tco2 per day into the formation and recovering oil23 see table 2 approximately 20 mtco2 are expected to remain in the formation over the lifetime of the project table 3 shows that the global potential for co2 storage in oil and gas fields may be 900 gtco2 according to doe potential storage capacity in us oil and gas fields is approximately 80 gtco2

bureau of economic ge ology jackson school of geos ciences university of texas at austin aug 22 2007although deep saline reservoirs have huge potential capacity to store co2 table 3 estimates of lower and upper capac ities vary greatly reflecting high degree of uncertainty in how to measure storage capacity26 actual storage capacity may have to be determined on casebycase basis in addition some studies have pointed out potential problems with maintaining the integrity of the reservoir because of chemical reactions following co2 injection injecting co2 can acidify lower the ph of the fluids in the reservoir dissolving minerals such as calcium carbonate and possibly increasing permeability increased permeability could allow co2rich fluids to escape the reservoir along new pathways and contaminate aquifers us ed for drinking water in an october 2004 experiment researchers injected 1600 tco2 1500 meters deep into the frio formation saline re servoir containing oil and gas along the gulf coast near dayton tx to test its performance for co2 sequestration and storage27 test results indicated that calci um carbonate and other minerals rapidly dissolved following injection of the co2 the researchers also measured increased concentrations of iron and manganese in the reservoir fluids suggesting that the dissolved minerals had high concentrations of those metals the results raised the possibility that toxic metals and othe r compounds might be liberated if co2 injection dissolved minerals that held high c oncentrations of those substances another concern is whether the inject ed fluids with ph lowered by co2 would dissolve cement used to seal the injection wells that pierce the formation from the ground surface leaky injection wells coul d then also become pathways for co2rich fluids to migrate out of the saline fo rmation and contaminate fresher groundwater above approximately six mont hs after the injection expe riment at the dayton site however researchers did not detect any leakage upwards into the overlying formation suggesting that the integrity of the saline reservoir formation remained intact at that time preliminary results from second injection test in the frio formation appear to replicate results from the first experiment indicating that the integrity of the saline reservoir formation remained intact and that the researchers could detect migration of the co2rich plume from the injection point to the observation well in the target zone these results suggest to the researchers that they have the data and experimental tools to move to th next largerscale phase of co2 injection experiments28 unmineable coal seams table 3 shows that up to 200 gtco2 could be stored in unmineable coal seams around the globe according to doe nearly

beds are not thick enough the beds are too d eep or the structural integrity of the coal bed29 is inadequate for mining even if they cannot be mined coal beds are commonly permeable and can trap gases ch as methane which can be extracted resource known as coal bed methane or cbm methane and other gases are physically bound adsorbed to the coal studies indicate that co2 binds even more tightly to coal than methane30 carbon dioxide injected into permeable coal seams could displace methane which could be recovered by wells and brought to the surface providing source of revenue to offset the costs of co2 injection according to doe between 150 and 180 gt co2 could be stored in unmineable coal seams in the united states and parts of canada see table 4 that estimate represents significant increase from estimates for north america provided in the ipcc special report and is significant fraction of the global potential for coal seam storage estimated by ipcc not all types of coal beds are suitable for cbm extraction however without the coal be d methane resource the sequestration process would be less economi cally attractive given economic considerations total co2 storage capacity in north america ma be less than the doe projections unmineable coal seam injection projects will need to assess several factors in addition to the potential for cbm extracti on these include depth permeability coal bed geometry few thick seams not several thin seams lateral continuity and vertical isolation less poten tial for upward leakage and other considerations once co2 is injected into coal seam it will likely remain there unless the seam is depressurized or the coal is mined also many unmineable coal seams in the united states are located near electricitygenerating facilities which could reduce the distance and cost of transporting co2 from large point sources to storage sites carbon dioxide injection into coal beds has been successful in the alberta basin canada and in pilot project in th san juan basin of northern new mexico see figure 1 however commercial co2 injection and seque stration project in coal beds is currently underway without ongoing commercial experience storing co2 in coal seams has significant uncertainties compared to the other two types of geological storage discussed according to ipcc unmineable coal seams have the smallest potential capacity for storing co2 globally compared to oil and gas fields or deep saline formations however doe indi cates that unmineable coal seams in the united states have nearly double the capacity of oil and gas fields for storing co2 the discrepancy could repres ent the relatively abundant u s coal reserves compared to other regions in the world or might also indicate the uncertainty in estimating the co2

acknowledges that the data sets are not comprehensive table 4 shows the estimates broken down by the three types discussed bove oil and gas reservoirs deep saline formations and unmineable coal seams table 4 indicates lower and upper range for sequestration potential in deep saline formations and for unmineable coal seams but only single estimate for oil and gas fields the carbon questration atlas explains th at range of sequestration capacity for oil and gas reservoirs is not provided in contrast to deep saline formations and coal seams because of the relatively good understanding of oil and gas field volumetrics32 although it is widely accepted th at oil and gas reservoirs are better understood primarily because of the long history of oil and gas exploration and development it seems unlikely that the capacity for co2 storage in oil and gas formations is known to the level of pr ecision stated in the carbon sequestration atlas it is likely that the estimate of 824 gtco2 shown in table 4 may change for example pending the results of largescale co2 injection tests in oil and gas fields the carbon sequestration atlas was compiled from estimates of geological storage capacity made by ven separate regi onal partnerships governmentindustry collaborations fostered by doe that each produced estimates for different regions of the united states and parts of ca according to doe geographical differences in fossil fuel use and sequest ration potential across the country led to regional approach to assessing co2 sequestration potential33 the carbon sequestration atlas reflects some of the re gional differences for example not all of the regional partnerships identified unmineable coal seams as potential co2 reservoirs other partners hips identified geological formations unique to their regions such as organicrich shales in the illinois basin or flood basalts in the columbia river plateau as other types of possible reservoirs for co2 storage

approximate ly 50 times the amount of carbon stored in the atmosphere and nearly 20 times th amount stored in plants and soils34 the oceans today take up act as ne t sink for approximately 17 gt co2 per year and have stored appr oximately onethird or more than 500 gtco2 of the total co2 released by humans to the atmosphere over the past 200 years35 over time experts predict that most co2 released to the atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion will eventually be absorbed in the ocean but the rate of uptake depends on how fast the ocean mixes the surface waters with the d eep ocean process that takes decades to centuries injecting co2 directly into the deep ocean is considered potentially viable process for longterm sequestrati on of large amounts of captured co2 the potential for ocean storage of captured co2 is huge on the order of thousands of gtco2 but environmental impacts on marine ecosyst ems and other issues may determine whether large quantities of captured co2 will ultimately be stored in the oceanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33801crs18 36 ipcc special report p 285 37 co2 hydrate is crystalline compound formed at high pressures and low temperatures by trapping co2

immobilizing the co2 as dense liquid or solid co2 hydrate37 deep storage in ocean bottom sediments below 3000 meters in depth might potentially sequester co2 for thousands of years38 limitations to

over the entire ocean the most significant and immediate effect would be the lowering of ph increasing th acidity of the water lower ph may harm some ocean organisms depending on the magnitude of the ph change and the type of organism actual impacts of deep sea co2 sequestration are largely unknown however because scientists know very little about deep ocean ecosystems40 environmental concerns led to the cancellation of the largest planned experiment to test the feasibility of ocean sequestration in 2002 scientific consortium had planned to inject 60 tco2 into water over 800 meters deep near the kona coast on the island of hawaii environmental organizations opposed the experiment on the grounds that it would acidify hawaiis fishing grounds and that it would divert attention from reducing greenhouse gas emissions41 similar but smaller project with plans to release more than 5 tco2 into the deep ocean off the coast of norway also in 2002 was cancelled by the norway ministry of the environment after opposition from environmental groups42 mineral carbonation another option for sequestering co2 produced by fossil fuel combustion involves converting co2 to solid inorganic carbonates such as caco3 limestone using chemical reactions this process known as weathering also occurs naturally but takes place over thousands or millions of years the process can be accelerated by reacting high concentration of co2 with minerals found in large quantities on the earths surface such as olivine or serpentine43 mineral carbonation has the advantage of sequestering carbon in solid st able minerals that can be stored without risk of releasing carbon to the atmo sphere over geologic time scales mineral carbonation involves three major activities 1 preparing the reactant minerals

mineral carbonation is well understood and can be app lied at small scales but is at an early phase of development as technique for sequestering large amounts of captured co2 large volumes of silicate oxid minerals are needed from 16 to 37 tonnes metric tons of silicates per tco2 sequestered thus largescale mineral carbonation process needs large mining ope ration to provide the reactant minerals in sufficient quantity44 large volumes of solid material would also be produced between 26 and 47 tonnes of materials per tco2 sequestered or 50100 more material to be disposed of by volume than originally mined because mineral carbonation is in the research and experimental stage reasonably estimating the amount of co2 that could be sequestered by this technique is difficult one possible geologi cal reservoir for co2 storage major flood basalts45 such as those on the columbia river plateau is being explored for its potential to react with co2 and form solid carbonates in situ in place instead of mining crushing and milling the reactant mineral s as discussed above co2 would be injected directly into the basalt formations and would react with the rock over time and at depth to form solid carbonate minerals large and thick formations of flood basalts occur globally and may have characteristics such as high porosity and permeability that are favorable to storing co2 those characteristics combined with tendency of basalt to react with co2 could result in largescale c onversion of the gas into stable solid minerals that would remain underg round for geologic time one of the doe regional carbon sequestration pa rtnerships is exploring the possibility for using columbia river plateau flood basalts for storing co2 however investigations are in preliminary stage46 costs for direct sequestration according to one doe estimate sequestration costs for capture transport and storage range from 100 to 300 per tonne of carbon emissions avoided using present technology47 in most carbon sequestration systems the cost of capturing co2 is the largest component possibly accounting for as much as 80 of the total48 cost information is sparse for large integrated commercial ccs systems because few are currently operating but estimates are ava ilable for the components of hypothetical systems table 6 shows range of estimated costs of each component of ccs system using data from 2002 and assuming that prices for geolog ical storage are not offset by revenues from enhanced oil r ecovery or coal bed methane extractionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33801crs21 49 ipcc special

incorporated ccs retrofitting existing plants with co2 capture systems would probably lead to higher costs than newly built power plants that incorporate ccs systems and industrial sources of co2 may be more easily retrofitted cost disadvantages of retrofitting may be reduced for relative new and highly efficient existing plants49 capturing co2 at electricitygenerating power plants will likely require more energy per unit of power output than required by plants without ccs the additional energy required also means that more co2 would be produced per unit of power output as result plants with ccs would be less efficient than plants without ccs comparisons of costs betw een power plants with and without ccs often include avoided co2 emissions as well as captured co2 emissions avoided

monito ring mitigation and verification 4 work on nonco2 greenhouse gases and 5 adva ncing breakthrough technologies beginning in 2003 doe created ven regional carbon sequestration partnerships to identify opportunities for car bon sequestration field tests in the united states and canada64 the regional partnerships prog ram is being implemented in threephase overlapping approach 1 characterization phase from fy2003 to fy2005 2 validation phase from fy2005 to fy2009 and 3 deployment phase from fy2008 to fy201765 according to the carbon questration atlas the first phase of the partnership program identified the poten tial for sequestering over 1000 gtco2 across the united states and part s of canada on october 31 2006 doe announced it will provide 450 million over the ne xt 10 years for field tests in the seven regions to validate results from smaller tests in the first phase with an additional cost share of 20 to be provided by each partnership figure 2 shows the

nded to demonstrate largevolume prolonged injection and co2 storage in wide variet of geologic formations according to doe this phase is to address the practical aspects of largescale operations presumably producing the results necessary for commercial ccs activities to move forward on octobe r 9 2007 doe announced that it awarded the first three largescale carbon sequest ration projects in the united states66 according to doe each of the three projects pl ans to inject million tons of co2 or more into deep saline reservoirs the sequestration projects will be located in the williston basin of north dakota and alberta basin of alberta canada the lower tuscaloosa formation in the southeast united states and the entrada formation in the southwestern united states on december 18 2007 doe announced its fourth award for largescale co2 injection and sequestration project in the mount simon formation of the illinois basin the m ount simon formation project will inject approximately 1000 t ons per day of co2 underground for nearly three years followed by monitoring and modeling of the behavior of the injected co2 in the reservoir67 one possible limitation to the deployme nt phase is paradoxically access by each partnership region to large volumes of co2 that can be used for the largescale injection projects for regions nearby to currently available sources of co2 in large volume such as those associated with eor availability of co2 may not be an issue but availability could be serious issue for other regions where co2 is not extracted or separated in large volumes for commercial use that possible limitation raises the issue of timing whether co2 capture technology and tr ansportation infrastructure will be ready to supply the needed million tonnes of co2 per year over several years for the deployment stage tests futuregen on february 27 2003 president bush proposed 10year 1 billion project to build coalfired power plant that integrates carbon sequestration and hydrogen production wh ile producing 275 megawatts of electricity enough to power about 150000 average us homes as originally conceived the plant would have been coalgasification fac ility and produced between 1 and 2 mtco2 annually on january 30 2008 doe announced that it was restructuring the futuregen program away from single stateoftheart living laboratory of integrated rd technologies single plant to in stead pursue new strategy of multiple commercial demonstration projects68 in the restructured program doe would support up to two or three demonstration pr ojects of at least 300 megawatts and that would sequester at least 1 mtco2 per yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33801crs27 source doe carbon sequestration technology roadmap and program plan 2007 figure 22 p 39 figure 2 doe

rial and labor costs for new power plants and the need to demonstrate commercial viability of integrated gasification combined cycle igcc power plants with ccs69 the budget justification also noted that number of states are making approval of new power plants contingent on provisions to control co2 emissions further underscoring th need to demonstrate commercial viability of new generation of coalb ased power systems according to doe doe requested 108 million for futuregen in fy2008 but congress appropriated only 75 million 33 million less than the request due to unused prior year funds in remarks included in th explanatory statement accompanying pl 110161 the consolidated appropriati ons act for 2008 the appropriations committees also cited concerns about main taining core funding for fossil energy rd and demonstration pr ograms in its budget justification for fy2009 doe requests 156 million for the restructured progra m and specifies that the federal cost share would only cover the ccs portions of the demonstration projects not the entire power system prior to does announced restructuring of the program the futuregen alliance an industry consortium of 13 co mpanies announced on december 18 2007 that it had selected mattoon il as the host site from set of four finalists70 in its january 30 2008 announcement doe stated th at the four finalist locations may be eligible to host an igcc plant with ccs under the new program it is unclear whether these four sites would have an advantage over other possible sites under the new futuregen structure issues for congress in march 2007 the massachusetts institu of technology mit released report called the future of coal which concluded that ccs is the critical enabling technology that would reduce co2 emissions significantly while also allowing coal to meet the worlds pressing energy needs71 the reports conc lusion assumes that future carbonconstrained world include s some level of carbon charge or price on co2 emissions the united states is not yet in carbonconstrained world and in the absence of price on co2 and an economic incentive to invest in ccs technological advancement and commercial deployment of ccs may depend at least initially on federal support the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 placed new emphasis on rd and demonstration projects for ccs at issue for congress is whether the doe carbon sequestrati on rd program willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33801crs29 72 for more information on capandtrade bills in the 110th congress see crs report rl33846 greenhouse gas

massachusetts vs epa at httpwwwsupremecourtusgovopinions06pdf05 1120pdfconform to pl 110140 and whether fundi ng appropriated by congress will enable the program to meet its goals and objectives other bills intr oduced in the 110th congress including those such as s 3036 that would authorize capandtrade programs to curtail the growth of greenhouse gas emissions72 contain provisions that could pr ovide incentives for ccs whether congress acts on those bills may in part determine how and how fast ccs is implemented on large scale it is widely recognized that costs for co2 capture and compression either pre or postcombustion will dominate the overall costs of ccs and that reducing those costs will be imperative to widespread deployment of ccs technologies the premise of carbonconstrained worl d and the projected costs of carbon sequestration is influencing decisions made today about future fossilfueled power plants for example in 2007 judge in minnesota public utility hearing recommended against purchasing power from proposed power plant citing the high cost estimates of ccs which could double the cost of energy compared to an older nonccs plant as reason to reject the proposal73 thus even without price for co2 emissions or mandatory cap the private sector is faced with regulatory and permitting environment that anticipates such requirements and is beginning to include the potential cost of ccs into its decisionmaking process paradoxically and despite u s emissions of over 2 gtco2 per year from electricity generation alone largevolume geologic sequestrati on tests of 1 mtco2 per year may have difficulty finding sufficient and inexpensive quantities of co2 to inject underground the difficulty ties back to the costs and technological barriers of separating large volumes of co2 from the flue streams of the hundreds of currently operating coalfired plants that hypothetically could furnish co2 for the tests congress may consider whether the us carbon sequestration prog ram is on track to develop the technology that efficiently captures co2 so that the costs of supplying sufficient co2 for largevolume sequestration tests across the country are not prohibitive other issues that congress may consider for largescale ccs deployment are not discussed in this report liability and longterm ownership for co2 sequestered undergr ound are two examples especially as the treatment of co2 evolves from commodity as it is considered in eor to pollutant as the supreme court has ruled in one case74 congress may also wish to consider the economic impacts of broad ccs infrastructure that could require large quantities of co2 pipeline and could raise issues of rightsofway and safety infrastructure may be especially important for areas of the country that l ack geologic sequestration potential such as new england and the southeastern atlantic coast states in those cases other typeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33801crs30 of sequestration strategies such as deepocean disposal of co2 may become more attractive where otherwise long and expens ive pipeline networks would be required to transport co2 from source to geologic reservoirs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33801crs31 75 ipcc special report p 346347appendix avoided co2 figure 3 compares captured co2 and avoided co2 emissions additional energy required for capture tr ansport and storage of co2 results in additional co2 production from plant with ccs the lower bar in figure 3 shows the larger amount of co2 produced per unit of power kwh relative to the reference plant upper bar wit hout ccs unless additional energy is required to capture transport and store co2 the amount of co2 avoided is always less than the amount of co2 captured thus the cost per tco2 avoided is always more than the cost per tco2 captured75 source ipcc special report figure 82 figure 3 avoided versus captured co2
