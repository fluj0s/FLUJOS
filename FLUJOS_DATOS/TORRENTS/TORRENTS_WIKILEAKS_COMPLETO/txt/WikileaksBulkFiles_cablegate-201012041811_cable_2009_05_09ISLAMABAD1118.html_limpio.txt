the ambassador accompanied by emboffs met may 20 with turkish ambassador soysal and other turkish counterparts the turkish embassy which has taken on coordinating role for nato in pakistan advocated greater cooperation with the us visavis pakistan soysal described turkeys own trilateral meetings with afghanistan and pakistan he thought the afpak relationship had improved since the february 2008 elections and credited foreign minister shah mehmood qureshi in particular for this geographic sensitivity while turkey hoped their trilaterals would result in cooperative programs the real objective was increased trust and transparency between the two neighbors the trilaterals had matured past joint statements decisions on specific projects needed to be implemented for the meetings to be worthwhile soysal said encouragingly the three countries had already conducted number of joint training on range of subjects soysal agreed that the friends of democratic pakistan initiative should not morph into donors forum despite the gop predilection he believed strong secretariat along the lines of task force model was needed to ensure the initiatives policy success nato could also contribute to pakistans development sponsoring education initiatives and professional exchanges 2 c summary continued turkish president gul would call president zardari may 22 to offer an aid package for internally displaced persons idps soysal focused on the julyaugust timeframe which this year includes ramadan suggesting turkish aid may be more postemergency so far turkey was the only muslim country to contribute to this humanitarian crisis though soysal hoped next weeks organization of islamic conference oic would take action he was frustrated the gop had timeline for the offensive in swat and thought the army was moving too slowly to initiate operations in the waziristans before next year he was not certain pakistani politics would be so patient and encouraged international missions to push for nonpartisan climate for as long as possible most of the responsibility for this however rested with zardari who needed to employ confidence building measures within his own party and with other parties especially leading opposition pakistan muslim leaguenawaz pmln end summary 3 s turkish embassy participants ambassador engin soysal dcm semih luffu turgut armyair attache colonel nuri gayir naval attache erhan sensoy and second secretary ilker kucukkurt us mission participants ambassador anne patterson dcm jerry feierstein rao chief john bennett army attache scott taylor and poloff terry steersgonzalez notetaker their trilaterals 4 c soysal described the trilateral meetings by turkey afghanistan and pakistan dating back to april 2007 those three meetings had been kept relatively small and focused he said each had its own theme 1 dialogue 2 development and 3 security and intelligence the next trilateral meeting date to be determined will focus on education though soysal admitted the three countries education systems were quite different the exchange was meant to build trust and transparency he emphasized the meeting would be formatted as parallel bilateral discussions rather than true trilats 5 c the got had witnessed firsthand deterioration in the relationship between the karzaimusharraf administrations over the first three trilaterals soysal revealed since zardaris presidency he had observed much improved relations relatively between the two countries while president asif zardari deserved some recognition for this positive turn soysal credited principally prime minister yousuf gilani and foreign minister shah mehmood qureshi they both exhibited geographic sensitivity he added playing up their moderate sufi credentials and raising universal andor conciliatory themes 6 c soysal was proud the turkishsponsored trilaterals had islamabad 00001118 002 of 003 matured beyond joint statements now the three countries needed to implement their decisions there had already been trilateral training opportunities he added including on crisis response counternarcotics and public affairs topics he also mentioned number of proposals he hoped would materialize soon including joint community center in peshawar and development center in ankara he thought the latter would welcome the visits of american experts turkey was additionally proposing trilateral military exercise or war game 7 s ambassador patterson briefed soysal on our own recent trilateral summit the usafghanistanpakistan meetings complemented turkeys process begun years before president zardari had performed well in highstakes situation the ambassador thought president obamas focus on counterinsurgency good governance and overall support had been received well by the pakistanis the rao chief noted that turkeys trilateral on afpak intelligence cooperation may have gone better than our own trilateral consultations the ambassador highlighted the transit trade agreement and the commitment to increased border controls and crossborder training our next trilateral would likely come in october the ambassador mentioned 8 c turkey was receptive to zardaris suggestion for regional summit not just trilateral to include all of afghanistans neighbors said soysal he confirmed the iranafghanistanpakistan summit set for may 19 had been postponed to may 24 he recommended pakistan reach out to even more international partners and suggested pakistani parliamentarians not just gop officials travel abroad to push pakistans case zardari would address nato members at special session in june of course soysal added zardari might demur depending on how the army offensive was going in swat friends of pakistan 9 c speaking of the calendar soysal turned to the friends of democratic pakistan initiative informing the ambassador that the gop aimed for july ministerial in istanbul comment we have conveyed to the turks our own concerns that there is not sufficient time to prepare for ministerial in midjuly we will continue to discuss the british would likely propose friends summit on the margins of the usual september general assembly session of heads of government soysal relayed assistant secretary general jean arnault would arrive in pakistan on may 21 he had attended the friendsdonors meeting hosted by japan in late april soysal hoped he as well as the ambassador would encourage the gop to standup secretariat for friends while the assignment of foreign ministry spokesman abdul basit as gop poc was positive soysal really advocated taskforce 10 c the dcm stressed that friends not morph in to donors forum which was the gops inclination also membership in the group had expanded and may now be too broad to work as coherent group he added lastly it would be up to the gop to provide the initiative its strategic vision the dcm encouraged the turkish ambassador to convey similar messages to the gop soysal concurred they have to hear from us initiatives for nato 11 c the turkish embassy in islamabad has taken on the task of nato coordinator at least on political issues among members missions and with the gop in that informal role soysal recommended number of joint initiatives and exchanges he thought members respective ambassadors to nato should jointly visit pakistan soon he also noted pakistani journalists and academics were being sent on study tours similar to our international visitors program to nato headquarters in brussels soysal welcomed us suggestions on suitable pakistani candidates for the trips lastly he had recently learned that number of pakistani universities conducted model competitions he felt his and other nato members missions could sponsor such events islamabad 00001118 003 of 003 12 c turkish ambassador soysal noted president obamas recent trip to turkey had been very positive and hoped for increased coordination between our two countries and embassies on spectrum of issues and beyond traditional fora he also noted his governments recent hosting of other special representatives to this region the idp challenge 13 c the turkish ambassador complimented the us on its may 19 announcement to provide 110 million in direct assistance to pakistans internally displaced idps he revealed turkish president abdullah gul would call zardari may 22 to offer support package as well he hinted that turkish aid may be geared to the postemergency phase in augustseptember which would also coincide this year with the holy month of ramadan soysal noted that turkey would be the first and so far only muslim country to assist pakistan with this humanitarian crisis he was perplexed that saudi arabia had not ponied up yet the got would encourage at the least strong statement of support by the organization of islamic conference oic summit during the week of may 25 and was hoping other oic members would kick in contributions soysal said 14 c however it appeared the gop did not have clear timeline for the offensive operations in swat northwest frontier province nwfp soysal complained he agreed with the ambassador that the gop also needed to identify competent civil administrators to enter recently cleared towns soysal was also concerned that the pakistan army was moving too slowly to clear militants from other districts and the waziristan agencies in the federally administered tribal areas fata gop plans were still broad brush and may not realistically be implemented if at all until the new year he analyzed the ambassador added that 2500 waziri families had already reportedly fled their homes in anticipation of army action but yet the gop refused to give international aid organizations access to the nearest settled district of di khan forcing families to move north to peshawar or farther east into punjab thoughts on nawaz 15 c soysal met oneonone with opposition pakistan muslim leaguen pmln leader nawaz sharif in lahore the week of may 11 nawaz understood the seriousness of the situation in swat soysal concluded he reported that nawaz stated the taliban should be eliminated nawaz warned however that pakistans democracy needed to deliver soon before the public looked again to alternatives soysal did not specify whether nawaz implied the military or the militants as the likely alternates 16 c while titfortat politics would eventually return soysal thought the international community should encourage for as long as possible nonpartisan stance by pakistans political parties but zardari held much of the responsibility for setting the tone soysal argued he should bring all parties into major decisionmaking host party leaders for session of the next friends meeting and reconcile with factions inside his own pakistan peoples party ppp 17 c comment this was the first meeting between the two embassies in this format which parallels similar dialogue we have with the uk high commission but with the turks playing an increasingly high profile constructive role in pakistan we will continue to develop our dialogue and find opportunities to work together in areas of mutual interest as moderate progressive muslim state featuring relatively stable democratic governance turkey is wellpositioned to be much more positive role model for the pakistanis and to neutralize somewhat the more negative influence on pakistani politics and society exercised by saudi arabia end comment patterson
