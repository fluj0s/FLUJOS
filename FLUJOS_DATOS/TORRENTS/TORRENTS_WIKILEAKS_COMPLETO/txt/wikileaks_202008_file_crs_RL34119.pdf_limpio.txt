funding provided through l hhsed appropriations and related funding made ava ilable through dod appropriations impact aid appropriations provided through the lhhsed appropriations table 1 details the most recent appropr iations for impact aid fy2002 fy2008 as the table shows congress s generally increased appropriations for impact aid payments over this period the overall increase during this period has been 85 more specifically payments for federally connected children section 8003 rose by 118 from fy2002 to fy2008 w ith basic support payments sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34119crs5 16 some of this increase is due to the incorporation of payments for certain heavily impacted leas previously funded under ction 8003f into the appropriation for section 8003b payments 8003b rising by 125 123 million16 payments for federal property section 8002 experienced the largest percentage increase of any impact aid payment over this time period at 167 but the dollar increase in funding was less than 10 million payments for f acilities maintenance and construction decreased from fy2002 to fy2008 by 392 and 635 respectively further examination of table 1 shows that payments for federally connected children section 8003 accounted for more than 90 of impact aid appropriations in fy2007 moreover the basic support payments section 8003b alone accounted for 891 of the appropriations in comparison payments for federal property accounted for 52 payments fo r construction accounted for 14 and payments for facilities main tenance accounted for less th an 05 of appropriations for this reason this report includes deta iled discussion of the section 8003b basic support payments for fede rally connected children from fy2007 to fy2008 appropriations fo r the overall impact aid program increased by 123 million or 10 at the individual payment level however only the basic support payment received an incr ease in funding for fy2008 the increase for basic support payments was 137 million or 13 this increase was able to exceed the overall program increase because all of the other impact aid payments were actually decreased by amounts ra nging from 86000 for f acilities main tenance to 864000 for children with disabilities for fy2009 the presidents budget request would continue to fund the impact aid program at its fy2008 level of 12 billion each of the specific impact aid payments would remain at their fy 2008 levels with basic support payments continuing to receive 11 billion unlike many other federal education programs the impact aid program is not forwardfunded

property acquired in practice making thes determinations may be difficult if the transaction occurred several decades ago the maximum payment an lea is eligible to receive for fiscal year is determined by applying the current real property tax rate for current expenditures levied by fiscally independent leas or imputed real property tax rate for fiscally dependent leas to the current annually termined assessed va lue of the federal property the assessed value of the federal property is dete rmined of the basis of the highest and best use of property adjacent to the federal

parents are in the military but live off the base the school distri cts weighted student count would be 200 militaryon base 100 200 100 on indian lands 125 125 300 militaryoff base 020 60 600 total but under the formula 385 thus this hypothetical district has 600 federally connected children but for the purposes of the formula the weight ed count of these children is 385 local contribution rate and maximum payments next the weighted student count or w eighted student units is multiplied by cost factor or lcr which is the greatest of onehalf of the state average perpupil expenditure appe onehalf of the national appe the previously determined lcr for comparable districts with unusual circumstances such as thos serving particularly large number of disabled children or the state appe times the local contribution percentage ie thepercentage of educational revenues that come from the local level 25 thus the lcr may vary from lea to lea even within the same states the weighted student total is multip lied by whichever of these amounts is greatest for given lea suppose for our hypothetical example that onehalf the national appe was the highest amount nd it is estimated at 4000 the maximum basic support payment for our hypothetical school district would be 4000 385 1540000 reduction due to insufficient appropriations providing maximum payments to all eligible leas in fy2007 would require approximately 178 billion26 since section 8003b ppropriations are well below this full funding amount statutory lang uage provides mechanism for reducing payments to leas the general principle is that more heavily impacted districts ie those more dependent on impact aid payments receive higher percentages of their maximum payments than less impacted districts this principle is achieved by calculating learning opportunity thre shold lot payment this is percentage of the maximum pa yment determined by addinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34119crs13 27 payments for certain heavily impacted leas section 8002b2 are excluded from the calculation the percentage of an leas average daily attendance that is composed of federally connected children and the percentage of an leas total current expenditure that iscomposed of section 8003 payments 27 this total percentage must not exceed 100 this percentage is multiplied by the maximum payment to produce the lot payment if in our hypothetical lea federally connected children account for 20 of all children in average daily attendance and impact aid funds are 30 of the leas current expenditures then the lot percen tage would be 50 and the lot payment would be 50 of 1540000 or 770000 if current appropriations were not fficient to make all lot payments only percent of the lot payment would be made in recent years however appropriations have been suffi cient to provide all leas w ith more than 100 of their lot payments the statute provides that funds in excess of what is needed to provide all leas with 100 of their t payment be distributed in proportion to leas lot payments however lea may receive payment in excess of its maximum support payment this provision gives priority for additional funding to leas with higher lot payments that is priority for funding goes to leas that are more affected or impacted by federally connected children or more dependent on impact aid as revenue source returning to our hypothetical example if funds were sufficient to pay 125 of lot the lea would receive 50 125 or 625 of its maximum basic support payment that is the lea would receive 625 of 1540000 or 962500 heavily impacted leas in addition to the socalled regular impact aid leas certain leas are specifically classified as heavily impacted section 8003b 2 in general there are two classifications of these leas 1 those that received heavily impacted payments in fy2000 referred to as conti nuing heavily impacted leas and 2 those that were not eligible to receiv such payment until fy2002 or later new heavily impacted leas with certain exceptions eligibility is based on the leas percentage of total ada co mposed of federally c onnected children and the leas tax rate for example most continuing heavily impacted leas must have at least 35 of the ada composed of federally conn ected children and have tax rate that is at least 95 of their states average tax rate or have at least 30 of their ada composed of federally connected children and have tax rate that is at least 125 of the average tax rate of comparable leas in their state in fy2006 28 leas received payments as heavily impacted leas

leas payments differ in three ways from calculations for regular impact aid leas first weig hts for certain classi fications of federally connected children are greater for some h eavily impacted leas for example leas that qualify as heavily impacted and have 100 or fewer federally connected children have their entire count of federally c onnected children weighted at 175 as opposed to using the weights depicted in table 2 second the maximum basic support payment for most heavily impacted leas is based on 80 rather than 50 of the state or national appe whiche ver one is higher finally given sufficient funds the lot percentage for these leas is 100 that is they receive 100 of their maximum support payment if funds ar sufficient to provide these amounts as result of these provisions the 28 heavily impacted leas received about 230 million or about 20 of the total funding for basic support grants under section 8003b in fy2006 in terms of per student payments these 28 leas receive over 4 times the amount per child as regular impact aid leas28 for the 9 largest heavily impacted leas their average per child payments are 10 times higher than the average payment per child received by the regular impact aid leas use of impact aid section 8003b payments impact aid payments differ from funds provided by other federal elementary and secondary education programs im pact aid funds provided under section 8003 are not limited to specified uses such as improving the educational achievement of disadvantaged students while funds are ge nerally used for current local education expenditures29 they may also be used for capital expenditures30 in addition except for funds distributed based on disabled students section 8003d impact aid funds need not be spent just on federally connected children finally because impact aid payments are not aimed at specific educational goals accountability requirements for the use of funds or for specific outcomes are minimal payments for children with disabilities section 8003d in addition to basic support payments section 8003 authorizes payments to leas serving certain federally connected children who are eligible to receive services under

structuring state school finance formulas to take into account local capacity to raise educational revenue an equalization formula would compensate leas to reduce discrepancies in appe or ability to raise revenue s for public k12 education throughout the state with one excepti on state school finan ce formulas are not permitted to take into acc ount funds leas receive from impact aid the one
