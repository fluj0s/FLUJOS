routine 3ga data on goals part ii lecture given on 7 august 1962 thank you well this is lecture two 7 aug ad 12 saint hill special briefing course and were going on with goals routine 3ga how you do it lets start more cohesively and coherently and more abundantly at the beginning of the concisity you get the pc to do goals list now i told you there was another remedy for lost goal you know you found the wrong goal and everything has gone to hell to make the pc feel better just get him to list some goals now you can keep that as stable datum the pc feels bad because of any 3ga get him to list some goals see now thats stable datum matter what else you do also get him to list some goals in other words if you clean up the wrong goal that was found get the pc to list some goals how many well until he looks better well in session not necessarily now youll find out that youll be tossing this off as an auditor back in your own bailiwick or organization quite often and you will learn rather rapidly that this is way of pulling somebody out of the soup while you are sitting there with telephone in each hand you see and preclear on the couch and one in the chair see and at that moment fourth party walks in the door you see and says oh fm in terrible trouble last night my wife threw out and everything is going to hell in balloon and when can you give some auditing you see and you say well the best thing to say well just as soon as youve got another 250 goals listed and they say oh i couldnt think of that well you just say do it do it do it you know do it you know two hundred and fifty goals do it do it you know get them listed get them listed thank you thank you dont talk to again until you have them listed and so forth and theyll come back theyll feel fine its the darnedest therapeutic measure you ever you ever had tothat and youll find out that that is dead right youll use this you might not think now that you would but you will youll find yourself using this the guys caving in you know what youve got to pick up youve got to pick up his missed withholds you know this and you know that and youve got to get tenhour prepcheck going on his past auditing and youve got this and youve got that and youve got these other things but you havent got time to do it so just tell him to list some goals got it its panacea if somebody is dying or something like that it might not work they might not be able to write or something like that but short of thatshort of that itll handle almost anything now lets expand this just little bit further listing of goals doesnt depend so much on how many goals as upon how much charge is remaining on the needle its not charge on the tone arm lets forget everything said in routine 3 on the subject of moving tone arms its moving needle how much is that needle moving the devil with the tone arm because you can make mistakes the auditor the environment other things and when you really start running the mid ruds on every goal youre going to get tone arm motion which wasnt there when you simply read the goals off so that test becomes invalidated the moment you move in with nulling by mid ruds because nulling by mid ruds is basically running rudiments and rudiments is moving the tone arm and its not the goals moving the tone arm but how can you tell the difference youre doing them both at the same time well so therefore moving tone arm is longer test for whether goals list is complete but moving needle is now youre going to want to know when is goals list complete and you say to the pc six goals in row and each one fires quarter of dial that is an incomplete list you neednt do any more than that see just to catch catfish to run down waterbuck to shoot game wardens to have high hat in court to be student and never to have anything to do with instructors and just read them off one right after the other and youll find out how much do they kick how much does each one kick and if they kick more on an average than divisionthats one of those little black line to black line see its abouti dont know what that division is i should measure it some time on ruler its probably threeeighths of an inch something like that i dont know what it is and if theyre kicking more than that your goals list is not complete any kick that you get on them if its more than that your goals list is not complete now theres something more if one kicks out of five or something wild like thatyou understand this is just guesstimate approximation because it will vary so much various parts of the listif one kicks out of the five why thats enough and that one kick was just that thats not cleaned up or anything you see thats just one threeeighths of an inch kick that goals list is very nice or the pc is mad as hell at you and the emeter is totally inoperative i think you could tell the latter if the pcs even vaguely insession why that readyou read six goals to him and one two something like that kick just that much you say voil√† now its or less its not or more it is or less as long as that needle is kicking third of dial quarter of dial and is kicking on four or five goals out of six that list is not complete furthermore the goal probably isnt on it ahhaha and that would be very important to you i can see you now going on and on and on and on and on nulling down 1500 goals very laboriously and then find out the goal wasnt on it well theres way to tell whether or not the goal was on it and thats how much charge is on the list all right now rock slams dont count the rock slam has been the subject of considerable study by lately and i learnt great deal about rock slams and theyre all failed to reveals but actually failed to reveal is insufficiently powerful as an auditing command to pull off one of these big heavy rock slams itll take off one of these littlethese little quarterofaninchwide rock slams that you get what you call dirty needle but when its slamming half dial its overts and it only comes off with overts and its usually overts on the auditor when you get pc sitting down there and this thingabout every third goal you get quarterofadial rock slam halfadial rock slam something like that watch it bud watch it because thats overts on the auditor and its ow on the auditor that youll probably find is the most efficacious if not on the auditor then on whom well you better find any goal that rock slams add them all up and find out on what it is you can make little hunt and punch tests you can eventually turn on the dirty needle and the rock slam but of course failed to reveal makes the thing go thats quite valid in mid ruds just failed to reveal this other is an ow situation this is readying up the needle and that sort of thing but if youre reading off goals list and youre getting this nice little tick and its going tick and tick and everything is fine you get one ticking out of ten or something like thatthats dandy everything is fine and all of sudden halfadialwide rock slam turns on had nothing to do with the goals list nothing to do with the goals list it has to do with overts and of course that will compare to the goals list some place or another but you couldnt care what it compares to it is overts of course the goals list charges up the overt but thats beside the point and if you dont expect to go the whole session spending 50 percent of your time cleaning up dirty needle cleaning up dirty needle cleaning up dirty needle you had better find out what the hell all these overts are on normally its you you see you clean them up as overts you understand that withhold is in place because it is theyou know makes the problem with the prior confusion you see the overt is the prior confusion and its the overt which makes this hang up now when youre getting rock slam why it wont come off by pulling the withholds you understand theres too much charge on the prior confusion you see so you just keep pulling the roof off of the niagara falls you see you keep going out there with dipper you know as it goes over the falls and you get some water little dipper full of water and you pull it over on the side and you say well ill get this river bailed out eventually one dipper at time see youve got to ask for niagara falls before it disappears and then it asises nicely in other words if you cant get rid of dirty needle on some pc youd better right straight back into the prior confusion proposition in other words its just overts and more nonsense about prior confusion the reason why you get dirty needle little shivery needle like that its failed to reveal you see one little tiny thing its about oh an eighthof aninch wide quarterofaninch wide something like that yes itthats all it is thats just failed to reveal but if you went shopping you would find an overt you see theres reason to go finding overts however little buggy stuff like that it turns on once in while and turns off again but when one is coming on persistently itll very often be accompanied by halfadialwide rock slam which is completely unexplainable and that halfadialwide rock slam is simply overts in magnitude and it doesnt pull by pulling withholds you have to get the overt withhold stays in place because it has prior confusion called the overt you see fellow walks up shoots the cop and after that he wont talk to people about police well you can pull all the times when he wouldnt talk to people about police and just find more times when he wouldnt talk to people about police you get the idea you eventually have to shop around and find out whats causing this constant and continual hangup well you finally get it out of him he shot cop and after that you havent any trouble with the withhold you see withhold is always the manifestation which comes after an overt any withhold comes after an overt so for that purpose somebody suggested the other day we ought to call it the overt slam and it would make more sense to one and all but that doesnt count as to whether the goals list is charged or not that doesnt have anything to do with it that is simply overts the pcs got which are expressing themselves in other words you could have complete goals list which every once in while turned into dialwide rock slam it hasnt anything to do with the goals list it merely has to do with overts you follow that thats very important to you because otherwise you see you could get all messed up youd say look how charged this list is look i read six goals and i get three down the line and its just fine and then here is this enormous rock slam that turns on and so forth and so therefore well have to go on listing goals therefore well have to go shopping and find out who hes got overts on you get the difference the person by the way would be very very hard to do goals assessment on who had that situation very hard to do youd have to be very slippery and so youd betteryoud better do little more prepchecking and get those overts off find out where they are and they usually are on the auditor after all its when the auditors auditing them that they turn on isnt it well it proves itself doesnt it when hes not on an emeter he doesnt rock slam you can prove things to pc like that get them to own up all right now supposing you had somebody list 850 goals you just walked up to them and you said oh youre going to have some 3ga thats fine swell im going to audit you thatthats good thats good well youd better be getting your goals list in order and they say urp or ulp or yes or something you just keep on giving them the auditing command you see out of session you just want them to get to 850 goals your first auditing action is to test it just keep kicking them in the head until youve got 850 goals theres reason to look at it or do anything about it until youve got 850 goals and theres real reason to spend any auditing time on the pc until youve got 850 goals this is just in the interests of saving auditing time and youll find out they will fool around and they will go week or two without adding anything to it and oooh they cant think of any more and that sort of thing well naturally you could pull theyou could pull the mid ruds on the subject of listing clean up the mid ruds on the subject of listing and itd help them out and they would go on like bomb well why do that its their life and their future why be so helpful say well the only thing at stake is your next 200 trillion years suit yourself usually its just as good as prepcheck in the bag and get your 850 goals on list specify that it must be on legal paper that is thirteen by eight as paper normally is it can be fourfold paper that is two pages connected at the back it can be lined or not lined it is usually best if it is lined legal and one column of goals on it only and let it be legible but have them do it legibly in the first place or have it typed by somebody for gods sakes dont have the pc copy it dont let the pc copy his list dont let the pc read his list dont let the pc get in front of an emeter and see whats live on the list you just tell him to list and if he does anything else youll have his thetan you understand thats quite important the pc can turn on the wildest mess of somatics and get sicker than pup and be completely unauditable and youll say good god whats happened here oh nothing hes just read his list over to see whats on it you see that can happen to pc dont discount it hes holding in his hand doublebarreled shotgun with both barrels pointing straight at his head you see pc should not read list over to self pc should not copy list pc should not go by self to an emeter to see if he can find own goal confucius say he better dead he better dead man ive seen pc just op out around the bend on this you know pretty goofy in other words hes at perfect liberty to write down his goals legibly on legal sheet of paper so that you can read them and thats what he is at liberty to do and thats all hes at liberty to do and that works for any goals list he does all right now what do you do weve talked lot about prepchecking and doing this and that yes its very good thing to have pc very well prepchecked by the routine 3ga auditor very good and have listing and goals and things like that cleaned up as the first action and as matter of fact you could do just that you see with some pc who wasnt coming to you constantly you could do prepcheck on goals you see and then you send him off to do his 850 list you see thats good plan of operation all right he comes back to you and you read the first six goals and it goes bang wham bang eight hundred and fifty goals hes listed and it falls off the pin as matter of fact youre in fear of the mark ivs life that the pin will do corkscrew this list is charged what do we do now well naturally you could list the pc up to 3962 goals couldnt you but that is rather lengthy now why one the goal isnt on the list that doesnt mean you never null it but the goal isnt on the list thats the first thing you know hes listing all four lines on one list you see hes thehes the mixedup kid you see hes putting them all down consecutive so your first action on doing something like thisit doesnt matter really whichwhich one of these two actions is first theres two actions here but the first action which i would do on this is id get him untangled on the subject of which goal belongs where and i would run the four lists with your goal on each list with what goal might you have what goal would oppose your goal what goal would retard opposition to your goal and what goal would pull back your goal now for sure somebodys going to think that we mean to put his goal in there we mean just those wordings just that wording we dont know his goal yet see my goal hoho what what who what is it i dont know what my goal is well all right answer the question thats yours is not to wonder why i am asking the question yours is but to furnish an answer thereunto so i can write it down on this sheet of paper he gives you four listed goals suddenly when hes given you about sixty on each list you throw away three lists and keep one keep the first list and put it on his list that hes done throw the others away you care nothing about them theyre probably not even accurately see but the probabilities are in favor of what goal might you have as list adds sixty goals to his list okay got that that straightens his skull out on the subject of what hes listing you all of sudden will have some fantastic automaticity roaring off if youveif its gone like this see and listen now this is good thing to do in any event you see this is nice to do in any event dont necessarily keep it to specialized case its very nice because it straightens things kind of out for the pc hes liable to have some fabulous automaticity roar off you say what goal would oppose your goal and all of sudden all the bad nasty mean goals that he didnt want that he was putting down on his list go tearing off he identifies them that fast as opposition goals and after that you dont have them occur on the list now dont think this is going to clear him dont anybody get the sudden idea the sudden brilliantnow wait minute maybe ron didnt notice this but you know if you continued that on to 4 or 5000 goals on each list hed go clear or suddenly his goal would spring out and he would know it himself without any nullingbecause its already been tested it didnt work you could list four lines of items just who or what would have your goal and that sort of thing but before youve listed fifteen youll wish you hadntfifteen on each list i mean thatsthats thaaaagh bluhhhh in other words items listing thinking that will go to clear it wont thats been tested theres another system of taking whole bunch of terminals who or what would have your goal see get bunch of terminals and then assess those and find one that sticks in and then find goals for that terminal see thats awfully interesting but that hasnt worked either im just telling you what hasnt worked too theres been lot of work in this direction now whats that do that discharges the living daylights out of it that gives him some idea of opposition goals and that sort of thing and it takes lot of charge off the list in hurry see all right now lets get rid of all of the goals he thinks are goals but which are solutions now all goals that pc thinks are goals except one are solutions to problems all goals are solutions to problems except one and thats postulated and its not solution to nothing and everybody can sit around and regard their navel in contemplation here trying to figure out how come pc would have one sitting out in thin air that wasnt solution to problem but im sorry but thats just the way the thetans that are here on this track at this time are built see thats what they done see and until i find some other explanation for it thats all they just postulate thats prime postulate for the universe of self and it doesnt depend on solution to any problem it solves nothing he just did it just out of the goodness of his stupid little cottonpicking heart the rest of them in any gpmany given cycle or gpm area are solutions to problems see he gets beaten up by all the boys in the neighborhood so he has goal to beat up everybody you see thats solution to problem to be able to punish at will see hes been in jail now and then up and down the track so hes finally developed goal to escape you see and then hethis will go off into all kinds of odd panels like to escape the consequences of life you see to get other people to escape the consequences of life to hate blue uniforms you see and theyll all be mixed up with this problem of getting put in jail theyre all solutions so the pc well he can figure himself crazy as to what is solution and what isnt solution but youll find that most pcs as they sit there only accept as valid goal that thing which they know will solve the problem they have the chronic present time problem now we had these last year and they were getting in the road of our goals finding and they do get in the road of goals finding like mad the guys got chronic present time problem it actually hasnt anything to do with his goals line it just happens to be present time problem of course it wouldnt be problem if it was on his goals line think that over for moment see it wouldnt really be problem see so it must be something else there must be some other thing well hell sit there and give you long and involved list of solutions to that problem and call it goals list and it drives him almost around the bend see he keepsbecause man you try and run this something try to run this process on somebody solve a___ think up solution to your problems thank you think up solution to your problems thank you think up solution to your problems thank you next thing you know the mass is getting massier and massier hes wondering whats going on you know it brings the masses right in on him think up solution to your problem bum show now goals list oddly enough would be composed of past solutions so that would run them out so that would be very therapeutic but the guy who is sitting there with chronic present time problem let uslet us say this fellow has ahas farm he has big farm see and the governments gone bankrupt and cant run it for him any more and hes sitting there with cows and horses and sheep and wages to pay and everything and subsidies and hes got this and hes had this for quite while morning noon and night hes done nothing but think about this do you know what kind of goals hes going to get to dispose of sheep at large profit to do lots of work to pull off miracles to be an economic wizard to make things grow better to make more production see theyll all have to do with his ptp and youll just get reams of stuff on ptps and this is why you develop these long lists because the person starts thinking up new solutions to ptps so this is the gag after youve done this four goals that separates out the sheep from the goats and tells him which is him to some degree that smooths that out takes some charge off the list pull this other one what problem would your goal or might your goal be solution to that is very charming you make laboriously written list of these things so you can throw it away but what problem would yourmight your goal be solution to whatever the wording you use i couldnt care less but its what problem would your goal be solution to thats what youre trying to find out youre trying to find out list of problems and the guy says oooh this bird with the farm he says oooh to run farm profitably to get my hands paid to make things better on the farm to produce agricultural machinery without paying for it to sell at high priceshow to sell at high prices in summer how to get cows milked for nothing and the next thing you know why he says what problem you can actually sort of run this thing on down and hell sort of realize hahaha this has nothing to do with my goal i mean thats all different so might doesnt hang him with having misanswered the auditing question you see as would would get yourself nice list of problems how many problems i dont know how many has he got how many thousand oh nothing like that dozens is the order of magnitude of this problems list its just dozens and all of sudden hell suddenly realize that hes been sitting there waiting for goal to now this is whatsthis is whats the killer this is not for getting the goal on the list this is for getting nulling done because your pc is not going to pay any attention to his own goal as it goes by if it doesnt solve his chronic present time problem hes waiting for goal to come up that makes farming economically feasible see what hes doing he doesnt give each goal as it goes by its proper weight and interest just as goal hes waiting for specialized goal to come up see and he turns each one over as regard to his chronic present time problem lets see would this goal help run the farm all right well this couldnt possibly be the goal and right away goes sort of out of session you see he fades out on you and hes all to catch catfish you say ah that wouldnt help run the farm to catch catfish that isnt it see see its problem in attention the guys attention is so stuck on current track that he just cant hear anything its not that you will miss the goal it just makes it harder to get because the pcs sitting there all the time hes waiting for how to make farm see his whole problem see is how to make farm solvent you read off list of goals he hears list of solutions to his chronic present time problem he doesnt hear his own goal when it goes by because thats something thats long ago and far far away and he aint ad nothing to do with it for long time you see so it has nothing to do with his problems today and its all invalidated anyway and theres nothing you can do about it see so this trick is to get his attention centered around for nulling and thats why you make list of these problems you see what problem might your goal be solution to and hell give you all these wild problems now you can go on with this too long you dostart doing three fourhundred of these problems in list and your pcs bank is going to start to get kind of gooey because remember youre going up against the problem and to list problems is therapeutic but to repeat wrong goals and so forth is not see because hes more or less inventing these goals hes guessing at them and so forth youll find out that it will run itself out of the zone and area of therapy actually your tone arm starts going up kind of stickily you can kind of follow it on the ta you see it starts getting bit sticky and gummed up you better come off it but youve gotten that out of the road now you can ask him another question and add to his goals list now with all of those problems out of the way supposing those problems were all cared for what might your goal be and list some goals get the trick well just supposing you had all those problems handled that youve given now weve got the list here were not going to tear it up in front of his face but were going to lay it over here to the side supposing youve had all those cared for now what would your goal be oh well thats entirely different oh yeah what would my goal be if all those things were handled oh gee oh god that would be ball you know it would be marvelous to dance amongst the daisies to whistle at blondes you know you get some interesting goals that hes had as goals in other words thats just method of taking bulldozer you see and just shoving first with this four list all the oppgoals off of his list so you havent got that automaticity to contend with and then shoving his problem solutions that are chronic and current that are really worrying him off of the list and now you can continue the list until its in this kind of shape so it will only give one tick every now and then and youre not going to go up to 3 4 5000 goals see and all of sudden the goals you start putting down after youve done these two tricks see these goals you get are going to be much more sensible theyll look more like goals you know theyto communicate well to have ball to get my own way anything you could think of it will be any usual goal but it wont be to turn all the firemen in chicago into ibexes that type of goal is never found on pc as the goal dont you see to run and run and run and turn around sometimes and come back so i can see where i was going when i wasnt there you seldom find that type of goal on pc you see whereas you actually in listing out things when you start to run to your 2 3 4000 list of goals youll get lot of those things on there and theyre just waste of time so thats way to cut your goals list down so that sort of handles going on and on and on and on and on now your next actionthats important because some goals lists tend to run awfully long before they are finally discharged and that helps them this way your next action in handling your goals list of course is to null by mid ruds now theres very good idea to prepcheck before you do nulling any old goal that has been found rightly or wrongly or been hinted at or evaluated on the pc put those down ahead of the list any goal the pc has had i dont care if its been prepchecked before see you know he had this goalhe was in coursehe was in course some place couple of years ago and he used to set goals for the session all the time and finally he put this down on his list and somebody found it on his list and it was in you know that kind of thing and they didnt ever really get it to pan out but he thought for long time that was probably his goal or something he was terribly fond of as goal that didnt pan out and hes been mad at it ever since or goal that was found wrong and listed on him or goal that was found and not listed or 3d criss cross was run on it you see any type of goal like that get nice neat little list of them and put them down ahead of the goals list i dont care if its been done before dont you see because in the meantime hes still going to have fondness for those until his actual goal is found and hes going to think of those once in while hes going to invalidate them once in while and hes going to muck them up once in while see and maybe his goal is to get myself in hell of fine ruddy mess you know you never know and he can sure do it with some old halfhalfgone goal see you put thatjust put that in front of the list all right now youve got those things now clean those up and then start in theres several ways this could go about but kind of the way i would favor would be to run whole prepget those gone see and then just run all the mid ruds or any variation of the mid ruds on your goal quote your goal quote your goal thats completely different prepcheck see its not on goals or anything like that has your goal been suppressed you see you get these things out of the way these old ones and then lets do your goal just to make sure and it sort of gets the wheels straightened out theyve been going round and round maybe foroh for some people theyve been going around for months or even years whats my goal whats my goal whatswhatsi wonder what my goal was and they finally go to fortune tellers take up ouija boards anything and you justyou not only then get the known ones out of the way but with this basket you know why you just get all the unknown ones that he hasnt mentioned out of the way too just prepcheck it just as though you had it on the list see so youd have to catch catfish to be waterbuck to run and run and run and knock all the firemen in chicago into cocked hats and your goal get the idea so that merely becomes part of the goals list any old found or suspected or hopedfor goal you see thats been worked over then this item this goal your goal see youre handling that in turn with very careful nulling by mid ruds see you make sure that you get it all polished up see so that it doesnt bang on anything and then sail on into his list now because theyve come off against plot of time from early to late in other words hes listed these things consecutively there is an argument heavy argument in favor of nulling them that consecutively because you can keep them cleaned up moreearlier see the earlier to late and you null by mid ruds from early to late see youve got your list now now null again from early to late to approximate the cycle of getting these things off you could also make case out of from getting late to early because it possibly would be in the greater number of cases that his goal would be late on the list rather than early on the list but then we take somebody here the other day i think i dont know how early the goal was on the list but it was practically first page so that argument against it really isnt valid and starting from the beginning and going through to the end is the recommended way to do it all right we tear on through that way and we clean each one of them up as i was telling you about in the first lecture and your pc should be looking as fine as silk now when do we prepcheck this well frankly if you do this trick if you do this trick you dont need to do too much prepchecking when youve done your beginning rudiments if you will then run ordinary mid ruds before you go into the body of the session with since your last session see not in this session you see but since your last session now when was your last session the fellow says well it was yesterday afternoon we finished up at 430 you say all right good since your last session is there anything you have suppressed see and do those repetitive like you do the beginning ruds you see dont do them fast check do them repetitive because the pc when hes doing goals nulling does mighty silly things and weve already caught two or three fellows offbase who come in and they went out with the tone arm you know the tone arm was sitting there at 275 and they come back in with the tone arm at 64 and the needle is going bzzzzz and they say now since the last time i audited you have you done anything you are withholding that is clean thank you they didnt do anything they read their whole goals list and tried to find it on the meter they havent done anything see hahah well theyre not withholding it they would have told you if you asked theyve just about thrown their case into cocked hat see and people do silly things while their things are being nulled and they get anxious and they get upset and they experiment around and they wonder if there isnt some easier way to find goal you can expect pcs to do all kinds of things like this so in nulling sessions if you say since your last session is there anything you have suppressed done repetitively and then do fast check afterwards fast check the mid ruds see on the same thing now youre sailing because youre not now going to have the interim time between sessions gumming up into suppress and failed to reveal and dirty needles and all of this other kind of thing in other words youre sailing now and its well worth doing it and after youve done it few times why it is very easy to do its not very lengthy action i did one the other evening i think in about i dont know about seven minutes it was whiz whiz whiz whiz whiz and it was all clean and everything went along beautifully all right now that is very good thing to do for goals typesnulling session in other words since your last session not in this session but since the last time you were audited whatever you want to say that thing is all clean now youve got that interim check you see now if you only want to go through that once and so forth you could do your fast check on the session see in this session brrrrrrrr see and that caught anything he mucked up inwhile doing the repetitive check see and that might clear that up but thatthis is now getting very nice indeed because the pc by this time will practically be crawling through the meter to get onto his nulling so you can be just so cautious without knocking the pc out of session on the basis of auditing see the worst auditing there is is auditing you know that that is the worst there is the worst auditing there is is not an auditor who cant read meter who will not do tr 4 who this who that who the other thing the pcs opinion i dont care if this ruins him gives him somatics puts him sick in bed i dont care what this does to himto him auditing is worse than any auditing that is something for you to remember because auditing sometimes is what lies back of your pcs lack of progress youre just being too confoundedly picky youre just being too confoundedly careful youre saying well i know we did prepcheck during the last three sessions that weve been prepchecking listing as subject i know weve been doing that but in actual fact in actual fact prepchecking demonstrated there that there was an awful lot of preparatory work to be done so instead of nulling today instead of nulling today why were going to go back over all of the prepchecking we did and straighten that out then you wonder why you cant get any rudiments in rudiments will go in now you see pc will stand for so much but sometimes noauditing occurs in actual auditing and its one of your chronic difficulties in auditing is the pc is getting auditing now when you start sailing on goals list and start nulling on down the line your own heart is going to be in your throat many times you will go to goal number 789 and honest to pete this thing never ticks theres hardly any valid you pick up the suppressions with tiny slow andand hahahahuhuh is the pc in session is the pc responding on the meter what the hell is going on here see well possibly lot of things could be going on there but i think its just routine after youve cleaned up just so many goals the pc stops invalidating them and stops suppressing them and stops doing this and that to them and you dont find much on them but also flying needleit isnt the stuck needle that is the most vicious thing to encounter it is the flying needle that is your worst enemy in nulling flying needle one which is spinning fromlets say your tone arm is gently and gradually rising so that in the space of five minutes will go from 45 up to 5 lets say it takes five minutes to get there do you see the relative speed of rise of your needle now that constantly rising needle if rising above certain speed is flying needle and flying needle is one which is enough to cancel out the invalidations the suppressions and the goals reads in other words the mechanical inertia of the needle the actual weight of the needle and the fact that it is flying there from the right to the left oh man to detect slow out of that thing is heroic its almost worth arc breaking the pc so hell stick you know just drives you batty i mean its flying needle its just constant rise constant rapid rise and it is enough so that if your tick just degenerates into just the slightest slow and if anything is guaranteed to give you myopia as well as nervous prostration its one of these fast rising needles youre looking for that little slow and then every once in while to complicate the thing pcs that have this sort of thing get jerky rising needle and its going up by fits and starts and you cant tell what is slowed rise you see and what is just needle pattern and so forth its almost worth kicking the pc in the shins to change the needle pattern see you can do various things about this but to attempt to cope with this situation very hard is of course auditing its something that you should go through the one thing you cant go through with is the dirty needle the dirty needlevery often the thing is latent which is read and so forth when pc has just so many overts on an auditor dirty needle becomes rather chronic and it slips and it slides with sudden jerks to the left and right and then starts buzzing dont you see and those sudden jerks can have been going on sort of before you saw them do you get the idea i mean theyre not good and instant theyre not this theyre not that now if you take magnifying glass on this and if you watch it very very carefully with magnifying glass youll probably be able to detect an instant invalidation or something like that inside dirty needle now i can do this and 90 round blinking for week afterwards from the eyestrain actually read dirty needle and read the vibrations inside dirty needle in order to clean the thing up it can be done but there isnt any reason for you to do it at all because its ow itsnow its more 0 than w now when your pc is all the time all the time all the time withholding and theyve always got failed to reveal and theyve always got failed to reveal its you thats auditing them so they must have the overt on you so lets put it in terms of overts now lets make random rudiment out of overts in this session have you committed an overt against or in this session have you committed an overt or something like that and you all of sudden see that dirty needle broaden out into wider rock slam and then murder will out they actually repeat the goal to themselves several times after you do while youre asking them suppress in order to make sure or you know theyre helpful theyve been doing something you see or theyve been talking about how lousy you are out of session or something like this see something is going on here that you can pretty well plan on your constant dirty needle if not traceable to the auditor is traceable to somebody else but basically it would go like this to the auditor most likely to auditors you see to scientologists to scientology to something else on broader perimeter sort of about your scale of application of overts for instance somebody could do this they could be running beautifully go by reception desk in central organization steal book and after that you wouldnt be able to straighten their needle out do you see that some auditor that youre auditing could get furiously angry at pc and refuse to audit the pc and put the pc off and raise hell with the pc dont you see come under the heading of scientologists you might as well say scientologists and pcs there on the list you just jot it down and come back into session again hes got dirty needle hes got rock slam you cant read this thing you see so just put it down to this it is overts now theres thing called missed withhold isnt there well now just translate the whole lot into missed overts dones that they didnt find out about see and youve got basically the same situation only weve got the overt side of the situation you see so the missed overt done that people didnt find out about and that sort of thing youve got lot of phraseology that can go this way now of course that necessitates running some ow to clean that up doesnt it now let tell you the difficulties with ow and one of the reasons why you have so much trouble sec checking and prepchecking people is they dont answer the auditing question they answer the auditing question because of see they answer the auditing question with something else you say what have you done to your pc you finally isolated that pcs auditors are chopping their pcs to ribbons you see what have you done to pcs this is field auditor in practice some place or another they come in and you are clearing them and they answer it this way i wonder why the pc acted up so its what did i do to pcs to make pcs act up you see thats not the auditing question its what have you done to pcs not what have you done to pcs to make them act up and as longnow listenas long as they answer the question with any additive it will not clear now thats well worth knowing and youd better write that down very strong because where ow doesnt work the pc is not answering the auditing question and if you dont have reality on this already some day youre going to get flaming reality on it youre going to be utterly shocked at the fantastic offbeatyoull have run ow for fifteen or twenty minutes and the pc is just getting more and more arc breaky and you cant quite figure what the hells going on here you know you havent got any tone arm action or something like that and then lightning will strike and you will suddenly remember ron telling you at some time or another that it was because the pc wasnt answering the auditing question and you all of sudden decide to investigate even at the risk of causing further arc breaks and find out what the pc is answering and just explore this just discuss this for while all of suddenit sometimes takes pc quite while to get disentangled from this thing you knowyoull find out the pc was answering the auditing question with some via or additive in some fashion that had nothing to do with the auditing question like youre saying now what have you done to women see the pc gets dirty needle or rock slam or so forth every timeevery time he has anything to do with women see and he comes into session and youits all mess see of course its all on his goals line but you havent got his goal how the hell are you going to straighten it up see youryour problem is to find hisis find his goal without having found his goal see and then youve got rock slam and dirty needle and so forth so youre going to say to him all right what have you done to woman see and hes going to sayif you listen carefully theres always something little bit wrong with the answer well iveive scolded them that sounds all right to you see what have you done to them i have scolded them and you say all right what have you done to woman what have you withheld from woman now what have you done to woman and very shortly they run out of answers thats one of the phenomena they run out of answers theyre back to scolded again you see and they just arent getting any better now the index is and the only test you have is it isnt clearing up see youre getting tone arm action to amount to anything and it isnt clearing up they arent getting sweetertempered theyre getting worse so what you can count on is theyre askingtheyre answering question that sounds to them like this you say what have you done to woman see and they answer it why have i been victim of women for so long is it because i have scolded them is that why women do in and theyre actually running solutions and they get better they run solutions to the problem of why they cant get along with women you got the idea its kind of like they do little goals assessment on themselves god help them you see whywhy have i why have i been the victim of women why have women chewed up all the time why are women always stealing my car this is what theyre trying to solve you see theyre trying to solve whole bunch of problems with relationship to women not what have they done to women and the solution to it is to say now look look the question is done done done done done just plain done done you see done have you got that done and they say yes ive been victim of done done see done to women now get the idea of woman there and you there and youve done something to woman done justjust that and all of suddenyou dont harass them this way unless theyre getting worse on ow you see and youd better harass them see and done to women i really have never done anything to women not really oh hit them once in while well i guess you could call that an answer hit them if thats doing anything to woman but i guess it is hit them yes hit them all right thats an answer all right call it an answer yeah thats right i hit them and they sometimes will say to you but of course that doesnt have anything to do with my problem and you have to go over it and you say now look were not asking anything about your problem or anything all we want to know is what youve done to women just done oh this guy will say oh yes oh well if it comes to that very often picked them up and dropped them outside of civilization and make them walk you know i guess thats doing something to them yeah that is thats doing something to them and ignoring them mainly ignoring them yeah youve got whole bunch of new answers now these answers go along the pc gets cheerful and you get tone arm action whenever youre not getting tone arm action on security checking the pc is trying to solve problem not trying to answer the auditing question got it either that or there is answer on it you know youre justyoure checking ayoure checking check list sec check list of zero questions for burglars you see and the pc is an editor you know it just doesnt match his burglary is done in other ways so the whole situation you see is entirely shifted youre not getting an answer to the auditing question or it doesnt apply and you dont get tone arm action the pc feels better the pc feels worse all right that is actually your dirty needle now you can pick up some time when he had dirtier needle he had dirty needle in an early session you can you know you can flick what was the withhold missed on him in that session bang it goes out and youre not troubled with it you see you can do other stunts to get rid of this thing im just telling you what lies underneath these wide rock slams and chronic dirty needles and that sort of thing and why ow suddenly raised its head here few weeks ago after being dormant for so long but ow has that liabilityis the auditing question must be answered or the pc will get more nattery and get worse all right and if all those things are done nulling and looking for goal and so forth can be done rather easily very successfully and without too much trouble the pcs goal is on the list if the list is in the condition ive given you you see if its limp and so forth why his goal will be on the list and you will find his goal in spite of huhh huhhh in spite of this but sometimes you will run into this freak condition theres piece of the goals list missing or something wild like this has gone on and you will say oh wonder or something but id just do the whole list before i started worrying too much about special solutions to the thing but sometimes you will youll have piece of the goals list gone or something like that the pc brought in all the goals list except pages 2 3 and 4 haha after youre nulling at list number 759 why he says you know i found these on the dining room table the other day they were mixed up in some sandwiches i wonder if theyre important you see and his goal is number 4 on page 2 but sometimes youre unlucky and sometimes youre lucky well all right now ive given you lot of extra data here on nulling and finding goals and checking goals out and that sort of thing i hope the data will be of value to you this hasive given you very little about listing i will have to cover that another time thank you very much good night
