findings ufouo dhsoffice of in telligence and analysis ia judges that number of emerging trends point to leftwing extremists maturing and expanding their cyber attack capabilities over the next decade with the im of attacking targets in the united states ufouo the potential for economic da mage the individuallyinitiated and anonymous nature of cyber attacks an d the perception that cyber attacks are nonviolent align well with the ideol ogical beliefs strategic objectives and tactics of many leftwing extremists ufouo the increasing reliance of commercial businesses and other enterprises on cyber technologies in cluding interconnected networks and remote access creates new and expanding vulnerabilities that technicallysavvy leftwing extremists will exploit ufouo the proliferation of cyber tec hnologies and expertise as well as the public availability of online hacking t ools and hackersforhi re offer leftwing extremists incentives to adopt cyber attack strategy u appeal of cyber attacks ufouo dhsia assesses that cyber atta cks are attractive options to leftwing extremists who view attacks on economic ta rgets as aligning with their nonviolent noharm doctrine and tactic of direct action ufouo their noharm doctrine include s claiming to ensure the safety of humans animals and the environment even as they attack businesses and associated operations ufouo many leftwing extremists use the tactic of direct action to inflict economic damage on businesses and othe r targets to force the targeted organization to abandon what the extremists deem objectionable direct actions range from animal releases property thef t vandalism and cyber attacksall of which extremists regard as nonviolentto bombings and arson ufouo the north american earth li beration front press office the media arm of the earth liberation front elf published the following guidance for activists by inflicting as much economic damage as possible the elf can low given entity to decide if it is in their sic best economic interest to stop destroying life for the sake of profit ufouo lone wolves and small cells can conduct highlyeff ective cyber attacks consistent with the strategy of leaderless resistance that many leftwing extremist s embrace dhsia assesses that this facet of leftwing extremist operational strategy unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only page 4 of 7 will further encourage some extremists to improve their cyber ttack capabilities and possibly encourage recruitment of individuals with sophisticated cyb er skills into their trusted circles furthermore extremists can appl their cyber skills in support of number of different leftwing movements capab ility that is consistent with the frequent shifting of individuals among movements u the most common leftwing extremist cyber attacks particularly within the anim rights movement in the past several year s have included deletion of user accounts flooding companys server with emails and other types of email assaults intended to force businesses to exhaust resources ufouo on 13 july 2007 an animal rights extremist hacked into us companys computer system and leted more than 300 associates user accounts to restore the accounts the perpetrator demanded that the company sell its shares in corporation that conducts tests using animal subjects ufouo in october 2005 animal rights extremists launched an email attack against milwaukee wisconsin firm th at held stock in an animal testing laboratory the firm subsequently sold its shares in the laboratory with losses it estimated at approximately 14 million ufouo in late april 2005 animal rights extremists overwhelmed us companys computer server with mail which the company claims resulted in loss of approximately 125 million u attractive strategy for the future ufouo dhsia judges that the cyber attack option will be come increasingly attractive to leftwing extremists as compan ies reliance on cyber technologies grows dhsia also assesses that these extremists will improve their cybe r attack capabilities by keeping pace with emerging technologi and overcoming countermeasures that develop over the period of this assessment u increasing reliance on cyber technologies ufouo businesses and other enterprises re ly on interconnected computer networks for operational continuity storage of vital data and communications introducing vulnerabilities that leftwing extremists could xploit for example the use of integrated u leaderless resistance ufouo leaderless resistance stresses the impor tance of individuals and small cells operating independently and anonymously outside of formalized organizational structures or leadership in order to increase operational security and avoid detection postings on extremist websites and other online media forums offer guidance on objec tives tactics and target selection followers are encouraged to selftrain promote their own objectives and conduct attacks on

poorlymonitored or unsecured connections in this target rich environment cyber attacks likely will become an incr easingly attractive op tion particularly on businesses and industries th at extremists consider highpriority targets u the logging industry principal targ et for environmental extremists and an industry not traditionally associated with cyber technologies now relies on integrated systems to support forestry operations u the farming industry also is experi encing growth in th use of advanced technologies such as global positioning systems and remote sensing to cut costs and manage crop production the agricultur industry often is target of environmental extremists who oppose geneticallymodified crop production u proliferation of cyber attack tools and expertise ufouo dhsia believes that the availabi lity of cyber technologies and expertise such as online hacking tools and hackersfo rhire provides leftwing extremists with resources to augment their own ho megrown cyber attack capabilities resources and capabilities for successful c yber attacks are becoming more accessible to the public as evidenced by online advertisements for hacki ng services and software simple online search provides users with numerous links to discussion forums and websites that offer hacking tutorials and information regardi ng exploitable system vulnerabilities in addition illegal filesharing sites allow pirated c opies of hacking software to be freely exchanged ufouo in october 2007 law enfor cement authorities discovered group advertising hacking services to cust omers

as means of direct action and publish links to hacking resources on their websites u potential targets ufouo based on an analysis of previou s limited attacks bot h cyber and noncyber and on the prospective growing advantages of cyber attacks in the future dhsia judges that potential targets likely will expan d to include broader set of organizations and critical infrastructure that extremis ts associate with harming animals and degrading the natural environment as we ll as icons of capitalism and authority ufouo in addition dhsia judges that leftwing extremists will build upon the perceived success of previous noncyber attacks on secondary targets organizations with business links to pr imary targetand increasingly will attack secondary and possibly tertiary targets one animal rights extremist website claims that attacks on secondary busine sses have resulted in more than 200 companies severing ties with the primary ta rget organization secondary targets in previous noncyber attacks have incl uded financial partners and suppliers associated with the prin cipal target organization ufouo the international nature of many types of c yber attacks means that many more attackers will be available to attack greater number of dist ant targets including those in the united states recent study of noncyber attacks demonstrates that majority of leftwing extremists previously have focused their efforts locally and limited their targeting to within 30 miles of where they live global connectivity however makes the distance between the cyber att acker and the target irrelevant u one extremist animal rights group s monthly newsletter stated that in todays technological age computer systems are the real front doors to companies so instead of chaining ourselves together in the physical doorways of businesses we can achieve the same effect from the comfort sic our armchairs u hacktivism the convergence of hacking and activism using cyber
