the adjusted basis of the property minus any salvage value and any insurance or other reimbursement that is received or expected to be received casualty losses are generally deductible only in the year the casualty occurred however if deductible loss occurs as re sult of disaster in presidentiallydeclared disaster area taxpayers can choose to deduc t that loss on the tax return for the year
