items changed each military service acted as single manager for various categories of consumables issued by all four services each single manager would buy items store and issue supplies manage inventories and forecast future requirements for example the us army bought and manage d all military food and clothing the navy managed all medical supplies petroleum and industrial parts and the air force managed all electronic items the single manager system reduced costs by centralizing wholesale stocks simplifying the supply chain and pe rsuading each military service to adopt the same standard items however the single manager concept was only partially successful because it did not provide uniform procedures among the services in 1961 then secretary of defense robert mcnamara ordered that the single manager agencies be consolidated into one agency resulting in the establishment of the defense supply agency1 the forerunner to dla in 1986 the goldwaternichols act identified
