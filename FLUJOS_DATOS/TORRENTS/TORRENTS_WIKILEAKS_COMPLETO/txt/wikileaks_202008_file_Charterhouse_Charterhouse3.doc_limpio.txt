money was paid directly to italy by mr paresh shah us3998250 and mr palvi patel us2198250 paolo to sanjay regarding aku of brand imports dated 16 november 2005 aku has given instructions to charterhouse to remit to tradex italy euro 3922818that is fine for but can you make sure sender neither details will appear on the tt reason is i do not have any official outstanding on my books with brand imp sanjay responded on 17 nov 2005 we will not put name on your euro credit on the statement sanjay to paolo dated 7 july 2005 kindly note the above amount has been remitted to your account by hon kabogo the amount is euros 5270 paolo to sanjay dated 13 september 2005 i have asked suresh to pay 100000 euros to tradex to be able to pay his suppliers i do not know whether he needs to pay the same to my account in kenya or notin case he wants to go through my charterhouse account please make sure this will not be done in one lot parmex and pgt parmex is company registered in the uk and pgt in dubai it appears that there is common ownership interest in these two companies by the parmar family which actively manages these companies the uk company is actively managed by mr dparmar and mr s parmar and the dubai business by mr bparmar and mr c parmar of bparmar there is evidence of an agreement by sanjay to pay parmex 05 profitcommission on the fob values from the suppliers parmex and pgt facilitate the documentation including providing pro forma invoices for the purpose of import declaration inspection shipment and payment on behalf of the importers of goods to the exporters this arrangement is similar to that of paolo of tradex but in this case paolo often does the administrative work and also issues parmex ltd invoices to ktl and other importers key importers are ktl and creative innovations ltd ktl purchases tyres mainly from transityres in europe in the name of parmex transityres invoices parmex which in turn invoices ktl and sends both of these invoices to ktl sanjay provides guidance on the activities and trading of parmex and has arranged securities for loan facilities to parmexs lenders parmex had loan facilities of about us44m october 2004 at amn amro guaranteed by personal deposits of sanjay shahmanoj shahmanish shah other activities of parmex and pgt local sales paid offshore there is evidence that sales made locally by ktl to buyers such as transenergy k ltd in mombasa rt east africa ltd and bachu industries are paid for in dubai to pgt by the purchasers eg local sale of us181936 to transenergy was paid for by transenergys office in dubai to pgt by way of 4 equal post dated cheques similarly another local sale to transenergy of us 56880 was paid for in dubai to pgt and in this particular instance 2 invoices seem to have been raised by kingsway tyre and automart one for us value to pgt since they asked for an invoice to be accounted for in their books and another local invoice to transenergy it is therefore likely that this method of invoicing and direct offshore paymentsreceipts could result in underreported revenues by ktl payment of personal and friends bills certain personal bills and of parties relatedassociated to sanjay are received by parmex and paid on sanjays approval these include bills for credit cards amex card bills for mr harun mwau and safe deposit box rentals dparmar notified sanjay of receiving john haruns amex bill of 9086 and the need to pay this bill local payments on behalf of pgt often payments are made locally by sanjay on behalf of pgt on instructions of mr b parmar the equivalent of the local amounts in us is credited to the relevant accounts such as ktl or creative innovations ltd account in dubai examples include payment of us10000 made to mr jaffer and creative innovations ltd account credited in dubai kshs 1152540 paid to mr gulam abbas and creative innovations ltd account credited in dubai us10000 and kshs 449580 paid to mr gulam abbas and ktl account credited with us16000 in dubai receiving payments from paolo on behalf of ktl paolo maintains trading current account with parmex often sanjay requests paolo to instruct parmex to debit paolos account in its books and credit the ktl account with the same in return ktl credits paolos us account at cb eg us100000 transfer from paolos account into ktl account in parmex books was reimbursed to paolo in his us account at cb by way of 10 tranches of us10000 so as to avoid any documentation as required by cbk receiving payments for various third parties various payments were received into the parmex account at cb from individuals cb and likely customers of ktl it seems there were private arrangements made by sanjay with the remitters to have funds remitted to parmex further investigations are required to understand the completeness of these transactions ie the authenticity of the remitters and the reasons for remitting monies to parmex the table below provides details of some of the

establish the payments made by books first and hidden treasures in respect of this consignment and the taxes paid taxes import duty excise duty vat paid there is evidence of activities that strongly suggest the possibility of underpayment of taxes by the importers that sanjay is associated with these activities entail preparing undervalued proforma and commercial invoices for purposes of idf

in trouble with bv and customs due to documentation declarations we believe melvin has briefed you on what counter measure we took in order to get the containers moving and meet bv requirements we need to highlight to you that we actually put ourselves at risk by sorting the documents with customs we have consulted our group financial controller who gave his personal guarantee to the customs and also paid some fees to the customs officers which we will need you to assist in paying this is not healthy for khind as public listed company and if we are found out to do double declaration we will be black listed by the customs and our export licence might be suspended from paolo memo to amin and manoj shah of ktl dated 4 october 2004 below is relevant extraction from the memo as agreed

negotiation from paolo to sanjay dated 17 march 2004 i keep on receiving from bureau veritas requests for inspection for tyres tube and flap on wilson logisticscapricorn etc etc of course all of them have been applied by cargo distributors i do not know what to say to them since they want to inspect the goods please let know it is possible that paolo means that using cargo distributors ltd as the consignee was creating problem with the inspectors such that they inspected the shipment where the consignee was it appears that as result of this concern the consignee for the pending shipment was changed to nairobi procurements ltd and the shippers advised accordingly by paolo other unusual matters below are extracts of some of the emails that indicate unusual operations at chb unclaimed
