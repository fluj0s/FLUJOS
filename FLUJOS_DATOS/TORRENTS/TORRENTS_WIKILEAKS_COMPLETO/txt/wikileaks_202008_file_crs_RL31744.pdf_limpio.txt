1996 cppa pl 104 208 to the extent that it prohibited material that was produced without the use of an actual child the only possible means that the court explicitly left open for congress to try to restrict such material was to ban it but allow an affirmative defense that the material was produced without using actual children even this approach the court did not say would be constitutional but rely found need to decide whether it would be this approach would shift the burden of proof to the defendant on the question of whether actual children were used in producing the material if the defendant could not meet the burden of proof then he could be punished for child pornography that might or might not have been pr oduced with an actual minor the court however said that the government ma not suppress lawful speech as means to suppress unlawful speech this suggests that an affirmative defense would be unconstitutional if it were not effectively available to all classes of defendant it might not effectively be available how ever to individuals charged with mere possession of child pornography or to produ cers of pornography that predated the cppa as these defendants might have

the current federal child pornography statute part of which was declared unconstitutional in ashcroft v free speech coalition 2 ashcroft v free speech coalition and 3 s 151 108th congress in its versions passed by the senate and the house the federal child pornography statute the federal child pornography statute pr ohibits the transporting shipping receipt distribution repr oducti on selling or possessing of child pornography5 it defines sexually explicit conduct conduct in which one may not depict minors engaging as actual or simulated sexual intercourse including genitalgenital oralgenital analgenital or oralanal whet her between persons of the same or opposite sex b bestiality c masturbation d sadistic or ma sochistic abuse or lascivious exhibition of th genitals or pubic area of any person6 the child pornography prevention act of 1996 cppa7 added to the statute the following definition of child pornography child pornography means any visu depiction including any photograph film video picture or computer or computer generated image or picture whether made or produced by electronic mechanical or other means of sexually explicit conduct where the production of such visual depiction involves the use of minor engaging in xually explicit conduct b such visual depiction is or appears to be of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct c such visual depiction has b een created adapted or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct or d such visual depiction is advertised prom oted presented described or distributed in ch manner that conveys the impression that the material is or contains visual depiction of minor engaging in xually explicit conduct8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31744crs3 9 18 usc 2252ac the reason that this affirmative defense is not available to defendant charged with possession without intent to sell is that the affirmative defense applies only to paragraphs 1 2 3 nd 4 of section 2252aa whereas paragraph 5 covers possession offenses paragraph 4 covers possession with intent to sell 10 18 usc 2252d 2252ad 11 ashcroft supra note 4 122 s ct at 1401 see also id at 1397 12 id at 1402 see also id at 1401 13 id at 1397the cppa however provides an affirm ative defense not available to defendant charged with posse ssion without intent to sell that each person used in producing the alleged child pornography was an adult and that t he defendant did not advertise promote present describe or distribute the material in such manner as to convey the impression that it is or contai ns visual depiction of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct9 for defendant charged only with possession of child pornography there is an affirmative defens that the defendant 1 possessed fewer than three images of child pornography and 2 promptly and in good faith destroyed or reported the images to law enforcement agency10 ashcroft v free speech coalition on april 16 2002 in ashcroft v free speech coalition the supreme court struck down paragraphs b and d of the definition of child pornography quoted above paragraphs wh ich covers images of actual children engaged in sexually explicit conduct and paragr aph c which covers images of actual children morphed to make it appear as if the children are engaged in sexually explicit conduct were not in issue paragraphs b and d by contrast cover pornography that was produced without the use of actual children in ashcroft v free speech coalition the supreme court obs erved that statutes that prohibit child pornography that is produced with actual children are constitutional because they target the production of the work not the content11 the cppa by contrast targeted the cont ent not the means of production virtual child pornography is not intrinsically rela ted to the sexual abuse of children as were the materials in ferber 12 the governments rationales for the cppa included that pedophiles might use the materials to encourage children to participate in sexual activity and might whet their own sexual appetites with it thereby increasing the sexual abuse and exploitation of actual children13 the court found thes rationales inadequate because the evil in question depends upon the actors unlawful conduct conduct defined as criminal quite apart from any link to the speech in questi on the government cannot constitu tionally premise legisla tion on the desirability of controlling persons private thoughts the government may not prohibit speech because it increases the chance an unlawfu l act will be committed at some indefinite future time wit hout significantly stronger more direct connection thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31744crs4 14 id at 1403 15 id at 1397 16 id at 1404 justice thomas concurring wrot that technology may evolve to the point where the government cannot prove th at certain pornographic images are of real children and that if that becomes the case the government may well have compelling interest in barring or otherwise regulating so narrow category of lawful speech in order to enforce effectively laws against pornography made though the abuse of real children id at 14061407 17 id at 1400 18 id at 1411government may not prohibit speech on th ground that it may encourage pedophiles to engage in illegal conduct14 the government also argued that the existence of virtual child pornography can make it harder to prosecute pornographers who do use real minors because as imaging technology improves it becomes more difficult to prove that particular picture was pr oduced using actual children15 this analysis the court found turns the first amendment upside down the government may not suppress lawful speech as means to suppress unlawful speech protected speech does not become unprotected merely because it resemb the latter the constitution requires the reverse the possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possib ility that protected speech of others may be muted 16 the court also noted that because child pornography unlike obscenity may include material with serious literary artistic political or scientific value it includes any depiction of sexually explicit activity matter how it is presented the cppa therefore applies to picture in psychology manual as well as movie depicting the horrors of sexual abuse teenage sexual activity and the sexual abuse of children have inspired countless literary works17 the court then noted that the cppa would make it crime to film shakespeares romeo and juliet in manner that made it appear that the teenage lovers were engaging in sexually explicit conduct the majority opinion in ashcroft v free speech coalition was written by justice kennedy and joined by justices st evens souter ginsberg and breyer with justice thomas concurring justice connor concurred insofar as the decision struck down the prohibition of child pornogra phy created with adults that look like children but dissented insofar as it struck down the ban on virtual child pornography chief justice rehnquist wrote dissenting opi nion joined by justice scalia arguing that the cppa should be construed to pply only to computergenerated images that are virtually indistinguishable from real children engaged in sexually explicit conduct and upheld as such18 did the court leave congress with any constitutional means by which it may restrict child pornography that was produced without an actual child the only possibility that the court explicitly left open not by saying that it would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31744crs5 19 id at 14041405constitutional but merely by finding need to decide the question is to ban material that appears to pict an actual child engaging in sexually explicit conduct but that was produced without using an act ual child while allowing an affirmative defense that the material was produced wit hout using an actual child this approach would shift the burden of proof to the defe ndant on the question of whether an actual child was used in producing the material if the defendant could not meet the burden of proof then he could be punished fo r child pornography that might or might not have been produced with an actual minor here is what the court said on this matter the government would have us read the cppa not as measure suppressing speech but as law shifting the burden to the accused to prove the speech is lawful in this connection the government relies on an affirmative defense under the statute which allows defenda nt to avoid conviction for nonpossession offenses by showing that the materials were produced using only adults and were not otherwise distributed in manner conveying the impression that they depicted real children see 18 usc 2252ac the government raises serious constitutional difficulties by seeking to impose on the defendant the burden of provin g his speech is not unlawful an affirmative defense applies only after prosecution has begun and the speaker must himself prove on pain of felony conviction that his conduct falls within the affirmative defense in cases unde r the cppa the evidentiary burden is not trivial where the defendant is not the producer of the work he may have way of establishing the identity or even the ex istence of the actors if the evidentiary issue is serious problem for the government as it asserts it will be at least as difficult for the innocent po ssessor the statute moreover applies to work created before 1996 and the producers them selves may not have preserved the records necessary to meet the burden of proof failure to establish the defense can lead to felony conviction we need not decide however whether th government could impose this burden on speaker even if an affirmative defense can save statute from first amendment challenge here the defense is incomplete and insufficient even on its own terms it allows persons to be convicted in some instances where they can prove children were not exploited in the production defendant charged with possessing as opposed to distributin g proscribed works may not defend on the ground that the film depicts only adult actors see ibid so while the affirmative defense may protect movie producer from prosecution for the act of distribution that same producer nd all other persons in the subsequent distribution chain could be liable for possessing the prohibited work furthermore the affirmative defense provides protection to persons who produce speech by using computer imagin g or through other means that do not involve the use of adult actors who appear to be minors see ibid in these cases the defendant can demonstrate children were harmed in producing the images yet the affirmative defense would not bar the prosecution for this reason the affirmative defense cannot save the statute for it leaves unprotected substantial amount of speech not tied to the governments interest in distinguishing images produced using real children from virtual ones19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31744crs6 20 see note 9 supra 21 id at 1404 previously quoted in the text accompanying note 16 supra 22 id at 1407 23 id at 1405 24 id at 1406in the third paragraph of this quota tion the court notes that the cppas affirmative defense is not available to defendants charged with possessing as opposed to distributing proscribed works and is not available to defendants charged with producing material using computer ima ging or through other means that do not involve the use of adult actor s who appear to be minors20 but if congress expanded the affirmative defense to include these two classes of defenda nts the cppa might still be unconstitutional an affirmative defense that applied to defendants charged with possession offenses or to producers of older works might violate due process because such persons might as the court noted in the second paragraph of the above quotation have way of establishing the identity or even the existence of the actors if such persons had way of establishing their innocence then the affirmative defense would ffectively not be available to them and the government would still apparently in vi olation of the first amendm ent suppress lawful speech as means to suppress unlawful speech21 justice thomas in his concurring opi nion wrote the court does leave open the possibility that more complete affirmative defense could save statutes constitutionality see at 1405 implicitly accepting that some regulation of virtual child pornography might be constitutional i would not prejudge however whether more complete affirmative defense is the only way to narrowly tailor criminal statute that prohibits the possession and dissemination of virtual child pornography22 he does not however suggest any other way the court concluded in sum 2256 8b covers materials beyond the categories of unprotected speech recognized in ferber child pornography using an actual child and miller obscenity and the reasons the government offers in support of limiting the freedom of speech have justification in our precedents or in the law of the first amendment23 it added that the prohibitions of 22568d as well as of 22568b are overbroad and unconstitutional24 s 151 108th congress senatepassed and housepassed versions this section of the report will summarize five major provisions of s 151 as reported by the judiciary committee and passed by the senate that appear to raise first amendment issues and consider whether they would violate the first amendments prohibition on congresss abridg ing the freedom of speech at the end of the discussion of each of the five provisions we will describe the house passed versions comparable provision next we will discuss provision in the housepassed version of s 151 that has counterpart in the senatepassed version finally we will mention additional provisions in both billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31744crs7 25 there appears to be significant differe nce between reflects the belief and is intended to cause another to believe both refer to the manner of advertising

bill would make it crime knowingly to advertise promote presen t distribute or solicit any material or purported material in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause another to believe that the materi or purported material contains i an obscene visual depiction of minor engaging in sexually explic it conduct or ii visual depiction of an actual minor gaging in sexually explicit conduct the two types of material specified in i and ii obscenity and child pornography produced with an actual child ar not of course protected by the first amendment if however material is not of the type specified in i or ii if it is visual depiction that is not obscene and is not of an actual minor but appears to be of an actual minor then it is protected by the first amendment if it is protected by the first amendment then can the fact that person distributes it in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause another to believe that is unprotected render it unprotected the answer as we discuss following the next paragraph appears to be and th is provision of the senatep assed bill therefore would apparently be unconstitutional insofar as it applies to distribution of protected speech there would however appear to be constitutional problem with respect to the words advertises promotes prese nts or solicits in the provision this is because these words would not restrict protected material to prohibit advertisements of protected material in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause another to believe that it is unprotected would be to prohibit what is in effect false advertising25 false advertising of cour is not protected by the first amendment26 prohibiting distribution of protected speech however unlike prohibiting false advertising of it would restrict protect ed speech an argument that this would nevertheless be constitutional might rely on ginzburg v united states 1966 case in which the supreme court by 5to 4 majority found that the question of obscenity may include consideration of th setting in which the publications were presented as an aid to determinin g the question of obscenity 27 considering the setting in which the publications in stion were presented the court noted that the publications had been mailed from in tercourse and blue ball pennsylvania solely for the value their names would have in furthering petitioners efforts to sell their publications on the basis of salacious appeal and that the leer of the sensualist also permeates the advertising for the three publications28 the court found that evidence of the manner in which the publications were advertised and mailed was relevant in determining the ultimate question ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31744crs8 29 id at 470 30 id 31 id 32 id with respect to all th ree factors the court in ginzburg applied the roth test for obscenity which preceded the current miller test see note 1 supra but the differences between the tests are immaterial for present purposes 33 id at 474 34 id at 476 35 splawn v california 431 us 595 1977 pinkus v united states 436 us 293 303 304 1978 36 425 us 748 1976 37 splawn v california supra note 35 at 603 n2 stevens j dissenting 38 see crs report 95815 freedom of speech and press exceptions to the first continuedobscenity 29 the first factor that must be considered in determining whether material is obscene is whether it appeals to the prurient interest and as to this factor the court found that the deliberate re presentation of petitioners publications as erotically arousing stimulated the r eader to accept them as prurient30 the second factor that must be considered in determining whether material is obscene is its degree of offensiveness and here the c ourt found that the brazenness of the petitioners appeal heightens the offe nsiveness of the publications 31 the third factor that must be considered in determining whether material is obscene is whether it has serious literary artistic political or scientific va lue and the court found that the circumstances of presen tation and dissemination of ma terial are equally relevant in determining whether social importance claimed for material in the courtroom was in the circumstances pretense or reality whether it was the basis upon which it was traded in the marketplace or s purious claim for litigation purposes32 the court concluded in ginzburg that it perceived threat to first amendment guarantees in thus holding that in close cases evidence of pandering may be probative with respect to the nature of the material in question 33 evidence of such pandering may support the deter mination that the material is obscene even though in other contexts the materi would escape such condemnation34 the supreme court applied the panderi ng rationale in two subsequent cases in the 1970s35 its continued validity however appears uncertain because the supreme court also in the 1970s held in virginia pharmacy board v virginia consumer council that truthful nonmisleading co mmercial speech is protected by the first amendment although to lesse r degree than protected noncommercial speech36 the sort of pandering that caused the publications in ginzburg to be found obscene in other words has since ginzburg gained some first amendment protection in one of two post ginzburg pandering cases in the 1970s dissent joined by four justices stated that ginzburg cannot survive virginia pharmacy 37 since the 1970s the supreme court has not addressed the pa ndering rationale but it has repeatedly struck down governmental restrictions on commercial speech38httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31744crs9 38 continued amendment 39 jenkins v georgia 418 us 153 1974 40 see text accompanying note 33 supra consequently though ginzburg has not been overturned its precedential value seems questionable if the pandering rationale remains valid then it might be basis for court to uphold conviction under the senatepa ssed bill for distributing obscene material that might not be obscene if the defendant had not distributed it in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause another to believe that it was obscene but if the pandering ra tionale remains valid then this would be the case under existing obscenity law as well the pandering rationale would not appear to enable the government to justify prosecution under the senatepassed bill that went further than existing obscenity law by attempting to convict defendant for distributing material that was clearly not obscene merely because the defendant distributed it in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause another to believe that it was obscene consider for example the movie c arnal knowledge which the supreme court found to be not obscene because it was not patently offensive39 under the senatepassed bill if defendant distributed carnal knowledge in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause another to believe that it contained an obscene visual depiction of minor engaging in xually explicit conduct then the defendant would be guilty of crime but the pandering rationale of ginzburg allows merely that in close cases ev idence of pandering may be probative of obscenity40 carnal knowledge because of the supreme court decision is not close case therefore to distribute it in pandering manner would not make it obscene and if it is not obscene then it is protected speech and the senatepassed bill would be unconstitutional to the extent that it would punish the distribution of protected speech on the ground that the fendant distributed it in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause another to believe that it was obscene we have thus far addressed only the senatepassed bills prohibition of distributing material in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause another to believe that the material contains i an obscene visual depiction of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduc t we now address the senatepassed bills prohibition of distributing material in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause another to believe that the material contains ii visual depiction of an actual minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct as to this material the pandering rati onale would be of releva nce if the pandering rationale remains relevant to deter minations of obscenity it does so because determinations of obscenity ar made by subjective test that weighs publications degree of prurience offensiveness and literary artistic political or scientific value and pandering the court held in ginzburg may be probative in weighing these factors determinations of child pornography by contrast are made by an objective test does the material visually depict an actual child engaged in sexually explicithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31744crs10 conduct the manner in whic h the material is distribut ed cannot affect the answer to this question and therefore is not rele vant to whether it is child pornography if the material is not child pornography then the senatepassed bill apparently could not constitutionally punish it because of the manner in which it is distributed to summarize our analysis of this provision it would app ear constitutional to make it crime to advertise promote present or solicit in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause another to believe that the material constitutes obscenity or child pornography produced with an actual child it would appear unconstitutional however to make it crime to distribute protected speech in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause anot her to believe that the material constitutes obscenity or ch ild pornography produced with an actual child if the pandering rationale of ginzburg remains valid then the senatepassed bill would constitutionally pe rmit the prosecution of some speech that would be obscene by virtue of the pandering ra tionale but it would not add anything to existing law in that respect the housepassed bill has comparable provision in section 503 but it would prohibit advertising promoting presenting or describing whereas the senatepassed bill would prohibit advertising promoting presenting distributing or soliciting the housepassed bill thus would not prohibit distributing and therefore would not have the apparent constitutional problem that the senatepassed bill would have in addition whereas the senatep assed bill would prohibit adve rtising etc of material in manner to cause person to believe th at it is an obscene depiction of minor or is child pornography produced with an actual child this provision of the house passed bill would cover only the latter second provision section 3 of the senatepassed bill would make it crime knowingly to distribute offer send or provide to minor any visual depiction that is or appears to be of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct for purposes of inducing or pe rsuading minor to participate in any activity that is illegal this provision would make it illegal to distribute some protected speech to minors namely visu depictions produced without using an actual minor of minor engaging in sexu ally explicit conduct but it would make distribution of such material illegal onl if done for an illegal purpose and the government may prohibit inducing or persuading by any means minor or an adult to participate in an activity that is illegal thus congress could prohibit individuals from using for example candy or tickets to ball game as well as visual depictions to induce or persuade minor to participate in an illegal activity but it seems uncertain whether congress may make it crime to induce or persuade only by means that restricts protected speech person to participate in an illegal activity in simon schuster inc v mbers of the new york state crime victims board the supreme

v black 011107 and is expected to issue decision this termdescribing his crime be deposited in an escrow account and made available to victims of the crime and the criminals other creditors41 the court wrote we conclude simply that in the of sam law new york has singled out speech on particular subject for financial burden that it pl aces on other speech and other income the states interest in compensating victims from the fruits of crime is compelling one but the of sam law is not narrowly tailored to advance that objective as re sult the statute is inconsistent with the first amendment42 although the court nevertheless stated th at it was not basing its decision on the statutes underinclusivene ss its not including income from other sources43 its conclusion just quoted suggests that had th statute required the seizure of income from nonspeech sources as well as from speech sources it would at least have had one less constitutional difficulty analogously in rav v city of st paul the court struck down an ordinance that prohibited the placing on public or pr ivate property of symbol such as burning cross or nazi swastika which one knows or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race color creed religion or gender44 the supreme court held that even construing the ordinance to apply only to fighting words which are not protected by the first amendment45 the ordinance was unconstitutional because it did not ban all fighting words but singled out some on the basis of hostility to their content the ordinance banned fighting words that insult on the basis of race color creed religion or gender but not for example on the basis of political affiliation union membership or homosexuality 46 if the government may not ban only some fighting words then arguably it may not ban only speech related means of i nducing or persuading minors to engage in illegal activities the government however may prohibit di stribution to minors of some if not all visual depictions that appear to be of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and it may prohibit distribution of such visual depictions even if the distribution is not for the purpose of inducin g or persuading minor to engage in an illegal activity it may do so because the supreme court has recognized that there is compelling interest in shielding minors from the influence of literature thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31744crs12 47 sable communications of california in c v federal communications commission 492 us 115 126 1989 we said that the govern ment may prohibit distribution to minors of some if not all such material because the supreme court seems to be becoming less absolute in viewing the protection of all minors regardless of age from all

1161 n61 2000 supp 48 previously quoted in the third graph of the text accompanying note 19 supra is not obscene by adult standards47 thus the senatepassed bill might avoid the possible constitutional problem of banning only speechrelated means of inducing or persuading minors to engage in illegal activities by simply banning distribution of the material to minors regardless of the purpose of the distribution the housepassed bill has comparable provision in section 505 but it would prohibit providing or showing to person be low the age of 16 the senatepassed bill uses minor which means under 18 material that is obscene or child pornography the senatepassed bill would include only the latter the housepassed bill would not like the senatepasse d bill li mit the offense to for purposes of i nducing or persuading minor to participate in any activity that is illegal it would thereby avoid the possible constitutiona l problem mentioned above third provision section 3 of the senatepassed bill would rewrite the affirmative defense provision of the cppa which provided that defendant may avoid conviction by proving that each pe rson used in producing the alleged child pornography was an adult and that the defendant did not advertise promote present describe or distribute the mate rial in such manner as to convey the impression that it is or contains visual depiction of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct the affirmative defense provision of the sena tepassed bill would require the defendant to prove that each person used in producing the alleged child pornography was an adult or that none wa s minor except that to prove that none was minor would not be an affirmative defense in prosecution that involves child pornography as described in 18 usc 22568c which covers images of an actual child morphed to make it appear as if the child is engaging in sexually explicit conduct the defendant would longer have to prove anything with regard to how he advertised promot ed presented described or di stributed the material in addition the affirmative defense in the natepassed bill unlike the one in the cppa would apply to prosecutions fo r possession of child pornography under 18 usc 2252aa5 the change from having to prove that each actor was an adult to having the option to prove that none was minor w ould be significant because the former requirement as the supreme court noted in ashcroft meant that the affirmative defense provided protection to persons who produce speech by using computer imaging or through other means that do not involve the use of adult actors who appear to be minors48 would the senatepassed bills changes to the affirmative defense make it constitutional in ashcroft the court found the affirmative defense in the cppahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31744crs13 49 id see note 9 supra 50 id the reason that this was the case under the cppa is that the affirmative defense required the defendant to prove that each actor was an adult at the time the material was produced 51 previously quoted in the second graph of the text accompanying note 19 supra 52 previously quoted in the text accompanying note 16 which indicates that this statement was response to the governments argument that ban on virtual child pornography should be permitted because as imaging technology improves it becomes more difficult to prove that particular picture was produced using actual childrenincomplete and insufficient for two reasons 1 defendant charged with possessing as opposed to distributing proscribed works may not defend on the ground that the film depicts only adult actors49 and 2 the affirmative defense provides protection to persons who produce speech by using computer imaging or through other means that do not involve the use of adult actors who appear to be minors50 the senatepassed bill would eliminate both of these problems but this would not necessarily mean that its affirmative defense would be constitutional because the court in ashcroft did not say that eliminating these two problems would be sufficient rather it said that it need not decide whether the government could impose on speaker the burden of provi ng his innocence and it wrote where the defendant is not the producer of the work he may have way of establishing the identity or even the exis tence of the actors if the evidentiary issue is serious problem for the government as it asserts it will be at least as difficult for the innocent po ssessor the statute moreover applies to work created before 1996 and the producers them selves may not have preserved the records necessary to meet the burden of proof failure to establish the defense can lead to felony conviction51 all these facts would remain the case unde r the senatepassed bill defendant other than producer might not be able to prove that minor was not used in the production of child pornography whether it was produced with adult actors or computergenerated and even producer might not be able to prove this with regard to material that predated the cppa though the court left open whether prosecutions in either of these instances would be constitutional it did say that the government may not suppre ss lawful speech as means to suppress unlawful speech52 the affirmative defense in the senatepassed bill would arguably not prevent the suppression of lawful speech in some cases the housepassed bill has comparable provision in 502d but it would require the defendant to pr ove that the production of the alleged child pornography did not involve the use of minor it would not include the senatepassed b ills option of proving that each person used wa s an adult under the housepassed bill the affirmative defense would not apply in cases that involve child pornography as defined in 18 usc 22568a or c section 22568a cove rs cases that uses an actual child and the unavailability of an affirmative defense might go without saying because as the government would ve the burden of proving that an actual child was used it follows that the defenda nt would not have the burden of proving that one was not used section 22568c covers cases of morphed child thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31744crs14 53 the senatepassed bill would make this change in the course of restructuring 22562a through into 22562ai th roughv and 22562bi through iii section 22562a currently begins sexually explicit conduct means actual or simulated t he senatepassed bill would strike means actual and insert means it presumably means to strike or simulated as well but leaves these words floating it then covers actual or simulated in 22562b with actual apparently redundant housepassed bill differs from the senatepassed bill with respect to these cases in that the senatepassed bill but not the housepassed bill would permit the defendant to avoid conviction by proving th at each person used was an adult fourth provision section 5 of the senatepassed bill would revise the definition in 18 usc 2256 of minor which is any person under the age of eighteen years to add that the term sha ll not be construed to require proof of the actual identity of the person section 5 would also revise the defin ition of sexually explicit conduct which is what visual depiction must depict an actual minor to be engaged in for it to be illegal under 18 usc 2252 or as disc ussed below what under the senate passed bill virtual child pornography must depict for it to be illegal under 18 usc 2252a under its current definition s exually explicit conduc t includes among other things simulated sexual intercourse under the senatepassed bill depictions of simulated xual intercourse would be prohibited only if they are lascivious and only if the genitals breast or pubic area of any person is exhibited distinction is drawn between the male and female versions of these parts of the body53 section 5 would next strike paragraphs b and d of the definition of child pornography which are the paragraphs that ashcroft declared unconstitutional it would replace current paragraph b with new paragraph b that would define child pornography to include visual depi ctions whose production involves the use of an identifiable minor engaging in sexua lly explicit conduct at first glance this provision might seem redundant of pa ragraph which defines child pornography to include visual depictions whose production involves the use of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct but section 5 of the senatepassed bill would also add new definition of ide ntifiable minor without substantively altering the existing definition to include virtual child pornography section 5 provides that identifiable minor means computer image computer generated image or digital image i that is of or is virtually indistinguishable from that of an actual minor and ii that depicts sexually explicit conduct as defined in paragraph 2b paragraph 2b is the portion of the definition of sexua lly explicit conduct that covers various actual or simulated sexual activitie s section 5 provides that virtually indistinguishable means that the depiction is such that an ordinary person viewing the depiction would conclude that the depic tion is of an actual minor and b does not apply to depictions that are dr awings cartoons sculptures diagramshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31744crs15 54

indistinguishable from an actual child would not given ashcroft be constitutional the majority in ashcroft held it unconstitutional to prohibit any nonobscene material that does not portray an actual child engaged in sexually explicit conduct the housepassed bill has comparable provisi on in section 502a which would define child pornography to include computergenerated image that is indistinguishable from that of minor gaging in sexually explicit conduct and 18 usc 1466a which would be created by section 504 would define indistinguishable to mean virtually indistinguishable fifth provision section 6 of the senatepassed bill would enact 18 usc 2252b which would make it crime knowingly to produce distribute receive or possess 54 visual depiction of any kind including drawing cartoon sculpture or painting that 1a depicts minor engaging in xually explicit conduct and b is obscene or 2a depicts an image that is or appear s to be of minor engaging in various sexual activities and b lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value number 1 of these prohibitions woul d be constitutional because it would be limited to obscene material number 2 of these prohibitions would be unconstitutional to the extent that it banned material that did not portray an actual minor the fact that material lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value means that it satisfies one of the three prongs of the miller test for obscenity but does not make it obscene or otherwise less than fully protected by the first amendment the housepassed bill has comparable provision in section 504 which would enact 18 usc 1466b which would diffe r from the senatepa ssed bills 18 usc 2252b in that the housepassed bill w ould prohibit only obscene depictions and thereby would avoid the constitutional problem with number 2 in the senatepassed bill sixth provision section 504 of the housepassed bill would enact 18 usc 1466a which would make it crime knowingly to produce distribut receive or possess with or without in tent to distribute visual depiction that is or is indistinguishable from that of prepubescent child engaging in sexually explicit
