from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re fwd re review of ee paper on alleged wang fraud date thu 30 aug 2007 090141 0400 cc kevin trenberth trenbertucaredu gavin schmidt gschmidtgissnasagov xflowed thanks phil i did take the liberty of discussing w gavin who can of course be trusted to maintain the confidentiality of this were in agreement that keenan has wandered his way into dangerous territory here and that in its current form this is clearly libellous there is not even pretense that he is only investigating the evidence furthermore while many of us fall under the category of limited public figures and therefore the threshold for proving libel is quite high this is not the case for weichyung he is not public figure i believe they have made major miscalculation here in treating him as if he is in the uk where ee is published the threshold is even lower than it is in the states for proving libel we both think he should seek legal advice on this as soon as possible with respect to peisers guest editing of ee and your review following up on kevins suggestions we think there are two key points first if there are factual errors other than the fraud allegation it is very important that you point them out now if not keenan could later allege that he made the claims in good faith as he provided you an opportunity to respond and you did now secondly we think you need to also focus on the legal implications in particular you should mention that the publisher of libel is also liable for damages that might make sonja bc be little wary of course if it does get published maybe the resulting settlement would shut down ee and benny and sonja all together we can only hope anyway so maybe in an odd way its actually winwin for us not them lets see how this plays out realclimate is of course always available to you as an outlet if it seems an appropriate venue but we should be careful not to jump the gun here kevin very sorry to hear about dennis please pass along my best wishes for speedy recovery if and when it seems appropriate to do so mike phil jones wrote mike kevin thanks for your sets of thoughts ive been in touch with weichyung whos in china at the moment he forwarded the paper to the people dealing with keenans allegations at suny he got reply to say that keenan has now violated the confidentiality agreement related to the allegation so it isnt right to respond whilst this is ongoing i will draft something short though whilst its all fresh in my mind then i can get onto something else i did send the email below to peiser clarifying whether he wanted review or just thoughts i got the amazing reply sent to three reviewers so letting the suny process run its course once finished real climate may be one avenue to lay out all the factsdetails away tomorrow i think you have monday off so have good long weekend cheers phil subject re review of ee paper on alleged wang fraud date wed 29 aug 2007 174843
