refugee relief costs related to kosovo 447 million more than was requested 29 billion for programs that had been addressed in earlier congressional action on hr 1141 10 billion more than requested the total includes 989 million for aid to central america and the caribbean including 2159 million for the defense department 100 million for aid to jordan which equals the amount the administration had requested for fy1999 but does not include advance appropriations for fy2000 and fy2001 900 million for domestic disaster relief mainly to respond to tornado damage 574 million for aid to farmers and 305 million for variety of other programs including 230 million transferred from hud to the federal emergency management agency fema for disaster relief most of these amounts are offset 20 billion of offsetting rescissions the conference agreement does not include senate provision that would have offset all of the amounts in hr 1141s 544 in outlays as well as in budget authority by making acrosstheboard cuts in non defense programs in last falls 21 billion supplemental bill nor does the agreement include controversial house provision making cuts in callable capital for international lending institutions most of the rescissions appear to have little or outlays including 125 billion in excess balances in the food stamp program and 350 million in unspent balances of section 8 housing program funds the conference agreement does not include funding for loan guarantees for steel companies hurt by increased imports or for oil and gas companies nor does it include provision reducing interest payments by midwest utility companies on amounts that they are required to repay to consumers such provisions were matters of controversy in the conference the agreement does however include measure to prevent the federal government from claiming share of state court settlements with tobacco companies conferees did not include controversial policy rider to delay implementation of restrictions on commercial fishing in alaskas glacier bay but did include some other environmental provisions the agreement also lifts provision in last years omnibus appropriations bill pl 105277 that had prevented obligation of funds in the fy1999 commercejusticestate appropriations bill after june 15 and the agreement includes housepassed provision requiring the president to seek burdensharing contributions from allies to offset us costs in kosovo key issues the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for kosovo raised number of issues including 1 whether to provide additional funds for defense readiness as emergency supplemental funding 2 whether to impose offsetting rescissions for some or all of the supplemental amounts 3 how to resolve outstanding issues on hr 1141 4 burdensharing and 5 whether to use the supplemental appropriations bill as vehicle to limit the use of ground troops additional funds for defense readiness when the administration submitted its funding request for kosovo some defense advocates in congress complained that the amount was much too small the crisis they said shows that forces are overburdened in general and that emergency funding is required to correct readiness shortfalls some crs5 legislators proposed adding as much as 2025 billion to the administration request to improve military readiness in general this prospect prompted considerable opposition house minority leader richard gephardt and senate minority leader tom daschle said that kosovo supplemental is not the proper vehicle for an increase in defense spending in effect to use an emergency supplemental bill to add funds for defense readiness would be means of bypassing limits on total discretionary spending established in the 1997 budget agreement caps that republicans insisted on maintaining in the recentlyapproved fy2000 budget resolution as approved by congress the conference agreement adds 54 in unrequested defense funds including 18 billion for military pay and benefits increases in fy2000 225 billion for military readiness accounts all made available for obligation through the end of fy2000 and 475 million for military construction such funds would not normally be counted as incremental costs of an operation funding for military pay and benefits in fy2000 in particular appears to be means of easing constraints on the fy2000 budget the bill does not however add nearly as much as some had proposed in key test of house sentiment on additional funds for the defense department the house rejected an amendment to hr 1664 by rep obey that would have cut about 3 billion from the amount added the conference agreement trims the house additions by about 14 billion offsetting rescissions closely related issue concerns whether congress should impose offsetting rescissions for some or all of any supplemental amounts provided for kosovo whether to offset supplemental funds in general and defense supplemental funds in particular has been an issue since caps on discretionary spending were first established by the 1990 budget enforcement act1 this year the issue has been particularly contentious in part because of backlash against last years supplemental appropriations bill part of pl 105277 which provided 21 billion of emergency funding without offsets and in part because any extra spending will reduce the social securityrelated part of the budget surplus in earlier action on hr 1141 and s 544 the parallel senate bill the issue of offsets was especially controversial the housepassed bill made offsets in budget authority but not in outlays for all of the nondefense amounts provided but the house rejected an amendment by rep todd tiahrt to offset the defense amounts as well the senate in contrast offset all of the amounts in outlays as well as in budget authority by making an acrosstheboard cut in nondefense funds in last years supplemental there was considerably less opposition to providing nonoffset emergency funds for the kosovo supplemental in floor action on hr 1664 on may 6 the house rejected by vote of 101322 coburn amendment to offset all of the funds in the bill the conference agreement on hr 1141 provides all of the kosovorelated funds as emergency appropriations without offsets 1 for detailed discussion of the debate over emergency supplemental funding for defense programs between 1993 and 1998 see stephen daggett emergency appropriations for the department of defense crs general distribution memo august 18 1998 crs6 issues in hr 1141 the senate bill provided substantially more money than the house bill and included some contentious policy riders including provision prohibiting the federal government from claiming share of the multistate settlement with tobacco companies and several environmental riders offsets however appeared to be the most difficult issue to resolve the white house threatened to veto either version of the bill because it objected to particular offsets conferees included some of the policy riders but did not insist on the most contentious offsets burdensharing several members of congress have complained that the united states is bearing disproportionately large share of the costs of kosovorelated operations accurate estimates of allied costs are not available but rough data on the us share of the military effort and relief operations have been provided on april 21 joint chiefs chairman general henry shelton told the house appropriations committee that us forces have flown about 65 of the aircraft sorties including combat and support operations in operation allied force on april 27 omb director jacob lew said that the united states is providing about 25 of refugee and migration assistance the conference agreement includes provision as passed by the house that directs the president to seek more equitable burdensharing and requires report on the issue by september 30 restrictions on the use of ground troops in the house appropriations committee markup of hr 1664 rep istook offered an amendment barring the use of funds for us ground troops in kosovo other members of the committee urged its withdrawal saying that such provision would lead to veto by the president the measure did not receive sufficient support to be brought to roll call vote in house floor action on the bill rep istook offered similar proposal that was rejected by vote of 117301 the conference agreement on hr 1141 does not include any restrictions for other versions of this document see
