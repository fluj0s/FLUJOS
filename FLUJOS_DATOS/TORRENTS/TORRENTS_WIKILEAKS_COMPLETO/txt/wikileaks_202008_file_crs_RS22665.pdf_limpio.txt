motor vehicles on the basis of their climate change impacts and 3 the act does not authorize epa to inject policy considerations into its decision whether to so regulate the decision does not compel

cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in 2003 after receiving about 50000 comments epa denied the section 202 petition3 much of

rejection however did so for different reasons judge randolph concluded that epa had properly exercised its discretion in choosing not to wield its section 202 authority as to this discretion issue recall that caa section 202a1 directs the epa administrator to prescribe standards for any motor vehicle emissions that in his judgment cause harmfu l air pollution judge randolph read in his judgment broadly to allow epa consideration of not only scientific uncertainty about the effects of ghgs but also policy considerations that justify not regulating thus epa in his view was entitled to rely as it did on such factors as the current bush administrations policy preference for voluntary ghg control measures and its belief that regulating motor vehicle emissions was piecemeal hence inefficient approach to dealing with climate change by contrast judge sentelle the other judge supporting rejection of the petition simply held that petitioners lacked standing 7 in dissent judge tatel asserted that massachuset ts had demonstrated standing through past and future loss of shore land as result of climatechangeinduced sea level rise on the merits he found that epa has authority under section 202a1 to regulate ghg emissions8 he further concluded that epa s 202a1 discretion does not extend to policy considerations as judge randolph held but relates exclusively to whet her the emissions cause harmful air pollution g15g138g156g156g138g140g145g158g156g142g157g157g156g561g159g495g561g7g18g3 g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g21g158g153g155g142g150g142g561g5g152g158g155g157g561 it was somewhat of surprise that the supreme court agreed to review the dc circuit decision in massachusetts v ep there was split in the circuits which often disposes the court not to take case and the dc circuit majority had not even ruled on the key issue whether section 202a1 authorizes regulation of ghg emissions moreover grants of certiorari over the opposition of the united states as here are rare but as the supreme court stated in its decision the unusual importance of the underlying issue persuaded us to grant the writ the court ruled 54 for petitioner states and envir onmental groups on all three issues in the case standing authority whether air pollutant incl udes ghg emissions and discretion whether in his judgment allows policy considerations 9 justice kennedy provided the fifth vote by joining justice stevens opinion for the courts liberalmoderate bloc the ruling in favor of petitioners was forecast early in the majority opinion by its opening sentences welldocumented rise in global temperatures has coincided with significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere respected scientists be lieve the two trends are related nor did the dissenters dispute this most of the decision is devoted to standing an issue that is ubiquitous in climate change litigation at the outset the court found that petitioners had two factors in their favor first

court found it of considerable relevance that the petitioner injury on which it focusedmassachusettss loss of shore land from globalwarminginduced sea level risewas that of sovereign state rather than private entity states are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction said the court noting their quasisovereign duty to preserve their territory having described petitioners favored position with regard to standing it was curious that the court then undertook fairly traditional standing an alysis as to the first prong of the blackletter standing testwhether plaintiff has demonstrated actual or imminent injury in fact of concrete and particularized naturethe court homed in on massachusettss status as owner of much of the commonwealths shore land that this in jury may be widely shared with other coastal states does not disqualify this injury said the court it is nonetheless concrete the second prong of the standing test is causation requiring that the injury of which the plaintiff complains is fairly traceable to the defendant epa did not dispute the existence of causal relationship between ghg emissions and climate change it did argue however that any reduction in ghg emissions achieved through the current litigation would be too tiny fraction of worldwide ghg emissions to make cognizable difference in climate change in an important ruling that may be of benefit to environmental pl aintiffs in many contexts the court held that even an agencys refusal to take small incremental step that would result in only modest reduction in worldwide ghg emissions is enough for standing purposes the third and final prong of the standing test is redressability demanding that the remedy sought by the plaintiff is one that is likely to redress his injury in this case the remedy sought is epa regulation of ghg emissions from new motor vehicles the court found that this remedy satisfied redressability because while it would not by itself reverse climate change it would nonetheless slow or reduce it nor given the enormity of the potential effects of climate change was it relevant to the court that the fu ll effectiveness of the remedy would be delayed until existing cars and trucks on the road were largely replaced by new ones given the large number of pages devoted by the majority opinion to standing its discussion of the two caa issues in the case seems strangely brief on the authority question the caas sweeping definition of air pollutantembracing any air pollutant including any physical chemical substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air 11 simply could not be squared in the courts view with epas position that ghgs are not included the court rejected epa s argument that federal laws enacted following enactment of this statutory languagelaws emphasizing interagency collaboration and researchsuggest that congress meant to curtail epas power to use mandatory regulations in addressing air pollutants nor was the court impressed with epas contenti on that air pollutant in the caa could not include vehicle ghg emissions because epa standards for such emissions could be satisfied only by improving fuel economy job epa asserted was assigned solely to the department of transportation under different statute the energy policy and conservation act 12 finally on the discretion issue the majority concluded that in his judgment allows the epa administrator to consider only whether an air pollutant may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare not the agencys policy preferences policy considerations at 11 emphasis added by the court 12 49 usc 32902

with whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change thus said the court epa can avoid taking further action in response to the section 202 petition only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion in sum whether epa decides to act or not it must ground its reasons for action or inaction in the statute accordingly the court reversed the dc circuit opinion and remanded the case to that court for further proceedings it is almost certain that the dc circuit will issue an order sending the petition back to epa fourjustice dissent by chief justice roberts vigorously disputed the majoritys finding of standing fourjustice dissent by justice scalia

the courts decision leaves epa with three options under section 202 make finding that motor vehicle ghg emissions may endanger public health or welfare and issue emissions standards make finding that they do not satisfy that prerequi site or decide that the science is so uncertain as to preclude making finding either way or cite some other reasonable explanation why it will not exercise its discretion either way the epa administrator has said following massachusetts v ep that while the decision bars epa use of policy considerations as basis for denying the petition it left open whether the agency can invoke them later when actually writing the regulations should it make an endangerment finding13 in this regard it should be noted that caa section 202 does not explicitly impose any stringency or other criteria on ghg emission standards promulgated under the section while section 202 states numerical formulae for em issions of carbon monoxide hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides none is stated for ghg emissions other than nitrogen oxides reflecting the apparently wide latitude epa has in setting mobilesource ghg emission standards under section 202 other than for nitrogen oxides commentators have suggested that epa following an endangerment finding could be creative the agency might some have opined set 1 voluntary standards 2 standa rds pegged to the café standards for fuel economy or 3 standards that must be complied with only after the president certifies that developing nations have put ade quate ghg emission limits into effect among other options it is not clear whether courts would uphold all of these innovative interpretations in any event on may 14 2007 the president asked the epa administrator working with the departments of transportation energy and agriculture to have caa regulations limiting vehicle ghg emissions in place by the end of 2008 and to use the presidents 2007 state of the union proposal for raising the café standards as guide 14 this appears to mean that epa will be making the prerequisite finding that motor vehicle ghg emissions endanger public health or welfare 13 the epa administrator is apparently referring to the courts statement that we need not and do not reach the question whether policy concerns can inform epas actions in the event that it makes an endangerment finding 14 briefing by conference call on the presidents an nouncement on café and alternative fuel standards may 14 2007 statement of epa administrator stephen johnson available at httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases2007

the courts ruling in massachusetts v ep resonates well beyond its four corners at this early date however only broad predictions are possible most obviously the finding of standing likely will be pivotal to the fortunes of plaintiffs in other climate change litigation key question will be whether the finding was contingent as could be argued on the existence of state petitioner and the presence in the caa of an explicit provision allowing the filing of administrative petitions in cases seeking injunctive relief this query is relevant only for private plaintiffs not joined by state plaintiffs in injunctive cases with mixed private and state plaintiffs court can focus on the latter as massachusetts v ep instructs it is only necessary that one plaintiff in such case have standing the decision also helps rebut other nostanding arguments often made in climate change litigation eg that even were the defendants to reduce their ghg emissions substantially it would make but an insignificant contribution to mitigating climate change elsewhere the courts ruling upholding caa coverage of ghg emissions from mobile sources improves the prospects of litigation seeking to have epa restrict ghg emissions from stationary sources such as coalfired power plants and factories 15 the stationarysource provisions of the caa use terms similar to that of section 202in particular air pollutant in his judgment and may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare16 contrariwise the ruling could undermine pending cases making federal common law claims against entities alleged to contribute to climate change such as coalfired power plants and auto manufacturers since it strengthens the argument that congress in th caa intended to leave room for courts to develop overlapping federal common law restricting ghg emissions ironically this means that the victory for the environmental side in massachusetts v ep enhances the possibility of defeat for that side in the federal common law cases g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 robert meltz legislative attorney rmeltzcrslocgov 77891 15
