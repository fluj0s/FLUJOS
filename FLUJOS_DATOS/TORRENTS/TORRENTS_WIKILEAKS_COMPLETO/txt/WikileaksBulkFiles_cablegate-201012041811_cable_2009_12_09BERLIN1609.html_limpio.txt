minister connects development with security policy berlin 00001609 0013 of 002 1 sbu summary dirk niebel fdp was an odd pick as germanys new development minister he had experience in international development and had previously suggested abolishing the development ministry now in charge niebel has big shoes to fill following on the heels of heidemarie wieczorekzeul spd important differences with his predecessor are already apparent he would like to integrate germanys development policy more closely with its foreign and security policy including in afghanistan niebel is also firm believer in free markets and sees successful conclusion of the doha development round as critical for developing countries for niebel nothing is sacrosanct he intends to phase out german aid to china which he regards as longer developing country with the ministry under new management there may be additional opportunities for collaboration between the united states and germany on development policy end summary dirk who 2 sbu dirk niebel struck many as an unlikely choice for development minister in the coalition government of chancellor merkels christian democratic union cduchristian social union csu and guido westerwelles free democratic party fdp the blackyellow coalition hamburg native niebels previous work experience includes eight years as paratrooper in the german armed forces and five years as placement officer at job center in heidelberg in 1998 he was elected to the bundestag lower house of parliament where he became caucus spokesperson for labor market policy and member of the labor committee in 2005 fdp chairman and current foreign minister westerwelle tapped him as fdp secretary general position he held until chancellor merkel appointed him development minister in november 2009 as secretary general niebel had called for the elimination of the ministry he would later head the ministry for economic cooperation and development bmz note this option appears off the table for now end note niebel succeeds heidemarie wieczorekzeul of the social democratic party spd who headed bmz for record 11 years connected security 3 sbu in december 18 meeting with ambassador murphy niebel said he intended to make some changes at bmz one such change is linking development policy more closely with foreign and security policy concept he referred to as connected security niebel told the ambassador he planned to coordinate very closely with foreign minister guido westerwelle and that he foresaw much greater cooperation between bmz and the german military in northern afghanistan note days prior to the meeting with ambassador murphy niebel had announced bmz would increase civilian assistance to afghanistan by around 50 million euros bringing germanys 2009 total to over 260 million euros end note 4 sbu in separate meeting several months ago chancellery national security advisor christoph heusgen had told us that bmz under blackyellow coalition would be less wedded to old notions of doing development work this assessment now appears to be accurate wiezcorekzeul had ensured that german development staff worked and lived in separate compounds away from provincial reconstruction teams prts and other bases from which the ministry of defense ministry of foreign affairs and ministry of interior operated she even refused to ride in german military vehicles when she visited afghanistan this kind of separation seems likely to end under niebel both physically and substantively 5 sbu among other ideas niebel brings to the table is plan to partner with third country donors like israel on projects in developing countries niebel told the ambassador that israels expertise in border protection could be shared berlin 00001609 0023 of 002 with african countries for example by teaming up with germany israel could participate in certain capacity building projects where it might not otherwise have access laissezfaire development 6 sbu shortly after becoming minister niebel remarked that his overall development philosophy was helping recipient countries help themselves he regards the successful conclusion of world trade organizations wtos doha development round as especially meaningful for developing countries there is more money being lost by trade barriers than all the development aid can make up for he said this perspective marks noteworthy departure from the approach of wieczorekzeul dubbed red heide for her affiliation with the young socialists years ago 7 sbu niebel also opposes proposed tax on international financial transactions to fund development assistance both chancellor merkel and wieczorekzeul had championed the socalled tobin tax citing differences within the government on the issue niebel has reportedly ended bmzs participation in an international working group on the proposed tax 8 sbu niebel is keen to reorient bmzs assistance reflecting on comments made publicly in his first days as minister niebel told ambassador murphy that germany planned to stop providing development assistance to china currently one of the largest recipients of german aid he added that china was only developing country when it came to climate change negotiations bmz will carry out its existing aid obligations to china only through next year the decision has proved controversial as bmzs assistance to china had reportedly benefitted german companies doing business there travel plans 9 sbu niebel said he planned to spend the holidays in israel note niebel is longstanding member of the germanisraeli society end note his first official travel to the developing world will be late january trip to rwanda eastern congo mozambique afghanistan and asia the ambassador suggested niebel visit washington to meet with new usaid administrator shah once confirmed niebel said he would coordinate dates for the visit with the embassy comment 10 sbu niebel takes charge of bmz at challenging time germany will run its largest postwar deficit in 2010 and pressure to rein in spending will strain every ministry niebels close relationship with westerwelle should be an asset however and could help minimize cuts on key priorities the close relationship will also facilitate niebels vision of integrating development policy with foreign and security policy since taking over at bmz niebel has increased assistance to afghanistan where germany was already the third largest donor and appears open to doing more in support of an integrated strategy in the north an early meeting between the new usaid administrator who oversees the worlds largest aid budget and the new german development minister who oversees the worlds second largest could be an important step in building stronger usgerman cooperation on our top
