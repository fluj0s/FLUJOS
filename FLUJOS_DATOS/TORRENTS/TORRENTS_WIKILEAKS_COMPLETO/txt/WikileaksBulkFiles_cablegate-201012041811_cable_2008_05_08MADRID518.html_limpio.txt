assistant secretary shannons visit to madrid april 30may 1 2008 classified by charge daffaires hugo llorens reasons 14b and d 1 c wha assistant secretary tom shannon visited madrid april 30may 1 2008 he met with secretary general of the presidency bernardino leon and former president jose maria aznar he also attended lunch in his honor hosted by charge d affaires hugo llorens with spanish private sector media and government experts on latin america and gave interviews to daily pais and with antena 3 tv leon stressed the need for the us and spain to work together in latin america aznar emphasized the importance of colombia and mexico and urged the us to maintain strong support for both both leon and aznar expressed concerns about argentina leon stresses desire to work with us in latin america 2 c as shannon and cda llorens met april 30 with newly installed secretary general of the presidency and former mfa number two bernardino leon as shannon told leon the us wanted to maintain continuity in policy towards latin america through the next administration he emphasized the importance of strategic partners such as spain and thanked leon for the effort he and mfa secretary of state trinidad jimenez had made to work with the us leon said president zapatero would need to make latin america foreign policy priority and work it intensively he suggested this was an area where spain and the us should coordinate closely and at the most senior levels he said the strategic effort should be to work closely with countries such as brazil chile colombia and mexico looking ahead to the new zapatero administration leon predicted the opposition popular party pp might be more conciliatory than in the past he said zapatero would put more emphasis on foreign policy and he stressed that good relations with the us would be priority leon mentioned he had met recently with foreign policy advisors to all three us presidential candidates he suggested both governments should begin thinking about meeting between presidents bush and zapatero in september at the unga leon noted that this meeting with as shannon was the first he had held with anyone outside the spanish government since assuming his new post 3 c as shannon explained the us was looking forward to two key events the oas general assembly oasga in medellin in june 2008 where the deputy secretary would lead the us delegation and the summit of the americas in trinidad and tobago in april 2009 he noted mexico and others were working to reduce tensions between colombia and ecuador in advance of the oasga as well as to avoid disruptions by venezuelan president chavez as shannon said the summit of the americas would be the new us presidents first multilateral event with latin america and major goal would be to put the summit process back on positive track after the mar plata experience he indicated the administration would continue to push its free trade agenda 4 c leon said argentina was very worrisome spanish companies in argentina were concerned by the populist tone of the government political polarization and the level of corruption there were complicated people and movements around the presidency he suggested some lived by the old adage that politician who is poor is poor politician he said there was much work for spain and the us to do with respect to argentina and complemented president bush for setting positive tone with president cristina fernandez kirchner as shannon mentioned that he had recently visited argentina and that in june usg team would visit buenos aires to reinitiate the lapsed highlevel dialogue the goal was to define the bilateral relationship by shared interests rather than by differences he predicted strife between various argentine sectors was just beginning the agricultural strike was merely the first round he said the peronist tendency once crisis was past was to look for wealth and figure out how to spend it ironically the more complicated internal situation might lead the government to seek to mend fences internationally he said the costs of too close association with chavez were now clear to the goa as evidenced by chavezs recent decision to nationalize the argentine firm sidor 5 c leon said spain hoped to use the eulatin america and the caribbean summit in lima in may to seek trade pact where those latin american countries who wanted in could be in and those who wanted out could stay out the goal was to keep country like bolivia or ecuador from dragging down the others as shannon noted this might help with the us congress on the free trade issue 6 c leon said posturibe colombia raised concerns although there were sensible people on the left eg polo democratico leader gaviria he noted that posturibe especially if the situation in peru deteriorated the andean region would be even more problematic he said peru was very key country 7 c leon said he was worried about bolivia and the threat to spanish business interests there he predicted morales would lose the may 4 referendum as shannon said the us was looking past may 4 and talking to the group of friends argentina brazil and colombia as well as the vatican he predicted the referendum results would provide greater legitimacy to the state governors and blunt the gobs criticism of the opposition and the us he noted wryly that the gob had blasted the us ambassador at the same time the bolivian fm was in the us seeking usg assistance as shannon said the governors needed to exercise caution and not be overly aggressive the us message was that we supported dialogue but not secession he doubted secession would come to pass he said the us was also talking to the armed forces and urging them to work within the constitution he noted the military understood the risk to it as an institution leon asked if the gob was arming civilians as shannon replied that some such activity was possible but he doubted it was on large scale he said some morales advisors might be pushing confrontation in order to paint the provinces as rebellious but the us message was that the provinces had to work within the confines of the law he noted the bolivian fm was in washington recently and tried without success to interest the oas permanent council in resolution condemning the provinces leon said spains message was complimentary territorial integrity but respect for the provinces as political units 8 c as shannon noted new mexico governor richardson had recently visited caracas in connection with the three americans in the hands of the farc chavez told him the us should help morales and work with the governors to make sure morales was not backed into corner this was unusual given venezuela had in the past urged on morales it appeared chavez might be genuinely worried about the turn matters could take in bolivia leon said he too was nervous about the situation he noted spain would regard deployment of troops or police to the oil installations as very bad sign 9 c leon said it was essential that the next iberoamerican summit salvador in november 2008 move beyond the famous incident in chile between king juan carlos and chavez he mentioned zapatero would see chavez in lima to try and set the stage for more positive summit regardless there were guarantees someone would not seek confrontation in salvador aznar looks to colombia and mexico 10 c as shannon and cda llorens also met april 30 with former president jose maria aznar aznar said he was worried about latin america he described what he called an antinafta anticolombia fta theme in the us presidential primaries at the same time he criticized an excessive emphasis on free trade and open markets in dealing with latin america both were fundamental but the us also needed to focus on how it could isolate chavez and also should keep wary eye on chinese and muslim influence in venezuela he argued the us and the eu needed to articulate policy more understandable to the common people and more comprehensive as shannon agreed on the need to support civil society and ngos in latin america he said many people in the us had view of latin america frozen in the 1990s but the region was changing rapidly the us and spain should be looking for catalytic ways of supporting democratic governance civil society and economic development he noted that in the past the us had sometimes ignored latin america until crisis arose in contrast president bush had record of solid engagement in the region 11 c aznar mentioned he had spoken with mexican president calderon before the new orleans summit and calderon had expressed concern about waning congressional support for nafta and the merida initiative aznar said failure of the colombia fta would be catastrophic he said uribe was the best friend the us had in latin america and the end of the farc was in sight he noted both chavez and ecuadorian president correa were implicated by information obtained as result of the goc operation against raul reyes it was more important now than ever for the us to support colombia aznar said colombia and mexico were the key countries in the region aznar said the us and spain should be working together to get mexico to be more active regionally although brazilian regional engagement was positive it needed to be complemented by more mexican engagement he urged the us to continue supporting both colombia and mexico saying that if calderon and uribe were successful it would shift the entire region in positive direction as shannon briefed aznar on the administrations continuing efforts to win approval for the fta with colombia as well as the merida initiative which represented very constructive us response to the concerns of mexico and central america regarding security and law enforcement he also briefed aznar on the new orleans meetings and the emphasis presidents bush and calderon and pm harper put on common vision for trade security and border management 12 c despite his worries for the region aznar noted many countries were doing well he cited chile panama and peru aznar said the electoral results in paraguay were good step the ideological leanings of the new government would not make much of difference aznar said brazil appeared to have put populism firmly behind it he described lula as mainstream figure albeit one who presented friendlier face to the disadvantaged he urged that the us and spain support good governance regardless of whether it came from the left or the right 13 c aznar said the situation in argentina was very complicated they appeared to be reverting to the vicious cycles of peronism in which sectors with money were shaken down by the government one interesting sign was the emergence of more critical middle class but cristina fernandez kirchner was disappointment he had once hoped she would conduct more sophisticated foreign policy but she appeared now to be puppet of her husband as shannon said argentina was underperforming in terms of attracting foreign investment and was conducting an erroneous foreign policy the last six years had seen economic improvement but the peronists again seemed to be looking for the money aznar agreed the growth had been notable sustained in large part by favorable international commodity prices but he said the recovery remained fragile the goa lacked credibility with the international business community and the argentine banking sector was weak as shannon hoped argentina had learned lesson from venezuelas nationalization of the steel company sidor playing with chavez was good way to get burned nevertheless he noted the goa for all its faults was not in the same camp as chavez as shannon and aznar agreed it was important for the us and spain to remain actively engaged with the goa and maintain dialogue with it as shannon noted his recent visit there and the resumption of regular formal dialogue between the usg and goa aznar applauded the initiative 14 c aznar praised president bushs strong stance in support of democratic transition in cuba and his most recent speech on the subject he said we needed to monitor carefully the steps raul castro was taking some of which were in the right direction nevertheless both the us and the eu needed to stay on the record as promoting democratic transition and openly supporting civil society and the dissidents as shannon noted the goc was attempting to isolate the us aznar said anything the us eu and spain could do to publicize the truth on cuba would help he cited the recent crackdown on the damas blanco noting the news in cuba was more than just cell phones and computers the public needed to know what was really happening he said that was the way to keep the pressure on raul castro whom he said should not be allowed to consolidate power fidel would continue to be an immobilizing element as long as he lived but when he died it might set in motion events raul could not control experts lunch 15 c lunch at the cdas residence brought together variety of latin america experts roman escolano of bbva jaime malet of the amcham alberto carnero of faes asis martin cabiedes of europa press juan luis cebrian of grupo prisa and eduardo san martin of abc and javier sandomingo mfa director general for iberoamerica the discussion was off the record and vigorous topics included cuba venezuela mexico the colombia fta and argentina sandomingo made point of saying during the lunch and again afterwards in private that spain would strongly prefer the us did not try to split eu opinion on cuba as shannon emphasized the need for the international community to work together for meaningful democratic change and to continue to reach out to civil society and the dissidents several of the guests unconsciously echoed leons and aznars concerns about argentina views on venezuela were negative especially on the economic situation as shannon used the opportunity to describe the merida initiative and he heard strong expressions of support for us fta with colombia comment 16 c we were especially struck by the emphasis bernardino leon laid on cooperation with the us in latin america his move from mfa to the presidency is rumored to have been prompted by zapateros dissatisfaction with the functioning of his firstterm foreign policy apparatus reportedly his odd man out experience at the nato summit in bucharest was the last straw leon is credible player on foreign affairs and welldisposed towards the us having him in key position at the presidency bodes well as does the resonance of spanish views with our own on most things latin american cuba will continue to be the exception at least when it comes to tactics but on great many other important issues in the western hemisphere we believe spain is genuinely interested in working with the us and highly values as shannons continuing attention aznar remains wellbriefed on latin america knows the players and frequently travels to the region all good reasons for us officials to stay in touch with him llorens
