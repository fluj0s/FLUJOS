infrastructure president museveni is credited with bringing relative political and economic stability to uganda although he has not been able to end the conflict in northern uganda his strategy in the late 1980s and 1990s was to coopt his political opponents and when necessary to use military means to neutralize rebel groups musevenis first government included opposition figures who had served in previous governments and arch critics of the nrm despite efforts aimed at achieving national reconciliation armed opposition to his government continued for much of the 1980s and 1990s uganda political profile in may 1996 after long transition period president museveni was elected to five year term in direct presidential elections in what was known until 2005 as noparty system museveni won

fair national referendum on multiparty politics was held in june of 2000 crs2 museveni prevailed with 907 of ugandans favoring noparty government system the president stated that multiparty politics could only be introduced once noparty system had succeeded in eliminating the threat of return to sectarian politics in 2005 museveni changed his position on this issue see below the nrm remains the dominant party although some of its members openly express their opposition and frustration about nrms leadership some party leaders are also focused on the issue of succession while new members of parliament challenge the old establishment of the ruling party despite some serious challenges facing the leadership uganda has made and continues to make important progress on number of fronts the east african country is more stable today than few years back and the prospect of final agreement with the lords resistance army lra could lead to lasting peace in uganda the 2001 presidential elections on march 12 2001 uganda again held national elections and president museveni won 693 of the votes cast1 while his closest challenger kizza besigye received 278 besigye doctor and musevenis onetime ally was member of the nrm and musevenis personal physician during the insurgency in the early 1980s he ran on an anticorruption platform vowing to rid the government of its excesses he also raised questions about ugandas military involvement in the democratic republic of the congo drc election observers both local and international declared the elections to be free and fair although they acknowledged that the electoral process and management had many weaknesses the results of the elections were rejected by besigye on the grounds that there were discrepancies and inconsistencies in the electoral process he filed petition at the supreme court challenging the declaration of museveni as presidentelect and sought to annul the elections besigye subsequently lost the petition and said he would respect the supreme court verdict in august 2001 besigye fled uganda and later surfaced in south africa2 the thirdterm debate and adoption of multiparty system uganda was ruled under noparty system after museveni took power in 1986 in march 2003 president museveni suggested to his national executive committee the leadership organ of the nrm that the movement should consider lifting the ban on multiparty system he and his supporters also urged review of the twoterm limit for president according to the ugandan constitution at the time person shall not be elected under this constitution to hold office as president for more than two terms as prescribed by this article3 under this provision president musevenis term would have expired in 2006 but many of his supporters argued that without museveni uganda might plunge into another civil war critics of the 1 ugandan elections 2001 online at httpwwwugandaelectionscom 2 besigye fled into exile day after he met with

constitution says not more than two consecutive terms4 those ruling party members who criticized the presidents third term proposal were removed from power including eriya katagaya the thenfirst deputy prime minister and longtime ally of president museveni5 the vice president also resigned reportedly to pursue her academic studies in the united states in may 2005 the ugandan parliament voted to approve referendum on multiparty politics on july 28 2005 ugandans voted overwhelmingly in favor of multiparty system after almost 19 years of party system reportedly more than 92 of the registered

the presidency the 2006 multiparty elections in february 2006 ugandans voted in the first multiparty elections in almost 26 years president museveni won 59 of the votes while the leading opposition candidate kizza besigye won 37 of the votes the ruling nrm won 202 seats in parliamentary elections while the opposition forum for democracy coalition won 40 seats the election results show decline in support for president museveni from his 74 and 69 victories in the 1996 and 2001 elections respectively meanwhile besigyes 37 share represented 10 gain over his 2001 vote share international election observers did not condemn the election results nor did they fully endorse the electoral process according to the european union election monitoring group report ugandas first multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections since 1980 have demonstrated significant improvements in comparison to previous elections according to the same report despite number of problems experienced by voters on election day eu chief observer max van den berg who spent the day traveling between kampala gulu and soroti noted that voters came out in large numbers knew that they had choice between change or continuity and made this choice with calm and dignity but the elections were marred by intimidation counting irregularities voter name deletions and show of force by the government harassment by authorities and the trial of the opposition candidate besigye were seen as part of the overall strategy to secure victory kizza besigye was charged and imprisoned soon after his return to uganda to run as candidate for president he was charged with rape terrorism and treason he was released from prison in january 2006 and challenged president museveni in the february 2006 presidential election 4 john kakande museveni speaks on 3rd term the new vision january 3 2003 5 president should listen to old friends avoid disaster editorial the monitor may 3 2002 crs4 the situation in northern uganda while much of the country has remained stable since the nrm took power in 1986 civil war has ravaged northern uganda for over 20 years the situation has been characterized as one of the worlds worst humanitarian crises where civilians particularly children are the most affected according to the united nations and numerous reports by nongovernmental organizations the conflict and the humanitarian crisis in northern uganda have killed tens of thousands of civilians due to deliberate targeting of children by the lords resistance army lra see below although the actual number of those killed is unknown according to report by the civil society organizations for peace in northern uganda csopnu coalition of 50 ugandan and international groups more than two million civilians have been affected an estimated 90 of the population in the northern region of acholiland particularly in the districts of gulu kitigum and pader have been displaced and some estimate that 80 of the forces in the lra are the abducted children from these areas for the past two decades the victims in this conflict have largely been civilians although the conflict began as an effort to overthrow the museveni regime the victims reportedly were abused routinely by security forces and the government failed to provide adequate protection to civilians particularly children in northern uganda according to several reports the lra abducted more than 20000 children over the past decade for forced conscription and sexual exploitation6 according to the united nations the most disturbing aspect of this humanitarian crisis is the fact that this is war fought by children on children minors make up almost 90 of the lras soldiers some recruits are as young as eight and are inducted through raids on villages they are brutalized and forced to commit atrocities on fellow abductees and even siblings those who attempt to escape are killed for those living in state of constant fear violence becomes way of life and the psychological trauma is incalculable although the situation in northern uganda has improved significantly over the past year since the beginning of the peace talks between the lra and the government of uganda the security council reported in may 2007 that the lra has not released any children women or noncombatants from its ranks similarly the unsc report voiced deep concern over the absence of any concrete signs regarding the release of children associated with various forces especially local defense units and lra the unsc report also stated that government security forces continue to occupy schools in abandoned communities thereby significantly delaying the reopening of schools 6 uganda complex emergency us agency for international development usaid july 2003 crs5 the lra early years in 1985 the milton obote regime was ousted in military coup by general tito lutwa okello and other military officers from northern uganda the coup came at time when the nrm attacks against the obote regime threatened obotes hold on power in 1986 the nra defeated the okello regime forcing the military and their supporters to flee to northern uganda shortly afterward rebel alliance was formed the uganda peoples democratic army upda the upda began attacks against government military installations primarily in northern uganda the same year alice lakwena an acholi spiritual healer emerged as the dominant leader of the rebel alliance lakwenas faction the holy spirit movement initially dominated the alliance and also began to make its move in southern sudan after devastating battle with the ugandan military in jinja 60 miles from the capital of kampala in which large number of the rebel alliance members were killed or captured lakwena fled to kenya by the late 1980s and early 1990s upda was longer active one of lakwenas key members and reportedly relative joseph kony then in his early 20s emerged as the leader of the remaining forces and emerged as the lra leader major military strategy shift took place in the early 1990s with the emergence of kony konys group began to primarily target civilians in northern uganda and forged strong alliance with the government of sudan the overall impact of the crisis in northern uganda is not clear although day to day life for many in this region has changed significantly the economy in northern uganda has been devastated especially in light of the fact that much of the population is displaced internally and some have left the region according to various sources there are an estimated 1517 million internally displaced people in northern uganda children who are not in internally displaced persons camps often leave their homes at night to sleep in hospitals or churches although over the past year conditions have improved these children are known as night commuters education for many of these children seems out of reach since many are unable to stay in one place to attend school according to world vision report pawns of politics the north has suffered insecurity manifested by violence against civilians abductions and displacement this insecurity has resulted in death loss of property and disruption of development activities children are losing vital educational opportunities they are at greater risk for contracting hivaids and other stds and they are forced into child prostitution child soldiering and other forms of bondage7 as result of the war and perceived ethnic bias and marginalization the nrm government is unpopular in northern uganda in the 2006 elections opposition candidate besigye reportedly won 80 of the votes in gulu over the past year the government of uganda has expanded civilian protection and significantly increased its budget for reconstruction and development in northern uganda more than 400000 displaced persons have also returned to their homes over the past year regional implications under the leadership of joseph kony the lra has conducted military operations in northern uganda the democratic republic of congo drc and 7 the pawns of politics children conflict and peace in northern uganda world vision 2004 crs6 southern sudan the regional impact of the northern uganda crisis has been particularly hard for southern sudan in part because of its geographic proximity and also due to the government of sudans support for the lra rebels in southern sudan the lra allied with the government of sudan to attack the sudan peoples liberation army spla the liberation movement fighting then successive sudanese governments according to us and regional officials southern sudanese civilians have been victims of lra attacks the lra was given protection facilities for training and supplies by the government of sudan to wage war in northern uganda and southern sudan according to south sudan us and regional officials the lra targeted civilians in eastern and western equatoria and in the juba region the regional capital the lra leadership and its troops had permanent presence in southern sudan under the protection of the government of sudan in the juba region lra forces used schools and other government facilities to train and house their troops8 in late 2005 the lra intensified its attacks targeting civilians in southern sudan especially in yei and juba areas however the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement cpa in 2005 between the government of sudan and the splm has threatened the survival of the lra as force in southern sudan the takeover of the government in southern sudan by the splm has made lra activities very difficult the cpa has provision in the security agreement that all foreign groups must be forced out of sudan the late leader of southern sudan dr john garang had the lra and foreign terrorist groups in mind when he insisted on this provision9 in 2005 some lra units went into drc reportedly looking for new home after the splm took power military clashes in drc reportedly led to the killing of 8 guatemalan united nations peacekeepers in the drc the congolese government acknowledges the presence of lra forces in garamba national park in early november 2007 president joseph kabila stated that lra forces will be forced to leave drc once peace agreement is reached between the lra and the government of uganda he also made it clear that the lra will be expelled from drc if they failed to reach an agreement10 meanwhile some of the lra forces have moved to designated assembly area in southern sudan 8 the author visited juba last year and other towns in southern sudan over the past decade where lra has been active 9 ted dagne interviewed dr john garang on number of occasions during the security arrangement negotiations 10 ted dagne met with president kabila and discussed issues related to uganda and drc in november 2007 crs7 attempts to end the conflict number of attempts in the past at negotiated settlement with the lra failed in large part due to lra intransigence and due to the government of ugandas inconsistent positions the first serious effort was launched by former ugandan government minister betty bigombe in the early 1990s with the full support of president museveni in 1993 bigombe made contact with the lra leadership and the lra initially expressed interest in negotiated settlement prior to this effort the government of uganda launched what was known as the operation north campaign operation north campaign was designed to deny the lra support in the north and to arm the civilian population with bows and arrows known then as the arrow group the operation failed and created strong animosity between the government and elements in northern uganda the bigombe initiative ended when president museveni threatened to use force against the lra and demanded its surrender other initiatives both local and regional failed to produce tangible results bigombe was once again engaged in an effort to bring an end the conflict in northern uganda in late 20042005 contacts were made with the leadership of the lra and the lra also had appointed two senior commanders vincent otti and sam kolo as negotiators in this new initiative the peace initiative stalled in 2005 when kolo defected to the government side and the government of uganda began its military campaign resolution of the conflict through military means has not been successful in part due to ineffective operations against the lra and an apparent lack of will by the government to end the conflict through negotiated settlement in october 2005 the international criminal court icc issued arrest warrants for five top lra leaders including kony some observers while supportive of the icc prosecution of these leaders maintain that the icc action could hinder peace efforts other observers argue that despite the icc process the parties were able to reach important agreements for the first time in decades moreover many lra members and leaders have returned to uganda under government amnesty program according to the peace agreement traditional justice shall form central part of the alternative justice and reconciliation framework current peace initiative after series of failed peace efforts the government of south sudan appears to have made some significant strides in brokering the conflict following months of talks in juba sudan the two parties signed formal cessation of hostilities agreement on august 26 2006 under the agreement lra insurgents were expected to gather at assembly points in southern sudan the deadline for assembly was extended after ceasefire observers reported that both sides violated the agreement in october the ugandan army has admitted to approaching rebel safe haven in sudan claiming it was escorting journalists and diplomats on factfinding mission meanwhile lra soldiers claiming they feared attack by the ugandan forces violated the agreement by leaving designated assembly point in southern sudan many observers remain skeptical that all of the remaining lra insurgents will comply with the terms of the agreement crs8 president museveni has offered amnesty if the rebels accept peace agreement according to media reports and us officials there is support among many civilians in northern uganda for reconciliation rather than revenge against the lra leaders nevertheless unless the iccs chief prosecutor luis morenoocampo accepts local judicial solution the indicted insurgents would have to accept asylum in country not bound by the rome treaty the icc has announced that it will not consider any amnesty proposal until after the successful completion of peace agreement following speculation that the ugandan government was going to yield to the lras demand that icc arrest warrants be annulled president museveni announced on july 19 2007 that warrants for the top lra leaders will remain in place until peace agreement has been reached we are not going to ask the icc to lift the arrest warrants if the lra leaders dont conclude the peace talks they could be arrested and taken to the icc or get killed if they conclude the peace deal that is when the government can write to the icc to say we have found an alternative solution in august 2007 he stated that if the parties agreed to resolve their differences peacefully the issue of accountability could be addressed through local and traditional mechanisms11 the ugandan governments continued negotiations with the lra reached the critical question of how agenda 3 reconciliation and accountability reached in june 2007 should be concluded the past year has yielded two other agreements mandating the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of lra forces from northern uganda in february 2008 the government of uganda and the lra reached several agreements the parties agreed on permanent ceasefire amended the agreement on accountability and reconciliation and the agreement on comprehensive solutions see appendix the lra leadership moved into the garamba national park in the drc and has not given indication of signing the agreement since april 2008 the congolese army and united nations peacekeeping force have deployed their forces near the garamba park and in september 2008 the ugandan government demanded that they take action to contain the lra in late october the lra sent delegation to kampala for the first time in almost two decades to meet with senior ugandan officials moreover the lra delegation went to northern uganda to consult with its constituency as the parties get closer to concluding the peace talks social and economic profile economic conditions uganda is blessed with fertile soils regular rainfall and sizable deposits of copper and cobalt its largest sector is agriculture which employs 78 of the workforce and accounted for about 90 of export earnings and 234 of ugandas 11 ted dagne met with president museveni in uganda in august 2007 and discussed wide range of issues crs9 gross domestic product gdp in 20032004 coffee exports make up half its export earnings and uganda is africas largest coffee producer other major exports include cotton tea and to lesser extent maize crop production has been hampered by security concerns in the northern and western regions of uganda to stabilize the economy museveni adopted policy of reducing inflation while simultaneously increasing production and export earnings uganda raised producer prices on export crops increased the prices of imported petroleum products and boosted civil service wages long periods of forced displacement in northern uganda have seriously disrupted agricultural productivity in the region but usaid reports that recent security improvements have allowed number of farmers to return home and resume normal cultivation according to usaid officials in uganda the restoration of normal farming practices is essential to the recovery process throughout fy2007 usaid contributed significant funds to the food and agriculture organization fao and catholic relief services crs to distribute farm equipment and seeds to ugandan farmers prior to the spring 2007 planting season in 20062007 food production was better than expected in part due to good weather conditions however recent flooding in the north and east of the country could impact food production in 2008 the industrial sector has also expanded with real output growth approaching 10 year industry constituted 242 of gdp in 20032004 the main industries include the processing of coffee cotton tea sugar tobacco edible oils dairy products and grain milling as well as brewing other ventures include vehicle assembly and the manufacture of textiles and metal products according to the economic intelligence unit 112007 overall real gdp growth is forecast to rise gradually to 64 in 2008 and 66 in 2009 as the government begins to get to grips with the energy crisis these figures are below the targets of around 7 set by the government and its development partners as necessary to bring significant improvements to the living standards of most ugandans especially given that the population is expected to grow by an annual rate of over 3 obstacles to economic growth remain ugandas heavy reliance on coffee exports makes it vulnerable to international commodity price fluctuations and poor weather conditions privatization initiatives pose problem as they are seen by many to be scramble for previously stateowned property another problem plaguing ugandas economy is corruption uganda relies upon international donors for 41 of its national budget those donors in particular ireland norway sweden and the united kingdom have become increasingly critical of governance issues and rise in defense spending the latejune discovery of an oil reserve in the fields of western uganda much larger than initially estimated has many speculating about the potential implications for ugandas economy the oil was discovered in an exploratory mission by oil and gas groups heritage and tullow the oil reserve is located in the albertine basin close to ugandas border with the democratic republic of congo crs10 hivaids in the 1980s and early 1990s uganda was one of the african countries most devastated by the hivaids epidemic over the past decade however uganda has made significant progress in the fight against hivaids and the museveni government is widely credited for implementing sweeping reform to address the hivaids epidemic according to usaid the prevalence of hiv has dropped over 50 in the last fifteen years today the overall prevalence rate is 67 moreover prevalence among pregnant women declined significantly despite these impressive declines hivaids is still serious problem in uganda an estimated 91000 ugandans died in 2005 and there are over one million orphans from the aids crisis ugandas hivaids prevention program known as abc abstinence be faithful or use condoms is credited for the reduction in hiv infections and has been viewed by the us administration as model for the rest of subsaharan africa in 2007 the united states provided 188 million to support ugandas fight against hivaids see table below for summary of us assistance to uganda regional relations uganda is member of the east african community and enjoys friendly relations with fellow members kenya and tanzania uganda has at times had tense relations with two of its other neighbors rwanda and more recently the democratic republic of congo drc resulting from its 1998 troop deployment into eastern congo while the ugandan government claimed the troop presence was aimed at discouraging attacks from ugandan rebels based in the region there were widespread allegations of natural resource exploitation and uganda eventually removed its troops under international pressure in 2003 in 2005 museveni threatened to send troops back to the region when lra forces moved from sudan to the drc if congo failed to deny them sanctuary although the current peace talks may avert further contention due to ugandas increased military pressure on the lra joseph kony and his forces are currently hiding out in the garamba national park in the drc the same place hutu extremists gathered prior to the rwandan genocide there the lra is reportedly planting crops gathering resources and rearming there are also rumors that the lra is receiving supplies from both eritrea and allies in khartoum sudan ugandan troops in somalia approximately 1800 ugandan troops have been stationed in somalia since early 2007 in an effort to increase security and put stop to the violent conflict in mogadishu the ugandan troops members of the uganda peoples defense forces are the only au forces currently serving the african union mission in somalia amisom other au countries nigeria burundi ghana and malawi that pledged combined total of 6500 troops to amisom have attributed their delayed deployment to logistical and financial issues in january 2008 burundi deployed an estimated 850 peacekeeping troops to somalia the peace and security council of crs11 the african union announced in midjuly that ugandan troops would remain in somalia for another six months army spokesman major felix kulayigye announced the extension and argued that it does not make sense to withdraw ugandan troops simply because the reconciliation congress is underway in mid september 2 ugandan peacekeeping troops were killed in mogadishu bringing the number of peacekeeping troops killed in somalia to eight since march 2008 usuganda relations relations between washington and kampala are warm over the years successive american administrations have supported the museveni government as reformist regime and staunch ally of the united states the clinton administration championed the museveni regime and president clinton visited uganda during his 1998 tour of africa relations cooled however when ugandan troops intervened in the congo in 1998 clinton administration officials were also critical of uganda and rwanda when the two former allies clashed in eastern congo in 1999 and 2000 the bush administration appears to have restored good relations with kampala former secretary of state colin powell visited uganda during his fournation trip to africa in 2001 secretary powell met with president museveni and opposition leaders to discuss wide range of issues including sudan and drc he praised museveni for lowering ugandas hivaids infection rate in 2001 uganda withdrew several battalions from the drc and by may 2003 almost all of ugandas troops had been withdrawn president museveni
