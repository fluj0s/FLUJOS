available to many offici als under the colonial postal system3 in 1775 the first continental congress passed legislation giving members mailing privileges so they could communicate with their constituents as well as giving free mailing privileges to soldiers4 in 1782 under the articles of confederation congress granted members of the continental congre ss heads of various departments and military officers the right to send and receive letters packets and dispatches under the frank5 early franking law 1789 1873 after the adoption of the constitution the first congress passed legislation for th establishment of federal post offices which contained language c ontinuing the franking privilege as enacted under the articles of confederation6 under the post office ac t of 1792

copies of acts bills government reports and speeches servin g as distributor for government information and proxy for the then nonex istent washington press corps providing local newspapers across the country w ith information on washington politics10 because franking statutes allowed memb ers to both send and receive franked mail during much of the 19th century constituents could also mail letters to their senators and representatives for free11 according to one scholar members spent up to three hours each day signing their names on envelopes some members franking up to 3000 items daily when congress was in session and occasionally hiring ghostwriters to sign their signature for them12 this led one member to describe the house of representatives as bookbinders shop13 in 1845 congress passed comprehensive fra nking legislation that instituted an accounting system in which executive departments would pay for mail through general tax revenue in hopes of easing the burden on th post office department and reducing paid mail rates14 members of congress conti nued to have their franking privilege paid for out of postal revenue15 the accounting system was repealed

have long objected to the franking privilege because of its abuse for illegal private and political gain during the 19th century abuse of the franking privilege either through loan of the frank to nonauthorized users or its misuse by those entitled to the privilege was common109 reports to congress during the mid19th century routinely suggested that the laws prohibiting private use of the frank were universally disregarded most people possessing the pr ivilege used it as private convenience for themselves and their friends private companies regularly secured envelopes with the frank on them and that very small proportion of the matter transmitted through the mails under the frank had any reference to the actual business of congress110 john quincy adams during his first ear as united

regulations on the franking pr ivilege severely restrict the types of overt franking abuse common in the 19th century both the house and senate require that members receive an advisory opinion on all

incumbency advantage although contemporary franking critics continue to voice concerns about the costs and buses of the franking privilege the most common contemporary criticism of franking regards its use in congressional elections and the perceived advantage it gives incumbent members running for reelection critics argue that the vast majority of franke d mail is unsolicited and in effect publicly funde d campaign literature116 during fy2006 894 of mail costs in the house and approximately 270 of mail costs in the senate were mass mailings117 critics also argue that incumbent house members may spend as much on franked mail in year as challenger spends on his or her entire campaign118 critics also point out that franked mail costs are higher in election years than non election years indicating that members may be using the frank in attempts to influence an election119 historically although reformers of the franking privilege in the 19th century were chiefly concerned with abuses that created unnecessary costs the relationship between the frank and ree lection was not unnoticed120 speeches in washington dc were often delivered not for consumption by other members but

representatives proponents of the franking privilege argue that the frank allows members to fulfill their representative duties by providing for greater communication be tween the member and an individual constituent one defender of the frank has argued that free transmission of letters on governmental business is directly c onnected to the wellbeing of the people because of the nature of the legislative function123 proponents of the franking privilege ar gue that representative accountability is enhanced by use of the frank they conte nd that by regularly maintaining direct communication with their constituents members provide citizens with information by which they can consider current public policy issues as well as policy positions on which voters can judge them in future elections124 in addition proponents argue that if legislative matters could not be easily transmitted to constituents free of charge most members could not afford to pay for direct

forced to rely on intermediaries in the media or significant personal costs in order to publicize information the member wished the constituents to receive129 historically the franking privilege has long been perceived as serving this role in 1782 james madison describe d the postal system as the principal channel that provided citizens with inform ation about public affairs130 the franking

and ffice expenses subject to law and senate regulations the combined funds may be us ed without limitation in any one allocation category135 since january 3 1999 in the house the combined funds for each representatives franked mail office staff and office expenses members representational allowance may be used without limita tion in any one allocation category subject to law and house regulation where can such materials be sent since october 1992 representatives have been prohibited from sending ma ss mailings outside their districts136 this action followed us court of ppeals ruling that found the practice unconstitutional137 options for future franking change contemporary critics of the franking privilege have offered number of suggestions to abolish or change the pr ivilege several of these ideas have beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34274crs22 138 recent bills to abolish the frank include hr 2308 104th congress hr 331 103rd congress hr 1541 103rd congress and hr 771 102nd congress 139 39 usc 3204 140 mass mailing is defined in 39 usc 3210a6e as 500 or more substantially similar pieces of unsolicited mail sent in the same session of congressincorporated in bills in the 110th congress or recent congresses among the ideas are the following proposals abolish the franking privilege although the franking privilege has only been abolished once bills for its abo lition have been introduced regularly in congress since the 1830s138 most proponents of abolishi ng the franking privilege however do not support complete ban on free mail and disagreement exists on what system would replace the frank some proponents advocate replacing the frank with postage stamp allowance for members as part of their representational allowance this option however does not directly address c ontemporary concerns about the frank because all franking is now individually charged against member expense accounts switching to stamp allo wance would have only symbolic effect as an abolition of the frank second option would be for members to use the penalty mail system under the same restriction as ot her federal employees139 this would restrict members from sending any mail matter other than official correspondence in response to constituent requests this option would likely reduce congressional mail costs significantly it could also impair the ability of members to communicate with their constituents prohibit mass mailings ban on all unsolicited mass mailings could potentially save millions of dollars in congressional mail costs and reduce concerns about the effect of franked mass mailings on cong ressional elections related option would be to reduce the number of mailings that constitute mass mailing to smaller number from 500140 hr 2687 introduced by represen tative ray lahood during the 110th congress would effectively prohibit representatives from mass mailing newsletters questionnaires or congratu latory notices the prohibition would not cover certain other types of mass mailings made by members including federal documents such as the congressional record or voter registration information the proposed legislation would apply only to representatives it would not affect mass mailings made by senators prohibit unsolicited mailings ban on all unsolicited mass mailings could potentially save millions of dollars in congressional mail costs and reduce concerns about the effect of franke d mass mailings on congressiona l elections unlike ban on mass mailing however ban on unsolicited mailings might be governed by rules similar to the houses current email policy allowing unsolicited mass communications to constituents on subs criber list opponents argue that prohibition on unsolicited mail would restrict the ability of members to communicate with their

mailings during the second session of each congress141 give franking privileges to electoral challengers some critics of the franking privilege have raised concerns about its effect on elections and have advocated giving franking privileges to challengers in cong ressional elections142 advocates argue that giving the frank to challengers would reduce the incumbency advantage of members of congress by llowing nonincumbent candidates similar ability to contact constituents opponents have argued that use of the frank is currently prohibited for political purposes and that challengers in congressional elections would inherently be us ing the frank for campaign purposes reduce the allowance given to members for franked mail critics of the frank advocate reducing the overall mail allowance for both senators and representatives currently each senators franking allowance is determined by formula that gives maximum allowance equal to the cost of one first class mailing to every address in their state143 senate offices that exceed their allowance may supplement the allowance with official office account funds senators are however limited to 50000 for mass mailings in any fiscal year144 in the house each representatives mail allowance is combined with allowances for office staff and official office expenses to form the members representational allowance mra145 members may spend any portion of their mr on franked mail subject to applicable law and house regulations146 critics also suggest restricting representatives to total mass mailing limit similar to the current

increased di sclosure support individual disclosure of all fra nkingrelated costs not just mail costs some proponents propose putting the indi vidual cost of each mass mailing on each piece of the mailing hr 2788 introduced in the 110th congress would require that each individual piece of franked mail contained in mass mailing made by member of the house contain statement indicating the aggregate cost of producing and mailing the mass mailing each pi ece of franked mail would contain the statement the aggregate cost of this ma iling to the taxpayer is____ with the blank space containing the total cost of pr oducing and franking the mass mailing the legislation would not affect mass mailings made by senators concluding observations although the franking privilege has ex isted almost continuously since the founding of the nation the legal restrictions on its use have routinely been altered by congress two important trends emerge from this analysis first restrictions on the use of the frank who is entitled to frank mail what is entitled to be franked how much material can be sent where the franked material can be sent and when franked material can be sent have been bot h tightened and loosened by congress throughout hist ory this reflects normative ambiguity about the privilege with congress seeking to balance perceived mocratic need for the franking privilege against charges of abuse wastef ulness and incumbency protection second members of congre ss continue to use the frank to communicate with constituents despite the rise of alternative forms of mass communication although illegal use of the frank has been largely curtailed contemporary critics of the privilege continue to voice concerns about wastefulness and incumbency protection recent proposed changes to the franking priv ilege reflect these concerns seeking to reduce the overall volume of franked mail and the impact of mass mailings on elections while maintaining the ability of members to effectively communicate with constituents
