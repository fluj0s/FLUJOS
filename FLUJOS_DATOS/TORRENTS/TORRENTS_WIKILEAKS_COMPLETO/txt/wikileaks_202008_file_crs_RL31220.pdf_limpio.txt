report provides basic discussion of the us balance of payments bop the bop is systematic accounting of the uss international transactions for specified period of time it is an econo mic indicator that is followed closely by members and committees concerned with international trade and financial flows the bop measures flows between us and nonus residents transactions involving items capable of directly satisfying economic needs and wants are recorded in the bops current account these are fu rther distinguished as goods and services trade receipt or payment of income from investments and oneway unilateral transfers the capital and fi nancial accounts capture tran sactions involving asset transfers eg ownership transfer of quities between resident s and nonresidents the bop is organized as doubleentry bookkeeping system as result credits ie inflows of funds are in principle offset by debits ie outflows of funds however difficulty in gathering accurate information creates statistical discrepancy to ensure cred its and debits sum to zero the statistical discrepancy is calculated as the sum of all bop tr ansactions with the opposite sign key element of the bop is the balance of trade bot the bot equals exports minus imports of goods and services the bot is used to quantify the trade deficit ie imports exceeding exports from the early 1990s until the third quarter of 2002 the us trade deficit grew from ss than 1 of us gross domestic product gdp to more than 4 because of the bops dual entry bookkeeping organization the trade deficit must be offset by othe r transactions typically net investment inflow into the united states provides the bulk of the required offset that is in order to purchase usbased assets fore ign investors acquire the net outflow of dollars generated by the trade deficit many analysts believe the trade deficit is not sustainable and that the attractiveness of foreign i nvestments will gain ground rela tive to us investments this will encourage domestic investors to send more investment funds out of the country while also encouraging foreign i nvestors to send less to the united states both would make it more difficult to fund us imports at current levels two possible scenarios have been formulated to explain how the trade deficit might fallsoft and hard landings with soft landing the trade deficit gradually falls allowing exchange rates and other economic measures to adjust the adverse impact on the economy is thought to be minimal hard landing on the other hand would entail dramatic fall in the value of the dollar and insufficient time for the economy to adjust recession may ensue the terrorists events of september 11 and the weakening economy had the potential to trigger hard landing but the da ta do not indicate that this is happening the exchange value of the dollar relative to widelytraded currencies has steadily weakened since the beginning of 2002 but at the same time its value has strengthened relative to less widelytraded currencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220contents t h b l n c f p m n t s d f i n d1 the current account 3 the capitalfinancial accounts 4 the capital account 4 the financial

since the 1990s significant manifestation of this concern was the formation of the us trade deficit review commission in 1998 19 usc 2213 as amended this commission was charged with exploring the causes and consequences of the merchandise trade and current account deficits and specific bilateral trade deficits the impact that united states monetary and fiscal policies may have on us

the united states bea reports the bop quarterly bop transactions are grouped by type figure 1 illustrates bop transaction categories in flowchart the two primary headings are the current account and the capitalfinancial accounts merchandise goods trade services trade income from ownership of assets eg income from stocks securities and businesses and unilateral transfers are recorded in the current account and asset flows are recorded in the capitalfinancial accounts the ge neral distinction between current account and capitalfinancial account transactions is that the items involved in the former are available to satisfy economic needs or wants in and by themselves whereas the latter transactions involve assets that would first need to be exchanged for resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220crs3 5 for further information on items included in the current account see americas growing current account deficit its cause and what it means for the economy

addition to discussing trade generally ib96038 discusses bilateral trade flows and the lternative methods used to calculate current account items the data in this current report utilizes the balance of payments method 6 even though balance of trade deficit is negative number it is discussed as if it were positive that is growing deficit is moving from negative number closer to zero to one further awaycapable of satisfying these needs or wants for example stock certificates would first need to be sold to satisfy economic needs or wants as matter of convention the statistical discrepancy which arises because of the complexity in gathering the required data is placed on the capitalf inancial account side of the bop the current account5 merchandise or goods trade includes all raw materials and manufactured goods bought sold or given away services trade includes tourism transportation engineering services and business serv ices eg banking insurance law management consulting and acc ounting services patent and copyright fees that cross international borders are also included in the services category as matter of practicality the distinction between goods and services sometimes becomes blurred eg gifts purchased by travelers are classified as services good or service transaction is classified by the direc tion of the flow of funds for example an exported good or servi ce generates an inflow of funds and is recorded as credit with positive sign in the bop an import is accompanied by funds outflow and is recorded as debit with negative sign typically the united states imports more goods than are expor ted while just the opposite is the case for services if imports exceed exports trade deficit occurs and when exports exceed imports trade surplus occurs the balance of trade bot is used to quantify trade deficit or surplus to reflect the growing importance of services in the us economy the balance of trade measure in this publication includes goods and services however as result the trade ficit as measured by the bot is lower than had merchandise trade been used exclusively6 as stated above this is the case because the united states typically exports more services than are imported to show the balance of trade in the context of the size of the us economy figure 2 presents the bot as percent of us gr oss domestic product measure of national income as figure 2 illustrates the united states has had trade deficit over the period since 1992 and this ficit has generally grownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220crs4 7 the capital and financial accounts are

balance source b ureau of economic nalysisfigure 2 measures of the us trade deficit as percent of gross domestic produc t1992q12002q3 measure closely related to the balance of trade is the current account balance as can be seen in figure 2 the bot and current account balance track similar paths this is the case because th bot is significant component of the current account balance however in ddition to goods and services trade the current account balance also includes inco payments and r eceipts and unilateral transfers in this regard the current account balance is more complete because it encompasses all international transactions of items available to satisfy economic needs or wants international income receipts and payments derive from ownership of assets stock dividends are an example an out flow results from income earned in the united states being repatriated by foreign asset holders and an inflow results as american residents repatriate foreign generated income unilateral transfers are oneway transfers of funds worker remitta nces from abroad eg foreign worker sending money back home direct fore ign aid and pension payments involving residents and nonresidents ar examples the bureau of economic analysis does not individually report inflows and outflow s of unilateral transfers but instead reports only the net flow the capitalfinancial accounts the capitalfinancial accounts actually include three accountsthe capital account the financial account nd the statistical discrepancy7 each will be discussed in turn the capital account in order to comply with international monetary fund suggested guidelines the bureau of economic analysis reorganized the balance ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220crs5 8 see upcoming changes in the classification of current and capital transactions in the us international accounts survey of current business february 1999 pp 1011 9 few transactions that should be included in the capital account are inadvertently classified as current account transactions beca use of the difficulty in disentangling these transactions from other current account transactions 10 reserve assets include foreign currencies go ld and special drawing rights sdrs sdrs were created as part of the international monetary fund to help stabilize international transactions for more information see the balance of payments of the united states concepts data sources and estimating procedures us department of commerce may 1990 because this publication predates the re vision of the us bop the discussion of the financial account is conducted in the capital account sectionpayments in june 1999 several transa ction categories were moved from the unilateral transfer account in to newly formed capital acc ount the newly defined capital account consists of capital transfer s and the acquisition and disposal of non produced nonfinancial assets the major types of capital transfers are debt forgiveness and migrants transfers goods and financial assets accompanying migrants as they leave or enter the country8 nonproduced non financial asset transactions include transfers of the rights to natural resources patents copyrights trademarks franchises and l eases other transactions recorded in the new capital account include the transfer of title to fixed assets gift and inhe ritance taxes death duties uninsured damage to fixed assets and legacies for the united states these transactions typically comprise relatively small portion of the balance of payments s ee the appendix but significant debt forgiveness program could increase the im portance of this account prior to the introduction of this new account the f undamental division of the balance of payments was between the current account and what was then called the capital account with the introduction of this new capital account the capital account that existed prior to the change wa s renamed the fi nancial account the financial account international transactions involving assets that are not recorded in the capital account are reported in the financial account 9 financial account transactions may involve financial assets such as loans bank deposits drafts government and private debt and equities assets may also encompass physical or real assets held for the production of in come such as manufacturing facilities and controlling interest in business enterprise the financial account is further divided into us assets abroad claims and foreign assets in the united states liabilities us assets abroad are classified either as us official reserve assets other us government assets or us private assets only the net of each of these transactions is reported in the balance of payments official reserves as opposed to other government assets are used for currency support and to ensure smooth operation of the international transactions system10 the statistical discrepancy collection of bop data is very complex and involves numerous government agencies in ternational organiza tions and industry and trade associations as result there is significant potential for data collection error for example merchandise trade valuation is depende nt on the paperworkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220crs6 11 of course it is possible that the us impor ter has yen from previous transaction or the japanese manufacturer desires dollars for an upc oming transaction in either of these cases the us importer or the japanese manufacture r is playing the role of the third party described in this exampleaccompanying transaction if this pa perwork is inaccurate then statistical discrepancy might arise the only transac tions that are thought to generate few discrepancies are those involving us offici reserve assets in contrast private financial transactions are difficult to trac k and therefore may s ubstantially contribute to the discrepancy it should be noted if both the credit and debit entries of transaction are omitted then statistical discrepancy is recorded in spite of the fact that the individual components of the bop that are affected would be inaccurate also many errors and omissions may offset each other in short the statistical discrepancy underestima tes the magnitude of errors and omissions the statistical discrepancy is calculated as the sum of all other bop transactions but with the opposite sign the nature of balance of payments transactions the nature of balance of payments tr ansactions becomes clearest when more than one currency is involved for exampl consider us importer purchasing goods manufactured in japan in this case it is likely that the us importer desires to make payment in dollars and the japane manufacturer desires to receive payment in yen to complete the transaction third party willing to exchange yen for dollars at the current exchange rate needs to be located11 the third party can be bank business enterprise government or an i ndividual and the thir d party does not have to be from japan or the united states the critical aspects are that the third party is willing to exchange yen for dollars for reason and this reason is not likely to have anything to do with the transaction between the us importer and japanese manufacturer for example the yen supplie r may want to purchase us goods for shipment to japan or he or she may want to purchase us stocks bonds or other assets regardless all of the possible transactions are captured in the us balance of payments the transaction between the us importer and the japanese manufacturer is captured as us import and the third party transaction is captured as either us export or as transfer of us assets to foreignownership it should be noted that the dollaryen exch ange rate plays critical role in both transactions in the first transaction the us importer judges the wisdom of the transaction based on the dollar value nd the japanese expor ter passes judgment based on the yen value these two valuations are linked by the exchange rate likewise the exchange rate influences the third partys willingness to make yen available to complete the exchange thus far the third party has been portray ed as reacting to the initial transaction between the us importer and the japanese exporter however the third party is not likely to be aware of the other transacti on one or more banks are probably acting as intermediaries to complete the two transactions in reality both transactions arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220crs7 occurring in somewhat independent manne r the connecting links are the exchange rate and financial intermediaries if the exchange rate is allowed to find its own value then the number of dollars flowing into the foreign exchange market in search of yen and yen flowing into the market in search of dollars determine the rate if us importers are attempting to purchase growing amount of japanese produc ts yen holders may have to be enticed into exchanging their yen for dollars by more favorable yendollar exchange rate ie they may require more dollars for ye n than was previously the case if on the other hand yen holders are bringing increasing numbers of yen for exchange into dollars the dollaryen exchange rate may begin to swing the other way hence the question that needs to be answered is re dollar holders desire for yen driving changes in the exchange rate or is the driving force yen holders desire to have dollars this question will be explored in the next section another key aspect of balance of payments transactions is that they likely interact with every part of the domestic economy hence every domestic market be it for final goods or services inputs or fi nancial instruments is impacted to some degree by bop transactions and in turn the bop is influenced heavily by these domestic markets any strength or wea kness in the domestic economy is in part shaped by international transactions the trade deficit as shown in figure 2 the us trade deficit steadily grew during the latter part of the 1990s and during 2000 during the fi rst half of 2001 the trade deficit began to shrink but resumed growing again in the second half of the year in 2002 the deficit grew to more than 4 percent of gross domestic product this section of the report will consider the possible causes of the persistent and growing trade deficit explore its characteristics and possible consequences and its likely sustainability possible causes of the trade deficit the us trade deficit review commission identified several potential causes of the us large and growing trade deficit they are 1 the more rapid expa nsion of the us economy compared to the economies of our trading partners according to the commission report this is the most widely held reason for the trade deficit 2 the american economys strength s encouraged foreigners to invest in and lend to americans and that has led to real appreciation of the us dollar which has lowered import pr ices and raised prices abroad of our exports 3 the belief that foreig n trade barriers that hinder us exports can contribute to trade deficits specialists in intern ational economics tend to discount this last pointhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220crs8 12 see page vi of the commission report 13 this was in the searching for common gr ound and areas of basic agreement section of the us trade deficit review commission report page iv the republican members submitted this portion of the report but the demo cratic members assisted in its preparation and acknowledged that it represented common ground4 the huge imbalance between domes tic savings and domestic investment as the fundamental cause of the major infl ows of foreign funds that as they are respent are the basic source of the excess of imports over exports12 these causes reflect the fact that balan ce of payments transactions touch every aspect of the domestic economy the first two relate to the strength of the us economy relative to other economies the second and fourth are related in that foreign investors are filling the gap between domestic savings and domestic investment the third plays role in shaping us trade policy and is indirectly factor determining where firms locate their operations characteristics and conseque nces of the trade deficit the growing trade deficitfinancial surplus led the us trade deficit review commission to conclude in our strongly held view trade deficits are part of the recent virt uous circle of the us economy contributin g to low interest rates with the net inflow of funds from foreign investors increasing the overall supply of investment funds and to low inflation with imported products meeting domestic demand for goods and services that exceeds domestic pr oduction the huge trade deficits have helped to make po ssible period of high employment and rapid economic growth by enabling us investment to exceed us saving and us consumption to exceed us producti on trade deficits have contributed to higher american living standards others see trade deficits as measure of the problems that international trade causes our society particularly the jobs and business lost to import competition most egregiously in this view persistent trade deficits between the united states and several other nations represent the impact of unfair foreign trade barriers us businesses are seen as unable to sell their products in those nations because of their restrictions on us imports while at the same time businesses from those nations have easy access to our markets but the positive feedback effects of some of our imports on jobs in us export industries should not be forgotten the competitiveness of us producers is enhanced by their ability to source globally the lowest cost and highest quality parts and components13 these paragraphs of the commission re port capture the multifaceted nature of the trade deficitfinancial surplus the doubleentry bookkeeping nature of th balance of payments captures the fact that parties to all tr ansactions enter them for reason the end result is that balance of payments outflows are offset by inflows of like amount however the trade deficit represents an imbalance with more dollars flowing out to purchasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220crs9 14 because of the doubleentry nature of the bop current account deficit must be offset by surplus in the capitalfinancial accounts ie an identity is formed but with subsets of the current account and the capitalfinancial acc ounts in this case the balance of trade and the financial account the necessity of an identity is broken 15 see globalization and the perceptions of american workers by kenneth f scheve and matthew j slaughter institute for interna tional economics march 2001 for discussion of the growing worker anxiety imports than flow in to pay for exports to maintain overall balance trade deficit necessitates surplus in the remainder of the bop but because the us trade deficit is not offset by the remainder of the current account it is necessary that the financialcapital accounts run surplus to pr ovide the offset table 1 illustrates this for the year 2001 and the first three quarters of 2002 table 1 the balance between the current account and capitalfinancial accounts date

and financial account transactions dominate the asset side of the bop many analysts view trade deficit as bein g accompanied by financial account surp lus the data support this view14 some believe the trade defi cit is an opportunity for domestic residents to have wider variety of goods and services available without having to give up the same value of goods and services via exports as are received via imports in this context the growing trade deficit enriches consumers at the same time many view the trade deficit as sign of weakness for our economy that is due in part to the unfair trade practices of our trading partners proponents of this view point to the grow ing anxiety many workers have experienced even during recent prosperous times as an argument counterba lancing the consumer gain discussed in the proceeding paragraph15 additionally some view the growing fi nancial account surplus as the united states becoming more indebted to foreign i nvestors technically growing financial account surplus simply means that foreigners hold growing value of us assets these assets include the nations loan portfo lio public and privat as well as otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220crs10 16 the broad index used in figure 3 is weighted average of the foreign exchange values of the us dollar against the currencies of large group of major us trading partners the index weights which change over time are derived from us export shares and from us and foreign import shares see th st louis federal reserve web site httpwwwfederalreservegovreleasesh10summaryassets of every type eg equities real estate and pr oductive capacity the use of the term more indebted or the united states increasingly becoming debtor nation in this context refers to fore ign residents owning growing number of domestic assets and reflects growing loss of domestic control of the countrys productive base however others view attracting foreign private investment into the united states as vote of confidence for our ec onomy and sign of strength and foreign direct investments are viewed as an even stronger statement of confidence because of their more permanent nature hence as stated above strong investor interest in us opportunities may be viewed as sign of the relative strength of the us economy vis á vis other economies this ra ises the question is the trade deficit driving the financial account surplus or is the financial account surplus driving the trade deficit the exchange value of the dollar holds some clues in making this determination if the growing us trade deficit were the driving force the increasing outflow of dollars required to pay for the imports not offset by exports should have put downward pressure on the dollars exchange value relative to the currencies of us trading partners that is to entice third party to accept the dollars offered to pay for the imports not offset by exports more favorable exchange rate was likely needed if this were the case the dollar should have weakened against the currencies of our trading partners during the period of our growing trade deficit if on the other hand foreign investors desire to invest in the united states was the driving force the dollar should have strengthened figu re 3 shows the balance of trade and the inflation adjusted tradeweighted exchange value of the dollar16 in 1995 the dollar began to strengthen relative to us trading partners currencies during this same period the trade deficit was growing this indicates that the fi nancial account surplus was likely having more influence during this period than the trade deficit ie driving the process it should be noted that in the months following september 2001 the dollars strength has not been as robus t this will be investigated belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220crs11 figure 3 balance of trade and inflation adjusted trade weighted exchange rate monthly january 1992november 2002sustainability of the trade deficitfinancial surplus many analysts raise the possibility that the persistent tr ade deficitfinancial surplus is not sustainable over the long r if investors see the need to begin realigning their portfolios to include fewer us investments then the trade deficit would have to contract because the fundi ng to pay for the excess imports would not be available additionally if domes tic savings did not fill the void domestic investment would also have to be curtailed this would impact the growth prospects of the united states analysts consider two scenarios for pull back by investorssoft and hard landings with soft landing as inve stors gradually reduce their interest in the us economy the dolla rs exchange value relative to our major trading partners begins to weaken and imports become relatively more expensive on the domestic us market and us exports become more competitive on the world market the end result is an expected reduced trade deficit and lower foreign investment in the united states with hard landing the above events are compressed in time an event such as sharp decline in the stock market is put forth as possible spark to hard landing as foreign investment reced and domestic investors seek safer investments outside the united states intere st rates could rise significantly to fund the trade deficit or if viewed from the investment side the rising interest rates could facilitate closing the gap between domestic savings and investments the result could be recession because the economy w ould not have adequa time to react to the rapid change relatively liquid portfo lio investments would lead the stampedehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220crs12 17 the most liquid funds are sometimes referred to as hot money in its broadest usage hot money is available for any speculative inte rnational transaction large hot money flows may destabilize currency 18 according to the federal reserve the broad index includes countries or regions that had share of us nonoil imports or nonagricultu ral exports of at least ½ percent see new summary measures of the foreign exchange value of the dollar federal reserve bulletin october 1998 p 813of funds out of the united states in this scenario17 the mexican peso crisis of 1994 95 and the more recent financial crises in asia latin america and russia show the extreme situation that can arise when th ere is sudden drop in confidence in the prospects of an economy the impact of recent events as figures 2 and 3 indicate the trade ficits growth tre nd was only briefly interrupted after september 2001 but the do llars strength position is currently more clouded figure 4 shows three indexes of the monthly tradeweighted exchange rate of the dollar the first is broad index of the dollars value relative to major us trading partners18 this index began and ended the period at almost the same value but after strengthening of the dollar during the first half of the period the recent trend has been for the dollar to weaken it remains to be seen if this weakening trend will continue the next index is subset of the broa d index that measures the dollars value relative to the united states trading partners having widely traded currencies eg the euro swiss franc etc with this i ndex the dollar peaked in value in february 2002 but it has fallen by more th an 11 percent since that time and is almost 4 percent lower than the rate at the beginning of 2001 this weakening of the dollar encourages increased us exports and dampens imports in the united states many analysts have claimed that the dollar has been overvalued for several years and this gradual downward trend is bringing the do llar back into line with the other major currencies other analysts point to the soft economies and geopolitical tensions as possible further causes the final index measures the dollar relative to major trading partners who do not have widely trading currencies these incl ude countries in latin america asia the middle east and eastern europe while the dollar lost ground against these currencies in the months after septembe r 2001 it has generally strengthened since the beginning of 2002 and ended the period up by just over 5 percent weakened investment climate in these countries relative to the ited states may explain why these currencies have not increased in value relative to the dollar nonetheless the strengthening trend encourages us re sidents to increase imports from countries comprising this index and disc ourages us export increaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220crs13 figure 4 monthly inflationad justed tradeweighted dollar exchange rate indexes january 2001january 2003 conclusion as the record of all transactions between domestic and foreign residents items in the balance of payments influence all gments of the us economy this breadth of activity ensures that the global economy influences all domestic economic outcomes as result the international economy contributes to all the strengths and weaknesses observed in the domestic economy analysts who emphasize the bops contribution to the strengths point to items such as lower consumer prices and the advancements that result from heightened international competition analysts who emphasize the bops contribution to weakne sses point to items such as the widening income gap between low and high income earners and adverse employment impacts in large measure the controversy inte rnational economic transactions create is centered around the us trade deficit during the period from the early 1990s until the third quarter of 2002 the trade deficit grew to more than 4 of us domestic economic activity analysts are concerned th at trade deficit of this magnitude is not sustainable with trade deficit th imports of goods and services not funded by exports is in large measure funded pr imarily by nonus re sidents investing inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31220crs14 the united states if the us investment climate weakens relative to the rest of the world the readily available funding to run trade deficit could shrink dramatically this adjustment is termed soft landing if the change is gradual enough to allow markets to adjust many analysts be lieve the us economy can weather soft landing without significant dverse consequences an ab rupt adjustment is termed hard landing with hard landing th us economy could ex perience significant recessionary pressures most analysts believe soft landing is more likely than hard landing but the possibility of hard landing cannot be eliminated the events since september 11 have created the type of pressures many analysts believe could trigger hard landing fortunately thus far the evidence does not suggest that the us is experiencing rd landing typically with hard landing the domestic currencys value falls significantly and quickly relative to the currencies of its trading partners this occurs b ecause the hard landing is being fueled by investors liquidating their i nvestments and moving their funds to safer investment destinations the outflow of funds puts downward pressure on the currencys value in recent months the dollar has lost va lue relative to major economic powers with widelytraded currencies but it appears this decline s been gradual enough not to cause severe problems at the same time the dollar has weakened relative to major currencies it has strengthened relative to less widely traded currencies the end result is clouded picture as to the imp act the dollars value is having on the economy and vice versa nonetheless ev in the face of the dollar weakening against some currencies the resiliency of the us ec onomy appears to be strong
