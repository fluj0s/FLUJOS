105th congress updated may 24 1999 william gwhittaker specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress abstract through nearly two centuries american workers and their employers have been concerned with the structure and regulation of workhours early humane concerns gave way during the 1920s and 1930s to economic factors ie spreading available work to the jobless since the 1960s attention has focused upon alternative work patterns an effort to balance work with family responsibilities and other concerns this report presents brief introduction to the workhours issue and then traces the legislative history of this question through the 104th and 105th congresses it will not be updated further federal regulation of working hours an overview through the 105th congress summary through much of the 19th century and well into the 20th reformers sought to reduce the length of the workday and workweek to relieve workers from excessively long hours of toil such extended hours of work were deemed hazardous to an employees physical and moral health depriving him or her of opportunity for education rearing of children and participation in the democratic process and during periods of economic decline there was concern that work be shared among those seeking it for these reasons it was held that hours of work should be reduced through the years local state and federal government had attempted to regulate hours of work the walshhealey act 1936 provided an 8hour day and 40hour workweek in certain federal contract procurement in 1938 the federal fair labor standards act flsa was adopted ultimately establishing 40hour workweek with overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 per week then the quest for workhours reduction gradually came to halt by midcentury new generation that lacked personal experience with the conditions that had sparked the earlier wagehour legislation was entering the workforce in the 1960s drive commenced for alternative work scheduling in 1978 congress passed the federal employees flexible and compressed work schedules act modifying the structure of workhours for employees of the federal government in the mid1980s the 8hour provision of walshhealey was repealed and during that same period compensatory comp time option was provided under the flsa for employees of state and local governments by the 1990s interest was being shown in extending alternative scheduling in the private sector in the 104th congress hearings on this issue were conducted the house and senate presidential interest was expressed concerning the issue during mid1996 the house passed hr 2391 ballenger extending the public sector comp time option to the private sector new legislation has been introduced in the 105th congress hr 1 ballenger dealing specifically with comp time and s 4 ashcroft providing broader restructuring of overtime and workhours regulation hearings were conducted in the house and senate during february on march 5 the house committee on education and the workforce voted to report hr 1 on march 19 1997 the bill passed the house in amended form on march 18 the senate committee on labor and human resources voted to report s 4 debate commenced in the senate on may 1 cloture votes on may 15 and june 4 failed the legislation died at the close of the 105th congress some changes in overtime regulation could lead to more family friendly workplace but others might lead to an unfriendly working environment and further complicate efforts to balance work with family responsibilities key issue is the extent of worker choice with respect to flexible work hours decisions and with respect to the use of compensatory or flexible hours once they have been earned

timeandahalf for hours worked in excess of 40 per week within 40hour workweek there is complete flexibility any configuration of hours is permitted within the 40hour weekly pattern eg 5 days of 8 hours 4 days of 10 hours 2 days of 20 hours so long as the total hours worked do not exceed 40 in single week by the early 1990s just over 76 million nonsupervisory employees were covered by the overtime pay provisions of the act1 workhours legislation received committee and floor consideration during the 104th and 105th congresses for the most current information about pending legislation please consult the legislative information system lis at httpwwwcongressgov introductory comment during the 104th congress interest developed in altering the role of the federal government in the regulation of hours of work this resurgence of interest in the structure of work hours may have number of origins some are concerned with deregulation of labor standards ie to allow the operation of the free market with minimal interference from government this is sometimes expressed in terms of generalized desire to let managers manage there has also been desire most vigorously expressed during the 1960s and 1970s for creation of family friendly working environment with various forms of alternative or flexible scheduling and work arrangements proposals for change in labor standards however usually come under close scrutiny by labor interests and others who are concerned with possibly diluting hardwon protections for workers in its 1990s context change in work hours regulation is most frequently urged on behalf of enhanced opportunity for workers flexibility in balancing family and workplace requirements childcare eldercare education etc others however have suggested narrower modification of overtime pay constraints for example to allow workers wider options to volunteer for uncompensated work to serve in uniquely structured positions such as houseparents in residential childcare facilities 1 us department of labor employment standards administration minimum wage and maximum hours standards under the fair labor standards act section 4d1 report washington 1993 p 25 for the fair labor standards act see 29 usc 201 ff crs2 to combine different types of work for single employer teaching and nonteaching work for community college when the total hours worked exceed 40 and for other specialized arrangements it may not be entirely clear however how the putative beneficiaries of such changes in work scheduling regard the various proposals for some firms flexible scheduling may work well increasing efficiency and satisfying employees for others it may inhibit productivity frustrate effective management and result in burdensome recordkeeping some workers may find new freedom in flexible and compressed workhours but others especially those with family responsibilities may find it difficult to mesh workplace flexibility with inflexible nonworkrelated schedules for example meeting the closing deadline at childcare center alternative scheduling may result in family friendly workplace but that may not necessarily be the result the campaign for shorter workday and workweek has been both in purpose and constituency different from that for flexible and compressed scheduling2 reducing workhours has generally been goal of workers of many social reformers and institutionally of organized labor where there has been public regulation of the length of the workday or workweek it has generally included an overtime pay provision the original purpose of such penalty was not to enrich workers though workers have come to view it as income enhancement but rather to discourage employers from scheduling hours deemed by policymakers to be excessive and conversely to encourage the spreading of work as means for increasing employment3 the movement for flexible and compressed work hours speaking generally does not address the number of hours worked but rather attempts to reconfigure worktime in manner that is more convenient for workers who may have outsidenonworkrelated responsibilities or some workers may prefer alternative working hours in order to have larger blocks of leisure time 3day weekend for example although some trade unions notably in the public sector and some employers have endorsed the concept of alternative work patterns the initiative in this area seems generally to have come from organizations concerned with the needs of working women there has also been support from workers with special needs students the handicapped longdistance commuters and the like ordinarily the 2 under the concept of compressed scheduling total daily hours of work are rearranged to allow for longer workdays compressed into fewer days of work per 40 hour workweek thus worker might have 4day weekly schedule of work with 3 days off duty while still not exceeding 40hour workweek this is allowed under current law in the federal sector such compression can extend through an 80hour biweekly period eg 60 hours of work in one week and 20 hours of work the second 3 for discussion of the motivating philosophy of the shorter workhours movement see the shorter work week papers delivered at the conference on shorter hours of work sponsored by the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations washington public affairs press 1957 96 p slightly different perspective is presented in sar levitan and richard s belous shorter hours shorter weeks spreading the work to reduce unemployment baltimore the johns hopkins university press 1977 94 p crs3 decision to institute an alternative scheduling arrangement rests with the employer while these systems may produce more family friendly work environment they may also satisfy businessproduction need of the employer as one reviews the evolution of workhours regulation through the 20th century it may be useful to keep number of questions in mind if long hours of work are considered harmful when they result from business necessity should they be considered any less harmful when urged by workers as compressed scheduling should work hours be flexible or compressible only when it is convenient for workers or in the interest of workers conversely should employers have parallel option of flexibility to change daily and weekly hours of work when it meets their production needs and should either party have protected right to abstain from flexibility here the evolution of the reduced worktime and flexible hours movements is sketched the motivation of workers the development of public policy and pressures through the past several decades for modification of that policy finally there is brief review of certain overtimerelated legislation that was considered by the 104th and 105th congresses the shaping of federal policy the length of the workday and workweek has been matter of contention at least since the early 19th century federal policy with respect to hours of work and overtime pay requirements falls into series of general periods but with considerable overlap from one to another first during the 19th and early 20th centuries various workertrade unionreform groups campaigned first for the 10hour workday and then for an 8hour workday 4 these demands were voiced largely though by means exclusively in humane terms to provide an opportunity for the worker to develop physically intellectually and spiritually to share in the good things his talents and energies had produced to nurture and to educate his children to participate in the democratic process and to shoulder responsibly the obligations of citizenship in free society long hours of work in factory mine and field were regarded as often physically mentally and psychologically debilitating leaving workers broken in health and spirit and by extension similarly affecting succeeding generations5 4 american labor organized and unorganized wrote marion c cahill in his study shorter hours study of the movement since the civil war new york columbia university press 1932 p 137 has had two primary objectives higher wages and shorter hours while to the individual laborer the order of importance is that given the leaders of the labor movement have stressed hours he explains the individual laborer has been influenced by very natural but shortrun point of view the emphasis of labor leaders on hours has been the result of their ability to view the question more broadly 5 organized labors approach to work hours reduction is set forth in mcneill george the eight hour primer the fact theory and the argument washington american federation of labor 1899 and in gompers samuel the eighthour workday its continued crs4 second following world war i and increasingly during the great depression the impetus for hours reduction seems to have shifted while social and humane considerations continued to be motivating elements for trade unionists and reformers economic considerations took on greater weight high levels of depressionera unemployment made some measure of work sharing achieved through restraints upon the hours of work eg overtime pay requirements seem more desirable to many6 during the early 1930s congress had under active consideration legislation to establish by statute 30hour workweek an initiative associated with senator hugo black7 in 1933 the 30hour bill was set aside and the new deals national industrial recovery act nira was passed instead under the nira codes of fair competition with fair labor standards were adopted for individual industries these normally included restraints upon the number of hours to be worked each day or week in 1935 the nira was declared unconstitutional and replaced in the labor standards area by two new laws the walshhealey public contracts act 1936 and the fair labor standards act flsa 1938 walshhealey dealing with the contract purchase of goods by the federal government set an 8hour day and 40hour workweek for such contract work8 in the flsa congress dropped the concept of daily hours restraints and opted instead for what would become 40hour standard workweek with overtime pay for hours worked by covered workers in excess of 40 per week9 5 continued inauguration enforcement and influences 9 p washington american

continued crs5 third the 40hour workweek seems to have become the standard in the wake of world war ii periodically organized labor has suggested that working hours should be reduced gradually with reduction in takehome pay as technological change accelerates and productivity rises10 in the late 1970s representative john conyers proposed legislation to reduce the workweek and to provide doubletime for hours worked in excess of new statutory limit ultimately ca 32 hours although hearings were conducted in 1979 on the conyers proposals new hours legislation was adopted11 since then despite some academic interest in the issue legislation to reduce the statutory workweek has largely disappeared from the public policy agenda12 the thrust of the overtime pay provisions of the various federal statutes had not been to enrich workers rather the imposition of overtime rates timeandahalf was viewed as penalty imposed upon employers who engaged workers through what was viewed by many as excessively long hours with deleterious impact for worker health and wellbeing but as parallel consideration and strongly so during periods of economic downturn there was concern both by workers and by the public policy community to reduce hours to spread employment by the late 1960s new consideration had developed even where work hours may not have been excessively long desire developed for shorter hours for more personal reasons to cope with family responsibilities to pursue education or perhaps just to permit enjoyment of more fulfilling lifestyle for employers there was concern with rationalization of the work process 9 continued philip s foner our own time history of american labor and the working day westport conn greenwood press 1989 380 p 10 fink gary ed aflcio

begun for an alternative approach to the world of work some writers have suggested that the student activism of the 1960s and attitudes engendered by the antiwar protests of that era had in some measure spread to the workplace13 women were entering the workplace in growing numbers while at the same time maintaining their role as the primary caregiver at home most of these new entrants to the workforce had not experienced the struggles of the preworld war ii decades for basic labor standards therefore they may have been more willing to trade them for other options that they perceived as beneficial and there persisted within the business community certain antiregulatory disposition which inspired move for repeal of certain new deal enactments riva poor and walshhealey in 1970 riva poor cambridge ma management consultant published collection of essays 4 days 40 hours14 and initiated public relations campaign that called for restructuring of work schedules notably creation of compressed workweek poor suggested the potential virtues of an altered pattern of worktime longer weekends happier workers and for industry more efficient ordering of production processes groundswell of support for the concept developed touting the benefits of new ways to work some however questioned the depth of that support how informed it was and what had motivated it at whose initiative they asked would compressed scheduling be instituted would workers who found the arrangement inconvenient have an effective option for dissent without damage to their careers was the system suitable for all or most workplaces what impact would longer daily hours of work have for persons with childcare responsibilities for students for the handicapped what were the implications for households in which both husband and wife worked outside the home would workers really want to work longer daily hours without overtime pay in exchange for longer periods of time away from work and would the longer workdays exact toll would workers embrace compressed scheduling week after week through summer and winter alike the answers to such questions were not immediately apparent two separate but interrelated efforts in behalf of the compressed workweek each anchored in the work of riva poor commenced during the summer of 1971 first legislation was introduced in the congress to amend the walshhealey act and 13 for example see sheppard harold l and neal q herrick where have all the robots gone worker dissatisfaction in the 70s new york the free press 1972 222 p frequently cited example

similar legislation would be reintroduced as the decade progressed second series of hearings conducted by the department of labor dol reviewed the wisdom of setting aside the 8hour provisions of the walshhealey act in time the two efforts overlapped on september 7 1971 dol under secretary james hodgson of the nixon administration opened 3 days of hearings devoted essentially to issues raised in the thenpending legislation in an opening statement dol spokesperson noted that the primary reason for the hearing was the problem facing government contractors who want to adopt fourday 40hour work week and still avoid the payment of overtime after eight hours16 ms poor witness suggested that compressed scheduling might improve productivity and noted that it strikes that the main issue is does the government want to encourage innovation or not at this very critical time in the development of our economy17 industry long critical of restrictive labor standards legislation tended to support the compressed workweek initiative though its views were mixed organized labor voicing its traditional opposition to relaxing labor standards argued that more than eight hours of work per day is harmful to the moral social and intellectual development of the worker observing that the compressed workweek was being advanced by nonworker elements as proworker option trade union spokesperson stated long ago we learned to be suspicious of managements sudden interest in the wellbeing of the workers18 the only labor witness not taking this perspective was local officer of the american federation of government employees public employee union representing in this instance federal employees19 with the hearings complete the secretary took further action by 1973 dol interest in amendment of the walshhealey act seemed at least for the time to have waned 15 through the years various federal statutes had dealt with overtime pay and safety standards in 1969 several of these statutes were merged into the contract work hours and safety standards act cwhssa efforts to amend the overtime pay provisions of walsh healey have normally been accompanied by an attempt to modify similarly the cwhssa 16 us department of labor employment standards administration wage and hour division in the matter of proposed adoption of fourday fortyhour workweek without payment of time and

reduction to more flexible approaches to work alternative work patterns or new ways to work ie compressed workweek flexible hours flexiplace employment andor telecommuting job sharing etc the initial thrust of the movement for alternative work arrangements appears to have come very largely from consultants and academicians associated broadly with the womens movement20 the initial constituency for alternative work scheduling aws appears to have been professional women in search of way to juggle family and workplace responsibilities with time that constituency appears to have broadened substantially legislation to allow greater work hours flexibility for federal employees was introduced by senator john tunney in june 1973 although the measure died at the close of the 93rd congress it was reintroduced in variety of forms through the next several congresses with support from representatives bella abzug yvonne burke patricia schroeder stephen solarz and senator gaylord nelson among many others while the movement concerned itself both with public and private employment the immediate legislative focus was upon federal employees the various legislative proposals dealt with direct federal workers but they constituted an important precedent first the proposals would set aside the various federal statutes that might conflict with establishment of compressed work hours for federal employees second and far more significant they signaled willingness of some organized workers and reform groups to abandon the principle of the 8hour workday and 40 hour workweek and to accept 10hour or 12hour workday when it seemed to be in their immediate interests to do so as suggested in the dol hearings of 1971 division developed within the trade union community with respect to compressed work schedules some with an eye to history were skeptical about any breach of the 8hour40hour standard others looked forward to the potential flexibility of comp days and long weekends among public employee unions some supported the concept others did not j gene raymond speaking for the national federation of federal employees argued that compressed work schedule the 4day week would allow the government to serve the public during evening hours when most taxpayers are off work he pointed to energy savings improved employee efficiency and morale reduced cost for transportation and services etc21 spokespersons for the public employee department aflcio and for the federation at large were sharply critical george poulin of the international association of machinists having explored such 20 during the 1970s advocacy for the restructuring of work centered in washington dc in nonprofit interest group the national council for alternative work patterns inc group of similar

days left many members especially those who were older increasingly fatigued the longterm reaction to compressed scheduling he suggested was less idyllic than its proponents suggested and he noted further the arrangement is probably not applicable to most blue collar occupations22 refined and modified the federal employees flexible and compressed work schedules act was passed by the congress and on september 30 1978 signed into law by president jimmy carter pl 95390 it set aside the 40hour workweek to the extent that it allowed for flexible compression of work hours on any daily configuration within an 80hour biweekly period23 initially the act was experimental to expire after 3 years unless extended by the congress in december 1985 after slight modification the act was made permanent pl 9919624 yet another look at walshhealey with federal employees compressed scheduling legislation moving toward approval 19771978 representative william armstrong senator henry bellmon and others renewed efforts to amend walshhealey senator bellmon declared himself mindful of the lengthy struggle which organized labor undertook to establish the 8hour day but argued that circumstances change and this country is longer faced with the inhuman daily hours of work it once had he added it does not seem likely that very strong argument can be made against the 4day workweek on the basis of endangering workers health and safety25 the arguments raised against the work hours restrictions of walshhealey closely paralleled those made in behalf of the federal employees measure walshhealey legislation was introduced in the 95th and 96th congresses with action being taken in the 97th congress 1981 thensenator armstrong reintroduced walshhealey legislation and senator don nickles chairman of the 22 us congress house subcommittee on employee ethics and utilization committee on post office and civil service parttime employment and flexible work hours hearings 95th cong 1st sess may 24 26 june 29 july 8 and october 4 1977 washington us govt print off 1977 pp 9597 23 pl 95390 read in part 1 the term compressed schedule means in the case of fulltime employee an 80hour biweekly basic work requirement which is scheduled for less than 10 workdays and b in the case of parttime employee biweekly basic work requirement of less than 80 hours which is scheduled for less than 10 workdays and 2 the term overtime hours means any hours in excess of those specified hours which constitute the compressed schedule see title ii section 201 of the act 24 while the experiment progressed impact analysis were to have been conducted but in practice little official analysis seems to have taken place how widely such systems can usefully be implemented their contribution to efficiency and productivity the toll upon or benefit to workers engaged through extended hours etc seems at least within the context of the federal program to remain subject for exploration 25 congressional record february 24 1977 p s2956 conversely others believed that workers were longer faced with inhuman daily hours of work because statutes such as walshhealey and the flsa were in place crs10 senate subcommittee on labor arranged hearing on the proposal this bill is needed to bring the laws governing federal contractors into conformity with current overtime provisions and flexibility in work schedules provided for private sector employees under the fair labor standards act and ironically senator armstrong added to federal employees themselves26 the hearing revealed clear division between labor and industry with the public employee unions absent aflcio staff economist john zalusky testified against compressed scheduling pointed to potentially negative impact upon productivity in the longterm noted that problems of health and safety could be expected to arise and suggested that it could have an adverse impact upon home and family life further he noted that compressed scheduling would be optional for employers but not necessarily so for employees zalusky questioned surveys purporting to demonstrate widespread employee support for compressed scheduling as more reflective of employer persuasiveness than of worker choice it seems like the boss comes out and says how do you like your job and the fellow says i love it27 industry and employer witnesses tended to endorse the concept the armstrong bill allowed compression only up to 10 hours day robert thompson speaking for the us chamber of commerce affirmed that the bill was good start but urged the subcommittee to improve it by striking any daily preovertime hours restriction when senator nickles suggested that such proposal might lead to abuse thompson responded that fatigue and personnel problems would largely prevent establishment of working hours longer than workers could or would stand and still maintain their productivity i am convinced thompson argued that there are very very few employers if any left around who are just going out of their way to abuse workers these days28 when the armstrong bill died at the close of the 97th congress the issue was reintroduced in the 98th congress 19831984 by the senator and in the house by representative john erlenborn invoking the spirit of the federal employees legislation representative erlenborn noted that flexible hours had proven highly popular with federal employees particularly women and argued that it makes sense on the one hand to recognize the benefits of innovative scheduling for women in the federal work force while on the other hand acquiescing to outdated federal contracting rules that deny those benefits for women in the private work force29 26 us congress senate subcommittee on labor committee on labor and human

29 congressional record april 27 1983 pp e1895e1896 crs11 senator armstrong emphasized consistency it is only fair for federal contractors to have the same advantages that private sector and government employees do30 the legislation died at the close of the 98th congress but in the 99th congress new walshhealey legislation was introduced by representatives james quillen and thomas kindness while presented as being in the interest of workers the trade unions opposed it in contrast the concept had strong support from the business roundtable us chamber of commerce national association of manufacturers associated general contractors of america agc and associated builders and contractors31 the agc national newsletter noted approvingly that if the legislation were to pass contractors could implement flexible work schedules on federal projects without paying overtime to their construction workers32 the laborer trade union journal noted that the walshhealey act is recognized by many labor leaders as the main protection against unreasonably long workdays that workers had to endure until the last few decades33 on may 6 1985 during consideration of budget resolution sconres 32 99th congress senator nickles offered an amendment providing that it was the sense of congress that the overtime pay requirements of walshhealey and the contract work hours and safety standards act cwhssa should be made to conform with those of the flsa and it is further assumed that the resulting outlay reductions shall be utilized to achieve the previously agreedupon program and outlay savings based upon cbo estimates senator nickles pointed to significant savings to be achieved from these changes the effect of this is to say that you can do work for the federal government under the same rules that you can do work in the private sector and as result you can save lot of money34 in support senator armstrong observed that such action would not only save money but make life more interesting and better for employees make it possible for employees throughout the country to be more productive35 senator edward kennedy questioned the extent of any putative savings but agreed to work with senator nickles in the committee on labor and human resources to develop appropriate legislation36 two 30 congressional record march 21 1983 pp s3525s3526 31 bureau of

and the cwhssa dropping all reference to daily overtime pay requirements and leaving only the 40hour workweek standard basically the same as that of the flsa42 and further the conference report applied this change to all federal procurement not just to dod purchases the daily labor report summarized the issue in the following manner jay power lobbyist for the aflcio said that the gramm amendment would have exempted 95 of military contracts from the prevailing wage requirement as negotiations among the conferees continued power said it simply became clear that the only way to defeat the davisbacon amendment was to compromise on the walshhealey issue while we didnt seek the deal we felt we did not have any choice43 thus compromise was reached in which the 8hour provisions of walshhealey and the cwhssa were dropped apparently to protect the davisbacon act 37 congressional record may 8 1985 pp s5682s5683 senator armstrong noted that the bill would allow contractors the

signed december 23 1985 permanent extension of the federal employees flexible and compressed work schedules act pl 99196 comp time for state and local government employees the original fair labor standards act of 1938 crafted through legislative compromise had left large numbers of workers uncovered among them persons employed by state and local governments gradually the scope of the act was widened to extend coverage to this large body of workers in 1966 the concept of enterprise for defining coverage was broadened to include certain hospitals schools transportation systems etc enterprises that were also state and local governmental entities in maryland v wirtz 392 us 183 1968 the supreme court upheld this extension of coverage in 1974 congress extended the act to most other employees of state and local governments again litigation followed and in national league of cities v usery 426 us 833 1976 the court overturned wirtz holding that both the 1966 and 1974 flsa amendments were unconstitutional to the extent that they interfered with the integral or traditional governmental functions of states and their political subdivisions schools hospitals fire protection sanitation etc were viewed as traditional functions of states and local governments and thus exempt the distinction between traditional exempt and nontraditional nonexempt proved difficult to sustain in practice in garcia v san antonio metropolitan transit authority 469 us 528 1985 the court overruled national league of cities and brought the body of state and local government employees under the act44 the garcia decision sparked concern on the part of the state and local governments employers that compliance with basic labor standards already in effect in the private sector would be unduly costly although variety of issues emerged during hearings on possible legislative response it seems clear that it was the issue of the potential costs for which local officials were accountable to taxpayers rather than any social concern which appears to have motivated the local governmental employers appeals to congress for relief were followed by extensive negotiations with interested parties public hearings and enactment of the 1985 flsa amendments the latter pl 99150 established the terms under which the flsa would be applied to state and local governments45 44 expansion of flsa coverage to state and local government entities is summarized in us congress house fair labor standards amendments of 1985 report to accompany hr 3530 house report 99331 99th cong 1st sess washington us govt print off 1985 pp 58 45 responsibility for labor standards protections has traditionally rested both with state and local governments and with the federal government each is free to act with the higher standard that most protective of the worker normally taking precedent thus higher state continued crs14 congress provides compromise in pl 99150 congress added new section 7o to the flsa46 it provides that employees of public agency which is state political subdivision of state or an interstate governmental agency may receive compensatory time off comp time in lieu of regular overtime compensation however congress did not intend by this new section that the overtime pay provisions of the flsa simply be set aside thus congress carefully delimited the comp time provisions of law and the option was not to be free of costs to the employing agency institution of comp time arrangement under section 7o must be in conformity with collective bargaining agreement where such is in effect or where there is not collective bargaining agreement through an understanding between the employee and employer arrived at before the performance of work comp time actually worked is to be calculated at rate not less than one and onehalf hours for each hour of employment for which overtime compensation is required emphasis added allowance is made for the banking of comp time accrual of credit hours but within strict limits for employees engaged in public safety activity an emergency response activity or seasonal activity not more then 480 hours may be accrued for employees engaged in other types of work more than 240 hours may be accrued47 once the accrual limits for credit hours have been reached extra hours worked must be compensated on paid time timeandahalf basis there is cash out requirement if worker ceases his employment he is to be compensated for accrued comp time at rate of compensation not less than the average regular rate received by such employee during the last 3 years of the employees employment or b the final regular rate received by such employee whichever is higher the agency is expected to make reasonable effort to allow the employee to utilize comp time at his or her convenience and desire ie within reasonable period after making the request if the use of the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the public agency comp time is not free time for the employing agency for the convenience of having worker engaged through extra hours more than 40 per week the agency must allow 90 minutes of paid leave for each 60 minutes of overtime worked48 45 continued and local standards may supersede the requirements of the flsa 46 the provisions of pl 99150 the new section 7o of the flsa are discussed here at some length because they provide policy foundation for subsequent proposals for extension of the acts comp time provisions to workers in the private sector 47 the caps upon the accrual of comp time are not annual limits but rather limits upon the number of credit hours an employee can have in the bank at any given time as comp time is drawn down the account can be credited with new credit hours within the cap one is still speaking of 6 and 12 weeks respectively of comp time or overtime work each year 48 this is summary of the provisions of section 7o for precise explanation of the operation of these provisions one should consult the statute and the appropriate administrative continued crs15 concerns and reservations the use of comp time it was argued while the 1985 flsa amendments were under consideration could be an effective means through which to reduce taxpayer costs and it could facilitate efforts of state and local governments in dealing with various unexpected or seasonal crises public safety emergency for example or another seasonal activity of short duration for which employment of extra staff would not be reasonable but in amending basic worker protective statute congress sought to anticipate areas of possible adverse effect or abuse and to build into the new provisions system of safeguards even with these safeguards in place and recognizing that public agencies do not go out of business operate under legislated or administrative regulations and are subject to general public supervision concerns were raised about the section 7o option fundamental purpose of the overtime provisions of the flsa was protection of workers from excessively long hours of work there was concern that some employers even public employers can be inconsiderate and abusive public work can be as enervating and hazardous as private sector work there was also concern that if long hours of toil in the private sector carry negative implications for workers and for the public so may those in the public sector secondary element of the overtime provisions of the flsa had been to encourage reasonably sharing of available work some argued that the use of comp time might frustrate this essential purpose overtime pay was designed to encourage employers precisely because of the cost involved to reduce excess hours of work and to employ more people where the volume of work supported it to allow the widespread use of nonpremium compensatory time on the plea that to do otherwise was too costly some argued would remove the employment incentive and frustrate the purpose of the act one justification for institution of comp time arrangement which includes some measure of flexible and compressed scheduling has been that it provides employees with flexibility and creates family friendly workplace but critics worried that in the absence of precise conditions flexible scheduling would not necessarily be family friendly and may depending upon the manner in which it is administered be decidedly unfriendly overtime hours even offset by comp time could constitute significant burden for persons who outside of the workplace operate on fixed schedule ie employees who have family and child care responsibilities who are enrolled in educational programs or who may have second job including selfemployment as in family farm situation49 prior employee concurrence through collective bargaining agreement or an understanding arrived at between the employer and employee is necessary before 48 continued regulations see 29 usc 207o and 29 cfr 553 49 house report 99331 op cit p 21 notes that the intent of the comp time provision is the preservation of regular past practices that have proved mutually beneficial to employees and employers crs16 comp time arrangement can be entered into under section 7o but some question whether the employee is effectively free to decline to extra hours acceptance of the comp time option for example might become prior condition for employment misused such an understanding between public employer and public employee could become factor in promotions and measure of workers cooperation and seriousness about his work the statute directs that the employee will be permitted to utilize accrued comp time within reasonable period and if the use of compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the public agency emphasis added while the department of labor through regulations has attempted to define these concepts there is still significant latitude for subjective interpretation considerable legislative attention was devoted to the limits placed upon comp time accumulation in section 7o 480 hours for public safety activity and 240 hours for those engaged in other unspecified work was this too restrictive or too generous50 the statute does not require that comp time be cashedout until employment is terminated thus an agency could carry up to 12 weeks 3 months of employee earnings for an indefinite period where one employee is involved the total of such deferred earnings may be inconsequential where several hundred or several thousand workers are involved the amount of forgone interest to the employees could be substantial which has led to several questions what happens to the return on these deferred earnings or credit hours ultimately converted to cash further might staff shortage be created if number of workers chose to cash out at one time the emphases upon seasonality in section 7o it could be argued had less to do with managing emergency services that were unanticipated than with reducing the cost of employing public workers to perform routine functions both seasonal and of nonseasonal nature this concern was raised in the report of the committee on 50 house report 99331 op cit p 21 explains the concern for abuse was noted by the committee when it stated pp 2122 the committee does not expect to find that after the enactment of these amendments local government employees are suddenly reclassified with additional designations as emergency personnel similarly the committee assumes that local government administrators will resist the temptation to assign their clerical employees or their support staff to an afternoon of shoveling snow on the courthouse steps or day with the ambulance crew simply to bump the compensatory time cap to the higher level crs17 education and labor51 further the definition of seasonality provides the basis for determining the cap on comp time accrual in reporting the 1985 flsa amendments the house committee on education and labor affirmed that compensatory time is not envisioned as means to avoid overtime compensation52 however as noted above reducing the cost of providing public services was central issue while the 1985 flsa amendments were before the congress inevitably some might argue that would lead to having public employees work extended hours perhaps with some regularity without having to pay them time andahalf as would ordinarily be required in the private sector expanding compressed scheduling and comp time to the private sector an early initiative by the end of 1985 three different arrangements were in effect for dealing with extended hours of work53 for covered employment in the private sector the 40hour workweek prior to payment of overtime was largely the norm but within 40 hour workweek any configuration of workhours was permitted without the payment of overtime54 in addition as discussed above special overtime structures were allowed for employees of state and local governments under the 1985 flsa amendments section 7o and under the federal employees flexible and compressed work schedules legislation alternative work schedules beyond the 40 hour workweek were permitted for certain federal employees with these latter exemptions in place under the flsa the question arose should these options comp time and compressed scheduling be extended to the private sector 51 house report 99331 op cit p 22 notes seasonal activity is not limited strictly to those operations that are very susceptible to changes in the weather obviously parks and recreation activity in general are primarily seasonal since they experience peak demand during fair weather seasons or other sport seasons and largely dormant periods at other times road crews while not necessarily seasonal workers may nevertheless have significant periods of peak demand for instance during the snow plowing or road construction season in such an instance the snow plow operatorroad crew employee would be able to accrue compensatory time to the higher cap while other employees of the same department who do not have lengthy periods of peak seasonal demand would remain under the lower cap mere periods of short but intense activity do not make an employees job seasonal in nature therefore clerical employees working increased hours for several weeks on city budget or processing insurance forms or tax notices would not need the higher compensatory time cap since the limited periods of increased activity could be accommodated within the lower limit 52 house report 99331 op cit p 23 53 in additional to the various federal overtime pay requirements many of the states have introduced their own workhours standards conversely some workers are protected by none of these arrangements neither federal nor state 54 as variously noted exceptions to the 40hour workweek formula have been built into the flsa thus the system is not as rigid as it might appear at first glance see for example 29 usc 213 crs18 the wallop proposal introduced in march 1985 the 99th congress while congress still had under consideration the federal employees compressed work schedules legislation and the walshhealey and cwhssa modifications senator malcolm wallop proposed legislation that would have allowed the 40hour flsa standard to be set aside in order to replace it with comp time option under the wallop proposal persons employed more than 40 hours week would have been allowed to bank hours defer earnings on straighttime basis the banked hourscomp time would then have been used by employees during slack employment periods as the senator explained it with payment being made at the time the banked hours were used55 senator wallop reintroduced the legislation in the 100th and 101st congresses s 2196 and s 515 respectively without action being taken in an introductory statement in march 1989 the senator explained that the wyoming firm that had inspired the legislation was normally beset with strong seasonal fluctuations he observed during the peaks the employees would work well over the normal 40 hour work week but in the troughs their hours were well below that standard the senator suggested that both workers and management viewed the arrangement as one solution to ensuring steady wages throughout the year the senator pointed out that the option might be especially helpful to working women with children who might use the comp time during school vacations56 essentially this proposal would have set aside section 7 of the flsa without actually repealing it while the legislation was viewed by its sponsor and those advocating its introduction as family friendly and sensible solution for dealing with irregular time demands57 some believed that it clashed with the purposes of the flsa the proposed legislation however seems to have sparked little public discussion either pro nor yet as an early initiative in the area of private sector comp time arrangements the legislation warrants examination concerns and implications if enacted the wallop bill s 515 would have allowed employers to engage employees for an unlimited number of hours per week without payment of overtime rates by mutual agreement between worker and his employer the two would have been allowed to set aside the overtime pay requirements of the flsa and to operate basically without any overtime pay constraints on simple oneforone comp time arrangement with comp time calculated on straighttime basis the employer would have saved 50 of his wage costs for each overtime hour worked but these savings would have been realized at the expense of employee takehome pay institution of the comp time system was to have been allowed pursuant to contract made between the employer and the employee individually or an agreement 55 congressional record permanent edition march 28 1985 p 6691 see s 798 referred to the committee on labor and human resources 56 congressional record permanent edition march 6 1989 pp 35263527 see also congressional record permanent edition march 18 1988 p 4439 57 congressional record permanent edition march 18 1988 p 4439 crs19 made as result of collective bargaining where collectively bargained agreement permitted the arrangement workers could be expected to have some protection and voice in structuring the system otherwise there was specific requirement that an agreement between an individual worker and hisher employer be voluntary or that it not be condition for securing employment or remaining employed control of the comp time accrued by employees was left in the hands of the employer thus the system was flexible for the employer but not necessarily so for the worker58 as was discussed above one purpose of the overtime provisions of the flsa is to deter employers from engaging their employees through excessively long hours and instead to hire additional workers with the overtime pay penalty set aside the disincentive with respect to overtime work and conversely the incentive to create additional employment opportunities would have been removed job creation however was not the only concern that sparked enactment of the overtime section of the flsa collateral purpose was to provide shield for workers against potentially negative impacts of long hours of toil and as well from any accompanying costs in terms of health and safety hazards fatigue or inconvenience many observers thought that shield might have disappeared under the proposal as introduced59 the comp time option would have applied to any employer public or private large or small stable or newly established under the flsa labor standards are applied differently to different work environments in part because public and private sector employers operate in different cultures and under different 58 on april 12 1989 senator wallop proposed the substance of s 515 as an amendment to thenpending legislation noting all we are doing is permitting voluntary agreements between labor and management to utilize flexible comp time program emphasis added the assumption was that the arrangement would be voluntary for each of the parties senator kennedy took exception to that assumption observing what the senator from wyoming is basically saying is when that person comes in and gets that employment he indicates that they sign contract to permit this kind of compensatory time off the problem with that as we all know is that the bargaining position between an employer and single employee at the time when they come on in to work is not one of great equity we know very well that any employee when they go to the job the employer may well say youve got the job just sign here which says we do not have to compensate you with overtime pay for any time over 40 hours week see congressional record permanent edition april 12 1989 p 6154 the issue related to the effective right of an employee to decline to enter into an agreement to allow comp time use when to decline is clearly contrary to the wishes of his current or prospective employer 59 senator wallop later affirmed that the issue was one that he had pushed for most of this decade with s 515 resting in committee he redrafted its substance as an amendment to the general 1989 flsa amendments his proposal tabled by vote of 66 to 33 sparked floor debate between senators wallop kennedy metzenbaum and mitchell that summarized the issues pro and concerning private sector use of comp time for hours worked in excess of 40 per week see congressional record permanent edition april 5 1989 pp 56045605 and april 12 1989 pp 61536158 crs20 rules the public employer normally is an ongoing concern governed by established and uniform personnel regulations and under general public supervision private sector firms are diverse in their labormanagement relationships and have greater freedom to merge or simply to go out of business in some sectors of the private economy instability is common for example in the garment industry and in some segments of construction responsible firms of course would honor their obligations for payment of deferred earnings the cashout value of comp time less responsible firms might not where bankruptcy proceeding was involved workers might secure their back pay where there were assets to be attached but that could involve litigation beyond the resources of many workers especially those in the lowincome group even for firm with the best of intentions an employer could fall upon hard times and endup in default in some cases closing might be more informal leaving workers without recourse payment of comp time earnings accrued on straighttime basis would have been deferred until the workweek in which the comp time was actually used cap was to have been imposed upon the number of hours accruable under the system and date was set by which such deferred earnings would have needed to be paid to the workers just in subsequent workweek60 the employer under s 515 would have had control over and use of the deferred wages through an indefinite interim period provision was made for payment of interest on what some arguably may have viewed as an interestfree loan from the workers to their employer enforcement of wagehour standards even under current law is difficult in firm with significant number of employees working through different time periods and degrees of flexibility and hours compression and accruing deferred income through comp time the task could be very complex what level of compliance machinery would be necessary to determine that comp time was accurately awarded to insure that an employer would be able to make payment when called upon to do so and to secure payment of these back wages were an employer either unable or unwilling voluntarily to pay them overtime pay and comp time concerns in the 104th congress the flsa in 1938 was product of legislative compromise while it set general minimum wage and overtime pay standards exceptions were built into the statute through the years the pattern of exceptions has become increasingly complex as congress in response to appeals from various interests has sought to expand the coverage of the statute or to define certain categories of workers or industries as outside the acts requirements most such legislative adjustments have 60 reference here is to s 515 however see also comments by senator wallop april 12 1989 congressional record permanent edition april 12 1989 pp 61561657 as part of the senators remarks there is letter from james helzer unicover corp cheyenne wyoming explaining his firms experiment with comp time option subsequently found to have been in conflict with the flsa crs21 been followed by complex and normally more detailed and technical regulations developed by dol in an effort to apply the changes mandated by congress in the 104th congress more than two dozen bills were introduced urging amendment of the flsa61 several of those proposals dealt specifically with the 40 hour workweek flexible and compressed scheduling and overtime pay s 1129 ashcroft with similar measure in the house hr 2723 doolittle and hr 2391 ballenger the ashcroft proposal on august 7 1995 declaring that americas workplace laws reflect the needs of bygone era and are hopelessly outdated senator ashcroft introduced s 1129 the work and family integration act62 it is incomprehensible senator ashcroft suggested that workplace law in this country is predominated by workplace statute that was passed almost 60 years ago suggesting the need for adjustment of the 40hour workweek principle the senator stated that such rigid and inflexible provisions have paralyzed those it was meant to help the flsa he continued now deprives employees of the right to order their daily lives on and off the job to meet the responsibilities of work and home63 senator ashcroft urged greater overtime pay flexibility as family friendly issue s 1129 adding new subsection to section 13 exemptions of the flsa was both simple and complex first it would have allowed an employer to set aside the standard 40hour workweek and replace it with 160hour basic work requirement ie 160 workhours over 4week period that is scheduled for less than 20 workdays64 second within the 4week 160hour period or as separate flexible scheduling arrangement an employer would have been allowed the option of 61 early in the 104th congress the flsa was extended to legislative branch employees pl 1041 signed january 23 1995 later congress adopted legislation to exempt official court reporters with state and local court systems under certain conditions from the overtime pay provisions of the act pl 10426 signed september 6 1995 to modify child labor practice under the act with respect to certain hazardous types of work pl 104174 signed august 6 1996 and more general amendments dealing with the federal minimum wage and related issues pl 104188 signed august 20 1996 62 s 1129 was referred to the senate committee on labor and human resources on february 27 1996 general hearing was conducted on issues raised by the proposed legislation on december 6 1995 companion legislation hr 2723 was introduced in the house by representative doolittle and referred to the committee on economic and educational opportunities 63 congressional record august 7 1995 p s11788 64 the initiative for instituting flexible or compressed workhours program under s 1129 rested with the employer once that initial decision had been made the employer would have been allowed to invite his employees to participate in the program his employees would have had the choice of participating or not if they agreed to participate the employer would then have been free to schedule them for more than 40 hours in workweek without paying overtime rates if the employee chose not to participate then the employer would have been required to pay him timeandahalf for hours worked in excess of 40 in single workweek crs22 restructuring workhours that is any configuration of hours so long as the total for the 4week period did not exceed 160 workhours within the 4week160hour period overtime pay would be required third if an employer found it appropriate to schedule in excess of 160 hours in 4week period then each employee could have worked up to 48 hours more than the regular 160 hours carrying over the excess 48 hours to succeeding 4week period as credit hours65 fourth hours worked in excess of 160 in 4week period credit hours would have been credited to the employee at straighttime rate section 7 and any other provision of law that relates to premium pay for overtime work shall not apply to the hours that constitute such compressed schedule it appears that timeanda half pay would not have been required until an employee had worked 208 hours in 4week period ie 160 regular work hours plus 48 credit hours66 fifth an employer would have been allowed to initiate program of flexible schedules within the new 160hour workmonth and invite the participation of his employees such flexible schedule could include designated hours and days during which an employee on such schedule must be present for work and other specified conditions67 sixth employee would have been required to participate in the flexible and compressed scheduling program and any threat intimidation or coercion on the part of the employer was prohibited68 under this proposal workers and workplaces would have been divided into two separate groups first there are those covered by collective bargaining agreement union workers in which case that agreement would govern implementation of the flexible and compressed workhours arrangement second there are those workers not covered by collective bargaining agreement for the most part nonunion workers in which case the program drawn up by or authorized by management would be controlling69 65 there may have been some ambiguity about the wording of the credit hour provision of s 1129 only 48 credit hours could be accumulated during single 4week period and only 48 credit hours could be drawn down by the employee in succeeding 4week period for credit to the basic work requirement for such period however as introduced the legislation did not appear to impose cap per upon the number of credit hours that worker could accumulate while he or she participated in the flexible scheduling program 66 as introduced s 1129 provided for compressed scheduling option ie flexibility within 160hour work4week workperiod b flexible workhours within workperiod however defined and c credit hours option while the compressed and flexible scheduling arrangements may be freestanding it would appear that they might also have been used jointly as flexible and compressed schedules with credit hours option structuring these arrangements as part of single program appeared to allow maximum scheduling flexibility 67 under the federal employees flexible and compressed work schedules act periods are usually set aside during which employees must be present core time in order to permit scheduling of meetings or other activities involving full working group 68 the bill specifically prohibited coercion of employees in order to get them to participate in program of flexible andor compressed scheduling 69 in addition to its general flexible and compressed work scheduling provisions s 1129 continued crs23 the 40hour workweek s 1129 according to an explanation released by the senators office does not change the 40hour work week standard but rather simply adds an additional provision to the fair labor standards act which creates an exception to the 40hour workweek70 but the senator pointed out the bill would alter the flsas rigid 40hour maximum workweek provision71 under the proposal the 40hour workweek could have been replaced with two other patterns taking its place first the 160hour 4week work period and second the 48 credit hour balance overtime pay would have been triggered after 208 hours had been worked 160 regular workhours with up to 48 credit hours assuming cap at 48 on the number of credit hours that could be accumulated then further credit hours could be earned until some part of the 48 banked hours had been drawn down in many operations this combination of scheduling options arguably might have eliminated the need for overtime pay in the traditional sense that the term is used under the flsa while the 40hour workweek would not have been repealed the more flexible scheduling option could have become the norm new workplace flexibility this legislation senator ashcroft affirmed in his statement introducing s 1129 will put work schedule decision making back in the hands of employees later he pointed out that employees would be able to request and employers could provide compensatory time off instead of being paid overtime rates for overtime hours worked72 s 1129 provided that an employer may establish programs of flexible and compressed work schedules all scheduling arrangements under such programs arrangement of hours and days of work the degree of the compression designation of core time when an employee must be present for work etc appear to have rested with the employer except where there is collective bargaining agreement73 production processes and business necessity likely would have been major factors an employer would have taken into account when determining whether and when to grant an employees request for compensatory time off hours 69 continued dealt with other issues it allowed for the priority rehiring of former employees under certain conditions without incurring penalties of law ie civil rights discrimination seniority pension requirements etc it would have modified section 13a1 of the flsa with respect to leave and overtime pay policies for salaried workers an issue that has been in contention for several years and it would have brought the federal employees flexible and compressed work schedules act into conformity with the 160hour 4week formula 70 senator ashcrofts office has prepared fact sheet undated concerning s 1129 from which this report draws 71 congressional record august 7 1995 p s11789 72 congressional record august 7 1995 pp s11788s11789 there would appear to have been some uncertainty about the computation of overtimecomp time rates giving the wording of the proposed legislation and some of the related documentation 73 normally it is the employers option to establish the sequence of workhours starting times shift structures etc flexibility in scheduling both under current practice and as projected under s 1129 is essentially an employer decision crs24 flexibility and the like the bill did not contain language comparable to the within reasonable period and if the use of compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the establishment as is part of section 7o that deals with comp time utilization in the public sector74 section 7o of the flsa as it relates to comp time for state and local government employees requires in the absence of collective bargaining agreement that participation in comp time program be preceded by an agreement or understanding arrived at between the employer and employee before the performance of the work75 s 1129 provided the employer may on request of the employee grant the employee compensatory time off in lieu of payment for such overtime hours whether or not irregular or occasional in nature and notwithstanding section 7 the overtime pay provisions of the flsa or any other provision of law emphasis added there was requirement that such request be written and thus were it not required by the implementing regulations it would appear that request of the employee could have been either oral or written if the request had been oral worker agreement or refusal might have been difficult to document were litigation to follow and indeed many employers might have sought protection by securing an employees agreement in written form this however may have raised other concerns since the several workhours options were to be initiated and in the absence of collective bargaining agreement structured at the discretion of the employer the form format and timing of an employee request to participate in such programs were left to be defined in regulations if at all assuming that an employee request to participate in an alternative workhours program under s 1129 would be written then content and timing could be important for example could prospective worker be handed request form when applying for employment if so would an applicant be free to decline to sign without endangering his likelihood of being hired while hr 2391 as reported included provision that private sector employee may only be provided compensatory time off if such agreement or understanding was not condition of employment s 1129 did not while s 1129 would have prohibited an attempt by an employer directly or indirectly to intimidate threaten or coerce it was not specified how this would be implemented 74 some might argue that control of such programs could hardly rest with anyone other than the employer especially where work processes are closely integrated with one employee dependent upon another or where there are tight production deadlines 75 see 29 usc 207o2aii this provision also appeared in hr 2391 the ballenger proposal of the 104th congress discussed below as reported by the committee on economic and educational opportunities hr 2391 also required that such an agreement or understanding be entered into knowingly and voluntarily by such employee and in the case of private sector employees that it be written or otherwise verifiable statement crs25 some were concerned that flexibility for the employer under pressure to meet production deadlines could result in an employee being required to work compressed schedule that would be inconsistent with his or her nonwork responsibilities childcare school or other training program etc that could occur under current law but at the end of 40 hours in single week any additional hours of work would trigger an overtime pay penalty of timeandahalf under s 1129 employer flexibility could have extended to 208 overtime free hours in single month arranged to meet the requirements of the employer and of the production process in the absence of general request from an employee to participate in alternative scheduling it is not clear that separate request would have been required on each occasion in which weekly hours of work extended beyond 4076 would consistent refusal by worker to work compressed schedule 160 hours structured through 4 weeks andor to accept straighttime pay for overtime credit hours rather than insisting upon timeandahalf have affected that employees status and opportunities the proposed legislation would have applied equally to workplaces that are comfortable and collegial and to those that are characterized by highpressure productionoriented culture whether s 1129 would have assured that flexibility was twoway street was not immediately clear compliance and administration the federal employees flexible and compressed work schedules act applies only to employers that are more or less permanent that is to federal agencies and the implementation of the option is carefully scrutinized by the office of personnel management and more distantly by the congress the 1985 flsa amendments created comp time option for employees of state and local governments there the employers are ongoing entities operating under public supervision s 1129 proposed extension of the flexible and compressed workhours option to an employer that is to any employer covered under the overtime pay provisions of the flsa public or private large or small without limitation under current law for covered employees the general requirement is that any hours worked in excess of 40 per week require payment at the rate of timeandahalf straight forward standard s 1129 would have authorized variety of new workhours arrangements some workers might remain on straight time others on alternative scheduling with credit hours some workers might move in and out of the system allowed by s 1129 depending upon their nonwork responsibilities s 1129 imposed cashout deadline for credit hours so long as one remained in the program carrying credit hours on the books through an extended period would add some complexity to the compliance burden for some small firms the alternative scheduling option could prove difficult to administer however any initiative which expanded comp time and related options would likely engender such difficulty in some measure 76 questions arose as to how much flexibility an employer would have been allowed in designing an alternative scheduling program crs26 during consideration of the legislation providing flexible and compressed scheduling for federal employees process that spanned more than decade many of these same issues were raised even allowing for the differences between public and private sector employment enforcement andor compliance problems suggested by s 1129 would not necessarily be overwhelming but would add complexity beyond the current program alternative scheduling and the family friendly workplace alternative work scheduling through the past several decades has often been considered positive step in the creation of family friendly workplace the growing trend of both husband and wife working outside the home has made more difficult the juggling of work and family responsibilities flexible hours with time off to care for family matters could proponents say make workers happier less stressed and more productive when s 1129 work and family integration act was introduced it was pointed out that worker wishing to work 45 hours one week in exchange for working only 35 the following week so he or she can attend their childs baseball game parentteacher conference or doctors appointment must first have an employer willing to pay him or her five hours of overtime pay for the 45hour week s 1129 is an effort to make the fair labor standards act conform to the realities of the current workplace77 central issue here may be the matter of control when flexible and compressed scheduling is utilized to enhance the quality of worklife and where workers are able to match flexible schedules to their family needs the system should work well at least for the employee but that flexibility and match may not always exist78 clearly flexible and compressed scheduling is not an option for all employers nor for all employees for an establishment with cooperative labormanagement relationship and where the work processes allow it flexible scheduling may be win win situation but where production depends upon workforce stability as in factory setting where customer hours need to be maintained or where employees work closely as team an absence of an employee could be damaging and though the individual workers may feel less stressed productivity may suffer that flexible scheduling results in increased efficiency and productivity does not appear to have been demonstrated conclusively under some circumstances flexible and compressed 77 congressional record august 7 1995 p s11788 under current law if an employee works flexible schedule within the 40hour week takes the 5 hours off and works an additional 5 hours there would be need for overtime pay under the flsa flexibility is allowable within single workweek if however need for time off arose on the final workday of the week that option would not be available he would have to use vacation time personal days family leave days etc 78 if one assumes as appears to be normally true that the employer establishes the schedule of workhours then the issue becomes primarily one of the mode of payment ie overtime pay in cash on timeandahalf basis or credit hours drawn down on straight time basis in either case control over workhours would appear to rest with the employer crs27 schedules may benefit both the employer and employee but under different circumstances they may not necessarily benefit either the ballenger proposal during the early months of the 104th congress the house subcommittee on workforce protection chaired by representative ballenger conducted oversight on certain aspects of the flsa among them the issues of comp time and compressed scheduling on september 21 1995 mr ballenger introduced the compensatory time for all workers act of 1995 hr 2391 following further hearings and markup the bill was sent back to the full committee on economic and educational opportunities on july 11 1996 the full committee reported the legislation by vote of 20 yeas to 16 nays republicans supporting the bill democrats in opposition on july 30 1996 the measure was called up in the house and passed 225 yeas to 195 nays further action was taken on the legislation during the 104th congress in general the ballenger bill would have allowed employers to offer compensatory time off to their employees in place of the more traditional overtime pay in cash the choice of whether to offer the option was left to the employer where there was collective bargaining agreement implementation of the option would have been subject to negotiation where such agreement or worker representation was involved an arrangement was to have been worked out between each employee and his or her employer once management had determined to offer comp time and had developed program for its implementation the worker would have been given the option of participating in the program or remaining on traditional cash overtime pay basis an agreement or understanding in written or otherwise verifiable form would then have been entered into between the parties ceiling of 240 hours of comp time was to have been set or less depending upon the individual program with mandatory cashout of accrued hours at least once each year proponents of the legislation have affirmed that workers would be free to choose with respect to participation free from coercion on the part of their employers further once worker had become participant he still had the option of opting out of the program with appropriate notice to his employer conversely the employer would be free to terminate the program with appropriate notice to his employees the legislation called for sanctions and penalties in case of violations of law concern about the legislation was voiced from several perspectives some argued that extended and in their view excessive hours of work might be as hazardous and debilitating for workers in the 1990s as they had been in the 1930s ie that 40hour workweek was long enough and that overtime work should be discouraged the substitution of comp time for regular cash overtime would involve crs28 trade of some cash earnings by the employee for time off at later date79 further comp time would be the equivalent of wages but these wages accrued hours would be deferred income held and used by the employer on an interim basis significant concern appears to have been the issue of effective choice on the part of the worker some questioned whether worker really would be free to decline to participate in the comp time program if he or she knew that the arrangement was preferred by his or her employer if job applicant were offered the option of comp time in place of cash overtime could that become an implicit condition of employment even were the employer carefully to refrain from making it an explicit condition could an employer assign overtime work only or largely to employees who agreed to accept comp time rather than cash finally there was the matter of effective worker choice in the use of comp time already earned the employee could request the use of his or her comp time and the employer could approve that request within reasonable period and when the absence of the employee does not unduly disrupt the operation of the firm definition of reasonable period and unduly disrupt would be left either to implementing regulations or to the discretion of the employer while the employer could approve an employee request it could also deny the request under this bill the employer would have been allowed to buy back the accrued hours at his the employers discretion compensating the worker in cash thus accrued comp time banked hours might not be available to worker when need for workhours flexibility arose the ballenger bill was characterized as family friendly legislation and as an aide to workers especially to working women in their effort to balance work with family concerns in general hr 2391 was supported by industry and by employer or businessoriented groups the labor policy association the national federation of independent business etc and opposed by the trade union movement and certain 79 if an employee who is regularly employed throughout the year works overtime hours and is paid in cash he receives his regular wage augmented by his overtime pay for the extra hours worked if that employee were instead to take comp time he would be permitted to take paid leave 90 minutes of leave for 60 minutes worked overtime at later point at years end the annual earnings for the worker who took the cash would combine his regular wage plus his overtime pay the worker who took comp time would have given up some amount of overtime pay but he would have had some extra hours of free time during the year there would be tradeoff of cash for free time crs29 womens organizations80 the final vote on hr 2391 was 225 yeas to 195 nays action on the measure occurred in the senate81 the clinton proposal by june 1996 comp time legislation had been under active legislative consideration for more than year markedup and reported by the workforce protections subcommittee in middecember 1995 full committee markup had been scheduled for june 26 1996 in the interim backers of the legislation had discussed alternative language which might offer further protection and assurances to workers the clinton administration also had the issue of flexibility under consideration during the summer and fall of 1996 it began to shape package of proposals although they were never considered in legislative form they provided additional options for legislators and became an element in the workhours debate both in the house and senate into the 105th congress president clinton enters the fray on june 21 the president directed memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies urging implementation of federal family friendly work arrangements the federal government must continue to set the pace in transforming the culture of the american workplace so that it supports employees who are devoted to their families he directed the agency and department heads to develop plan of action to utilize the flexible policies already in place and to the extent feasible to expand these programs among the presidents areas of concern was flexible hours that will enable employees to schedule their work and meet the needs of their families this includes encouragement to parents to attend school functions and events essential to their children he called for an initial report from the departments and agencies within 120 days that would include an assessment of progress made toward specific goals and include innovative approaches and detailed success stories82 80 variety of individuals both from management and from the general workforce spoke in their own behalf with respect to the legislation the division among womens groups over comp time became more apparent during the 105th congress diana furchtgottroth resident fellow at the american enterprise institute and associated with the conservative independent womens forum testified in support of the concept helen norton of the womens legal defense fund spoke against it as did

reelection president clinton addressed the family reunion v conference in nashville discussing series of familyrelated issues the president spoke about the issue of time an increased opportunity for parents aside from their work responsibilities to address the needs of their children he concluded by observing that there are two more changes we can make that would help the american economy not hurt business and strengthen families first he noted would be an expansion of the family and medical leave act adopted by the 104th congress he urged we should pass family leave ii that would allow employees to take up to 24 hours year thats not lot of time for parentteacher conferences or for routine medical care for child spouse or parent second we need to make the workplace more familyfriendly especially where lot of overtime is concerned and give people more flextime in taking overtime either in income or in time with their families he proposed to redefine compensation in way that reflects the value of family and community while urging greater workhours flexibility the president emphasized its important that this be choice for employees he acknowledged employer interest in the proposal but stressed that in his opinion the employee has to make the decision and that we have to write strong protections into the law at the same time he took note of existing abuses with respect to minimum wages and overtime pay adding that without appropriate safeguards it could simply open the door wide for abuse of the overtime laws83 an initial response the presidents message enjoyed mixed reception although the president had avoided use of the term comp time which has negative connotations for unions and substituted the term flextime84 aflcio president john sweeney commented opening up overtime laws to potential abuse is not the solution to families needs85 christina martin deputy press secretary to republican presidential candidate robert dole referred to the initiative as stolen rhetoric86 some reporters termed the proposal an electionyear appeal to americans juggling job and family87 others suggested that the presidents proposal marked another

under discussion through the summer of 1996 in his acceptance speech at the democratic convention the president said we should pass flextime law that allows employees to take their overtime pay in money or in time off depending on whats better for their family97 but the white house still indicated that veto awaited the ballenger bill the washington post reported in early september the veto promise comes at the strong urging of organized labor which fears that there are not enough protections in the proposal to prevent employers from coercing workers into taking time off in lieu of overtime payments labor appears equally leery of the white house proposal but union officials this week did not seem prepared to make public fuss about it during the election campaign 98 karen nussbaum director of the working womens department aflcio stated the view that workers need the money earned through overtime pay and that they have little confidence that they would actually have choice between cash and time off even were the flsa amended she pointed out that with about 800 dol wage and hour inspectors responsible for compliance in some 6 million workplaces ensuring full and free choice might be difficult99 conversely dan yager of the labor policy association contended that the vast majority of employers would not abuse the option sandra boyd of flecs and the lpa argued

to offer legislation on compensatory time expanded family leave the washington post september 7 1996 p a9 crs33 deadset against it lpa president jeffrey mcguiness asserted that most workers want some sort of workplace flexibility101 what president clinton proposed under date of september 27 1996 president clinton transmitted to congress draft for his familyfriendly workplace act of 1996 the proposal was essentially divided into two parts section one dealing with comp time and section two expanding the family and medical leave act comp time option the president proposed adding new subsection r to section 7 of the flsa102 although the initiative was not acted upon during the 104th congress and was not subject of hearings its provisions summarized below became an element in legislative discussion of the issue and therefore is part of the background for the current debate first the concept of employee for purposes of the comp time option was defined to exclude parttime temporary or seasonal worker an employee of public agency an employee of an employer in the garment industry and others vulnerable employees excluded through regulations to be issued by the secretary of labor103 second comp time would be calculated on basis of 1and12hours of paid leave for each hour of overtime worked in case of bankruptcy comp time would be treated as unpaid wages third the decision whether to offer comp time would rest initially with the employer if the employer decides to offer comp time then he may do so pursuant to collective bargaining agreement memorandum of understanding or any other written agreement between the employer and representative of such employees where collective bargaining agreement exists and there is representative of the employees then the option may be arranged through plan adopted by the employer and provided in writing to its employees which provides employees with voluntary option to receive compensatory time off for overtime work where there is an express voluntary written request by the individual employee for compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay 101 transcript morning edition national public radio october 24 1996 p 7 102 the text of the presidents proposal with explanatory information appeared in the daily labor report october 15 1996 pp e1e7 103 employees of state and local governments of course would continue to be covered under section 7o of the act under section 3d of the clinton proposal the secretary would be allowed to issue regulations defining classes of employees who would be excluded from the comp time option to limit the number of compensatory hours that participating employees may accrue to less than otherwise applicable in the new subsection r and to require employers to provide such employees with monetary compensation for earned compensatory time at more frequent intervals than otherwise applicable under the new subsection r crs34 the request must be submitted prior to the performance of any overtime assignment and may not be required as condition of employment fourth the comp time option must be available to similarlysituated employees on an equal basis fifth the employee may not earn more than total of 80 hours of compensatory time in any year or alternative 12month period 104 the employee would be regularly advised if the number of hours of comp time earned and of the total accumulated earned but unused sixth at the end of any 12month period the employer would be required to cash out any comp time earned but unused at 1and12 times the rate of pay earned by the employer when the overtime was worked or the rate at the time the hours were cashed out whichever is higher within 15 days following the request of an employee the employer would be required to make cash payment for comp time earned105 monetary cashout is also required where an employee either voluntarily or involuntarily terminates his employment seventh the use of comp time by terminated employee may not be counted to diminish eligibility for unemployment compensation106 in addition payment for comp time shall be treated as compensation for hours worked for purposes of calculation of entitlement to employment benefits eighth the employee may utilize banked comp time with two weeks prior notice to an employer unless such use will cause substantial and grievous injury to the employers operations or perhaps within the two week period unless use of the compensatory time at that time will unduly disrupt the operations of the employer ninth the employer may not require that an employee use accrued comp time however the employer may modify or terminate compensatory time plan upon not less than 60 days notice to employees 104 the wording may earn not more than total of 80 hours in 12month period would be firm annual limit not merely limit to the number of hours of compensatory leave that one might have on the books at any time ceiling italics added with ceiling an employee could work far more than 80 hours of overtimecomp time each year so long as more than 80 hours were accrued 105 subsection r3c provides an employee may voluntarily at the employees own initiative request in writing that such endofyear payment of monetary compensation for earned compensatory time be delayed for period not to exceed three months extending the cashout payment shall have effect on the limit on earned compensatory time for the following 12month period 106 subsection r4 provides terminated employees receipt of or eligibility to receive monetary compensation for earned compensatory time shall not be used by the employer to oppose an employees application for unemployment compensation or b by state to deny unemployment compensation or diminish an employees entitlement to unemployment compensation benefits crs35 tenth the employer may not substitute earned compensatory time for any other paid or unpaid leave or time off to which the employee otherwise is or would be entitled or has or would earn nor satisfy any legal obligation of the employer to the employee pursuant to any law or contract107 eleventh various employee safeguards were included for example the following were defined as unlawful acts of discrimination by an employer to discharge or in any other manner penalize discriminate against or interfere with any employee because such employee may refuse or has refused to request or accept compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay or because such employee may request to use or has used compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay or b to request directly or indirectly that an employee accept compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay to require an employee to request such compensatory time as condition of employment or as condition of employment rights or benefits or to qualify the availability of work for which overtime compensation is required uponan employees request for or acceptance of compensatory time off in lieu of overtime compensation or c to deny an employee the right to use or force an employee to use earned compensatory time in violation of this subsection twelfth system of penalties for violation of the provisions of the comp time option were provided including the award of penalties attorneys fees and other sanctions certain qualifications were built into the clinton proposal among them were it would define parttime employee as anyone who worked less than 35 hours per week such person would not be eligible to participate in the program b similarly for purposes of exemption from the program seasonal person is defined as one employed for season or other term of less than twelve months or is otherwise treated by the employer as not permanent employee of the employer c further the excluded class was defined to include an employee in the construction industry in agricultural employment or in any other industry which the secretary by regulation has determined is seasonal industry d finally the secretary of labor was directed as necessary and appropriate to develop regulations implementing record keeping requirements and prescribing the content of plans and employee notification the comp time program under the clinton initiative presented as an experiment was to expire sunset 4 years after enactment of the measure 107 the concern here appears to be that employers might diminish sick leave or annual leave ordinarily granted to employees since employees could use comp time for vacation and certain other activities since vacation time and sick leave are not mandated by the flsa it is not clear how such substitution could be prevented crs36 other provisions of the clinton plan the clinton proposal included additional initiatives largely independent from the comp time option per each of which would likely have raised additional areas of concern for interested parties commission on workplace flexibility assuming that the basic comp time option were written into law the clinton initiative called for creation of commission on workplace flexibility the commission would have been charged with the conduct of comprehensive study of the impact of compensatory time on public and private sector employees including but not limited to the impact of the law on average earnings hours of work work schedules and flexibility of scheduling work to accommodate family needs and on the ability of vulnerable employees or other employees to obtain the compensation to which they are entitled the report to be concluded within 4year period was to be submitted to the secretary of labor and to the appropriate committees of the congress it was to have made recommendations as to whether the comp time option was to be modified or extended including recommendation as to whether particular classes of employees or industries should be exempted or otherwise given special treatment and whether additional protections should be given including to employees of public agencies expanding the family and medical leave act the clinton proposal would have expanded the family and medical leave act of 1993 fmla to provide to an eligible employee 24 hours of unpaid leave within 12month period108 this time away from work was to be used to i participate in school activities directly related to the educational advancement of or daughter of the employee such as parentteacher conferences or interviewing for new school ii accompany the or daughter of the employee to routine medical or dental appointments such as checkups or vaccinations and iii accompany an elderly relative of the employee to routine medical or dental appointments or appointments for other professional services related to the elders care such as interviewing at nursing or group homes options provided through changes in the fmla would be outside the scope of comp time legislation while potentially utilized as supplement to other alternative work schedules flexibility under the fmla would be administered somewhat differently leave for civil service employees the proposal would have added new section 6383f to the united states code allowing public employees to enjoy 24 hours of unpaid annual leave for school medical and eldercare purposes this would follow the pattern noted above for the private sector workforce 108 concerning the family and medical leave act see crs report 94388 family and medical leave by leslie w gladstone and crs issue brief 97017 the family and medical leave act proposed amendments by leslie w gladstone crs37 some additional aspects fact sheet accompanying the clinton proposal explained its implications emphasized are such concepts as flexibility employee choice and worker protection109 the fact sheet appears to use the term flextime when it would seem to have meant comp time the concepts are not necessarily interchangeable110 however in dealing with the need for workplace flexibility neither the fact sheet nor the president in his transmittal statement takes note of the flexibility already part of the flsa the administration documents proclaim under the presidents proposal employees choose but in practice the clinton proposal like hr 2391 puts initial decisions about comp time with the employer it takes note of the distinction between workers employed under collective bargaining agreement and those in nonunion work setting as does hr 2391 and requires that requests for participation in comp time program be voluntary though structured somewhat differently the clinton proposal assures worker freedom from abuse pressure to participate to draw down accrued time etc as would the amended ballenger proposal of the 104th congress and later of the 105th congress however the clinton proposal explicitly assigns to dol regulatory responsibility and other options ie designating vulnerable classes to degree exceeding that of hr 2391 finally the clinton proposal incorporates language that assures the worker the right to utilize his banked comp time already earned unless it will cause substantial and grievous injury to the employers operations or unduly disrupt the operations of the employer again as in hr 2391 the concepts of substantial and unduly disrupt are left to the secretary of labor to define through the regulatory process overtime pay and comp time concerns in the 105th congress as preparations began for the 105th congress changes in overtime pay law remained an issue receiving top priority among emerging labor issues explained tim shorrock of the journal of commerce is republican bill designed to make the us workplace more flexible through the use of comp time thats flexibility not only good for employers observed sandra boyd of the industryoriented labor policy association its good for the bottom line peggy taylor of the aflcio was less enthusiastic suggesting in shorrocks summary that the initiatives could 109 daily labor report october 10 1996 pp 1e6 in addition to the text of the clinton proposal the statement from president clinton in transmitting the package section bysection analysis and fact sheet were reprinted 110 such concepts are still evolving and their precise definitions may not yet be entirely set however in general flextime refers to scheduling of work within set period normally the 40hour workweek this could include such matters as arrival and departure times core hours for work etc comp time the concept that seems to apply here deals with the substitution of timeoff for overtime pay outside of traditional 40hour workweek crs38 gut the 40hour week and make workers vulnerable to pressures from employers to take time off instead of overtime pay111 representative goodling chair of the full committee on education and the workforce circulated dear colleague letter dated december 17 1996 inviting members to become cosponsors of new comp time legislation that will be the same as hr 2391 as passed by the house on

friendly legislation to allow the use of comp time in place of overtime pay meanwhile similar interest was rising in the senate114 by late january the wall street journal was anticipating that republicans and business groups will be taking their fight directly to the public which survey by the probusiness labor policy association suggests supports the concept of flexibility overwhelmingly 115 in the house the issue reappeared as hr 1 ballenger in the senate as s 4 ashcroft meanwhile the administration was considering alternative approaches to workhours flexibility generally within the context of the family and medical leave act adopted early in the 104th congress the new ballenger bill on january 7 1997 representative ballenger introduced new comp time bill the working families flexibility act hr 1116 the measure was referred to the subcommittee on workforce protections on february 5 with mr ballenger as chair the subcommittee conducted hearings on the proposal on march 5

lines and reflected the differences between the two parties over the gopsponsored legislation that is backed by business groups and opposed by organized labor crs39 hr 1 as reported under date of march 12 1997 house report 10521 was filed hr 1 as reported differed in some respects from hr 2391 of the 104th congress the earlier legislation had proposed restructuring section 7o of the act which now deals only with wagehour coverage for state and local government workers to expand its provisions in modified form to the private sector workforce in hr 1 of the 105th congress section 7o was left unchanged and new section 7r was added to flsa that dealt specifically with private sector workplaces the wording of the new bill varied somewhat from though was largely the same and roughly parallel to that of hr 2391 the new bill like its predecessor would allow employers to provide at their initiative the option of comp time in lieu of monetary overtime compensation at the rate of 1and12hours of comp time for each hour of overtime worked118 where collective bargaining agreement was in place or where representative of the workers had been formally recognized an employer would have had to work within that context in shaping comp time program where there was negotiated contract and recognized worker representative the employer and the individual employee would allowed to enter into an agreement or understanding with respect to comp time the bill would have required that such agreement be arrived at before the performance of the work b that it be entered into knowingly and voluntarily by such employee and c that it is not condition of employment the agreement was also to have been affirmed by written or otherwise verifiable record119 the employer would not allowed directly or indirectly to intimidate threaten or coerce or attempt to intimidate threaten or coerce any employee with respect to the comp time option120 employees would not have been allowed to accrue more than 240 hours of comp time if unused such hours would need to be cashedout at the end of designated 12month period an employer would have been permitted upon 30 days notice to the employee cashout all hours banked in excess of 80 an employer could also have discontinued the comp time option after giving 30 days notice to the employee the employee could have rescinded his agreement to participate in the comp time program giving written notice at any time within 30 days thereafter the employee would have been given monetary compensation for his banked hours hr 1 made clear that an employee who terminated his employment voluntarily or involuntarily would have been paid for unused comp time 118 the worker would not have right to comp time unless program under the new section 7r is instituted by the employer nor in the absence of collectively bargained agreement would the worker have right to be consulted concerning the structure of the option its scope and the restraints imposed upon its utilization 119 the verifiability of the agreement could be as much in the interest of an employer as that of worker where liability and litigation are possible where industries are thinly capitalized or where business failures are frequent written policy and written agreement could be of special value to the worker 120 the definition of coercion etc within the context of public sector employment where there are civil service and other regulations may not be problem its definition in the private sector where economic pressure the need for employment could be subtle form of coercion may be more difficult crs40 comp time under hr 1 was to be used upon request by worker within reasonable period after making the request when it does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer language carried over from the housepassed bill of the 104th congress hr 1 as reported had language dealing with penalties and posting requirements house report 10521 noted that the comp time agreement had to be mutual between the employer and employee if either does not so agree then the overtime pay must be in the form of cash compensation121 further it explained hr 1 does not require that the same agreement be entered with every employee or that the employer agree to offer compensatory time to all employees122 the report took note of concerns voiced by critics of the legislation including the assertion that low wage workers might be especially vulnerable to exploitation were private sector comp time option instituted it suggested that the definition of low wage might be somewhat ambiguous and that many workers who might be classified as low wage workers might be benefitted from the comp time option some of the most forceful and compelling testimony in support of allowing workers the option of paid compensatory time was given by low wage worker therefore the report noted the committee sees reason to deny certain employees the option of compensatory time based solely upon their level of income or their occupation123 the report explained as the committees intent that an employee who has accrued compensatory time may generally use the time whenever he or she so desires the only limitations which the bill puts on the use of compensatory time it stated is that the employees request to use compensatory time be made reasonable time in advance of using it and that the employer may deny the employees request if the employees use of the compensatory time would unduly disrupt the employers operations the report emphasized that interpretation of unduly disrupt should follow the standard set forth by the department of labor and litigated through the courts for state and local government workers it concluded the employers right to deny compensatory time off under hr 1 is very limited but the employer must have some ability to maintain the operations of the business it added if that is not recognized in the law then employer will ever offer compensatory time as an option124 121 us congress house committee on education and the workforce working families flexibility act of 1997 report to accompany h r 1 house report 10521 105th cong 1st sess washington

vote to report hr 1 followed party lines the democratic members filed dissenting report in our view they began the inevitable consequence of enactment of hr 1 would be to require employees to work longer hours for less pay they charged that the legislation though presented as family friendly has been deceptively titled and actually diminishes the flexibility of working families they added this is bill about employer flexibility and power plain and simple and they pointed out that the legislation was opposed by organized labor and by womens groups such as the womens legal defense fund the american nurses association and business and professional women usa though they did not suggest that all or even majority of employers would violate the rights of workers under hr 1 they argued federal labor law must protect employees indeed even lawabiding employers from the illegal and ill begotten gain of unconscionable employers in the real world they stated most employees lack the bargaining position wherewithal and nerve to insist that their employers respect employee needs and rights126 where the majority stressed the need for mutual agreement with respect to comp time the minority stated that many employees are reluctant or fearful to buck their employers wishes regarding their terms and conditions of employment this is especially true they added for some 85 of the workforce who do not have the protections of collective bargaining agreements the minority argued that the legislation gives the employer complete discretion over whether to offer overtime at all the option of offering or denying it to any group or groups of employees and the authority to withdraw the comp time plan at any time127 the minority suggested that there are major workplace differences between the public and private sectors and that in effect statute tailored to the needs of state and local government workers could not arbitrarily be applied to the private sector the majority cites various cases and regulations applicable to the public sector standard for taking leave time these precedents and regulations will not be controlling to the comp time provisions of the bill further public sector employers operate in substantially different setting than private sector employers public sector employers dont face the business cycles and competitive economic pressure of private sector employers further public sector employees are generally organized and have substantial procedural protections to protect against arbitrary and capricious employer actions128 125 house report

retention reporting etc these would be expected to vary from those governing the public sector the minority argued that the worker protections built into the legislation were inadequate that even under current law wage and hour standards were difficult to enforce and violations were frequent hr 1 will engender more overtime violations the proposed legislation the minority held increases the need for resources for enforcement and compliance on the part of the department of labor during committee markup the minority had offered series of proposals that would putatively have strengthened worker protection under hr 1 and more extensive body of remedies with respect to violations they were rejected on series of largely partyline votes129 finally the minority raised series of objections with respect to manipulation of the workweek to the detriment of the employee the treatment of potentially vulnerable employees under the proposed legislation the practical relationship of comp time to other paid leave the status of comp time under bankruptcy or informal cessation of business and other concerns they also noted concerns voiced by the clinton administration with respect to h r 1130 floor debate and house passage the comp time legislation hr 1 was called up in the house on march 19 1997 the arguments pro and in general terms followed those of the 104th congress representative pryce for example opened by charging that opponents of the legislation have chosen to put politics above sound policy and argued that it is time we stopped automatically thinking of employeremployee relations in such adversarial terms with hr 1 she affirmed labor and management can work together to meet each others needs at least the choice will be theirs not washingtons 131 conversely representative moakley argued that the legislation helps the big people but it does not do much for the ordinary worker he asserted that the legislation would leave workers vulnerable and often without protection in the real world if your boss tells you to take time off instead of getting extra pay you either do what you are told or you start packing your gear132 proponents of the legislation spoke in terms of an option for flexibility of more freedom for workers critics saw little option for workers and viewed the legislation rather as yet another attack on americas workers133 disagreement was voiced about the provisions of the legislation the motivation behind them and the impact they would have in the real world of the workplace 129 house report 10521 p 3940 2530 130

consideration of hr 1 was approved by vote of 229 ayes to 195 nays134 it provided for series of floor amendments the goodling amendments as soon as the house commenced consideration of the bill representative goodling chair of the full committee offered two amendments bloc the first goodling amendment read as follows employee may receive or agree to receive compensatory time off under this subsection unless the employee has worked at least 1000 hours for the employees employer during period of continuous employment with the employer in the 12 month period before the date of agreement or receipt of compensatory time off the second goodling amendment reduced the number of hours of comp time that an employee could accrue from 240 hours to 160 hours135 representative clay the ranking minority member of the full committee while speaking against hr 1 per agreed to accept the goodling amendment bloc because it provides very minor improvements in the underlying bill136 representative petri pointed to the long debate with respect to construction workers and other seasonal employees and their coverage under hr 1 with the goodling amendments he noted it is unlikely these workers will ever be able to use comptime but he observed making comptime an option in industries where the relationship between the employer and the employee is transitory may in fact make it easier for unscrupulous employers to avoid paying overtime wages the amendments he suggested strengthened the worker protections afforded by the legislation by assuring that an employee has substantial relationship with an employer before the option of earning paid compensatory time in lieu of overtime137 the concepts raised in the goodling amendments did not appear to have been dealt with during hearings on the legislation the impact they might have upon compliance activity on the part of the department of labor was not addressed nor was the potential complexity of requirements that dol would need to devise for implementation the goodling amendments were approved on vote of 408 ayes to 19 nays138 the boyd amendment third amendment was offered by representative boyd it provided that the working families flexibility act of 1997 hr 1 would automatically terminate 5 years after the date of the enactment by putting in place 5year sunset provision the amendment ensures future congressional review of this act mr boyd affirmed several members endorsed the amendment as reasonable method through which to try out the option and then assess its impact representative clay voiced

the legislation mr clay agreed that he would accept the amendment139 unlike the clinton administration proposal discussed above the boyd amendment made provision for specific report to the congress by the secretary on the utilization and impact of comp time the house approved the boyd amendment by vote of 390 ayes to 36 nays140 the owens amendment concerns had been raised as to whether low wage workers generally nonunion would have true freedom of choice with respect to the proposed comp time option representative owens therefore proposed exempting from the option workers who earn less that 25 times the minimum wage we can have bill which allows the upper middle class people who want this to have it and at the same time lets us exempt threequarters of the work force who earn 10 or less he noted that with adoption of the boyd amendment congress would need to return to the issue in 5 years and at that time could expand the option if it is found to work satisfactorily 141 representative ballenger objected that the owens amendment would exempt everyone who made less than about 23000 from the option he questioned why such workers should be barred by the law from making this choice mr ballenger added the owens amendment is premised on the argument that lower income workers are inevitably at the mercy of their employers and so cannot make free and voluntary choice about compensatory time representative mink in support of the exclusion argued that the owens amendment was trying to make it possible for the low wage worker not to be put under this pressure of having to work overtime for compensation at all for that promise of time off sometime in the future mrs mink argued there is absolutely nothing in hr 1 which gives the employee the choice the free choice or the decision to take this time when they need it meanwhile representative greenwood termed the owens amendment insulting patronizing and discriminating view generally concurred in by representative goodling142 after further debate the owens amendment was defeated by vote of 182 ayes to 237 nays143 the miller calif amendment final amendment to hr 1 was offered by representative miller of california the miller amendment provided substitute for hr 1 striking all after the enacting clause and inserting wholly new text its provisions were quite different from the ballenger proposal it set limit of 80 hours of comp time that could be earned through any 12 month period it provided variety of technical internal safeguards more specific reporting stronger explicit 139

democrats in opposition republicans in favor see senate report 10511 april 2 1997 provisions of the ashcroft bill s 4 was comprehensive covering areas not dealt with in hr 1 it set forth several workhours options and in addition the bill dealt with certain other aspects of existing law148 compensatory time off like hr 1 s 4 began by adding new subsection r to section 7 of the flsa its provisions were similar to those of hr 1 establishing the same general options and requirements 144 congressional record march 19 1997 pp h1154h1155 145 congressional record march 19 1997 pp

requirements 148 the text of s 4 appears in the congressional record january 21 1997 pp s222 s224 crs46 biweekly work programs under s 4 an employer at hisher initiative would have been allowed to establish 2week 80hour work period during which without incurring an overtime penalty an employer could schedule work in any manner 2 weeks of 40 hours each 60 hours in one week and 20 hours in the other etc the employer would not have been required to pay overtime rates timeandahalf until 80 hours had been worked in 2 calendar weeks for hours worked in excess of 80 in 2week period worker would have been compensated either in cash or in paid comp time each at not less than timeandahalf basis flexible credit hour program an employer would have been to establish at his initiative but in conformity with collective bargaining agreement where there is trade union presence flexible credit hour program once the program had been established the employee would then have been allowed to elect to participate where worker chose to participate in flexible credit hour program he and his employer would then jointly designate hours for the employee to work that are in excess of the basic work requirement 149 of the employee so that the employee can accumulate flexible credit hours to reduce the hours worked in week or day subsequent to the day on which the flexible credit hours are worked compensation for flexible credit hours would have been on straight time basis an employee would not have been allowed to accumulate more than 50 flexible credit hours and when an employee is longer subject to such program he would have been paid for his accumulated credit hours up to 50 at straight time rate in any event accumulated credit hours would have been cashed out not later than at the end of each 12month period this could have allowed worker significantly increased measure of workhours flexibility but it arguably could have been subject to abuse particularly if by prior mutual consent overtime hours were to have been renamed flexible credit hours and compensated for at straight time rate rather than at timeandahalf the bill stated that employee may be required to participate in the flexible credit hour program and as in the comp time section employers may not directly or indirectly intimidate threaten or coerce employees with respect to the credit hours option where there was valid collective bargaining agreement an employee may only be required to participate in such program in accordance with the agreement since the flexible credit hours initiative broke new ground and had it been adopted it would have made the option available in hundreds of thousands of very different work situations implementation issues would likely have arisen the employer would have been allowed to establish the credit hours program and under the provisions of the legislation would seem to have been allowed to establish its operational procedures it would have been program under which the employer and the employee jointly designate hours to be worked for credit in 149 it appears that the basic work requirement ones preovertime work period would be 40 hours or if participating in biweekly work program 80 hours there would appear to be reason why it could not be the latter crs47 practice might designation consent form have been provided to worker when hired or would such designation have been recurring procedure being renewed each time flexible credit hours were to be worked in s 4 as introduced there had been requirement for written agreement between the worker and his employer with respect to credit hours in the bill as reported provision for written or otherwise verifiable statement that is made kept and preserved had been added the result of the dewine amendment in committee the definition of jointly designate could have been significant it could potentially mean different things depending upon the culture of specific workplaces would such designation operate on an ad hoc basis each time need arose with specific number of hours specified or could worker and his employer jointly designate willingness to have the employee work overtime hours flexible credit hours at the discretion of the employer whenever business necessity might require such hours to be compensated for on straight time basis under the comp time proposal it was provided that worker or an employer could terminate the program at will at any time when worker requested it with 30 days notice when terminated by an employer while comparable provision appeared to apply to the credit hours program of s 4 as introduced the dewine committee amendment made clear that the two programs in that respect would have been basically subject to the same standard there was an annual cashout requirement for the credit hours program it is not clear that monetary compensation for banked hours would necessarily have been paid at any time before the close of 12month period though credit hours for leave purposes would have been utilized in accordance with the agreement between employer and employee were an employee to withdraw from the program and request in writing the conversion of his banked credit hours to payment in cash the employer would have been obligated to provide monetary compensatory to the employee within 30 days flexibility was the expressed intent of the legislative package while credit hours were to be cashedout not later than at the end of each 12month period there would appear to have been restriction against more frequent cashingout of credit hours should it suit the interests of the parties150 under 150 by removing the overtime pay requirement for flexible credit hours the arrangement would seem to favor the employer by reducing employment costs the employee might be affected in several ways where worker has significant and continuing need for workhours flexibility where an employer may have overtime work that would allow for accrual of comp time trading work and hours off on oneforone basis could be in the interest of the worker allowing the worker to deal with family responsibilities without sacrificing earnings but the system could also have problematic aspects even where opting for credit hours might not seem to be in workers immediate interest ie where credit hours might become surrogate for regular overtime circumstances might lead worker to accept that arrangement first the worker may not fully understand the terms of the option or the alternatives especially so were he new labor market entrant or unschooled in labor management practice second where there is high level of competition for available employment worker might agree to the designation of overtime hours as credit hours out of continued crs48 the flexible credit hours option worker could move in and out of the program with some regularity thus for example worker could enter the credit hours program at the beginning of each pay period or at intermittent periods accumulate up to 50 credit hours actually overtime hours at straight time and then leave the program if he were paid for his accrued credit hours at the close of each period of participation it appeared that he could reenter the program and begin accruing new credit hours continuing the process in cyclical fashion as s 4 moved through the legislative process most attention seemed to focus upon the question of comp time whereas the flexible credit hours component of the measure could have been in practice of equal significance especially in small establishment with collegial culture and in the absence of abuse it could have provided for worker flexibility and employer flexibility at the same time but the use of flexible credit hours could have substantially expanded the traditional 40hour workweek or 80hour biweekly work period and could have done so at straight time wage an employer with the employees consent might effectively have circumvented the overtime pay requirements of the flsa paying straight time flexible credit hours for what previously were classified as overtime hours in the comp time legislation both hr 1 and s 4 it was provided that an employee might accrue not more than 240 hours of compensatory time while the concept of accrue might mean that not more than 240 hours of comp time could be earned during the course of 12month period it could also be ceiling or restraint against there being more than 240 hours of comp time in workers account at any given moment151 with respect to flexible credit hours the term used in s 4 was accumulate since there appeared to be prohibition against an employee participating in more than one program at time it appeared that an employer were the employee to agree to it could have scheduled an 80hour biweekly work period at straight time adding to that credit hours at straight time offer comp time option in addition and then cashout the accumulated hours the result couldhave been rolling work period that could in its effect largely have abridged the overtime pay requirements imposed by the flsa this issue might have been addressed in implementing regulations if the 40hour workweek still is considered to be socially and economically desirable norm the use of comp time and flexible credit hours could cause workers annual work time far to exceed that standard salary practices relating to exempt employees as currently administered the pay of salaried worker may not be diminished docked when he or she is absent from work for partial day if such docking takes place senator jeffords explained 150 continued fear of offending the employer ie in order to secure or to retain employment third it appears that an employer could make overtime work available solely on credit hour basis so that where worker needed the income he might view the straight time wage of credit hours as better than overtime work at all 151 the department of labor advises that the latter interpretation applies where state and local governments are concerned under section 7o of the act crs49 in statement supportive of s 4 all the salaried employees of the firm or agency may lose their exempt status under the flsa thus he stated policy that allows for partial day of unpaid leave can convert an exempt worker to nonexempt one who is then owed overtime even if the worker has sixfigure income and is employed at the highest levels of the company152 this issue relates only to salariedexempt workers153 since they are executive administrative or professional they may be called upon to work extra hours beyond fixed schedule to complete project or if not called upon to do so may simply decide to do so because they are responsible and professional when salaried employee works extra hours the employer public or private accepts that as the normal course for salaried employee the work must be completed however should that same employee need few hours away from his work at some point his employer may see injustice in docking the workers pay but there is an obvious question of equity involved it is hard to argue in both directions at the same time ie that the employee is overtime pay exempt as salaried when he works extra hours but an hourly and dockable employee when he absents himself for brief period on the other hand some employers point out that salaried workers are normally highly paid and have argued that they dont need the protection of the overtime pay requirements of the flsa the issue has been variously before the courts for number of years and legislation dealing with this matter has been introduced in several congresses154 by adding to the flsa new section 13m s 4 would have redefined the conditions for overtime pay exemption as salaried workers under section 13a1 of the act s 4 read the fact that the employee is subject to deductions in compensation for i absences of the employee from employment of less than full workday or ii absences of the employee from employment of less than full pay period shall not be considered in making such determination exempt status the bill added other clarifying language apparently intended to meet current objections and to eliminate the need for further litigation committee action on s 4 introduced on january 21 1997 s 4 was referred to the subcommittee on employment and training chaired by senator dewine hearings on the bill were held on february 4 and on february 13155 full committee 152 congressional record january 21 1997 p s225 153 section 13a1 of the flsa exempts both from the

employees the salary basis test issue by charles ciccone 155 summary of the hearings appears in crs report 97532 federal regulation of continued crs50 markup followed senator dewine proposed an amendment restructuring the measure without it would seem altering its content the dewine amendment was approved on straight partyline vote republicans in favor democrats in opposition the democrats then proposed seven amendments to the legislation each defeated on straight partyline votes156 the committee subsequently voted to report s 4 once again the vote followed party lines republicans in support democrats in opposition in senate report 10511 filed on april 2 1997 opinion was sharply divided the republican majority emphasized the need for workhours flexibility in order to meet the needs of the workforce of the 1990s s 4 provides men and women working in the private sector the opportunity to voluntarily choose compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay as well as to voluntarily participate in biweekly and flexible credit hour programs the report commenced adding this legislation will enable americans to participate in flexible work schedules so that they can better cope with the challenges of the 21st century157 the majority report noted that many of todays work force view certain of the flsas provisions as harmful rather than helpful and observed flexible work schedules would give employees more control over their lives by giving them better tool to balance their family and work obligations158 an extended dissenting comment reviewed the various reservations that critics of the comp timeflexible workhours legislation had voiced through two congresses there is real employee choice it argued and guarantee that comp time will be voluntary159 further the minority statement contended that there was right to use comp time when employees need it160 it pointed to the flexibility of current law noting if employers want to provide familyfriendly work schedules 155 continued working hours consideration of the issues by william g whittaker pp 4245 and 49 53 156 amendments proposed by democratic senators in brief included language in the following areas to link the comp time legislation with the family and medical leave act to expand coverage of the family and medical leave act to mandate unpaid leave for parental involvement in their childrens school activities to exclude parttime seasonal and temporary employees and to exempt employers in the garment business from participation in the s 4 options to prohibit discrimination in the assignment of overtime work where employees prefer cash wages to comp time and to deal with related concerns 157 us congress committee on labor and human resources family

acting secretary metzler affirmed must effectively and satisfactorily address three fundamental principles real choice for employees real protection against employee abuse and preservation of basic worker rights including the 40hour workweek162 floor action in the senate senate floor debate on s 4 commenced on may 1 1997 continuing intermittently into june as other issues were called up the arguments pro and largely followed those presented during hearings and where comp time was concerned in the floor debates in the house debating the issues senator jeffords chair of the full committee commenced discussion of s 4 by suggesting that there is need for workplace flexibility affirming that the legislation would give employees the opportunity to choose paid time off instead of cash compensation for overtime hours worked and noting that employees would be free to work out more flexible schedules with their employers if it suits their needs the senator noted that the legislation had early met with opposition which he suggested stems from the political positions of big labor unions rather than the needs of working men and women he dismissed concerns voiced by opponents of s 4 as misplaced although the legislation had been being opposed by number of womens organizations some of whom were represented at the various hearings senator jeffords viewed the measure as womans issue noting the increased participation of women in the workforce during recent years he concluded that s 4 represented true flexibility for workers and not the heavy hand of the employer163 161 senate

karen nussbaum director working womens department aflcio testified against the workhours legislation as did helen norton and donna lenhoff both of the womens legal defense fund testifying in support of workhours legislation was diana furchtgottroth member of the independent womens forum their testimony is summarized in crs report 97532 cited above see also letter to senator lott may 30 1997 in

womens law center and the womens legal defense fund the letter appears in the congressional record june 2 1997 p s5164p crs52 conversely senator kennedy argued that s 4 was fatally flawed the bill he noted eliminates the guarantee of pay for overtime work for 65 million employees and responds to an appeal from the national federation of independent business that small businesses cant afford to pay overtime further he argued it would have the effect of abolishing the 40hour workweek as national standard employers could require employees to work up to 80 hours in week without receiving overtime pay the bill he contended provides employee choice since the employer chooses who works overtime and when an employee can use comptime he pointed to potential for discrimination in that the employer can assign all overtime work to employees who will accept comptime instead of overtime pay ultimately he observed the employer is free to deny the request of an employee for use of comptime worker choice he suggested is not the motivation behind the proposal instead it is designed to help employers cut workers wages164 senator wellstone pointing to the flexibility of current law disputed the need for comp time legislation he stated right now employers can give their employees this flexibility if they so desire the problem is lot of employers do not do that but it has nothing to do with the basic principle of the 40hour week and the principle that if an employee works overtime he or she should get time and half pay this legislation undercuts that senator wellstone contended that most people in the country will be opposed to it s 4 when they learn all the provisions in the legislation and he concluded the issue with s 4 was neither choice nor flexibility what really is at issue here is you essentially overturn portions of the fair labor standards act you overturn the 40 hour week165 floor debate was sharply divided senator dewine acknowledged that the issues raised by critics of s 4 are going to be points of contention as this debate continues over the next few weeks but he dismissed them as irrelevant to the bill i thought we passed out of committee senator dewine stressed comp time as womans issue he emphasized worker choice flexibility and the need to bring labor standards laws into conformity with the world of work of the 21st century referring to existing wagehour legislation as antiquated he affirmed this is what this bill does it sweeps away some of these old laws that prohibit workers from doing what they want to do he argued that the measure would reduce some of the stress on americas working families by making the american workplace more family friendly166 senator hutchison of texas reiterated arguments in support of s 4 concluding my only surprise is that we did not update this antiquated labor law earlier167 164 congressional record may 1 1997 pp s3885s3886 165 congressional record may 1 1997 pp s3886s3887 166 congressional record may

may 12168 more extended debate commenced on may 13 supporters of the legislation each day reaffirmed their commitment to family friendliness those critical of the legislation did also but senator kennedy stated the concern that many of us have is that it really gives the whip hand so to speak to the employers he added it does appear to many of us that this is really subterfuge to permit employers to avoid paying overtime he recalled that amendments had been offered in committee that would have provided for worker choice but that the amendments were rejected along straight party lines the real issue with respect to comp time the senator suggested is who is going to make the decision169 senator ashcroft presented different perspective he found it outrageous that congress through wagehour legislation should have deprived the private sector hourly workers of this country of the right to cooperate with your their employers to make decisions about time off and about flexible working arrangements170 and he declared himself stunned when those organizations which purport to be helping american workers began running television ads against this legislation these ads are lie senator ashcroft affirmed i think it is shameful that the aflcio would seek to impair the ability of hourly workers in this country to have the benefit his constituents he noted resented the fact that the labor lobby in washington had abandoned their traditional promoting of workers interests171 once again the senator reviewed the provisions of the proposed legislation affirming that the interests of workers are adequately protected therein recalling that salaried employees and public sector employees are able to avail themselves of flexible work scheduling where workers and employers concur he concluded flexible working arrangements would make it possible for people to meet the needs of their families without taking pay cut172 the debate continued at length senator harkin presented an analysis of what he suggested was the need for increased worker safeguards in the legislation reviewing amending language proposed by democratic senators during committee markup and explaining the workplace implications of the various provisions of s 168 congressional record may 12 1997 pp s4291s4293 169 congressional record may 13 1997 p s4335 170 congressional record may 13 1997 p s4339 171 congressional record may 13 1997 pp 3940 senator ashcroft read into the record the text of one antis4 ad big business is moving to gut law protecting our right to overtime pay if they win employers could pay workers with time off instead of money he declared this language to be simply false and pointed out that the employer would not have unilateral right in scheduling workhours under s 4 that it takes request by the employee in order for that to happen as the debate progressed senator wellstone took note of the stated concern about the aflcio ads this is the first time i heard what those ads have to say he stated reading their text into the record as the senator from missouri had done but senator wellstone reached different conclusion of the statement in the ads he declared that is true that is absolutely true ibid p s4345 172 congressional record may 13 1997 p s4342 crs54 4173 senator harkin took note of senator ashcrofts concern that certain interests are ganging up to defeat s 4 he read into the record list of organizations he identified as opposed to measure stating the fact remains mr president that every group that represents lowincome workers is opposed to this bill those who understand what real life is about and who understand what these lowincome workers have to go through they are opposed to this bill with respect to the bottom line he observed that this proposal before us appears to be neither worker friendly nor family friendly and the result of this enactment would require employees to work longer hours for less pay174 senator harkin argued that s 4 is another one of the very bad ideas that periodically come up through the senate it sounds good whats it called the family friendly workplace act ridiculous nothing could be farther from the truth175 senator wellstone suggested that two elements were essential for making the legislation what its proponents have argued that it is family friendly first it must be truly voluntary second employees must really get to use their accumulated comptime when they want and need to use it s 4 he stated fails both tests176 he added s 4 as written is familyunfriendly it is thinly disguised effort to reduce pay and to help employers avoid paying overtime that is not just rhetoric that is the bill i wonder how many families will consider this bill to represent friendly gesture when we strip it of its happyface packaging and expose it for what it is an effort to reduce pay and to help employers avoid paying overtime he continued plenty of employers do try to avoid paying overtime already under current law and far too many succeed with respect to s 4 he concluded we dont need to provide encouragement to cut more pay and avoid paying more overtime177 senator cochran protested that todays work rules are too inflexible and this legislation s 4 changes that to meet the needs of todays working families he urged support for giving working families the opportunity to balance their work and family obligations by supporting this legislation178 senator hutchison of texas concurred with s 4 she argued we are trying to bring our labor laws into the 21st century to reflect the changing face of working america and to meet the growing 173 congressional record may 13 1997 pp s4342s4344 174 congressional record may 13 1997 p s4344 senator harkin identified the following groups as being among those opposed to s 4 the league of women voters american association of university women national council of senior citizens the naacp the national council of raza the disability rights education and defense fund the union of american hebrew congregations the southern christian leadership conference and the national council of churches 175 congressional record may 13 1997 p s4345 176

she stressed its potential impact for women we realize that twothirds of the working women in this country have schoolage children and that what they need most is little relief from the stress caused by being both the provider at work and the caretaker at home179 concerning the issue of choice senator hutchison illustrated both sides of the issue pointing to the case of working mother who would not be able to attend special school event because federal law wont allow to do it she affirmed that this restraint would be changed by s 4180 but under s 4 senator hutchison pointed out workers would have absolute right of choice with respect to workhours flexibility she observed neither the employee or the employer has the ability to dictate whether the other chooses to participate in comptime or flextime option either side can say thank you if the employer says on friday i need you to work 2 extra hours today the employee then has the right to say thats fine and i will take that in overtime pay or thats fine and i would like to bank that at timeandahalf rate to take later on as free time likewise if an employee goes to the employer and says i would like to work 2 overtime hours this friday and take those off with pay next monday the employer has the right to say im sorry but it doesnt work into the schedule this week thus under s 4 the soccer mom unexpectedly confronted with the need to attend childs friday afternoon game or to use few banked hours for other purposes could have potentially an inflexible situation senator hutchison emphasized that even under s 4 the employee could not simply walk into an employers office and demand the right to draw down comp time that afternoon noting the qualification of reasonable notice to the employer and that an absence does not unduly disrupt the operations of the business she explained if the standard were otherwise mr president scant few employers would even want to offer comptime or flextime for fear that it might shut down their business if too many employees left at some critical time for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to argue that employees should have the absolute unfettered right to take time off whenever they choose for other than serious health or family needs is disingenuous they know that doing so is unreasonable and would prevent workers from having any flexibility because most employers would not be able to offer comptime or flextime program 181 179 congressional record may 13 1997 p s4348 180 congressional record may 13 1997 p s4348 181 congressional record may 13 1997 pp s4348s4349 later as discussion of employee choice continued senator hutchison affirmed of course the employer is running the business many times it is the small business man or woman that has gone out and borrowed the money that works 80 hours week trying to make it go to contribute to our economy it is not easy being in business in america with all of the taxes and regulations and litigation that person in business must face so of course they are running the operation congressional record may 15 1997 p s4508 crs56 however necessary the reasonable notice and does not unduly disrupt provisions may have been some might argue that they would not necessarily have helped the working mother in all situations ie the freedom of worker on friday afternoon to use comptime for an unexpected or unplannedfor event182 senator hutchison however was not especially concerned as to whether the employer or the employee have the upper hand legally speaking but rather that they work together she affirmed the only reason an employee would want to take comptime or flextime is so that they can restore some measure of control and sanity to their workweek the only reason an employer would want to offer comptime or flextime is so that his or her employees will be more engaged fulfilled and ultimately more productive at their jobs the senator observed this bill truly will create millions of winwin arrangements throughout this country where both employer and employee walk away happy183 altering the reported legislation debate on s 4 would continue intermittently into early june with arguments pro and being reiterated sometimes as ad hominem statements on other occasions by way of rebuttal to the assertions of other speakers 184 through the weeks during which the measure was before the senate numerous refinements were proposed with respect to the legislation on may 13 at the close of the first full debate on s 4 senator dewine rose to explain certain modifications under committee substitute among them were the following first the concept of union recognition was expanded to include all employees who are members of unions and thus to allow them to secure flexibility through their collective bargaining agreements second critics of the legislation had suggested that certain groups of workers eg parttime seasonal and temporary workers those in the garment industry and those in certain other industries that the secretary of labor might determine to be especially vulnerable to exploitation should be excluded from participation in the options of s 4 senator dewine in the 182 we hear what if you want friday off senator kennedy observed he then proceeded to explain the various flexible options already part of the flsa noting that according to bls statistics only 10 percent of hourly employees use the flexible schedules and he explained the current law offers host of family friendly flexible schedules today yet few employers provide them senator kennedy concluded working mother may want particular day off so that she can accompany her child to school event or doctors appointment nothing in this legislation requires the employer to give her the day off she requests the employer decides when it is convenient for her to use her accrued comptime there is freedom of choice for workers congressional record may 13 1997 p s4337s4338 183 congressional

offer flexible work option the employee must work for the employer for 12 months and 1250 hours within 1 year ensuring that stable relationship exists between the employer and the employee185 third senator dewine proposed strengthening of the penalty structure with respect to the s 4 options fourth the substitute would require the department of labor to revise its fair labor standards act posting requirements so employees are on notice of their rights and remedies under the biweekly and flextime options as well as the comptime option186 in addition numerous other potential amendments were filed these dealt with amendment of the family and medical leave act the definition of unduly disrupt the treatment of accrued hours within the context of bankruptcy proceeding application of flexible scheduling to the legislative branch under the congressional accountability act the liability and penalty structure of the proposed legislation creation of commission on workplace flexibility and more comprehensive substitute language187 vote on these amendments as on the legislation per was blocked by parliamentary processes voting on cloture and the immediate aftermath debate on flexible workhours legislation had been intermittent other issues being called up so that only part of the senates daily work schedule was devoted to the issue on may 13 after just over 2 hours of debate on the issue188 senator lott introduced cloture motion providing for vote to end debate189 the first cloture vote was taken on may 15 and failed the vote was 53 for cloture and 47 against an insufficient majority two republicans joined the democrats in opposition to cloture190 on june 2 senator lott again announced the filing of cloture motion191 while senator hutchison charged that the legislation was being filibustered on the other side senator kennedy noted that the senate had conducted more than 4 or 6 hours of debate on the issue192 recalling the first cloture vote senate kennedy 185 some may view this requirement as safeguarding workers against exploitation but it would also add further complication to be dealt with the dol in its compliance effort together with additional recordkeeping and certification burdens 186 congressional record may 13 1997 pp s4353s4354 187 the number of potential amendments is extensive and they are technical in nature they can be found in the

later june 4 the second cloture vote was taken again it failed to secure sufficient majority the vote was 51 yeas 47 nays three republicans joined the democrats in opposition194 postmortem discussion of the legislation occurred on june 9 1997 senator thomas argued that the reluctance of the white house to endorse the legislation was largely as result of the labor unions to which the white house is so sensitive recalling the experience of wyoming firm that had for many years sought to circumvent the overtime pay requirements of the flsa and citing various polls senator thomas concluded that concerns about s 4 are simply political opposition brought on by the opposition of the labor unions195 senator coverdell affirming that alteration of the 40hour workweek and the overtime pay requirements of the flsa were really in the interest of workers declared himself absolutely baffled by the opposition to the measure196 i do not understand why the democrats and labor unions are standing in the way of bringing choice and flexibility to the american workplace declared senator domenici he charged those opposing s 4 with misleading the people about this bill adding the democrats and for some reason the labor unions falsely claim that this bill will end the 40hour workweek197 after the second cloture vote on june 4 further consideration of s 4 largely ceased the bill died at the close of the 105th congress related initiatives of the 105th congress as discussion of workhours legislation had evolved there had been interest in adding language to expand the family and medical leave act of 1993 as discussed above such linkage was urged by president clinton late in the 104th congress senator dodd on january 22 1997 introduced s 183198 the dodd bill would have reduced the threshold for coverage under the family and medical leave act from firms with 50 employees as under current law to include firms with as few as 25 employees the bill was referred to the committee on labor and human resources senator murray on february 5 1997 introduced s 280199 the murray bill to be cited as the time for schools act of 1997 would have expanded expand the family and medical leave

to participate in literacy training under family literacy program the bill which was referred to the committee on labor and human resources defined the conditions under which such leave would have been be granted and the types of activities that would have justified such leave in the house representative clay proposed legislation hr 109 to amend the family and medical leave act the clay bill would have reduced the number of employees that would trigger coverage under the act to 25 coverage is now required for firms with 50 employees or more an eligible employee would have been entitled to 24 hours of leave during any 12month period beyond current requirements of the act for certain educationrelated and eldercare purposes200 conclusion through the years employee perspectives toward hours of work have changed depending upon the experience of individual workers general economic conditions and distance from the adverse conditions that obtained late in the 19th century and through the depression years some have pointed to positive developments in the area of labor standards and labormanagement relations during the middle 20th century and have suggested that it may be anachronistic for the rules governing the workplace to be rooted in 1930s experience and enactments201 conversely others believe that the basic protections and safeguards provided by laws such as the davisbacon and walshhealey acts the national labor relations act and the fair labor standards act are the bases of these postdepression era workplace improvements and that without them conditions would likely regress the federal employees flexible and compressed work schedules act 1978 was promoted and shaped by generation not directly affected by labor conditions of the late 19th and early 20th centuries the constituency for flexible and compressed work hours appears to have been younger and largely in the public sector among organized workers within the trade union movement there appears to have been difference of opinion public employee unions for the most part coming to favor the legislation the more traditional private sector unions expressing doubts and outright opposition202 since its enactment flexible and compressed scheduling in the federal sector appears to have gained support elsewhere in the public sector as well as in the private sector 200 congressional record january 9 1997 p h142 201 congressional record august 7 1995 p s11788 202 to the extent that public and private sector trade unionists held different views with respect to alternative work scheduling this may have been in some measure reflection of the differing workplace cultures of the private and public sectors crs60 the alternative scheduling option may have eroded support for the traditional 40hour workweek further erosion of the principle of federal workhours regulation may have occurred with amendment of the walshhealey act and the cwhssa in the mid1980s with the 1985 flsa amendments and establishment of comp time option for state and local government employment the traditional approach to working hours regulation was again altered given the use of flexible and compressed scheduling in the public sector it is increasingly being considered as an option for the private sector some argue however that public employment is different from private sector employment in terms of purposes management workplace culture and public oversight and control it has also been argued that labor standards compliance activity could be substantially more complicated were each employer free in effect to establish his own rules with respect to overtime deferral of income comp time etc but the precedent set in the public sector and the presentation of working hours deregulation as step toward family friendly workplace with the apparent popularity of alternative work scheduling among public employees may make it increasingly difficult to object to the establishment of similar policies for private employment as congress considers options for alternative workhours scheduling and comp time for the private sector number of questions are likely to be raised for example are alternative work schedules and modification of overtime pay standards in the interest of workers or are they an effort effectively to set aside the 40hour workweek and thus to nullify the overtime pay provisions of the flsa i really think this flexibility argument is about money suggested maria echaveste then administrator of dols wage and hour division speaking generally about the issue its about employers wanting to schedule people in such way so as to minimize their overtime203 senator ashcroft presented the issue from totally different perspective today parents face severe time shortages attempting to fit all work and family responsibilities into an inflexible and demanding workweek he observed adding that concerns voiced about private sector comp time option are nothing more than scaremongering204 alternative work scheduling may not be an option for all employers nor for all workers questions remain as to whether the pending legislation would create more worker friendly workplace labor is concerned that the initiative would hurt working families and that the real beneficiaries will be employers who will get more work for less money205 others believe that this approach will assist in establishing more family friendly workplace and represents new and more efficient way of working better for workers and better for employers as well
