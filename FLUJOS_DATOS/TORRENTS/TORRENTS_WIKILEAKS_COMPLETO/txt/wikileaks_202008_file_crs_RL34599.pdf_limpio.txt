answers for oral questions except for supplementary followup questions disc ussed below at 12 30 pm daily after the deadline for submitting oral questions for the session three days forward the questions for oral response are shuffled and drawn at random and are numbered on the order paper in the order drawn23 quota system determines the number of questions that are listed based on the

floor procedure for oral answers the time for oral questions fills about one hour each day monday through thursday when the house of commons is in session some cabinet minister s such as treasury or defence are scheduled for the entire hour while ministers fro m departments that typica lly receive fewer questions may appear for only part of the hour at noon each wednesday 30minute block of time

for the first question as determined by the order set in the shuffle the text of the question is printed in full in hansard the british equivalent of the congressional record therefore the inquiring member need only identify for the speaker the numbered question he is asking the minister typically responds w ith the prepared response drafted by the civil service the content and delivery of answers are governed similarly to questions if the speaker believes minister is not answering the question or using the time to make speech he may interrupt and urge the minister to finish27 after the answer is given supplementary questions are in order the speaker may use his discretion but will typically llow the original questioner one followup and then will alternate between majo rity and

response28 minister is not required to answer question nor to assign reason for so refusing29 ministers occasionally decline to answ er an oral question because formal government response to the question is fo rthcoming or because an answer would be detrimental to national security intere sts additionally substantial body of precedent exists in britain whereby the sp eaker rules questions on certain subjects out of order such as the royal family commercial information regarded as confidential personal information pertaining to civil servants and some matters relating to defense nd national security among other subjects30 urgent and topical questions oral questions not lis ted on the daily order paper may be asked in unusual circ umstances called urgent questions31 these are normally reserved for emergencies that do not permit the required notice the member seeking to ask an urgent questi on is required to consult the speaker who determines if the question warrants immediate reply if it does the speaker notifies the minister of the question it is not uncomm on for this notice to be as short as half hour before the question is asked32 in 2007 parliament be gan

the united states on the cspan network36 procedures for prime ministers questi ons differ somewhat from the procedures used for all other oral question periods or questions to the prime minister may be submitted as with ordinary oral questions to other ministers in practice however submitted questions to the prime minister typically ask only about his engagements for the day37 in this way supplementals may cover the full range of government policies this practice reflects the differing role of the prime minister from other ministers and allows for lively and unscripted debate bout timely policies38 the almost universal use of such open questions to the prime minister has both benefits and drawbacks proponents of the open question system argue that it makes it easy for the opposition to raise t opical issues and is the only existing mechanism by which to hold the prime mini ster publicly accountable for his policies and decisions critics of the system argue that open questions tend to create fiercely partisan debates and result in lack of depth in the scrutiny of the prime minister due to the questions jumping around from issue to issue39 the availability of the prime minister for frequent questioning is relatively new development in the british question time in the 19th century the prime minister was liable to questioning in th same proportion of th time as were his cabinet colleagues as courtesy to the elderly prime minister at the time william gladstone the prime ministers questions were put last in the order to permit him to come late to the daily

that separa time period for directing questions to the pr ime minister was established40 additional parliamentary models many if not most parliamentary mocracies provide for some form of question period in which mps can scrutinize the government41 the particulars of these question periods vary widely often custom and tradition are as important as institutional structure in determining how given question period functions in practice and how effectively it serves its stated goals canada the question period in the canadian house of commons is similar in structure to british question time but differs in several important respects most importantly there is requirement that oral questions be submitted in advance as matter of routine members of the canadi an parliament ask stions of ministers without advance notice42 thus all oral questions in theory operate under the same spontaneous context as prime ministers qu estions in britain in practice however some members may notify ministers in dvance of their questions and questions from the governing party rarely contain unpleasant surprises43 second important difference between th british and canadian systems is that all ministers appear at question period in canada each day unless prior obligation of official business prohibits their attendance44 members can thus question any minister on any day questions however are not directed toward specific ministers any individual minister may answer any posed question the nonpartisan speaker has authority to compel an individual mini ster to respond to particular question45 procedurally question pe riod in canada is structured to allow opposition parties the opportunity to question the government46 typically the lead opposition party is given the first three questions

britain must be s ubmitted the week prior to the desired date and only one topic is discussed each day thus adjournment debates do not allow for as much participation as adjournment procee dings in the canadian parliament 51 ibid pp 433437 52 ibid p 436 53 for example on feb 5 2008 question was put forth regarding what the government had done in response to corruption scandals af ter the question was asked hansard records opposition party members chanting oh oh the answering minister then recognized the heckling by saying i welcome the enthusiastic response of the opposition 42

and michael s whittington the canadian political system continuedvarious parties47 individual questions to be asked are organized by the parties the parties decide on daily basis which members will participate in the questioning and deliver list of names and suggested order of recognition to the speaker48 once the question period has begun the speaker calls on the members at his discretion and also may allow supplementary followup questions49 finally the canadian parliament augm ents question period with adjournment proceedings commonly called the late show50 any member who is dissatisfied with the answer to question posed during the afternoon question period may petition the speaker to discuss the matter further at the conclusion of the days legislative business usually 630 pm51 due to the large number of petitions received the speaker will designate up to fi ve for debate when directed member may then speak for up to four minutes on the topic with minister getting two minutes to respond at the conclusion of the 30minute period the house stands in adjournment52 the procedures and customs of cana dian question period tend to create an atmosphere of spontaneity and exc itement which occasionally includes parliamentary heckling normally recorded verbatim in the canadian hansard thereby serving as vehicle for many members opinions to be recorded53 canadian observer has commented what usually ensues is verbal fencing match with precocious opposition members sparring with ministers attemp ting to bait them into saying something that is an embarrassment to the government the minister must keep his cool and not allow himself to be goaded into saying anything more than is necessary to provide factual information or as is often the case to gracefully avoid the question54httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34599crs10 54 continued environment structure and process 2d ed toronto mcgrawhill ryerson 1976 pp 429430 55 ces franks the problem of debate and question period in

would require the selection of the strongest n to be heads of departments and will require them to be well equipped with the knowledge of their offices it will also require the strongest men to be the

for such sessions when requested by congress although presumably not as frequently or periodically as the secretary of state question hour period on wide range of issues will help restore dialogue and facilitate the flow of information between both branches on important matters of foreign policy and national security ground rules for this procedure would have to be determined between the two

procedur likewise historical proposals in the united states have suggested range of question period proce dures an assessment of the potential merits and drawbacks of an particular proposal for question period in congress will be influenced by the specific format selected similarly the effects of question period on the congressional policy process and c ongressionalexecutive relations might be somewhat pendent on the specific format two dimensions of particular importance that differentiate various question time formats are 1 which executive officials will answer questions and 2 whether questions and answers will be written oral or both legislators seeking to structure presidential question period that consists only of oral answers may need to consider different issues than legislators seeking structure that includes both written and oral questions to cabinet officials in practice presidential question period with oral answers only might resemble the prime ministers questions portion of question time in britain this would perhaps limit the time and resources expended while also generating high level of public interest and c overage of national issues mo re extensive question period that included cabinet officials or written answers however might allow for greater oversight and scrutiny of the executive branch and allow for member questions about more

parliamentary style question period in congress have advanced variety of arguments in its fa vor these arguments generally advance four themes that question period will improve the performance of executive departments by improving congressional oversight capabilities that question period will promote interbranch dialogue andrelations that question period will promot increased public knowledge and interest in government affairs and that question period will streng then the institutional position of congress within the government relative to the president improved oversight many supporters of question period for congress believe that question and answer period with cabinet officials could lead to improved accountability of the executive branch95 by serving as complement to the committee oversight system question period could allow members frequent direct public access to cabinetleve l officials some critics of the current system of committee oversight hearings believe that question period could help alleviate perceived problems of timeliness access and shared inte rests that currently exist question period could allow for routine timely oversight by the entire congressional membership wider oversight participation typically under the current committee based oversight system only committee members are allowed to question executive branch officials committee might permit members of congress who are not members of the committee to sit with it to question witnesses if they have recognized concern in the committees inqui ry but such instances are infrequent junior

encies they have been responsible for overseeing and thus longer perform their institutional roles as effectively as they might99 by allowing the full membership of congress to question cabinet officials proponents believe that such relationships between ag encies and committees would not preclude serious scrutiny of executive departments as representative derrick stated during hearing over the years there becomes somewh at incestuous relationship between the committees of jurisdiction and the areas they oversee over period of time in many instances rather than becoming di sciplinarians of the areas they oversee committees become advocates100 in the british parliament observers have noted that backbenchers tend to develop subject expertise through the question period101 although it could be argued that this subject specialization in the us congress generally develops through congressional committee membership there are limited number of committee positions available thus member of the house might be interested in and knowledgeable about tax law but may not have seat on the ways and means committee arguably the member is effectively cut off from contact with the appropriate officials form ulating tax policies alt hough many members may now channel such interest into membership in informal groups and caucuses with question period such member interest in subjects outside the purview of their committees could arguably be harnessed more effectively faster answers proponents of question period also argue that the committee system cannot produce timely answers from the executive branch it is not speedy means of obtaining information oversight hearings may occur weeks or months after the events that triggered them102 regular question period would allow members to

colin campbell former president of the canadian study of parliament group in hearing testimony one of the great difficulties i find in the united states is that it does take time nonetheless to get the inquiry system through committees running and sometimes the most crucial period of crisis is lost in terms of galvanizing public opinion in giving people sense of how the executive branch is dealing with it because there is more immediate way of having officers of the executive branch come and answer questions103 question period might also effectively speed up constituent casework in the british parliamentary experi ence questions submitted for written response constitute major means of constituent service for mps 104 matters of purely local nature or involving individual citizens complaints against government bureaus are frequently resolved by means of parliamentary stions submitted for written response the parliamentary require ment that named questions r eceive written response within days of submission enforces an efficient constituent service program for mps105 members of congress devote considerable time to constituent service including inquiries to agencies on behalf of cons tituents this casework activity is frequently protracted procedure dopting the british parliamentary requirement of quick response time to questions for writte n response might improve the casework performance of members of congress assuming that agencies provided comparably thorough service in shorter time period if the congress were to follow british practice and publish agency respons to written questions in the congressional record more public record of agency respons would be available than the current practice with casework responses forw arded directly to individual

benefit of such dir ect scrutiny of top cabinet officials is improved internal oversight within the executive branch departments111 cabinet members might become more watchful of their staffs and their

frequently read at length prepared remarks into the hearing record members of the committee generally question the witnesses sequentially since members often have sc heduling conflicts it is not uncommon for them to be present for only part of the hearings and thus they may inadvertently ask many of the same questions offered by other members in their absence in complex subjects involving the jurisdiction of several co mmittees agency heads and other officials may be required to appear before several committees and subcommittees to respond to questions which are often duplicative similarly in comparison with question time system the committee oversight procedures tend not to produ ce substantial spontaneous in teraction between differing points of view as observer has noted in the hearing process there is little opportunity for interaction among witnesse s of varying views this problem was highlighted when president ford forbade administration witnesses from appearing at congressional hearings simultaneously with their critics115 interbranch relations proponents of question time also believe it would promote more positive relationship between the legislative and executive branches of the government regular availability of the president or executive branch officers to questions by the congress might lower the institutional barriers between the legislative and executive branches currently there is little formal public interaction between members of congress and the executive branch116 cabinet officers tend to testify before limited number of committees and consequently come into direct contact most frequently with only limited number of members questions by the general membership of both houses would expose cabinet officers to wider variety of congressional opinion at the same time executive branch accountability to the congress would be emphasized in visible and public manner117 from the position of the executive bran ch the question

houses could provide the leverage needed to gain agency support within or circumventing hostile committees public stage for congress some proponents of question period believe that it could strengthen the political power of congress as an institution relative to the executive branch scholars and other political observers contend that the institutional advantages of the presidency over the congress such as unity of thought and the ability to plan political strategy have been expanded in the age of mass media they argue that the presidents single voice allows him to dominate public discussion while individual members of c ongress have difficulty even being heard119 as representative gejdenson testified it seems to that we have frankly lost power as an institution not by any supreme court decision but by the fact that the president matter who he is speaks with one voice and the number of voices that we have here at the congress tend to not make for clear debate i think question period would frankly give congress more equal footin g with the presiden tin that it would place us on the same plane at least with the leading cabinet secretary on particular issue120 from this perspective by placing the executive branch on the same stage as congress two things might occur first congress might come to occupy stronger institutional position in the mind of the public proponents maintain that by appearing alongside the president in position of equality or perhaps even strength congress might reclaim institutional power lost in the past second pub lic communication between the legislative and executive branch about important issues may increase as well as public attention to key issues as representative gejdenson testified often there is such wide variety of responses from housesenate members to presidential issue positions that you dont get real dialogue between the legislative and executive branches and that by instituting question period in the well of the house without other gislative business going on it would give very direct focus121httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34599crs24 122 ibid p 79 123 questions and answers from question time are publicly available on

place in the british parliament are not institutionally suitable for the american system of gove rnment which is based on separation of powers between coequal branches128 such objections have been raised on structural constitutional and institutional grounds structural concerns as structural matter the relationship between executive officials and the legislature in the american system is different from that in parliamentary democracy the president is neither member of congress nor entirely reliant on congress for his governin g authority he is independently elected and has constitutional authority separate from congress in parliamentary system the prime minister derives his authority from the consent of the majority of the legislature129 his office is beholden to the parliament as political actor he is ultimately responsible to the legislature much the way the speaker of the house is beholden to the membership of congress similarly department ministers in parliamentary systems are drawn from the membership of the parliament in the united states members of congress are constitutionally prohibited from simultaneously holding offices in the executive branch130 legislators appointed to cabinet pos itions by the president must resign their legislative office thus the nature of any question period in the united states and in particular stion period involving the president would necessarily adopt different institutional character than parliament ary question period131 the nature of party governance is also different in the united states than in most parliamentary systems in britain for example the government has the implicit backing of the majority of the legislatur failure to capture majority on key legislative item would signal loss of confidence in the executive and the need to call elections132 in the united states members or ganize into parties but party cohesion in the legislature is not necessary to maintain control of the

as political scientist hugh hecl has pointed out this means question periods are therefore unlikely to clarify th fundamental choice as to which party is more fit to govern134 constitutional objections some critics of question period have raised concerns that the constitutionallybased separation of powers doctrine might prohibit the establishment of mandatory appearances by the president andor other executive branch officials before the congress135 in particular because the president is an independent constitutional office presidential question period probably could not be established without the implicit support of the sitting pr esident although cabinet members do not have the same constitutionallybased status it is similarly unclear whether congress could establish mandatory appearances for such officials136 without any constitutional duty to appear before congress upon request president might refuse to appear or refuse to allow cabinet member s to appear unless conditions were made so fa vorable that congress would longer be interested137 as practical matter subjecting executive branch officials to direct questions by members of congress could increase the frequency with which claims of executive privilege are invoked as ba sis for withholding certain requested information138 such increased use of executive privilege may endanger the success of the question period as an informati onal device and might potentially strain interbranch relations hips in general institutional objections as an institutional matter critics of question period have also

the question period might ar gue that the house already questions administration officials in committee so what difference would it be if we questioned them on the floor my answer is that the floor of the house of representatives is special place each member on the floor is equal to every other member but to have an administrati on official come to the floor to answer questions alters the chemistry of the pl ace the kind of question period we are being asked to consider could transform it from meeting place of equals to an interrogation room140 presidential question period would proba bly not raise this specific concern as the president is an elected official in addition the pr esident has historically made periodic appearances in congress in times of crisis and modern presidents have delivered their state of the uni on address to congress in person poor oversight significant disagreement exists regarding question period effectiveness in obtaining informati on about federal agency programs and administration many observers of the parliamentary questi on period contend that ministers answering questions provide only such information as they want and that the information obtained might not warrant the expenditure of time and effort required one of the first things learned by rising politician in any democracy is how to artfully avoid giving information he does not want to give question period might elicit some marginal information not now obtainable through congressional hearings and official ne ws conferences but i doubt it would be worth the additional demands of time and

udents of parliame nt and the congress have rated the question period as an inferior legisla tive device colin campbell canadian academic and former president of the cana dian study of parlia ment group testified that people in parliamentary system s look longinglyto the committee system because you can really get into detail in way you cant in parliamentary question system143 similarly other scholars have not ed because the congress is more directly involved in adminis tration of programs due to hearings appropriations and confirmations than is the house of commons question period in congress would not carry the punch of an inve stigative committee on american lines144 the committee system also arguably provides wider set of oversight tools for members than simply questioning executive officials through hearings travel staff investigations review of appropriations and author izations and other means members of congressional committees become specialists on the subjects and agencies within their committees jurisdic tion committee hearings also give diverse interest groups and private citizens ready acce ss to the legislative process question period would not involve such outside politi cal actors to make their case regarding public policy proposals and the implementation of g overnmental programs of course congressional question period would not be the only information source available to the legislative bran ch none of the past proposals consider replacing the committee system with question period instead they see the two systems as complementary congressional committees would continue to be responsible for review of executive bran ch policies should question period be introduced in congress it is likely that committee hearings would continue

partisanship many critics both in countries with existing question periods and in the unite d states believe that question periods encourage partisanship and foster unnecessary partisan strife it has been noted that question time in the british parliament is debate at its most partisan146 during debate on the kefauver bill in 1944 representative clarence cannon leading parliamentary theorist in the house claimed the proposal would unnecessarily increase party strife in the congress and would upset delicate balances between the executive and legislative branches such question hour would degenerate immediately and inevitably into political fencing match the device would be used for partisan political advantage the questions submitted from the floor would probe excruciatingly into the depths of the rawest nerve centers of current campaign issues it would give rise to bad ta ste bad manners and bad blood instead of bringing about better teamwork between the congress and the executive departments it would drive wedge of discord between the legislative and executive branches147 similar concerns were echoed by mbers during the 1992 hearings on the gejdenson resolution members thought question time would just be another opportunity for the presidents opponents to try to embarrass the administration and would produce more heat than lig ht representative benjamin gilman described the idea of bringi ng cabinet members to the floor as an invitation to partisanship rather than beneficial addition to the deliberative process148 this argument presupposes that member s of the congress would value political point scoring more highly than pragma tic inquiry when given an opportunity to question executive branch officials appearing before the respective houses it also presumes that when presented with similar opportunity in committees members act with more restraint than they would show on the floor in rebuttal an argument could be framed to assert that there appear to exist adequate rules in both houses to enforce decorum and propriety on members dur ing legislative debate and such rules could also be applied during question period undermining the committee system it is likely that any question period in congress that involved the questioning of cabinet member s would alter the practices of the standing committees in th house and senate critics of question period for congress have raised concer ns that such systems would undermine committee jurisdiction increase the difficulty of getting highranking officials to appear before the committee and reduce the overall quality of oversight interactions between congress and the administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34599crs30 149 ibid p 61 150 ibid pp 6465the standing committees of both the house and the senate might find themselves sharing oversight responsibility with the entire membership of the chamber under system of question time if all members were given the opportunity to ask any questions of cabinet officials the agendas of the standing committees would potentially compete with the polic preferences of individual members of congress as remedy the standing committees might be given the power to control or preclear questions prior to their submission however this would arguably undermine one of the stated advantages of question time universal access to the administration for all members similarly the question period could also frustrate administration officials used to receiving limited set of committee oversight instructions an executive department accustomed to maintaining frequent consultations with particular authorizing and appropriating committees of the house and sena could suddenly be faced with substantially different nd potentially conflicting indicators of policy preferences from questions received on the floor of similar concern is the effect of question time on the willingness of administration officials to participate in committee hearings critics note that many administration officials already feel harri ed with the amount of time they have to spend on the hill before committees and might not be amenable to taking part in both question time and committee oversight hearings149 during hearings on the question period in 1992 several comm ittee chairmen submitted written testimony with concerns about the ability of committ ees to successfully call administration witnesses to committee hearings once question time system was introduced an appearance before the house for questioning might allow cabinet member to argue that that fulfills his or her oblig ation to appear before congress and thus resist accepting an invitation from congressional committee150 finally question period might result in lower quality of interaction between members and the administration questions from the floor are likely to be more general in their focus or more concerned with the local impact of proposed policies than questions initiated in committee hearings similarly some cabinet secretaries may view the question periods as less valuable forum than committee hearings for interacting with members of congress there may also be some question by the agencies about the value of questions fro m the floor in dealing with committees the agency must respond to generally we llinformed questions from members knowledgeable about the agencys duties quality of debate critics of question periods in parliamentary systems often maintain that in practice the system rarely results in substantive policy debates as james sundquist

denigrated the substantive value of it for instance one canadian member said anyone who has participated in questi on period knows its main purposes are to embarrass the government to amuse the tourists and tv audiences and to make life easier for reporters it is totally ineffective way to elicit significant information153 the question period also has been manipulated for political or policy purposes in 1971 the british ministry of environment distributed prepared questions for oral response to mps who supported ministr policy for the purpose of blocking awkward questions by opposition members parliamentary select committee was named to investigate the situation and dete rmined that in previous sessions both the government and the opposition had sought to rig questions one minister claimed that question rigging had become comm on practice of course question rigging cannot be entirely successful urgent stions may be submitted if conditions warrant and determined mp whose question is not reached may continue his question for oral response at subs equent appearance by the minister154 cost opponents of written response questions frequently cite the cost of providing such service in great br itain the written responses are generally provided by senior civil servants the most recent statistics from the british government estimate the average cost at 140 approximately 280 for written question and 385 appr oximately 770 for an oral question155 during the past few years mps have asked over 75000 questions156 supporters of written response proposal could contend that

giving the administration new forum to promote its policies and positions in the heart of the legislative branch157 scholars of congress and the presidency ve argued that the rise of mass media particularly television medi has given the president comparative advantage over congress158 while the president can employ the resources of the executive branch to promote his unitary message indivi dual members of congress may lack the institutional resources to compete with the president and congress as whole lacks unity of message159 the introduction of televise d question period might serve to increase this presidential advantage opponents also worry about the institutiona l and partisan balance of question time period since the president is almost certain to have significant number of ideological or partisan allies in congress it is likely that significant portion of the time for questions and answers would be taken up by proadministration positions as james sundquist testified in 1992 half of the question would be asked by partisans of the administration in power who would undoubtedly in baseball vern acular toss up fat balls for the administration to knock out of the park the question period would thus give the administration in power an extrao rdinary opportunity to score points in political debate before national audience160 relative to the committee system the structure of question period as sundquist notes also favors the administra tion in committee hearings the legislative majority can pursue their questions at length offer commentary and have the opportunity for the final word in most pr oposals for question periods this would not be the case161 legislative considerations for congress as has been noted earlier various form at options for question period exist the potential effects on both the procedures of the legislation branch and the relationships between the executive and congress will vary according to the question period format selected and in particular according to the scope of the proposed question period whether questions will be written oral or both how often thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34599crs33 question period will take place and wh ether the question period will include questions to the cabinet members or only to the president which executive branch officials perhaps the most fundamental decision about any question period will involve who will be asked to appear popular perceptions in america of parliament ary question periods focus on the oral questioning of the prime nister prime ministers qu estions in england however comprise tiny fraction of the questioning system as discussed past proposals for question periods in congress have focu sed on the questioning of the cabinet members not the president the kefauver mondale and gejden proposals called for the appearance of cabinet members only the involvement of the president howev er is perhaps more likely to produce the positive effects sought by proponents of the question period appearances by the president would presumably generate great er public interest than appearances by cabinet officials similarly appearances in congress by cabinet members already occur in committee hearings question period would be change in format but not necessarily sharp change in practice presidential question period on the other hand would be wholly new developm ent in american politics and would presumably have an impact on the practice of politics what form would questions take second important question for congress to consider is whether question time would include both oral and written questions in most parliamentary systems that employ question periods written questions vastly outnumber oral questions due to time limitations oral questions however generate more public interest an d typically involve stions of general interest and important contemporary public policy the kefauver mondale and gejdenson proposals differed from the traditional question period in not providing for wr itten responses to members questions moreover if british mps question for oral response is not reached heshe has the option of accepting written response to the question in lieu of an oral answer within the limited time provided for oral stions in past american proposals at most two hours weekly few members of the house and senate would be able to receive an oral response if oral questions were to be used s econd issue would arise as to whether and how many unannounced questions would be allowed either as initial inquiries or supplemental followup questions how often would question time occur how much time the congress devoted to question periods would also ffect the number of g overnment officials appearing at these sessions the british house of commons devotes four hours weekly to the question period to permit roughly the same number of cabinet members as there are in the united states to be questioned once monthly but the united states in addition to cabinet department heads has number of other senior officials who do not hold cabinet rank ye t influence national policy enormously independent agency heads directors of government corpor ations and senior presidential staff subject to senatorial advice and consent might all be prime candidates for appearances at question peri ods yet none of the earlier proposals hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34599crs34 162 the mondale proposal would have also permitted impromptu questions from the floor with rigid time limits under the divided contro l of the committee chairman and the ranking minority memberdirectly addressed what role if any these officials are to play in any question period plan how would questions be chosen since it is likely that the demand to ask oral questions will exceed the amount of time available system for choosing among members questions will probably be needed oral questions in britain are chosen by the shuffle preclearance is not required either by committee or party both the monda and kefauver proposals tied the administration of the question period into the committee system162 questions by members would first be cleared by the committee having jurisdiction over the subject area the gejdenson proposal placed the selection of questions with the majority and minority leaders use of the committees to clear questions would potentially allow for smooth integration of the question period and the committee system co mmittees could select questions related to current policy and oversight debates within the committee and project them into public view through the question period on the other hand in subjects which span the jurisdictions of several committees such as energy policy it might be necessary to obtain the approval of half dozen committees before the question could be put to the cabinet offi cial it might also be unlikely that committee would approve inquiries which questioned either th policy attitudes of the committee majority or of the department when the same party controlled the congress and the executive branch use of the majority and minority leader s to select questions would potentially have the advantage of focusing the ques tion period on the policy differences between the political parties arguably congressional leaders would be likely to c hoose questions of national political prominence which highlight policy differences between the competing parties under such system however rank and file members may find themselves left out of the question process thus the use of chamber leaders as selectors of questions might not be desirable if legislators perceive question time as means to allow wider participation in congressional oversight use of random shuffle to choose am ong questions would potentially allow greater participation from ra nk and file or junior memb ers on the other hand random shuffle might result in greater numbe r of questions that were not of general interest as occasionally occurs in the british system members might use an oral question to seek government answer in response to particular constituent casework concern would question period be

limit the number of appearances the president would need to make while also allowing for both house and senate par ticipation other contemporary join t sessions of congress such as the annual joint session for the presidents state of the union address might serve as logistical and procedural model for policymakers considering bicameral issues what rules would govern floor procedure parliamentary systems that employ question period have complex ru regarding both the procedures and content of questions for example in the british system the rules state that questions must be succinct must either seek info rmation or press for action may not convey information or advance an argument and must relate to matter which is the responsibility of the minister addressed similar rules are used to keep answers as short as possible163 for any question period in congress rule s would have to be drafted regulating general question time proce dures such as the numbe r and kind of supplementary questions which could be answered as we ll as specific aspects of floor procedure such as the control of time legislator s might consider adopting entirely new chamber rules to govern question time or they might consider conducting question time under existing rule s for floor debate164 modifying existing rules however might prove just as complicated or even more complicated as adopting entirely new

requi re general examination of house or senate rules of procedure to per mit the accommodation of question routine establishing regular time for questions in the house for example would force

presentations such as oneminute speeches or special order speeches be curtailed expanding session length would likely cause periods of subs tantial overwork toward the end of session or congress while at other periods of relatively light floor schedules the additional session time spent on questions may be relatively inconsequential who would referee the enforcement of house or senate rules might become more vital if question period took on the partisan intensity shown in britain and canada in those parliaments the sp eaker is clearly recognized nonpartisan removed effectively from electoral

the rulings of the speaker are not challenged in the us congress rulings by the speaker or vice president about issues such as the proper form of questions may increase both partisan feeling and the

vary widely in the frequency with which ques tion periods are held and in the number of questions submitted by members the data suggest that establishing question period is guarantee that it will develop into an effective information tool of the legislature although executive branch officials peri odically appeared on the floor during the first congresses by the late 1790s th practice had largely ceased proposals for question period for congress have been ffered with relative regularity beginning in the mid19th century initially the proposals were endorsed by scholars who sought to increase executive branch influe nce in the congress at time when the legislative branch was preeminent in r ecent decades the proposal has been offered as means to assure greater executiv branch accountability during periods of perceived executive dominance in the federal government whether the question period would be ccessful in system of separated powers depends in large part on the attitude of its participants and on the format the question period ultimately assumes the question period has the potential of involving more rankandfile members in the policymaki ng process and improving the means of communication between executive departments and the congress it also could harden relations between the congress and the executive and might increase the level of partis an controversy in congress in crafting question period proposal fo r use in the congress attention will likely be given to balancing the interests of both parties and their leadership the concerns of
