for the congress nd the administration and the issue extends to lhhsed projects in some instances lhhsed appropriations are earmarked for specific recipients or locations either in the public law or in the conference report for the most part the authorizin g statute gives the general purpose for such earmarks such as projects for the imp rovement of postsec ondary education but subsequently an appropriations act or conference report designates specific recipients by means of earmarks such designati ons usually bypass sta ndard administrative procedures for an agencys competitive distribution of awards the president has urged the elimination of cong ressional earmarks in appropriations in recent years but the congress has continued the practice in terms of numbers of lhhsed earmarks the fy2004 conference report hrept 108401 included an estimated 2000 earmarks for specific lhhsed projects the estimated number for l hhsed was approximately 1600 earmarks in fy2002 and seven earmarks in fy1996 in terms of dollar amounts for lhhse d earmarks the fy2004 estimated total was 876 million or 018 of the grand total lhhsed appropriation for fy2002 the estimated amount was 10 billion or 025 of the grand total for fy1996 the estimated amount was 15 milli on or 001 of the grand total 302a and 302b allocation ceilings the maximum budget authority for annual lhhsed appropriations is determined through twostag congressional budget process in the first stage the congress agrees to overall spending totals in the annual concurre nt resolution on the budget subsequently these amounts are allocated among the various committees usually through the statement of manage rs for the conference report on the budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31803crs12 resolution these amounts are known as the 302a allocations they include the discretionary totals available to the house and senate committees on appropriations for enactment in annual appropriations for fy2004 the congress agreed to the budget resolution hconres 95 conference report hrept 10871 on april 11 2003 the resolution provides for an fy 2004 discretionary total of 7845 billion for procedural information see crs report 98721 introduction to the federal budget process in the second stage of the process the appropriations committees allocate the 302a discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each of the 13 annual appropriations bills these amounts are known as the 302b allocations these allocations must add up to more than the 302a discretionary allocation and form the basis for enforcing budget discipline since any bill reported with total above the ceiling is subject to point of order the 302b allocations can and often do get adjusted during the year as the various appropriations bills progress toward final enactment the 302b disc retionary allocations for the fy2004 appropriations bills that were agreed to by the house and senate committees on appropriations are shown in table 3 comparable amounts for fy2003 the presidents fy2004 budget and the fy2004 conference agreement are also shown both the 302a and the 302b allocations regularly

year cannot be spent until subsequent fiscal year see crs report rs20441 advance appropriations forward funding and advance funding for example pl 1087 which enacted fy2003 lhhsed appropriations provided 390 million for the corporation for public broadcasting cpb for use in fy2005 advance appropriations may be used to meet seve ral objectives these might include the provision of longterm budget information to recipients such as state and local educational systems to enable better planning of future program activities and personnel levels the more contentious as pect of advance appropriations however is how they are counted in budget ceilings advance appropriations avoid the 302a and 302b allocation ceilings for the current year but must be counted in the year in which it first becomes available this procedure uses up ahead of time part of what will be counted against the allocation ceiling in future years for an examplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31803crs13 of the impact of advance appropriati ons on program administration see the discussion below in the section on ed page 32 the fy1999 and fy2000 annual lhhsed appropriations bills provided significant increases in advance appropriati ons for discretionary programs these amounts stabilized at approximately 19 b illion or about 14 to 15 of lhhsed discretionary appropriations for the period fy2000 through fy2002 then increased to 215 billion in fy2003 for fy 2002 the presidents budget proposed the elimination of advance appropriations for federal discretionary programs including those for lhhsed programs the

of children with disabilities cost twice the national appe 100 more than the average ch ild and the maximum federal share of the extra cost would be 40 appropriations have never been sufficient to reach the 40 level some view this deficiency as promise made that has not yet been kept achieving the 40 funding level for fy 2003 for part b grants would take an estimated 202 billion whereas the fy 2003 appropriation was 89 billion the equivalent of 175 of the current appe times the numbe r of children served an additional appropr iation of 113 billion would have b een necessary to provide the 40 authorized maximum for fy2003 in addition funding requirements for maximum grants could grow in the future with the possibility of continued growth for both the appe and the number of children with disabilities served the latter may increase in part as result of medical advances that have enabled more medically fragile children to survive to sc hool age and to receive public educationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31803crs32 for additional information see crs report rs21447 individuals with disabilities education act idea current funding trends forward funding and advance appropriations many of the larger ed programs have either aut horization or appropr iations provisions that allow funding flexibility for sc hool program years that differ from the federal fiscal year for example many of the elementary and s econdary education formula grant programs receive appropriations that become available for obligation to the states on july 1 of the same year as the appr opriations and remain availa ble through the end of the following fiscal year that is fy2004 appropriations for some programs will became available for obligation to the states on july 1 2004 and will remain available for 15month period until sept ember 30 2005 this budgetary procedure is popularly known as forward or m ultiyear funding and is accomplished through funding provisions in the lhhsed appropriations bill forward funding in the case of elementary nd secondary education programs was designed to allow dditional time for school officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year for pell grants for undergraduates however aggregate program costs for indi vidual students applying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ah ead of time appropriations from one fiscal year primarily support pell grants during the following academic year that is the fy2004 appropriations w ill be used primarily to support the 2004 2005 academic year unlike forward funded programs however the funds for pell grants remain available for obligation for 2 full fiscal years thus if cost estimates turn out to be too low funds may be borrowed from the following years appropriations or conversely if the timates are too high the surplus may be obligated during the following year an advance appropriation occurs when the appropriation is provided for fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriation was enacted in the case of fy2004 appropriations funds norma lly would have become available october 1 2003 under regular funding provi sions but will not become available until july 1 2004 under the forward funding provisions discusse d above however if the july 1 2004 forward funding date were to be postponed for obligation by three months until october 1 2004 the appr opriation would be classified as an advance appropriation since the funds woul d become available only in subsequent fiscal year fy2005 for example the fy2004 appropriation for title i part grants to leas for the education of th disadvantaged is 123 billion this amount includes not only forward funding of 51 billion available july 1 2004 but also an advance appropriation of 72 billion vailable october 1 2004 like forward funding advance appropriations are accomp lished through provisions in the annual appropriations bill what is the impact of these changes in funding provisions at the program or service level relatively little is changed by the threemonth delay in the availability of funds since most expenditures for st andard school year occur after october 1 at the appropriations level however significant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year and is therefore fully included in the current 302b allo cation for discretiona ry appropriations under federal budget scorekeeping rules an advance appropriati on is not counted inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31803crs33 the 302b allocation until the following year in essence threemonth change from forward funding to an advance appropria tion for given program allows onetime shift from the current year to the next year in the
