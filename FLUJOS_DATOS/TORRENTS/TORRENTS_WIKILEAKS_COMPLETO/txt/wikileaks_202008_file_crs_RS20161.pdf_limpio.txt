as freestanding bill or added to hr 1141 bill providing supplemental appropriations for central america and caribbean disaster relief aid to jordan farm programs and some other domestic programs hr 1141 is currently under consideration by housesenate conference while there appears to be widespread support in congress for supplemental funding several potentially contentious issues have arisen some defense advocates have argued that funding should be provided not only to cover the immediate costs of military operations against yugoslavia but also to address perceived shortfalls in military readiness worldwide the administration has requested that funds be designated as emergency appropriations which will raise caps on discretionary spending by the amounts provided some legislators however may propose oﬀsetting rescissions for some or all of the supplemental funds if hr 1141 is the vehicle outstanding issues on that bill will have to be resolved including oﬀsets to which the

controversial house provision making cuts in callable capital for international lending institutions most of the rescissions appear to have little or outlays including 125 billion in excess balances in the food stamp program and 350 million in unspent balances of section 8 housing program funds the conference agreement does not include funding for loan guarantees for steel companies hurt by increased imports or for oil and gas companies nor does it include provision reduc ing interest payments by midwest utility companies on amounts that they are required to repay to consume rs such provisions were matters of controversy in the conferenc the agreement does however include measure to prevent the federa l government from claiming share of state court settlements with tobacco

the agreement includes housepassed provision requir ing the president to seek burdensharing contributions from allies to offset us costs in kosovo key issues the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for kosovo raised number f issues including 1 whether to provide additional funds for defense readiness s emergency supplemental funding 2 whether to impose offsetting rescissions for som or all of the supplemental amounts 3 how to resolve outstanding issues on hr 1141 4 burdensharing and 5 whether to use the pplemental appropriations bill as vehicle to limit the use of ground troops addition funds for defense readiness when the administration submitted its funding request for kosovo some defense advocates in congress complained that the amount was much too small t he crisis they said shows that forces are overburdened in general and that emergency funding is required to correct readiness shortfalls som ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20161crs5 for detailed discussion of the debate over emergency supplemental funding for defens e1 programs between 1993 and 1998 see stephen daggett emergency appropriations for th department of defense crs general distribution memo august 18 1998legislators proposed adding as much as 2025 billion to the administration request t improve military readiness in general this prospect prompted considerable oppos ition house minority leader richard gephardt and senate minority leader tom daschle said that kosovo supplemental is not the proper vehicle for an incre ase in defense spending in effect to use an emergency supplemental bill to add funds for defense readiness would be means of bypassing limits on total discretionary spending established in the 1997 budget agreement caps tha t republicans insisted on maintaining in the recentlyapproved fy2000 budget resolution as approved by congress the conference agreement adds 54 in unrequeste d defense funds including 18 billion for military pay and benefits increases in fy2000 225 billion for military read iness accounts all made available for obligation through the end of fy2000 and 475 million for military construction such funds would t normally be counted as incremental costs of an operation funding for military pay and benefits in fy2000 in particular appears to be means of easing constraints on th fy2000 budget the bill does not however add nearly as much as some had proposed in key tes t of house sentiment on additional funds for the defense department th house reject ed an amendment to hr 1664 by rep obey that would have cut about 3 billion from the amount added the conference agreement trims the house additions by about 14 billion offsetting rescissions closely related issue concerns w hether congress should impose offsetting rescissions for some or all of any supplemental amounts provided fo r kosovo whether to offset supplemental funds in general and defense supplemental funds in particular has been an i ssue since caps on discretionary spending were first established by the 1990 budget enforcement act this year the issue has been particularl y1 contentious in part bec ause of backlash against last years supplemental appropriations bill part of pl 105277 which provided 21 billion of emergency funding withou t offsets and in part because any extra spend ing will reduce the social securityrelated part of the budget surplus in earlier action on hr 1141 and s 544 the parallel senate bill the issue f offsets was especially controversial the housepassed bill made offsets in budge t authority but not in outlays for all of the nondefense amounts provided but the house rejected an amendment by rep todd tiahrt to offset the defense amounts as well the senate in contras t offset all of the amounts in outlays as well as in budget authority by making an acrosstheboard cut in nondefense funds in last years supplemental there was considerably less opposition to providing nonoffse t emergency funds for the kosovo supplemental in floor action on hr 1664 on may 6 the house rejected by vote f 101322 coburn amendment to offset all of the funds in the bill the conferenc agreement on hr 1141 provides all of the kosovorelated funds as emergenc appropriations without offsetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20161crs6 issues in hr 1141 the senate bill provided substantially more money than the house bill an d included some contentious policy riders including provision prohibiting the federal government from claiming share of the multistate settlement with tobacco companies and several environmental riders offsets however appeared to be the most difficult issue to resolve the white house threatened to veto either version of the bil l because it objected to particular offsets confer ees included some of the policy riders but did not insist on the most contentious offsets burdensharing several members of congress have complained that the united states is bearing disproportionately large share of the costs of kosovorelate d operations accurate estimates of allied costs are not availabl but rough data on the us share of the military effort and relief operations have been provided on april 21 joint chiefs cha irman general henry shelton told the house appropriations committee that us forces have flown about 65 of the aircraft sorties including combat and suppor t operations in operation allied force on april 27 omb director jacob lew said that the united states is providing about 25 of refugee and migration assistance th conference agreement includes provision as passed by the house that directs th president to seek more equitable burdensharing and requires report on the issue b september 30 rest rictions on the use of ground troops in the house appropriation s committee markup of hr 1664 rep istook offered an amendment barring the use of funds for us ground troops in kosovo other members of the committee urged it s withdrawal saying that such provision would lead to veto by the president th measure did not receive sufficient support to be brou ght to roll call vote in house floor action on the bill rep istook offered similar proposal that was rejected by vote f 117301 the conference agreement on hr 1141 does not include any restrictions
