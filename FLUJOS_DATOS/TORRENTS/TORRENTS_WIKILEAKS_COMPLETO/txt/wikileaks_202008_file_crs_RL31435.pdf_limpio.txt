congress during the 107th congress 109 nominations to fulltime pos itions in independent and other agencies were submitted to the senate of these nominations three were submitted by president clinton before he left office and were withdrawn by president bush on march 19 2001 pr esident bush submitted 106 nominations of which 94 were confirmed 10 were returned and two were withdrawn president clinton made three recess appointments to these pos itions during the intersession between the 106th and 107th congresses all of which expi red at the end of the first session of the 107th congress president bush did not make any recess appointments to these positions between the beginning of his administration and the end of the 107th congress table 1 summarizes the appointment activity the number of nominations submitted to the senate exceeds the number of individual nominees because due to the return of pending nominations at the august 2001 recess as discussed below eight nominees were nominated twice to the same position in addition two individuals sean okeefe nd mark w everson were nominated to two different positions table 1 nomination and appointment action in the 107th

which the president submitted second nomination of the same person for the same position average time to confirm nomination the length of time given nomination may be pending in the senate varies widely some nominations are confirme d within few days others may not be confirmed for several months and some are never confir med this report provides for each agency nomination that was confirmed in the 107th congress the number of days between nomination and confirmation da ys to confirm some senate recess days are not included in this sum because senators are unable to take up nominations on these days for practical reasons only days from the longer recesses around august and between congre ssional sessions are excluded these recesses are often longer than 30 days this cutoff point is suggested by the senate rules which provide that if the senate sh all adjourn or take recess for more than thirty days all nominations pending and not finally acted upon shall be returned to the presidenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31435crs3 3us congress senate committee on rules and administration senate manual 106th cong 1st sess sdoc 1061 washington gp 1999 p 55 rule xxxi paragraph 6 of the

senate congressional record daily edition vol 147 dec 20 2001 p s 14049 under this agreement only two nominations otto reich to be assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs and colonel david r leffarge to be brigadie r general were returned to the presidentalthough this rule is often waived3 the 32 days during the august 2002 recess and the 33 days between the first and second sessions of the 107th congress were subtracted from the days to confirm for those nominations that spanned one or both recesses days were subtracted for the august 2001 recess because as discussed below all pending nominations were returned prior to that recess an accurate calculation of the averag time the senate took to confirm nomination in the 107th congress is made more challenging by an unusual characteristic of the session senate rules provide that if the senate shall adjourn or take recess for more than thirty da ys all nominations pe nding and not finally acted upon at the time shall be returned to the president4 usually the senate agrees by unanimous consent to waive this rule and retain pending nominations over their recesses prior to the 31day august 2001 recess however the senate did not reach such an agreement and 162 pending nominations eight of which are among those covered by this report were returned to the president5 the president sent forward some of these nominees again after the r ecess those nominations were considered to be new nominations rather than conti nuations of the prer ecess nominations as result when such nominations are confirmed the length of the confirmation process as shown in the tables of this report as days to confirm does not include any prerecess time during which the nominee was under considerati on in the senate consequently the average is smaller than it would be if the pre and postrecess nomination times were added together for example the average number of days to confirm for nominations to the positions cove red by this report is 60 days but if the prerecess days during which nominee was under consideration in the senate were included for all confirmed nominees this average would be 61 days footnotes for appointment action tables for each agency below provide fi gures that take such pre recess time into account in general however comparisons between average confirmation times from this report and those from previ ous reports should be made cautiously httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31435crs4 6a succinct historical and contemporary overview of the appointment power is f ound in louis fisher appointme nt powers in his constitutional conflicts between congress and the president 4th ed lawrence ks university press of kansas 1997 pp 2248the appointments process the president and the senate share the power to appoint the principal officers of the united states6 the constitution article ii section 2 empowers the president to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint the principal officers of the united states three distinct stages mark the appointment process sel ection and nomination conf irmation and appointment selection and nomination in this stage the president selects the nominee and sends the nomination to the senate there are number of steps in the presidents selection first with th assistance of the white house office of presidential personnel the president lects candidate for the position the candidate then prepares and submits several forms the public financial disclosure report standard form sf 278 th questionnaire for national security positions sf 86 and the white house p ersonal data statement questionnaire the office of the counsel to the presid ent oversees the clearance process with background investigations conducted by the federal bureau of investigation fbi internal revenue service irs office of government ethics oge and ethics official for the agency to which the candida is to be appointe d if conflicts are found during the background check oge and the agency ethics officer may work with the candidate to mitigate the conflic ts once the counsel has cleared the candidate the nomination is ready to be submitted to the senate the selection and vetting stage is often the longest part of the appointment process there can be lengthy delays particularly if many candidates are being processed as they are at the beginning of an administrati on or if conflicts need to be resolved candidates for higherlevel positions are often accorded priority in this process for positions located within state us attorney us marshal and us district judge the president by cu stom normally nominates an individual recommended by the senator or senators if they are from the same party as the president from that state if neither senator is from the presidents party he usually defers to the recommendations of party leaders from the state occasionally the president solicits recommendations from nators of the opposition party because of their positions in the senate before maki ng nomination to federal position at the state or national level the president must consider how it will fare in the confirmation process nominee has legal authority to assu the duties and re sponsibilities of the position the authority comes with senate confirmation and presidential appointment nominee who is hired as consultant while awaiting confirmation may serve only in an advisory capacity if circumst ances permit and conditions are met the president may give the nominee recess ppointment or tem porary appointment to the position see below recess appointme nts may have political consequences however particularly if sena tors perceive that an ppointment is an effort to circumvent their constitutional role httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31435crs5 7for more detailed description of the confirmation process see crs report rl31980 senate consideration of presidential nominations committee and floor procedure

branch 19811992 by rogelio garcia archived contact henry hogue for more information the study did not include nominations submitted by presidents carter and reagan in the last months of their administ rations or nominations submitted within month of the senates adjournment at the end of session it also excluded nominations to the judiciary military services foreign service national oceanic and atmospheric administration officer corps and public health service officer corps as well as nominations to all ambassadorial us attorney us marshal and parttime positionsconfirmation7 in the confirmation or s econd stage the senate alone determines whether to appr ove or disapprove nominati on the way the senate acts on nomination depends largely on the im portance of the position involved existing political circumstances and policy impli cations generally the senate shows particular interest in the nominees views and how they are likely to affect public policy8 two other factors may also affect the scrutiny with which nominees personal and professional qualities are examined whether or not the presidents party controls the senate and the degree to wh ich he becomes involved in supporting the nomination although the senate confirms most nomin ations president can safely assume that his nominees will be approved routinely rarely however does rejection occur on the senate floor nearly all rejections occur in committee either by committee vote or by committee inaction re jections in committee occur for variety of reasons including opposition to the nomination inadequate amount of time for consideration of the nomination or factors that may have nothing to do with the merits of the nomination the most recent study of senate confirmation action which looked at the period between 1981 and 1992 found that th senate failed to confirm 11 of all nominations to fulltime positions in independent agencies during the same period 9 of nominati ons to the executive departments and 22 of nominations to boards and commissions also failed9 appointment in the final stage the confirmed nominee is given commission signed by the president with the seal of the united states affixed thereto and is sworn into office the president may sign the commission at any time after confirmation under unus ual circumstances he may not sign it at all thus preventing the appointment once the ppointee is given the commission and sworn in he or she has full authority to ca rry out the responsibilities of the office recess appointments the appointment process also enables the president to make an appointment without senate confirmation when the senate is in r ecess either during sessionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31435crs6 10art ii sec 2 cl 3 of the constitution

next session of congress10 presidents have occasionally used the recess appointment pow er to circumvent the confirmation process in response congress has placed restrictions on the presidents authority to make recess ppointment under 5 usc 5503a if the position to which the president makes r ecess appointment falls vacant while the senate is in session the r ecess appointee may not be pa id from the treasury until he or she is confirmed by the senate the salary prohibition does not apply 1 if the vacancy arose within 30 days before the end of the session 2 if nomination for the office other than the nomination of someone given rece ss appointment during the preceding recess was pending when the senate recessed or 3 if nomination was rejected within 30 days before the nd of the session and nother individual was given the recess appointment recess ppointment falling under any one of these three exceptions must be followed by nomination to the position not later than 40 days after the beginning of th next session of the senate11 for this reason when recess appointment is made the president generally submits new nomination for the nominee even when an old nomination is pending12 in addition although recess appointees whose nominations to full term are subsequently rejected by the senate may continue to serve until the end of th eir recess appointment provision of the treasury and general govern ment appropriations act may prevent them from being paid after their rejection13 temporary appointments congress has provided limited statutory authority for the temporary filling of vacant positions requiring senate confirmati on under the federal vacancies reform act of 199814 when an executive agency position requiring confirmation becomes vacant it may be filled temporar ily in one of three ways 1 the first assistant to such position may automatically assume the functions and duties of the office 2 the president may direct an officer in any agency who

confirmed this average should be used cau tiously as discusse d earlier the senate took the unusual step of returning all nomina tions to the president prior to the august 2001 recess many of those whose nominati ons were returned were renominated after the recess consequently these indivi duals were nominated twice and the days that elapsed while their first nominations we re pending in the senate are not included in the calculation of the average days to confirm nomination as result this average time is shorter than it would be otherwise the second table of each profile iden tifies the
