penetrate the communist party and other subversive organizations today the press television and radio along with the express interests of the administration keep this phase of criminal activity in position of prominence in the public eye certainly we cannot relax even momentarily our efforts in combating the criminal underworld including the prosecution of top hoodlums the foundation from which we forge our attack must be kept strong and fresh with full flow of information from well placed informants all agents in conducting investigation of criminal matters should be constantly alert for the development of new informants and new potential informants who may be in position to assist usxviii 42761 the attorney general held meeting in his office regarding the organized crime and

lack of progress by the organized crime and racketeering section the deputy attorney general pointed up the need for the receipt of full information in order to develop case and cautioned against too speedy action the attorney general took issue with this saying that while it was necessary to develop information nevertheless he expected the attorneys in the organized crime section to be more

and he expected something to be accomplished he advised he intended to hold another meeting on may 20 and by that time those in the section would have to be in position to report more favorably or he

program was inaugurated see 12762 letter from director hoover to fbi sacs states in relevant part to successfully complete our intelligence picture of the controlling forces which make organized crime operative it is now urgently necessary to develop particularly qualified live sources within the upper echelon of the organized hoodlum element who will be capable of furnishing the quality information required the most significant information developed to date indicating organization among the nations hoodlum leaders has been obtained from highly confidential sources in chicago new york and philadelphia concerning the existence of commission of top leaders of the organized hoodlum element exerting controlling influence on racket activities in this country raymond patriarca was listed as bostons top hoodlum and as commission member the letter further states that there is an urgent need for amplifying information which will reveal full details concerning the operations of these interrelated organized criminal groups throughout the nation our urgent need for new live sources strategically placed in the upper echelon of organized crime is brought into clear focus by the fact that information regarding the commission has been reported by any live criminal source to date it is mandatory that the development of quality criminal informants be emphasized and the existing program be implemented and greatly expanded you are again reminded that the penetration and infiltration of organized criminal activity is prime objective of the bureau and to accomplish this it is necessary to give renewed impetus to the development of quality criminal informants the best source we could possibly obtain would be criminal informant who is highly placed in organized crime to insure sic the success of this program it is necessary to utilize special agents with the will and desire to employ new approaches and means to secure the bureaus goals selection of particular criminal informant should be based on combination of particular hoodlums qualification by virtue of his position in the organized crime hoodlum element and upon circumstances indicating his possible vulnerability to development to properly develop informants of this caliber varied approaches can and should be utilized dependent upon the individual under development every office is being advised of this program since in the future it may be appropriate to expand it to include additional offices this program has as its primary purpose the development of quality criminal intelligence informants the two most important components of this program are the selection of individuals for development as informants and the designation of the special agents who will participate xx 1962 3662 the fbi

harassing patriarca and his associates with the hope that provable violation may develop patriarcas activities seem to concern gambling attempts to corrupt officials and he furnishes general aid and counsel to assorted members of the underworld in investigating those who are identified as lieutenants or close associates of patriarca it is felt that some violation of which they are guilty might

cassesso that he would give all the help he could in aiding them to kill willie marfeo 4 patriarca explained to baron that he was angry because marfeos crap game had been creating lot of heat on patriarcas crap game and on his booking operations 4 shortly thereafter patriarca called off the proposed murder 5 seven or eight months later tameleo told barboza that marfeo got it tameleo explained the details of marfeos murder to barboza 56 the establishment of the agreement will not be based on circumstantial evidence or inferences arising therefrom but rather the very agreement itself will be testified to by one of the individuals who was to participate in its execution the overt acts which took place in massachusetts are especially appropriate in case involving gangland assassination in that it has always been one of the essential factors in perpetrating successful hit that the contract be given to an outof state torpedo as means of minimizing the chance of detection of the assassination and thus lessening the risk that the individual who planned the assassination be traced 13 there is short redacted section that appears to discuss discrepancy in dates 13 in section discussing weak points in the governments case it is noted that the electronic surveillance of barboza proves that his testimony is true and this is of special significance 15 raymond patriarca was the subject of an fbi electronic surveillance by means of an electronic eavesdropping device installed by trespass at his place of business 168 atwells avenue providence rhode island during the period march 6 1962 to july 12 1965 16 walter barnes and edward f harrington reviewed 26 volumes of fbi logs memoranda and airtels in the boston office of the fbi 16 it is clear that we will have to disclose all of the material pertaining to the fbi electronic surveillance of patriarca since the device was in his place of business and some of the overheard conversations are clearly relevant some of this material has already been disclosed in connection with the income tax case against louis taglianetti of providence rhode island 16 we were also informed that an other sic associate of patriarcas namely joseph modica was the subject of an electronic surveillance by means of an electronic eavesdropping device installed by trespass at his place of business the piranha finance company 85 state street boston massachusetts during the period may 7 1964 and july 12 1965 the overheard conversations are reflected in logs memoranda and airtels 16 there is six page section titled pertinent excerpts

1965 an unman contacts patriarca and states that he has brought down flemmi and joseph barboza patriarca is infuriated at frank smith for allowing flemmi and barboza to come to see him without prior authorization patriarca makes arrangements to meet with barboza and flemmi in garage shortly thereafter as he does not want to meet these two individuals at his place of business 17 march 5 1965 jerry angiulo states to patriarca that vin jimmy flemmi was with joseph barboza when barboza killed jackie francione in revere massachusetts several months ago 18 march 9 1965 james flemmi and joseph barboza contact patriarca and during the meeting explain to patriarca that they are having problem with teddy deegan and desire to get an okay to kill him flemmi and barboza tell patriarca that deegan is looking for an excuse to wack sic out bobby donati who is friendly with rico sacrimone patriarca instructs flemmi and barboza to obtain more information relating to deegan and then to contact jerry angiulo at boston who would furnish them with decision whether they could kill deegan 18 may 3 1965 james flemmi ronald cassessa and joseph barboza contact patriarca and discuss hitting an unnamed individual 19 may 5 1965 henry tameleo tells patriarca that joe lombardo of boston told tameleo that he had received information that barboza cassessa and jimmy flemmi had received the okay to kill sammy linden for the reason that linden was on the side of the mclaughlin group and had been furnishing them with considerable money so that they could continue in their efforts to kill individuals connected with the mclean group patriarca tells tameleo to contact barboza and flemmi and to instruct them to forget the hit on sammy linden in that he is connected with one of our group tameleo tells patriarca that joe lombardo was perturbed because cassessa and barboza were associating with the flemmi brothers and information had been put out to the effect that barboza was with flemmi when teddy deegan was killed that lombardo had expressed concern that the italian group because of barbozas and cassessas associations might be drawn into the mclaughlinmclean feud and because of this lombardo had told barboza and cassessa to stay away from the flemmis 19 may 10 1965 an unman mentions that barboza had previously talked with patriarca regarding unknown topic and that flemmi had told barboza that patriarca had given him an okay to kill linden may 13 1965 cassessa and barboza and henry tameleo contact patriarca barboza discusses his prospective killing of an individual by the name of otoole and the means by which he is to carry out the murder 19 the june 22 1965 entry is very long detailed recitation of the plan to murder willie marfeo patriarca is clearly the principal involved in planning the murder the killers are named as barboza and cassessa patriarca states that he would love to kill marfeo himself 20 the bureau monitor overheard the conversation between patriarca tameleo and baron on june 22 1965 in which patriarca hired baron to kill marfeo and recorded it in the log however the conversation was not picked up on the tape recorder through some inexplicable mechanical failure accordingly the bureau supervisor in boston who regularly reviewed the logs and tapes in noting that the tape had failed to record the conversation did not incorporate the information in any memoranda airtel or bureau report nor did the bureau supervisor disseminate the information to other agents 23 information about an attempt by someone other than barboza to kill marfeo was disseminated to paul rico and dennis condon 23 it should also be noted that special agent rico of the fbi did receive information on july 1 1965 from live informant that patriarca had hired joe baron to hit willie marfeo 23 on january 12 1967 the irs informant furnished information to redacted that in view of the fact that the boston organization had killed several of barons criminal associates baron might be willing to talk this information was given to walter barnes who gave it to us attorney markham and henry peterson peterson then requested barnes to arrange an interview with barboza at the earliest opportunity 24 barnes found that barboza was on trial in local court for illegal possession of firearms it was inappropriate to interview baron at this time so mr barnes returned to washington and was later advised that baron had been convicted and sentenced to four to five years on january 25 1967 and was immediately incarcerated in walpole prison mr barnes returned to boston in february 1967 at which time barnes requested special agents rico and condon of the fbi to interview baron at an appropriate time and place 24 it should be noted again that special agents rico and condon were as matter of fact never made aware of the information overheard by bureau monitor on june 22 1965 and which forms the basis of this indictment as mentioned above special agent

provide his sic with job and an unspecified sum of money however in the event it was impossible to obtain job for him because of barbozas extensive record 36 years old 17 in prison and inability to do anything it was agreed that he would be provided additional money this position was made known to barboza year has passed and we have been unable to provide barboza with job at the time he was released from protective custody he was given only 1000 in government funds however he is now almost penniless and feels that he has not been given fair chance to begin new life in addition it should be noted that fbi intelligence indicates that barboza has been recognized at his present location by an individual who knows some of the massachusetts hoodlum element barboza is now desperate he states he is without any money and feels that the government has reneged on its promise to provide him with sufficient money he has indicated that he will publicly retract his testimony given in the aforementioned cases and will make known to the press that the government did not give him fair chance to go straight in the opinion of the writers if either of the above should occur the federal

deputy usm providence ri who was in charge of barons detail to meet and talk to him at five am august twentyseventh next so that f lee bailey would not be aware of this contact donald barboza said baron made statement that there would be polygraph and that he baron was just trying to move these people for some money that his arrest in new bedford mass screwed up this move that attorney joe

82770 f lee bailey writes memorandum to joseph balliro relaying the following information this is status report of the present situation with respect to joseph barboza baron and his proposed recantation of testimony given before the superior court in commonwealth v french although i have necessarily excluded few matters as confidential between mr baron and myself he has authorized to inform you as to the matters described below as you recall when i met with baron at his request in new bedford he stated that he had felt for some time that he should make direct effort to right the injustice which his testimony had caused he indicated that he had been assured all along that especially in the murder cases conviction was unlikely and after the conviction occurred he was told to expect that due to trial errors the supreme court would reverse the cases and of course there would never be retrial therefore permanent harm would be done to anyone whereas the government would have accomplished its primary objection much publicity about prosecuting organized crime after he learned that the supreme court affirmed the convictions and discussed this fact with many friends he became persuaded that these men might be executed for something they hadnt done and therefore took steps on his own to make his feelings known to the victims of his testimony his arrest in new bedford following my agreement to represent him was of course an unanticipated and unfortunate intervening factor and has prevented from going over exhaustively with baron all of the events that led up to his trial testimony and caused it to seem credible nonetheless after many hours of conversation with him at walpole i am convinced that i have most of the details of what actually took place it appears that the reports you have described given to three different police officers in three different departments by persons other than baron correctly describe the edward teddy deegan killing and the attempt on the life of anthony stathopoulos it appears that mr roy french did in fact shoot deegan that mr ronald cassesso was present with baron in the car and conspired to kill stathopoulos but was not involved in the deegan killing and that joseph salvati and louis greco were not present at all further henry tamelio sic and peter lemone sic had nothing to do with arranging deegans murder nor had they any reason to believe that it was going to occur the person sitting in the rear of the automobile which the chelsea police captain saw was in fact bald and was vincent flemmi romeo martin in fact shot deegan but the role ascribed to greco as the third assailant of deegan in fact involved another man whose last name begins with c as you had earlier suggested to all of this information will be verified by polygraph test within the next few days but i believe that an additional affidavit from baron naming the actual participants together with statement by cassesso who has never testified would be helpful in corroboration i have had response to my letter to the attorney general asking for help in writing sic the injustice that baron has caused if the law enforcement authorities are interested in correcting the wrongful convictions which were obtained in the superior court they have the power to do so and they certainly by this time have every reason to believe that terrible mistake has been made i will do everything i can consistent with barons legal rights to aid in attaining this result i am very hopeful that before much more time goes by someone in authority will recognize the serious responsibilities to be faced and confer with about some reasonable and practical means of setting these clients free until that time there is not very much that i can do directly except to try to prevent barons continued incarceration i must be frank in saying that because of his past experience he has some feeling that he can trade his own freedom as he did before for the conviction even if wrongful of people whom the law is out to get cccxxviii santa rosas press democrat reports that raymond patriarca was granted parole by the rhode island parole board after serving

32371 edward ted harrington attorney in charge of the organized crime and racketeering section in boston writes memorandum to james featherstone deputy chief of the organized crime and racketeering section harrington notifies featherstone of his trip to california the purpose of this trip is to confer with former government witness joseph barboza baron presently imprisoned pending charge of first degree murder in keeping with the governments obligation to baron i have assured baron that this office would take all proper steps to insure that he receives fair and impartial trial on his pending murder charge this obligation must be kept in view of the fact that many law enforcement officials in the boston area consider that the pending murder charge has been concocted by the underworld as means of retaliating against baron this belief is supported by the fact that the murder investigation was initiated by information provided by cell mates of baron in massachusetts prison who advised state authorities that baron had admitted to them of his involvement in this murder these same cell mates subsequently advised the same state authorities that they have been receiving monies from attorney ronald chisholm syndicate lawyer in the boston area i have been informed that he intends to call as witness in his behalf this trip to confer with baron is important to the interests of the government in that it is fulfillment of this offices commitments to do all within its power to insure that baron suffers harm as result of his cooperation with the federal government the writer will do nothing to attempt to dissuade the prosecution from bringing its case but will alert them of the possibility that the murder is mafia frame the fulfillment of this obligation is also in the practical interests of the government as baron may otherwise determine that the government has failed him in his time of need and it is my judgment that he will then retaliate against the government by submitting false affidavits to the effect that his testimony in the patriarca and deegan cases was in fact false and thus tarnish those most significant prosecutions ccclxxxvi 32571

their possible testimony in the clay wilson murder trial the teletype reads hyland advised that hughes testified that in july 1970 baron provided him with access to bonds stolen in california the

after he had killed wilson district attorney kiernan hyland implied that hughes also told the fbi previously that baron had possession of the aforementioned bonds the february 2 1971 teletype refers

regarding the raymond patriarca tapes the federal bureau of investigation bugged the office of new englands crime boss raymond patriarca from march 1962 until july 1965 monitoring of conversations was stopped on orders from president lyndon johnson who told the public he was against obtaining evidence in this way the johnson administrations decision to assure fair play for fred black jr had repercussions throughout the country since by disclosing the complete bugging file on black the department of justice had enabled him to avoid federal prison term it had to apply the same rule now in similar cases the decision threatened to overturn the conviction of louis the fox taglianetti who had been convicted of federal incometax evasion in 1966 under the new black rule taglianetti had to be given access to any government information that dealt even remotely with him while he was under investigation in may 1967 justice department lawyers delivered the airtels of the bug in the patriarca office to chief judge edward day of the united states district court in providence judge day reviewed them all and concluded that only ten had to be made available to taglianetti and his lawyers those ten airtels appeared in the federal court record and tremor went through the east coast cosa nostra and the entire politicalcriminal world of new england p119 20 many of the conversations related to gangland murder victims samuel lindenbaum and steven hughes in middleton massachusetts joseph francione gunned down in revere and henry reddington killed in his weymouth home patriarca was told joe

in 1965 as the hit man to kill marfeo joseph barboza baron named in the tapes by henry tameleo as the man who had murdered joseph francione had decided to cooperate with the attorney generals office

testimony so long as the case originated from barons discussion and not from the fbi eavesdropping it could be used to prosecute baron voluntarily furnished statement to agents of the fbi in april of 1967 concerning the offense in 1965 p 125 bob blakey had been special prosecutor in the organized crime and racketeering section of the justice department from august 1960 until june 1964 he declared that the taglianetti airtels were far and above the best information that he had obtained i read investigation reports that were the product of the use of normal investigative methods there is just simply comparison in the two kinds of reports in light of this i find it nothing short of incredible that mr clark and others would seriously suggest that the use of electronic surveillance techniques is neither effective nor highly productive p 129 louis the fox thought he was sly when he had his lawyers request the disclosure of all fbi eavesdropping records p 130 though the bugging of patriarcas headquarters in providence had taken place when the results were not admissible evidence in state or federal courts the revelation of the ten airtels in connection with taglianettis incometax case

that barboza was not made member and he did not live by the same rules that made people do he further stated that barboza killed for the hell of it whenever he lost his temper dxliii vincent teresa writes in his book my life in the mafia the following in 1962 the federal bureau of investigation slipped an illegal electronic bug into raymond patriarcas office on atwells avenue in providence between 1962 and 1965 the fbi listened daily to patriarcas conversations with such men as henry tameleo and vincent teresa and on october 6 1966 the mortal blow was struck it was on that date that joseph the animal barboza and three colleagues were arrested by police in the heart of boston in barbozas car police found fully loaded army m1 rifle and 45 caliber pistol the law then began applying squeeze that was to force patriarca to make fatal mistakes barboza was violent uncontrollable enforcer dxliv vincent teresa writes in his book my life in the mafia that the story that has been going around about the two individuals thomas deprisco and tashe arthur bratsos who supposedly raised seventy thousand dollars for barbozas bail was not true according to teresa deprisco and bratsos went all over boston shaking down bookies and nightclubs to raise the bail barboza needed the last place they went on the shakedown trail was the 416 lounge also called the nite lite café they entered the lounge like gangbusters and asked for money to help barboza out the patrons who included larry baiona sic ralphie chong joe black and phil waggenheim refused to help deprisco and bratsos then proceeded to hold them up with gun and demanded them to empty their pockets stating well take what we want deprisco and bratsos were then killed and the mob took only 12000 from their pockets not 70000 teresa continues now what baiona sic chong and waggenheim didnt know was that there was police informer in the place guy by the name of joe lanzi he was bartender and parttime owner of the four corners bar and he was in the joint at the time bratsos and deprisco came barging in teresa further states then on april 18 1967 they caught up with the informer lanzi three of jerry angiulos enforcers benjamin dechristoforo carmine gagliardi and frank oreto were driving through medford at four in the morning in the front seat of their car was lanzi who theyd just shot once barboza heard about what was going on he got message to chico joseph amico who was his closest friend and gave him orders to whack out waggenheim the mob found out and they hit chico right outside alfonsos broken hearts club where hed been trying to put an arm on some people to help barboza barboza went wild when he heard what happened he called patriarca fag and he promised hed hit everyone in sight for killing chico henry tameleo said go see butch frank miceli of the new jersey assassination squad and get supply of shotguns and rifles barbozas got to get hit teresa also writes it wasnt long after that that barboza found out he was going to be killed i guess district attorney byrne told him and two fbi agents who were working on him paul rico and dennis condon told him they convinced him that patriarca had doublecrossed him and was going to have him killed barboza was frantic he didnt want to die and he didnt want to be an informer he hated informers dxlv vincent teresa writes in his book my life in the mafia that raymond patriarca told him and henry tameleo that joseph barboza is gonna get killed in or out of the can patriarca continued you send the word to him and thats all there is to it dxlvi vincent teresa writes in his book my life in the mafia that after he listened to raymond patriarcas tirade regarding joseph barboza teresa told barbozas friend that patriarca said wherever barboza is hes gonna get it thats all i can tell you now you can tell joe according to teresa about week later the fbi agents met with barboza again and he began talking what the hell could the guy do patriarca had shoved his back to the wall it was the dumbest play patriarca ever made if hed done what henry tameleo wanted him to do convinced barboza everything was forgiven and then when he got out of jail whacked him there wouldnt have been any trouble but when barboza started talking there was hell to pay first barboza claimed that patriarca tameleo and ronnie cassesso had conspired with him to kill willie marfeo that was true as result of barbozas testimony they were all convicted even though the actual murder was handled by the new jersey assassination squad barboza wasnt through talking though he accused tameleo cassesso roy french an angiulo enforcer lou grieco sic pete limone and joe the horse salvucci sic of planning and carrying out the teddy deegan murder i told you before how that was done i still dont think tameleo was in on that one joe the horse was just an innocent sucker who barboza didnt like but hes doing life because of what barboza said he never had anything to do with the hit dxlvii vincent teresa writes in his book my life in the mafia the following regarding barbozas involvement in the witness protection program the fbi unable to handle the job alone called in an elite trusted contingent of sixteen deputy us marshals headed by deputy marshal john partington an experienced law officer with the highest credentials for the next sixteen months the marshals would have the task of living with barboza and his family keeping them safe and in proper frame of mind for the trials that were to come during those sixteen months hoover would

before the montana parole board on june 26 1973 to testify as witness in his behalf i am the former attorney in charge of the department of justices organized crime strike force for new england and am extremely knowledgeable of bentleys contribution to law enforcement in its efforts against organized crime bentley was the chief federal government witness in the prosecution which resulted in the conviction of raymond l patriarca henry tameleo and ronald cassesso he was also the chief state of massachusetts witness in the boston gangland murder trial of edward deegan which resulted in the conviction of firstdegree murder of six major underworld figures including joseph silvati sic the conviction of patriarca is considered by knowledgeable law enforcement officials to have been the most important organized crime case in the history of new england law enforcement government witnesses john j red kelley alleged mastermind of the plymouth mail robbery and vincent c teresa who were developed by the united states subsequent to bentley and whose testimony resulted in the conviction of many major syndicate leaders in the new england area have advised that one of the reasons that they decided to cooperate with the federal government was on account of the fact that bentley had first broken the syndicates code of silence and had survived the underworlds reprisal bentleys defection from the organized underworld and his decision to become government witness against his former associates constitutes the single most important factor in the success of the federal governments campaign against organized crime in the new england area bentleys significant contribution to law enforcement as the pivotal figure in the governments effort to combat organized crime should be weighed when his eligibility for parole is considered please advise if the appearance of witnesses before the montana parole board is in conformity with your practicesdlxvi 61173 the francis

the boston field office to james j featherstone deputy chief organized crime and racketeering section mcdowell writes regarding the parole hearing for joseph barboza it is crucial that the department favorably act upon this request while i have taken conservative position on the matter of teds compensation limiting the request to reimbursement of travel expenses and per diem ted is in private practice and could use the fee according to mcdowell since barbozas parole will probably be denied it needs to be clear to him that his continued incarceration is his fault rather than any lack of diligence by the department of justice to bring the fact of his cooperation to the boards attention it is best not to give barboza the impression that the department of justice has abandoned him in light of the fact that cosa nostra lcn has continually pressured barboza to change his edward teddy deegan testimony in order to free major lcn figures the memorandum continues while the government has evidence which would eventually blunt the lcn attempt to get barboza to perjure himself on behalf of henry tameleo and peter limone this would involve us in long expensive court hearings which would do good ted harrington is the best equipped to represent us in careful responsible manner at the hearing since he has maintained complete familiarity with barbozas situation over the yearsdlxviii william b lynch chief of the organized crime and racketeering section writes memorandum to henry petersen assistant attorney general of the criminal division entitled recommendation that

the montana state penitentiary the california authorities transferred him to montana to serve out his sentence since california could not guarantee his safety barboza is due to have parole hearing

prosecutions against the leaders of new englands organized crime familydlxix 61973 joseph barboza writes letter to greg evans stating that he received letter from roy bedell on june 18 1973 bedell

due to have parole hearing before the montana board of pardons deer lodge montana on july 31 1973 the department has had an understanding with barboza that at such time as he becomes eligible for

has requested that edward f harrington be the witness at the hearing according to the memorandum harrington rico and condon were responsible for developing barboza as successful witness barboza probably will not be paroled we will take position on the desirability of his parole petersen informs it is important that it be clear to barboza that his continued incarceration is his own fault

of romeo martin who was shot and killed in july 1966 he stated that his motives for doing this were that he has grudge against patriarca and his lieutenants and wishes them to remain in jail and also because of the fact that patriarca and the new england family have contract for his death outstanding in the amount of 10000000 barboza states that romeo martin was shot and killed for two reasons first martin furnished information to suffolk county massachusetts detective billy stewart who was on patriarcas payroll concerning the shooting and death of edward teddy deegan and second prior to providing information regarding the deegan murder martin attempted to buy into and control penny arcade in which patriarca was interested without advising his lieutenant or patriarca barboza claims to have set up martin with william geraways assistance by advising him by telephone that martin was to meet with ronald cassesso and joseph dimico barboza further claims that his assignment during the martin murder was to drive backup car and immediately prior to the meeting he made the last phone call to martin giving him the time of the meeting and thus setting him up barboza stated that the murder was ordered by raymond patriarca and the plans for it were formulated by his lieutenants henry tameleo and jerry angiulo barboza also indicates that he is afraid of being returned to california

protective of their informants and that every effort was made so that informants would not be prosecuted so that the informants would continue to provide intelligence information furthermore some of the us attorneys apparently believe that the fbi wants the informants to avoid prosecution so that the informant would advance in the hierarchy of organized crime and become greater value to the fbis

new identity relocation and subsistence allowance kelley states that the reason he lied was because agent paul rico told i shouldnt tell all of these things because it looked like i was being paid that i should just do as he said and everything would come out all right kelley also testified at the lerner trial that he cut down shotgun for use in the murders however at the manocchio trial kelley admitted that his armorer actually cut down the weapon kelley said rico told him not to mention the armorers role in the murders because the armorer was an important fbi informant that rico wanted to keep on the streets in an effort to dismantle the boston group of the patriarca crime family in addition kelley testified at the lerner trial that the gang had key meeting with patriarca prior to the murders at particular restaurant however at the manocchio trial kelley admitted that the meeting did not take place at the restaurant he previously named kelley stated that rico wanted him to put the meeting at that particular restaurant to establish phony connection between patriarca and the owner of the restaurant effectively assisting rico in his investigation against the restaurant owner according to kelley the fbi had invested millions of dollars in trying to tie the owner of the restaurant to patriarca but up to that point their investigation had not been successful rico apparently
