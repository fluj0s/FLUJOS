the individuals with disabilities education act idea authorizes federal funding for the education of children with disabilities and requires as condition for the receipt of such funds the provision of free appropriate public education fape1 the statute also contains detailed due process provisions to ensure the provision of fape originally enacted in 1975 the act responded to increased awareness of the need to educate children with disabilities and to judicial decisions requiring that states provide an education for children with disabilities if they provided an education for children without disabilities2 idea has been amended veral times most recently and most comprehensively by the 1997 idea reauthorization pl 10517 congress is presently examining idea again and hr 1350 108th congress

child left behind act nclbaseveral issues relating to idea were not included in the final version of hr 1350 as passed by the house among these were mandatory full funding4 and parental choice provisions 5 definitions and allocation formula provisions definitions the definitions in current law are rgely unchanged by hr 1350 however there are few changes most notably an amendment adopted during debate on the house floor amending the definition of fape current law defines fape as meaning special education and related rvices that have been provided at public expense under public supervision nd direction and without charge b meet the standards of the state educational agen cy c include an ppropriate preschool elementary or secondary school educati on in the state involved and d are provided in conformity with the indivi dualized education pr ogram required under sec 614d6 the amendment would add the following provision at the end of section c that is reasonably calculated to provide educational be nefit to enable the child with disability to access the gene ral curriculum the intent of the amendment as expressed by colloquy durin g house floor debate is to codify the interpretation of fape containe d in the supreme court decision board of education of the hendrick hudson centra l school district v rowley 7 in addition new definition of highly qualified would be added by hr 1350 with the same meaning as the term in section 9101 of the elementary and secondary education act esea this helps to align idea with the new requirements for highly qualified teachers mandated in the child left behind act nclba8 definitions of children with disabilities for the purpose of idea were discussed during the house debate on hr 1350 an amendment offered by rep shadegg and passed on the house floor provides in part that it is the sense of congress that students who have not been diagnosed by physician or other person certified by state health board as having disab ility

concurrent resolution on the budget for fy2004 states that the reso lutions levels for function 500 accommodate 22 billion increase for part b grants to states for fy2004 and 25 billion increase for fy2005 for an fy2005 total of 136 billion p88purposes of receiving services under th at act also hr 1350 would require several gao studies on various idea issues see below one of these studies would be review of variation among th states in definitions and evaluation processes relating to the provision of services under idea to children having conditions falling under the terms emo tional disturbance other health impairments and specific learning disability9 allocation formula provisions hr 1350 would make minimal changes in idea state and substate grant formulas none of which would appear to change how idea funds are currently allocated the bill would simplify the nguage of the part b grantstostates formula for example by eliminating language on the interim formula which had been in effect before the permanent formula became effective in fy2000 after that date the interim formula would neve r become effective again hr 1350 would limit the number of children with disabilities ag 3 to 17 that are to be counted for the purposes of determining maximum state grants to 135 of all children in that age group within state10 this provision would have impact on states allocation until the state became eligible fo r its maximum grant and then only if the number of children with disabilities served was greater than 135 of all children ages 3 to 17 in the state11 the presumed impact of this change would be to discourage states from overidentifying children with disabilities to increase their maximum grants under current law part b authority for appropriations is permanent and provides for such sums as may be necessary12 hr 1350 would specify authorized amounts for part b appropriations except for the preschool program under section 619 these aut horized amounts increase annually from fy2004 111 b illion authorizeda 22 billion increase ove r the fy2003 appropriationsand fy2005 136 billion authorizeda 25 billion in crease over the fy2004 authorization13 to fy2010 252 billion authorized after fy2010 authorizations would return tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31830crs4 14 hr 1350 would also maintain the perman ent authorization of the preschool program authorized under section 619 of part b section 619j 20 usc 1419 15 this minimum amount is also in flationindexed under current law 16 current maximum state setasides vary from 83 to 115 of state grants based on data from the us department of ducation ed budget service 17 apparently if states grant was less th an its fy2003 amount current language would apply that is its maximum reserve would be its prioryear reserve increased by inflation 18 526 us 66 1999such sums for fy2011 and subsequent fiscal years thus the permanent authorization of part b grants to states is maintained14 hr 1350 would make certain changes in provisions governing state reserves for administration and other statelevel activities under current law the maximum amounts states may reserve fro m their part b grants for administration and for state level activities are determined by increasing the prioryear reserve by the lesser of the rate of inflation or the percentage increase if any in state grants since appropriations for the part b grantstostates program have been growing at rates well above inflation the state reserv have been increased from year to year by inflation of this amount states may reserve for state administration 20 or minimum of about 57000015 whichever is greater currently these provisions mean that states can retain for state purposes on average about 10 of their state grants and about 2 of state grants on average for ad ministration but these percentages vary somewhat from state to stat and under current law w ill almost certainly change probably decreasing in the future16 although hr 1350 apparently retains curre ntlaw language re lated to state set asides it would add language based on an accepted floor amendment offered by reps mckeon and woolsey th at appears to override pr ovisions on how much states can reserve for statewide activities based on this language for any fiscal year for which states part b grant is equal to or greater than its fy2003 grant hr 1350 would set the maximum state could retain for statelevel activities at the amount it retained in fy200317 in addition hr 1350 would increase the state minimum for administration to 750000 however this minimum amount would not be inflation adjusted as it is in current law hr 1350 would allow states to use up to 40 of the amount reserved for state level activities for establishing and imple menting cost or risk sharing funds consortia or cooperatives to assist local educational ag encies in providing high cost special education and related services this provision together with the permitted use of local funds discusse d below addresses the issu of educating children with low incidence high cost disabilities this issue gained increased prominence

district v garret f the individuals with disabilities education act and related services 20 hr 1350 would maintain the requirement unde r current law for states to use portion of increases in state grants for local capacity building and improvement grants often termed sliver grants sec 611f4 20 usc 1411f4 21 20 usc 1412aservices held that the extensive services required by garret f must be provided by the school as long as they were not medi cal services that must be provided by physician19 current law specifies uses for reserves for statelevel activities including providing direct services to children with disabilities administering monitoring and complaint resolution and establishing the mediation process hr 1350 would add several permitted uses of funds for stat elevel activities in cluding implementing voluntary binding arbitrati on and developing and ma intaining prereferral educational support syst em discussed below20 hr 1350 would require states to distribute the remaining amount to cal educational agencies leas state and local eligibility state eligibility section 612a of idea provides for stat eligibility if the state demonstrates to the satisfaction of the secretary that the state has in effect policies and procedures to ensure that it meets each of the followi ng conditions these conditions include the core requirements of idea for the provision of fape and an individualized education program iep21 hr 1350 would change the language of section 612a by striking demonstrates to the sa tisfaction of and inserting reasonably demonstrates to the exact implications of this change are not clear however reasonably demonstrates to would appear to be less stringent requirement than the current law version of demonstrating to the satisfaction of the secretary the house report discusses this change and indicates that it was made in response to concern about the depa rtment of education overemphasizing compliance with process the report states the bill includes language modifying the standard of oversight to allow states to reasonably demonstrate to the secretary that the state has in effect policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the act the committee does not intend this to imply that states do not need to implement effective policies or pro cedures under the act or demonstrate the existence of effective policies and procedures the chan ge in language is not intended to provide rationalization to states for failure to effectively implement the act instead the change is intended to ensure that the secretary is focused on ensuring overall compliance with the act and not forcing stat to change individual words or phraseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31830crs6 22 hrept 10877 at 94 23 for further information on nclb see crs

would amend requirement s for state personnel standards and performance goals and indicators to align them with nclba requirements for example states would have to ensure that special education

refers to the statutory requirement that the states are obligated to identify locate and evaluate children with disabilities section 612a3 20 usc 1412a3schools including parochial schools and th requirements regarding child find are applicable to such children28 currently idea provides that when ch ildren with disabilities are placed in or referred to private schools by public agencies the costs are to be paid by the public agency29 and under current law court or hearing officer may require an educational agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of the enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made fape available to the child in timely manner prior to the enrollment30 current law allows for limitations on reimbursement in certain situations such as notice that parents are required to provide or when there is judicial termination of unreasona bleness with respect to actions taken by the parents31 current law also provides for exceptions to this notice requirement where the cost of reim bursement may not be reduced or denied for failure to provide notice if 1 the parent is illiterate 2 compliance would result in physical or serious emotional harm to the child 3 the school prevented the parent from providing such notice or 4 the parents had not received the notice that the educational agency wa s required to provide32 hr 1350 would not change the genera l requirement that states spend proportionate amount of idea funds on ch ildren who are unilaterally pl aced in private schools by their parents howeve r the bill would make number of other changes the committee report notes that the bill clarifies that the proportional amount of money obliged to be used to pr ovide special educati on and related services to children in the state with disabilities who have been pl aced by their parents in private schools must be used to provide some direct services33 the house bill also contains specific provisions relating to child find34 would add requirements concerning consultation and right to appeal and would make changes to the requirements concerning when the parents of the child with disability are to be reimbur

schools be completed in time period comparable to that for other students atte nding public schools consultation by the local education agency or the state educational agency with representatives of children parentally placed in privat schools would be required private school official woul d have the right to complain to the state educational agency that the local educational agency did not

requirements would likely result in physical harm to the child hr 1350 also would provide that reimbursement may not be reduced in the discretion of court or hearing officer for failure by the parents to provide notice if the parent is illiterate or cannot write in english or compliance with the requirement would likely result in serious emotional harm to the child local agency eligibility hr 1350

exception that leas can count up to 20 of the increase in their idea grants from one year to the next as meeting sns and moe requirements with the addition that these increased idea funds could then be used to provide additional funding fo r esea programs hr 1350 would modify state oversight of this provision under cu rrent law the sea may prohibit an lea from exercising this provision if it determines that local educational agency is not meeting the requirements of th is part hr 1350 would require the sea if authorized by state law to prohibit lea from exercising this provision if it determines that local educational agency is unable to establish and maintain programs of free appropria public education hr 1350 would also add veral activities to permitted uses of funds provided to local educational agency for exam ple hr 1350 would allow these funds to be used for reasonable additional expe nsesof any necessary accommodations to allow children with disabilities who are be ing educated in school identified for school improvement to be provided supplemental edu cational services this section would help to align idea to the requirements of the child left behind act nclba35 other activities permitted under hr 1350 include establishing mechanisms to fund high cost special ducation and related services purchasinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31830crs9 36 hr 1350 would add these

requirements in subparagraph 2a regarding prohibitions against supplanting nd reduction of local expenditures for special education by adding activities to paragraph 4 it would appear that funds used

that an lea could undertake include provision of educational and behavioral services and support including scientifically based literacy instruction and professional velopment for teachers to provide such services the bill notes that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to either limit or create right to free appropriate public ducation under this part evaluations and individualized education programs ieps provisions relating to evaluations nd assessments and the iep would be amended by hr 1350 hr 1350 would also add new section regarding determining when child has specific learning disability and prohibiting the use of discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability current law requires informed parental consent prior to the evaluation to determine whether child qua lifies under idea it also provides some leeway to an lea if parent does not consent but it is deemed necessary to evaluate the child hr 1350 would expand the leas flexibility if the parent does not provide consent or the parent does not respond to request from the lea to provide consent in those cases the lea may proceed with an initial evaluation in addition if the parent does not provide consen t for idea services or fails to respond to the leas request the lea shall not provide special education and related services under such circumstances the lea is not obligated to hold an iep meeting or prepare an iep in addition the lea shall not be considered to be in violation of any requirement under this part including the requirement to make available free appropriate public

safeguards introduction idea contains detailed pro cedural safeguards designed to ensure the provision of fape however these safeguards have been criticized as encouraging litigiousness and decreasing trust between parents of children with disabilities and schools one of the goals of hr 1350 is to reduce litigation and restore trust between parents and school systems38 and in an attempt to reach this goal hr 1350 would make significant changes in the procedural safeguards that are currently available to parents of children with disabilities statute of limitations and procedural safeguards

resolution sessions current law re quires state or local educational agency to ensure that procedures are establishe d to allow for the resolution of disputes through mediation at minimum when due

to discipline school personnel have several options these include suspension for up to ten days placement in an interim alternativ education setting for up to forty five days for situations i nvolving

curriculum and to progress toward iep goals for not more than 45 school days to the ex tent such alternativ and such duration would be applied to children without di sabilities in addition this action may include consideration of uni circumstances on case bycase basis hr 1350 specifically states that this change in placement could last beyond 45 school days if required by state law or regulation for the violation in question to ensure the safety and appropriate educa tional atmosphere in the schools hr 1350 would delete the requirement in current law that determin ation be made concerning whether childs action was manifestation of his or her disability and also would delete the provision in current law that if the childs behavi or was not manifestation of the childs disability the relevant di sciplinary procedures app licable to children without disabilities may be applied to the child in the same manner in which they would be applied to children without disabilities except that ducational services may not cease47 in addition hr 1350 would add provision to the section on personnel preparation programs to include providing high quality professional development for principals superintendents and other administrators one of the types of training specifically mentioned is behavioral supports in the school and classroomhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31830crs15 48 20 usc

provide the number of children with disabilities who are subject to longterm suspensions or expulsions would be amended to include data by race ethnicity and disability category in addition the

hr 1350 which states that it is the nse of the congress that safe and drugfree schools are essential for the learning and development of childre n with disabilities another amendment offered by rep sh

health board as having disab ility should be subject to the regular school disciplinary code oversight and administrative provisions monitoring withholding and judicial review hr 1350 would make substan tial changes to section 61648 this section currently entitled withholding and judi cial reviewrequire s the secretary of education to withhold some or all of stat part b funding if there has been failure by the state to comply substantially with any provision of this part or if an lea or sea fails to comply with its conditions of eligibility under part b49 in addition the section provides fo r judicial review if stat is dissatisfied with the secretarys final action with respect to the eligibility of the state under section 61250 hr 1350 would retain these provisions but would add new monitoring and enforcement provisions hr 1350 would require the secretary to monitor the implementation of this act using focus ed monitoring which would concentrate on improving educational results for all children with disabilities while ensuring compliance with program requirements the bill would require the secretary to monitor specified state indicators of educational outcomes for children with disabilities such as academic achievement graduation rate s and dropout rates the secretary could also review other permitted indicators such as the implementation of education of children with disabilities in the least restrictive environment and the transition of children with disabilitie s from special education to postschool experiences eg postsecondary education and employmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31830crs16 51 20 usc 1417 52 20 usc 1415b3if the secretary determines that state is not making satisfactory progress in improving educational results for children with disabilities one or more actions must be taken including provision of t echnical assistance nd withholding between 20 and 50 of the amount state may reta in for statelevel activities if the secretary determines that state is not in substantial compliance with any provision of this part additional ac tions would be required such as requiring the preparation of corrective action plan or improvement plan imposing special conditions on the states grant and furt her withholding of funds for statelevel activities if special conditions have been imposed and state has not corrected violations after 3 consecutive years the secretary shall take such additional enforcement actions based on specified actions in the bill ed administration in addition to amendments to s ection 616 hr 1350 would amend current section 61751 regarding the administration of idea to provide for pilot program on paperwork and to require th publication of model forms hr 1350 would add provision authorizing the secretary of ducation to grant waivers of paperwork requirements for period of time not to ex ceed four years with respect to not more than ten states based on proposals submitte d by states for addressing reduction of paperwork and noninstruc tional time spent fulfilling statutory and regulatory requirements the secretary also would be required to include in the annual report information relating to the effectiveness of the waivers hr 1350 also would require the secr etary to publish and disseminate model iep form model form for the procedural safeguards notice and model form for the prior written notice in section 615b352 preschool infants and toddlers and national programs hr 1350 appears to make only relativel modest changes to section 619 which authorizes services for preschool children with disa bilities and to part c which authorizes services for infants and toddlers with disabilities for example hr 1350 would include certain children with disabilities ages 3 to 5 in the definition of an infant or toddler with disability and ba sed on an approved floor amendment offered by rep nethercutt would modify the excep tion in part c that infants and toddlers with disabilities be served in natural nvironments ie with nondisabled infants and toddlers under current law the excep tion to this requirement occurs only when early intervention cannot be achieved satisf actorily in natural environment hr 1350 would add to this exception or in setting that is most appropriate as determined by the parent and the individualized family service plan teamhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31830crs17 part d which authorizes national activities has been substantially revised in brief some of the changes are matter of rearranging language for example part d of current law provides findings in veral sections while hr 1350 places all findings at the beginning of the partinc luding some findings in current law and adding some new findings hr 1350 conti nues some provisions of part d although sometimes with substantial changes for example the bill woul d retain the state competitive grants program authorized under s ubpart 1 of part d however it would focus these grants on professional development activities even more than current law does by requiring that at least 90 of the grants be used for these activities current law requires 75 of funds be used to sure sufficient numbers of skilled and knowledgeable special education personnel hr 1350 would continue other provisions of part d without change for example the bill would continue to authorize grants for community parent resource centers to help ensure that underserved pa rents of children with disabilities have the training and information they need to enable them to participate effectively in helping their children with disabilities finally hr 1350 would add new provisions to part d for example the bill would establish national center for special education research to conduct research on improving special education and related services for children with disabilities gao reports in addition to the amendments to idea discussed above hr 1350 would require the general accounting office gao to undertake series of reports on idea and special education these include review of federal and selected state and local re quirements related to idea that result in excessive paperwork review of differences among th states in the definition and identification of certain groups of children with disabilitiesfor example those identified as emo tionally disturbed or specific
