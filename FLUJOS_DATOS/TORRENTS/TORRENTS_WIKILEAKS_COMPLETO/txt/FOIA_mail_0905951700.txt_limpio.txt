from gjjenkinsmetogovuk to mhulmeueaacuk subject re wgi emissionsscenarios conference date wed 16 sep 1998 0915 0000 gmt mike i think the problem is the same one as in 1988 and 1994 in order to answer the question what is ipccs best estimate of climate change over the next hundred years and the uncertainties we need single best estimate of emissions plus range of uncertainty in the same way as modellres say here is our best estimate of climate sensitivity plus range then the sres group should do the same thing of course they can make all the usual disclaimers and talk about surprises just as the climate modellers do but not to come up with an estimate for business as usual emissions scenario plus range of 6gtc to 30gtc at 2100 seems to be ducking responsibilities getting away from single number answers is very laudable scientifically but it presents policymakers for whome the whole ipcc exercise is undertaken with problem as long as there is central estimate and range the surely both communities could be happy as they ultimately were with bau in 1990 and is92a in 1995 geoff original message from mhulmeueaacuk sent 15 september 1998 2023 to scenarios subject wgi emissionsscenarios conference dear all here are three comments on the questions raised by wgi tsu on 7 sept and by some of the other contributions to the discussion about scenarios for ipcc tar i am commenting from the perspective of climate scenario constructor servicing the impacts research community 1 the sres working group have identified 4 marker scenarios out of much larger range although these 4 largely capture the range i think the choice is good i do not see why some modelling centres should not be able to run all 4 emissions scenarios through their gcm from an impacts perspective i believe this would be very desirable and would enable fair range of climate change scenarios to be used in impacts work using direct gcm output without the need for scaling and if all four markers could be run through more than one gcm ie with different climate sensitivities then impacts work would have an even better sample of the possible climate change space to analyse these aspects of uncertainty seem to to be critical for impacts people and integrated assessors to explore to get us away from single number answers 2 if single emissions scenario has to be adopted by some gcm groups b2 seems to have the recommendation from naki and maybe sres too the storyline refers to it as dynamics as usual i think there are probably good reasons why so2 emissions fall so much in this storyline regional rather than global solutions and the encouragement of environmental protection the fact that the reduced c emissions relative to is92a are offset by the big fall in so2 emissions the net global warming in b2 is actually slightly higher than is92a if aerosol effects are included should simply be seen as reflection of more carefully worked out storyline than was the case with is92a i do not think it good idea indeed i think it would be very bad idea for gcm centres to mixandmatch elements of is92 and sres98 scenarios the tar should try and stick with the sres stories and emissions wherever possible the internal consistency in these storylines and hopefully emissions is important to maintain especially later on for impacts work and the thinking behind the sres scenarios is considerably better than was achieved in the is92 scenarios 3 the problem of different markers having different 1990 emissions values and the fact that 1990s c emissions diverge from those observed is more serious by 2000 the four markers range in c emissions from energy sources from 66gtc b1 to 80 gtc a1 given where we are right now about 67gtc in 1997 it seems daft to have such range for only 2 years hence as tom wigley has pointed out for example by the time tar is published we will know that a1 c emissions for 2000 are too high by say 15 surely we need to impose fix on all 4 markers to account for this such amendment may occur as result of the sres openprocess but this will take up to 12 months to be agreed and published should not someone wgi or wgiii tsus impose temporary solution now for climate modellers similarly something needs to be done for ch4 and n20 1990 emissions ch4 1990 emissions range from 281 to 481tg in the 4 markers compared with 506tg in is92 surely this range is not defendable i think at the least we need some assurance from sres that there has been some investigation into these differences and that they will withstand scientific scrutiny in peer review again maybe the openprocess may lead to revisions but what do climate modellers do in the meantime by the way the difference in global warming by 2100 that the sres ch4 and n2o scenarios generates relative to those in is92a is between 005 and 03degc lower in all cases mike dr mike hulme reader in climatology tel 44 1603 593162 climatic research unit fax 44 1603 507784 school
