classified by anne w patterson for reasons 14 bd 1 c summary during september 13 meeting with the deputy secretary president musharraf reiterated his intention absent intervention by the chief justice to be reelected before october 15 by the current national and provincial assemblies he explained the nature and required solutions to what he described as the very different threats posed by qaeda the taliban and extremism he expressed frustration that the media and some in washington did not adequately understand the complex realities of these threats and were questioning pakistans commitment to combat them musharraf supported speedy followup to the peace jirga by choosing the right people to participate in the subjirgas musharraf also urged the us not to undermine the agreement to sell pakistan f16 aircraft end summary 2 c the deputy secretary accompanied by ambassador sca assistant secretary richard boucher and sct coordinator dell dailey met president musharraf on september 13 musharraf congratulated negroponte on leading successful second session of the uspakistan strategic dialogue septel musharraf outlined his priorities as 1 on the political front to smooth the run up to his reelection as president and then complete parliamentary elections and 2 after the elections to focus on political reconciliation good governance sustaining economic growth and fighting terrorism reelection scenario 3 c musharraf said that he expected xxxxxxxxxxxx in attempting to disqualify musharraf as candidate he said that he could be reelected in uniform and before the current assemblies legally and constitutionally the only question is whether he will take off his uniform before or after he takes office again but it would depend on xxxxxxxxxxxx musharraf was hoping that he could engage with him in positive way in terms of the pending cases musharraf said the process of the presidential election would require 18 days to finish by the october 15 deadline the process must begin at the latest on september 27 musharraf reiterated that he has the majority of votes required in the current national and provincial assemblies but it cast moral doubt on the election if the opposition resigned masse 4 c on the deportation of former prime minister nawaz sharif the deputy secretary noted that the administration understood what had happened but not everyone in the us appreciated the nuances of pakistani politics it was important for musharraf to be as inclusive as possible and ensure elections were free and fair 5 c musharraf said that after the elections it would be important to include jamiat ulemaeislam juif leader fazlur rehman in the governing coalition musharraf described him as moderate and pliable it would be important especially if the agreement with bhutto succeeds to avoid the optics of religious vs nonreligious political groupings and rehman can be helpful in splitting the religious parties afghanistanindia 6 c negroponte noted the successful trilateral meeting he hosted on september 11 for pakistan and afghan presidential advisors tariq aziz and rassoul he said he was encouraged by what he saw as the shifting attitude and lower rhetoric of president karzai towards pakistan he urged that both sides name and organize meetings of the subjirga groups that had been agreed at the peace jirga 7 c musharraf said he agreed and will go ahead with selecting pakistans group of 25 for the subjirga these should be the right people with good influence but he suggested it would be even better to have jirga with five to six participants on both sides to lead their fellow tribesmen pakistan had raised this idea with kabul the most important outcome of the peace jirga according to islamabad 00004085 002 of 003 musharraf was the afghan recognition that they needed to talk to the opposition and this would be more successful with smaller subjirga group 8 c musharraf asked the us to intervene on one issue of real concernthe deliberate attempt of kabul and new delhi to destabilize balochistan he insisted that pakistan had ample proof that india and afghanistan were involved in efforts to provide weapons training and funding for baloch extremists through brahamdagh bugti and baloch marri two baloch nationalists who were living in kabul we have letters instructing who to give what weapons to whom musharraf said he had raised this with karzai who replied give time and i will address it musharraf said he was still waiting assistant secretary boucher noted that he had recently raised the issue with rassoul musharraf added if india wants to continue lets see what our options will be negroponte asked if after the elections there was possibility to move forward on negotiations with india musharraf said yes especially on kashmir where the population was getting restless fata qaeda taliban extremism are different problems 9 c negroponte noted that he had just received embassy islamabads briefing on our plans to support the gop integrated security and development plan for the federally administered tribal areas fata musharraf said the gop strategy was good but its application would take time and patience noting statements by the media and some administration officials musharraf said that pakistan did not need to be told by the us to take more action against terrorism because we know it is in our own interests he said he gives this message every day everywhere to thousands in pakistan and they are starting to listen 10 c musharraf outlined the differing threats of qaeda the taliban and extremism these he asserted were three distinct issues that too often are confused by the media or lowerlevel us officials who do not understand the complexities of the challenge pakistan is facing qaeda is in the mountains especially in north and south waziristan and bajaur and the gop is trying to deal with the locals to get them out the gop is telling the locals to avoid the trouble that comes with associating with foreigners and there has been some success especially in expelling the uzbeks now musharraf wants the tribes to expel the arabs the strategy is to do selected attacks and follow up with political efforts here too fazlur rehman can help but the mountains absorb lots of troops so in the shortterm musharraf has put brigade in north waziristan and two more in the settled areas on the fata border at some later point the gop will move troops into south waziristan the goal there was to break baitullah mehsud and his organization 11 c turning to the taliban musharraf said this was different issue pakistan could fight qaeda with troops but the taliban were being supported by locals opposed to the foreign presence in afghanistan military action against these locals explained musharraf would require fighting against our own people and this was very sensitive so the gop was reinforcing the borders and telling the locals they had right to cross the border this problem required combined military political and administrative solution on the politics again fazlur rehman could help musharraf speculated however that if washington heard he was meeting with rehman he would be accused of aiding and abetting religious extremists on the administrativedevelopment side musharraf said he was reinvigorating the political agent system building boarding schools that could remove students from extremist influence and creating jobs in the marble and olive oil industries foreign secretary khan reiterated pakistans concern about including article 347 and 348 on textiles cotton trousers in pending reconstruction opportunity zone roz legislation musharraf noted that pakistan was also expanding and better equipping the frontier corps levies and khassadar forces 12 c musharraf described extremism in pakistani society as yet another facet of the challenge and this required islamabad 00004085 003 of 003 changing mindsets he had attacked the problem in several ways the gop had increased control over mosques banning loudspeakers collection plates posters and distribution of projihad literature the police now understood the importance of this activity there had been 90 percent success in shutting down these activities musharraf said he had banned 23 organizations some before 911 but they keep changing their names so this was constant challenge he has had some success on madrassa reform by introducing new curricula and registering 75 percent of madrassas with the government the gop has introduced new secular subjects 70 percent of the registered madrassas have accepted the new program and some have begun teaching these new secular subjects 13 c musharraf thanked the us for approving the fiveyear 750 million plan for fata projects but said that the projects and rozs had not yet materialized negroponte noted that we were making progress on the roz legislation and had actually proposed more than 750 million over five years in assistance the funding process moves slowly but the pakistanis would be seeing results soon musharraf replied that the perceptions were different in pakistan and said that us statements and the 911 commission legislation showed that the us had doubts about pakistans intentions why musharraf wondered again did the media and the us believe he was playing double game and not doing enough f16s dont violate our deal 14 c in closing musharraf said that the pakistan air force was upset over what they felt was the us undermining by design the agreement to sell pakistan f16s musharraf said dont violate this deal as it would unnecessarily upset bilateral relations 15 u the deputy secretarys staff has cleared this message patterson
