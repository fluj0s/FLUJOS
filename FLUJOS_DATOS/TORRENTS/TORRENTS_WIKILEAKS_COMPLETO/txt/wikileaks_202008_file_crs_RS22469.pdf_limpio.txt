intelligence reform and terro rism prevention act of 2004 requires the treasury secretary to issue regulations mandating the reportin g of crossborder transmittals by certain financial institutions25 and to submit report to congress on the treasury departments efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing26 is the publication of classified information criminal act whether the publication of information related to the treasurys monitoring program is illegal depends on whether it falls within the definition of one of the categories of information protected by statute and is committed with the requisite intent27 the most pertinent of these statutes would seem to be the espionage act of 191728 which protects information related to the national defense by prohibiting the gathering as well as the willful communication delivery or transmission of such information to any person not entitled to receive it with the intent or reason to be lieve the information will be used against the united states or to the benefit of foreign nation29 the courts give deference to the executive determination of what constitutes defense information30 but the text of the statute seems to indicate that information related to the military establishment was the primary object of the law information that is made available by the government to the public is not covered under the prohibition in any event because public availability of such information negates the badfaith intent requirement31on the other hand the constitution protects the public right to acce ss government information and to express opinions regarding the functioning of the g overnment the first amendment to the us constitution provides congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press 32 although the supreme court has he ld that the government may regulate the content of constitutionally protected speech in order to promote compelling interest 33 it has been reluctant to enjoin the press from publishing information especially that relating to news and commentary on current events34 what international law may be implicated by the program the united nations participation act unpa35 which authorizes the president to implement measures ordered by the united nations s ecurity council may pr ovide some authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22469crs6 36 section 5 of the unpa 22 usc 287c provides in pertinent part that notwithstanding the provisions of any other law whenever the united states is called upon by the security council to apply measures which said c ouncil has decided pursuant to article 41 of said charter are to be employed to give effect to its decisions under said charter the president may to th extent necessary to apply such measures through any agency which he may designate and under such orders rules and regulations as may be prescribed by him in vestigate regulate or prohibit in whole or in part economic relations or rail sea air postal telegraphic radio and other means of communication between any foreign country or any national thereof or any person therein and the united states or any person subject to the jurisdiction thereof or involving any property subject to the jurisdiction of the united states 37 sres1269 oct 19 1999 38 sres1373 sep 28 2001calling on member states to work together to suppress terrorist financing share intelligence on terrorism and implementthe relevant international conventions and protocols to combat terrorism 39 ga res 109 gaor 54th sess supp 49 at 408 doc a5449 1999 for the activity36 the security council which plays lead role in determining threats to the international peace and security has declared that international terrorism is such threat and has called upon member stat to cooperate with each other to prevent and suppress terrorist acts to pr event and suppress in their territories through all lawful means the prepara tion and financing of any acts of terrorism and to exchange information in accordance with in ternational and domestic law and cooperate on administrative and judicial matters in order to prevent the commission of terrorist acts37 following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states the security council reite rated its earlier pronouncements ca lling upon the member states to cooperate in the fight against terrorism in pa rticular by adopting m easures to suppress the funding of terrorism and adhering to intern ational agreements pertaining to the same38 among such agreements is the internationa l convention for the suppression of financing terrorism adopted by the united nations general assembly in 1999 which obligates states party to take measures to identify discover freeze or seize the moneys used or intended for use to finance terrorist attacks of an international character39 the obligations of state parties extend to activities of their own citizens related to international terrorism and to terrorist acts that may take place outside of their own territory the unpa therefore appears to cover the type of monitoring at issue at least so long as the measures are calibrated to monitor only transactions that are reasonably related to an investigation of possible terrorist financing and are otherwise constitutional has congress responded on june 29 2006 the house of representative passed hres 895 voicing support for the tr easury terrorist finance tracking program as lawful condemning the unaut horized disclosure of classi fied information and calling upon news media organizations not to disclose classified intelligence programs another resolution was introduced hres 904 comme nding the american press for its service in keeping the public informed of government activity on july 11
