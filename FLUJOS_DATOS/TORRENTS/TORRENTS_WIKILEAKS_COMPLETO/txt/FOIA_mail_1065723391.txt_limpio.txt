mannvirginiaedu hi tom my understanding of the papers from the borehole community ever since the 1997 grl article by huang et is that they longer believe that the data has proper sensitivity to variations prior to about ad 1500in fact i dont believe anyone in that community now feels they can meaningfully go farther back that that huang contributed the section on boreholes in chapter 2 for ipcc 2001 and wrote the very words to that effect now the possible influences on boreholes might lead to inferred trends in gst that are different from those in sat is different one number of independent recently published papers by beltrami et stiglitz et mann and schmidt and others have demonstrated that there should be expectations for significant differences between past sat what we care about and gst variations what boreholes in the best case scenario see due to snowcover influences etc we dont have time to discuss that in this very short piece so i tried as briefly as possible to cover our bases on this issue in way that doesnt really stir up the pot w the borehole folks im interested in any further thoughts on the above mike at 1238 pm 10903 0400 tom crowley wrote hi i dont understand why we cannot cite the borehole data for the mwp that in sense is the only legitimate data set that shows 1 c cooling from the mwp to the lia forget the deforestation problem for the moment that is later in time if the borehole data for the mwp are legitimate then there is still case for concluding that the mwp was significantly warmer than the lia tom thanks phil few brief responses and inquiries below cheers mike at 0417 pm 10903 0100 phil jones wrote mike away oct 1116 so here are few comments few times the tone could be little less antagonistic we dont want to inflame things any further so remove the word laundry fair enough you should have seen the first draft i wrote this is quite toned down now 1 with the boreholes do we want to get one of the borehole group to sign up eg henry pollack would add lot of weight to the last 500 year argument this has merit unfortunately though i think it might open up hornets nest of the author list is not identical to the original list of authors on the eos article other thoughts on this 2 on the uhi there was paper in very recent issue of j climate by tom peterson arguing for the usa that this is nonexistent issue with uhi is one of large versus local scale one station doesnt influence largescale averages all studies which look at the uhi comprehensively find very little effect an order of magnitude smaller than the warming also the warming in the 20th century is very similar between the nh and sh and between the land and ocean components let see if i can fit one or two sentences in on this and keep the article under the length also if we cant estimate temperature histories accurately then sb cant say it was warmer in their mwp period they believe the 20th century instrumental data when they want to yes one of large number of amazing contradictions in their reasoning 3 keith is away till next week i doubt we will have the space to do the tree issues justice best just to say that there are an equal number of non treebased proxy series i do think we need to address their spurious description of the putative biological effects any way that you can get in touch w keith for response perhaps just to this one point also malcolm might want to comment on the current wording 4 ray malcolm and henry diaz have science perspectives piece coming out in the next couple of weeks on the mwpe this is also relevant good 5 dont think we will get away with the last paragraph whether we want it is an issue shouldnt we be sticking to the science ok i wasnt sure myselfyet it is powerful rebuke and reminds people that the objection to the validity of their work goes beyond just our articleand thats important does someone want to try to rephrase this paragraph maybe reducing it to couple sentences cheers phil at 2137 08102003 0400 michael mann wrote dear coauthors attached is draft response incorporating suggestions kevin tom w and michael ive aimed to be as brief as possible but hard to go much lower than 750 words and still address all the key issues 750 words by the way is our allotted limit looking forward to any comments feel free to send an edited version if you prefer and ill try to assimilate all of the suggested edits and suggestions into single revised draft if you can get comments to within the next couple days that would be very helpful as were working on late october deadline for the final version thanks for your continued help mike ______________________________________________________________ professor michael mann department of environmental sciences
