claims to control much of south ossetia fighting continues ref tbilisi 1337 classified by ambassador john f tefft for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary president saakashvili in an august 8 conversation with the ambassador and foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili in briefing to the diplomatic corps claimed that georgia now controlled most of south ossetia including tskhinvali although fighting was continuing near the northern town of dzhava they also reported that russian aircraft had dropped bombs on several targets in georgia outside of the conflict zone at two locations in the center of gori and dropped ordnance on radar installation near gori and police station in kareli there are uncofirmed georgian claims that they downed russian aircraft in statement the russian mfa denied this fighting had continued throughout the night of august 7 resuming four hours after president saakashvili unilaterally declared ceasefire at 1900 in second address august 8 he called on the international community to help repel this open russian aggression and announced general mobilization of reserves meanwhile russian statements have accused the georgians of targeting russian peacekeepers the georgians argue that the south ossetians are firing on the russian peacekeepers as provocation the georgians have announced that safe corridor and ceasefire will be established from 3 to 6 pm local time for all civilians interested in leaving tskhinvali to do so during the night of august 8 four short range ballistic missiles were fired from within russia toward tskhinvali 2 c we understand that at this point the georgians control 75 percent of tskhinvali and 11 villages around it journalists report that georgian forces are moving toward the roki tunnel that road has been cratered by georgian aircraft to make it difficult we are told fighting continues with russian fighters north of tskhinvali it is not clear if they are regular army or north caucasian irregulars saakashvili has said that georgia had intention of getting into this fight but was provoked by the south ossetians and had to respond to protect georgian citizens and territory meanwhile the georgian national security council nsc has formally requested 1000 of its combat troops in iraq be returned to georgia within 72 hours end summary 3 c comment all the evidence available to the country team supports saakashvilis statement that this fight was not georgias original intention key georgian officials who would have had responsibility for an attack on south ossetia have been on leave and the georgians only began mobilizing august 7 once the attack was well underway as late as 2230 last night georgian mod and mfa officials were still hopeful that the unilateral ceasefire announced by president saakashvili would hold only when the south ossetians opened up with artillery on georgian villages did the offensive to take tskhinvali begin post has eyes on the ground at the ministry of interior command post in tbilisi and will continue to provide updates the embassy held an eac and will hold another to reasses the situation by cob we have issued warden message and are looking at the situation very carefully if the georgians are right and the fighting is mainly over the real unknown is what the russian role will be and whether there is potential for the conflict to expand end comment current situation 4 c saakashvili who told the ambassador that he was in gori when russian bomb fell in the city center confirmed that the georgians had not decided to move ahead until the shelling intensified and the russians were seen to be amassing forces on the northern side of the roki tunnel he said that the georgian military action had been successful tskhinvali was mainly under georgian control and that reservists would be brought in to defend the city while armed forces were moved further north to continue the fighting according to saakashvili the eu was sending in carl bildt and the lithuanian foreign minister to tbilisi although most in the georgian government believed that the fighting had started as ploy of facto leader kokoity saakashvili was now concerned that this might have been russian pretext and further attack could be expected the foreign minister briefed the diplomatic corps on the situation noting that all red lines had been crossed but expressing hope that negotiations could take place and noting that full amnesty would be offered to anyone involved in the fighting she called on the international community to put pressure on the russian government to take action tbilisi 00001341 002 of 002 5 c the battle in south ossetia took place throughout the night of august 7 during the night four short range ballistic missiles were fired from within russia toward tskhinvali on august 8 russian aircraft flew into georgian airspace in central georgia and dropped ordnance on radar installation near gori and police station in kareli post understands that at this point the georgians control 75 percent of tskhinvali and 11 villages around it journalists report that georgian forces are moving toward the roki tunnel that road has been cratered by georgian aircraft to make it difficult to navigate with vehicles we are told fighting continues with russian fighters north of tskhinvali it is not clear if they are regular army or north caucasian irregulars as an moia spokesman said that approximately 1500 uniformed unidentified forces with tanks and artillery entered south ossetia via the roki tunnel on august 8 at 0200 reports indicate many casualties but none are reliably accurate state minister of conflict settlement and reintegration temuri yakobashvili said again on august 8 that georgia will grant amnesty to all ossetian fighters chronology of events 6 c on august 7 at 1925 yakobashvili returned from the conflict zone and the ambassador that the south ossetians continued to shoot at the georgian villages despite the announcement of the ceasefire yakobashvili said that he waited with general kulakhmetov the head of the russian peacekeepers in tskhinvali for some time for the south ossetians to show up kulakhmetov tried to call chochiev and other south ossetians to get them together with yakobashvili but they did not respond kulakhmetov said he does not control anything and that the south ossetians were shooting at the georgians behind my back yakobashvili said that the russians originally agreed to host bilateral meeting with the ossetians and the georgians outside the jcc popov came to georgia for this purpose and announced publicly it was his intention to do so then the russians flipped and said the meeting should be under the jcc yakobashvili said it was the jcc system that had caused the mess and it was time for real face to face talks 7 c osce observers on the ground in tskhinvali told poloff that georgias attack on tskhinvali began at 2335 on august 7 despite the ceasefire declared at 1900 the shelling intensified at 2345 with the georgians possibly using large caliber mortars and grad artillery with impacts every 1520 seconds and the south ossetians returning fire by observers calculations by 0035 there were at least 100 hits on the city of tskhinvali some of them damaging the osce field office there currently the osce has electricity but part of the building has sustained damage and the internet is down there was lull in the activity between 0145 and 0415 when the situation began to reintensify and by 0615 loud explosions could be heard the number of casualties are unknown as emergency services are unable to move freely on the ground due to firing most local residents are confined to cellars and basements waiting for calm to return 8 c at approximately 0400 on august 8 the georgian national security council asked the us for the return of 1000 of its troops from iraq 500 within the next 24 hours and the remainder within 48 hours regularly scheduled rotator flight may return up to 250 troops to georgia by this afternoon note usg agreement with the gog provides for emergency return of 1000 troops within 96 hours end note later saakashvili announced general mobilization of all reserves in second address he called russias actions open aggression and called on the international community to help repel it 9 c conversely the russians have said they believe georgian forces are targeting russian peacekeepers they have told the georgians that in view of these attacks georgia bears responsibility for anything that might follow the georgians have replied that they are avoiding any conflict with the peacekeepers as well as civilians the georgians believe the south ossetians are targeting the russians to provoke bigger georgianrussian conflict 10 c the south ossetians are reportedly now accusing the russians of betraying them one plausible explanation for all this is that facto leader kokoity decided to roll the dice and stimulate conflict with the georgians in hopes of bringing in the russians and thereby saving himself or enhancing his position reports that kokoity has left tskhinvali remain unconfirmed tefft
