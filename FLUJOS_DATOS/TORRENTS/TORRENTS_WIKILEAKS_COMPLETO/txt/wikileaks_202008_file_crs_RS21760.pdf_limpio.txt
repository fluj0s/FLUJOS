the national student loan cohort default rate was 172 and increased to an all time high of 224 in fy1990 as result the federal government was assuming large share of the burden associat ed with the defaulted loans in response largely to the increasing default rates and th associated costs congress passed series of measures intended to decrease the number of defaults deter students from defaulting on their loans and hold institutions accountable one of these acts was the student loan reconciliation amendments of 1989 pl101239 this act was the first time congress based institutional eligibility to participate in the federal student loan program on the institutions default rate in the following year congress passed the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra for fy1990 pl 101508 which made the aforementioned institutional requirement ffective through fy1996 and tablished maximum cohort default thresholds defined be low for continued participati on in the federal student

eligibility was not reinstated or the institution did not certify an ffel loan or continuedprogram1 obra of fy1990 exempted histori cally black colleges and universities hbcus as defined by title iii part b of the higher education act hea and tribally controlled colleges and universities tccus as identified by the tribally controlled community college assistance act and the navajo community college act from the cohort default rate th resholds the rate definition nd exemption definition have both been revised and extended since 1990 pres ently the exemption for these schools is scheduled to expire in june 2004 cohort default rates definition currently one criterion for institutional eligibility for federal family education loans ffel direct loans dl and the federal pell grant program is the institutions cohort default rate cohort is defined as the group of federal student loan2 borrowers entering repayment during fiscal year eg october 1 2002 to september 30 2003 the cohort default rate cdr3 is the percentage of borrowers defaulting4 during that year and the subsequent fiscal year eg defa ulted between october 1 2002 to september 30 20045 the cohort default rate for instituti ons having 30 or more students entering repayment in fiscal year is calculated by dividing the number of defaulted borrowers by the number of borrowers entering repayment in that same period this calculation is known as the nonaverage rate formula however for an institution that has 29 or fewer students in repayment its cohort default rate is calculated by aggregating data over the three most recent fiscal years the average rate formula uses the number of borrowers who entered repayment in the current fiscal year and the two preceding fiscal years and defaulted as the numerator and the number of borrowers who entered repayment in the current fiscal year and the two preceding fiscal years as the denominator institutional consequences if an institution has cdr of 25 or more for each year during the three most recent fiscal years ie 2001 2002 and 2003 it is inelig ible to participate in the federal student loan programs and in some instances the pell grant program6 in addition to the loss ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21760crs3 6 continued originate direct loan program loan on or af ter july 7 1998 or the institution requested in writing before oct 7 1998 to withdraw from participation in the ffel and direct loan programs 7 according to hrept 106665 hr 4504 the committee extended the exemption until june 2004 because the june 2002 deadline did not prov ide sufficient time for the institutions to implement the proposed actions from the default management planeligibility for cohort defa ult rate of 25 or higher for th ree years an institution that has cohort default rate of 40 or more for the most recent fiscal year loses its eligibility to participate in the federal student loan programs except for extenuating circumstances andor successful appeal an institution that loses its eligibility in either case remains ineligible to participate in the programs for the remaining part of the fiscal year in which it was notified and for the tw subsequent fiscal years hbcus and tccus are exempt from maintain ing cohort default rate of less than 25 for threeyear period it is important to note that these institutions are not exempt from the 40 cdr threshold and can be ineligible to participate in the federal student loan programs as result if one of these designated institutions does have cdr of 25 or more for each year in the preceding three fiscal years it can continue to participate in the federal student loan progra m and pell grant program if by july 1 of the year that it is notified of its loss of eligibility it submits default management plan and proof that it has engaged an independent third party to ssist with the implementation of this plan the default management plan and the thirdparty engagement were part of the 1998 higher education act amendments pl 105244 in addition the amendments specified that an institution that relied upon the exemption to remain eligible to participate in the title iv programs was required to demonstrate how it would lower its cdr to less than 25 by july 1 2002 the consolidat ed appropriations act of 2001 extended the cohort default rate exemption from june 2002 to june 2004 pl 1065547 management plan institutions with cdrs at or above 25 fo r each of the three most recent consecutive fiscal years and that wish to participate in the federal student an program and the pell grant program must submit default management plan the plan must contain specific assurances including but not limited to delineation of the appropr iate personnel and res ources that have been solicited to implement the default management plan proof that default management team has been assembled and that the team includes the chief executive officer and other relevant senior executives and administrative offices other than the financial aid office development of an evaluation approach to collect data to measure andverify relevant default statistics upon submission and approval of the default management pl an by the us department of education ed the institution must nnually submit evidence it has implemented the approved default management plan is making substantial improvement in reducing the cdr and that it continues to work with an independent third party according tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21760crs4 8 the national student loan data system is the us department of edu cations central database for student aid it receives data from schools gu aranty agencies the direct loan program the pell grant program and other us department of education programs 9 for additional information rega rding institutional cohort default rates please refer to the us department of educations cohort default rate guide available at httpwwwifapedgov drmaterialsfinalcdrghtmlprogram regulations at 34 cfr part 668198 s ubstantial improvement is determined by the institutions ability to demonstrate improvement in the following areas reduction in the most recent draf t preliminary or official cohort default rate an increase in the percentage of linquent borrowers who avoid default by using deferments forbearances andor job placement assistance an increase in the academic persistence of its student borrowers an increase in the percentage of students pursuing graduate or professional study an increase in the percentage of current addresses of its borrowers thatthe institution has available an increase in the percentage of linquent borrowers the institution has contacted the implementation of alternative financial aid award policies and thedevelopment of financial resources that reduce the need for student borrowing an increase in the percentage of accu rate and timely upda tes made to the national student loan data system8 the option of default management plan is not applicable for institutions that have cohort default rate of 40 fo r the most recent fiscal year institutional incentives institutions with low cohort default rates we re previously eligible for various special incentives for example prior to septem ber 2002 an institution whose most recent cdr was less than 10 could also deliver or di sburse student loan proceeds in single installment to student if that students loan period was less than or equal to one semester one trimester or one quarter in addition these institutions could choose not to delay the delivery or disburse ment of the first installment of loan proceeds for firstyear firsttime borrowers both of these institutional incentives expired on september 30 2002 status of exemption during the two most recent c ohort default rate periods fy2001 and fy2000 for which data are available none of the hbcu s or tccus had to rely upon the exemption to remain eligible to participate in the federal student loan and pell grant programs9 data from the five previous cohort fault rate periods indicate th at the cohort default rates athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21760crs5 hbcus and tccus have steadily decr eased for fy2001 67 of the 124 54 participating hbcus and tccus had cdrs of 10 or less wh ich would have made them eligible for the institutional incentives previously referenced in addition 49 40 of the institutions had cdrs between 10 and 199 only eight institutions 6 had rates of 20 or higher for fy2001 when the extension was granted for hbcus and tccus from 2002 to 2004 the house committee conference report indicated that the exemption was originally granted to these institutions because of their hist orical commitment to serving students who might not otherwise attend college hrept 106 665 moreover the general accounting office gao released report entitled student loans characte ristics of students and default rates at historically black colleges and universities gaohehs9890 that discusses research on the characteristics of st udents who are most likely to default on their student loans specifically the report states that students with less academic preparation and those who come from families with lower incomes are more likely to default on their student loans the report further states th at hbcus tend to enroll larger percentages of students from both of these groups possible explanation for why these institutions may have needed in the past to rely upon the exemption to the cohort default threshold to continue participating in the federal student loan and pe ll grant programs as the exemption is scheduled to expire in few months the congress may consider the following questions should the exemption be extended to continue to provide fail safe for hbcus and tccus that serve many disadvantaged students or has the recent data on cohort default ra tes at these institutions illustrated their ability to make good use of the exemption period and therefore the exemption is longer necessary
