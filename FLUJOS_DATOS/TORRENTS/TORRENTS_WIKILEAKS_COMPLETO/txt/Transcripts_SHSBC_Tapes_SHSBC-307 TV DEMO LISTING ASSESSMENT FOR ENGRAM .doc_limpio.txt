tv demo listing assessment for engram running part i an auditing demonstration given on 26 june 1963 here we are in the upstairs studio here this is the 26th of june 1963 and im going to give you an auditing demonstration of an assessment for engram chain and will give you several of these demonstrations as we go along here in the coming weeks but what i want you to pay attention to basically is simply the simplicity of the auditing the uncomplex nature of auditing and youve been given so many rules in auditing about all the things you must do and so forthof course one must do all of these things but theyre in their right place and one does these things only in their right place now the difficulties which you run into in doing this are absolutely minimal and if youll notice the exact auditing skills of 212 are used here in this assessment for engram running the rules of listing apply and so on the keynote of any fairly highlevel case of what makes an incident an incident is protest and to that degree were not on terribly solid ground because i dont know that these other buttons will uniformly produce the type of engram that protest will you see by protesting the individual shoves his face toward something and resists it which of course makes very heavy mass of energy and it makes heavy enough mass of an engram to cause that engram to be very plain and to persist so therefore you get much better engram under protest than otherwise nevertheless lot of people are not up to protest so were going to do an 18button assessment and use the standard 18 buttons and then were going to do lista short listto see if on that list we find anythingwe will of courseto assess for the type of engram the pc should be running lrh okay all right your chairs all right there pick up the cans and your chairs all right pc yes lrh is it all right if we audit in this room pc yes lrh all right very good all right squeeze the cans all right your havingness is bit down here isnt it huh very good all right thank you now what were going to do in this session is im going to do an assessment of these buttons omitting create pc uhhuh lrh because thatll land somebody in the middle of gpm pc right lrh if we dont get anything that is banging enormously why we will take protest just as matter of course and then ill go on and i will do short list and assess that list and well see what is your proper engram chain pc right lrh ive been wanting to do this with you anyway pc thank you lrh all right is it all right with you if i begin this session now pc yes lrh very good start of session has the session started for you pc yes lrh very good what goals would you like to set for this session pc to work well lrh right pc and feel the benefit of the session at the end of it to find out what it is on this chain what the assessment is thats it lrh that it all right thank you all right were going to go into this immediately here and find out what weve got and were just going to assess these 18 buttons less created okay pc right lrh im just going to read these off to you rapidly and see what we have here all right okay pc yes lrh all right in this lifetime have you

right we have two left in here in this lifetime have you mainly invalidated things in this lifetime have you mainly decided things all right i have to ask those two again any thoughts with regard to them pc i know youve always said um you once said to decide is your button rather heavily i do am inclined to decide this seems more real than the other one anyway to lrh all right very good any protest on the other one little bit pc well what i thought of i just wondered whether theres any protest on it and of course there would be but then in that case i would have thought the protest button would have stayed in as well that was the thought i had lrh oh all right very good thank you all right in this lifetime have you mainly invalidated things have you mainly invalidated things still there tiny bit in this lifetime have you mainly decided things well decided is really really staying with us bit here pc uhhuh lrh now let sort these out again in this lifetime have you mainly invalidated things latent in this lifetime have you mainly decided things all right in this lifetime have you mainly decided things yes sir thats your button very good all right pc yes well your adjudication must have been very good lrh well is it just because of my adjudication pc lrh doesnt read all right pc its very good lrh i just didnt want anybody to think that i had simply evaluated you into that position all right decided now were going to do little list here pc uhhuh lrh youre accustomed to these all right weve got question here lets see if it reads in this lifetime what have you decided doesnt read very good in this lifetime what have you decided thats got little tick anything wrong with that question pc just the things i have decided um i think this goes back to when on the boat when you said something about decisions that there was i was asking you selfdetermined changes that you and you know we sort of came up with you wouldnt you couldnt really decide these things you know theres very little we decided i think im on the right button here i may have got it mixed up lrh oh well all right pc something like that lrh all right very good in this lifetime what have you decided all right lets see if we cant get slightly better question here pc can i just say one thing here its possible im just wondering whether i use the word decided as emphasized its decided change you know people use this word decided in that way or i in my circle its been used quite lot lrh oh i see pc instead of to make decision its used you know lrh hm pc it would be an emphatic or quite distinct change lrh all right all right okay well were going to use this question anyway pc uhhuh lrh in this lifetime what have you decided pc all right lrh all right so just answer the

rather clear fall on havingness little bit earlier lets see what weve got here now all right squeeze the cans ah youre having time here on havingness well have to run moments havingness now what is your havingness process these days pc touch lrh all right thank you all right put down the cans okay touch that sign thank you touch the tablecloth thank you touch that can thank you touch that can thank you touch the top of the telephone thank you touch the table all right very good pick up the cans lets see how were doing with this all right squeeze the cans ah yes well thats increasing bit

very good pc thank you very much lrh okay all right now youve seen listing demonstration i wish to call to your attention that i just kept listing until i got something like clean needle now some of you can exaggerate this and get your rudiments out or get an argument going with the pc and keep your needle dirty but in actual fact the needle ought to clean up in relatively few pages of listing and as you saw it this one did now that might possibly require few more items listed there just to make suresomething like that it all depended on how easy that list is to null if that list is very easy to null why of course you do just go on and null it right on down and it should null down rather easily of course when you get that list item when you get the item on the list well you ask for engrams which decide soandso or cause of such decision and you run the chain and you find the pc would be able to run these things if you noticed some of these items were fairly hot you noticed also i was not looking for rocket reads i wasnt looking for rock slams i wasnt looking for any peculiar needle phenomena youd find most of that would pass away these things will not continue to rocket read just because they are goals you also noticed the pc gave several goals out of the gpms well thats all right because if they did read as the final item on the list i would simply do routine 3n and clean it up and its as simple as that all right i want you to notice in particular the general lack of strain on the model session the simplicity of it more than anything else and notice the addition of the factthis may be new to youthat the pc was carefully acknowledged when he made his goalsthat was after each goal was acknowledged and then after hed given the gains which were all acknowledged why he was then acknowledged for having made gains in the session well what if he hadnt made his goals at all well i would have said of course im sorry you did not make your goals in this session and if he hadnt given any gainsim sorry you have nohad gains in this session thats still an acknowledgment and youd foundwould have brightened the pc up in either case well what if he made some of his goals and didnt make some others of his goals well id just say thank you for making some of your goals for this session im sorry you didnt make the others similarly with gains if you have mixed bag all right well therethere you have demonstration of finding an engram chain on pc using the 18button prepcheck list with created omitted naturally because it goes straight back to goal andpossibly youd even get away with it you knowwhat would you find youd just find the goal and youd have to run 3n and there we have model session and this of course is the first step of routine 3r all right thank you very much good night
