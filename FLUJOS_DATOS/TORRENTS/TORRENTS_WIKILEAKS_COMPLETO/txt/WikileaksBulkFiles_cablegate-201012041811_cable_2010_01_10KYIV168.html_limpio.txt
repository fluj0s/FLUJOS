b kyiv 0128 classified by ambassador john f tefft reason 14 bd 1 c summary in contrast to the 2004 elections issues of national security and defense remain notable by their absence in this years presidential campaign ukrainians are focused on the economic crisis and the elections potential for reconfiguring ukraines political power relationships all candidates have supported transition to professional army and the abolition of compulsory military service but it was not until the final days of the first round that opposition leader yanukovich and prime minister tymoshenko elaborated much detail in their positions several candidates said that traditional european security and political structures have exhausted their potential only third place finisher tihipko and president yushchenko regularly highlighted strategic and foreign policy issues in their public statements anatoliy hrytsenko former minister of defense and head of the rada defense committee appeared in fatigues in his campaign posters but his lowprofile campaign hardly registered with voters end summary geopolitical and security issues largely absent 2 c throughout the campaign period candidates presented national security largely in terms of economic and social security matters of international security defense and regional stability generally received only broad formulaic attention and generated little public debate political analysts with whom we spoke lamented the low profile of these issues 3 c director of the xxxxx told us that with the european and global security landscape in greater flux and uncertainty including due to russias reassertion of its political ambitions and world view attention of the candidates to defense and security concepts is critical yet one she said was talking about them just at the moment when they matter most 4 c xxxxx and xxxxx director of the xxxxx each pointed out that ukraine will not receive nato or eu membership over the next 57 years or longer however the course of european security will be shaped during this period now is the time for ukrainians to care they assert according to xxxxx and backer of president yushchenko the problem is simple voter apathy toward anything other than the scandaloriented political commentary and debate that has marked postorange revolution ukraine yanukovych 5 c viktor yanukovychs campaign like party of regions legislative agenda over the past few years focused primarily on domestic social welfare and economicbusiness issues his defense platform cited defense reform transition to professional force and abolition of compulsory service military rightsizing in line with ukraines economic potential rather than resulting from review or analysis of threats and opportunities and social benefits for military academy graduates 6 c yanukovych pledges nonaligned ukraine member of neither nato nor the csto within multipolar new world order in private discussion with ambassador tefft yanukovych held open the prospect of continued military cooperation with nato and spoke of cooperation with ukraines military industrial sector in another conversation with ambassador tefftref yanukovych spoke of resetting relations with russia but continuing to build ties with washington yanukovych has stated publicly and privately to us that the future of the black sea fleet would be decided in way that would satisfy both ukrainian and russian interests while protecting ukrainian economic interests yanukovychs advisors tell us he would be open to extending the black sea fleets lease in sevastopol if russia offered attractive terms with substantially increased rent tymoshenko 7 sbu yuliya tymoshenkos official campaign platform only went so far as to promise to cancel conscription moving to professional army based on contract principles and to kyiv 00000168 002 of 003 allocate sufficient material equipment and finances to strengthen ukraines combat power tymoshenko has subsequently claimed that the armed forces receive adequate funding her foreign policy views have focused on economic policy achieving european living standards with eu membership to follow with only succinct note that there will be friendly relations with russia and the cis and any collective security arrangements will be decided by referendum 8 sbu in summing up her positions with the press on the eve of elections january 14 tymoshenko pledged that under her leadership ukraine would join the eu in five years and achieve an association agreement and free trade agreement by the end of 2010 she also said that the future of the black sea fleet will be determined in strict accordance with the ukrainian constitution she took position categorically against recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent nations outside the context of campaign stumping tymoshenko has consistently emphasized the importance of ukraines participation in the eus defense policy with public support for nato at only about 20 percent tymoshenko largely avoided mention of nato in the campaign serhiy tihipko 9 c serhiy tihipko is the comefrombehind candidate who moved into third place garnering 13 of the vote on january 17 meeting with the ambassador on january 21 ref tihipko said ukrainian public opinion is not ready for nato membership he advocated vigorous mod engagement with nato and adoption of nato standards and said mod should focus on improving its capacity to the maximum but political leaders should avoid talk of nato membership 10 c tihipko said that as long as the current leaders rule in russia nato membership will be impossible for ukraine the kremlin would unleash fifth column and destabilize the country if membership were close tihipkos campaign rhetoric has been clear that ukraine should give up its intentions to become nato member and stop wasting its time trying to secure nato membership 11 c throughout his campaign tihipko voiced pragmatic approach to urkainian foreign and security policy that emphasized constructive role for the country based on its own national economic interests and rejected existential debates about political allegiance to europe or russia he used that perspective to advocate more clearly and frequently his vision of an independent ukraine acting rationally and independently on the world stage than any other candidate save yushchenko 12 sbu tihipko sees clear role for ukraines militaryindustrial complex in ukraines economic recovery and in creating the strong military he believes is needed to protect the peace ukraine needs to win respect in its foreign policy including reboot of relations with russia to be achieved in particular through joint militaryindustrial projects ukraine requires new military doctrine based on the threats and realities of the modern world and professional army effectively trained at all levels with an effective reserve corps tihipko has strongly criticized ukrainian deployment to isaf saying that ukraine has use for this war he has argued that the us and its allies are defeated in afghanistan lytvyn and hrytsenko 13 c some expected former minister of defense and head of the rada defense committee anatoliy hrytsenko after series of campaign ads featuring himself in camouflage gear to continue with his normally pronato prowestern rhetoric on the contrary hrytsenkos campaign was lowprofile grassroots effort that focused on the economic and political issues more immediate to the electorate nevertheless hrytsenkos campaign materials made it clear that he believed ukraine must be prepared to go it alone without nato or the eu in the near term in his postelection meeting with the ambassador on january 22 ref b he predicted that cooperation with nato would continue but ukraine would not be able to be particularly effective partner 14 sbu speaker of the rada volodymyr lytvyn early on took the position that ukraine should stop seeking nato membership as the issue divides the nation furthermore he urged that the russian black sea fleet remain in ukraine kyiv 00000168 003 of 003 after 2017 as guarantor of ukrainian security neither candidate polled well with voters however the importance of military technical cooperation 15 c prominent ukrainian xxxxxxxxxxxx argues that while security issues did not play role in the election campaign the candidates are keenly sensitive to the condition of and fading economic potential of ukraines aging militaryindustrial complex in his view ukraines strategic orientation will be most greatly influenced by offers of tangible cooperation in the aftermath of the elections regardless of the ultimate winner russia he said brings so much more to the table in terms of longterm deals purchases sales technology transfer compatibility and interoperability and the ability to revitalize ukraines militaryindustrial complex practical ties are what will decide ukraines future allegiances nato is theoretical concept and all politicians have come to agree that ukraine needs the capacity for independent defense comment 16 c until the final days of the campaign issues of foreign and security policy were rarely raised by the press or brought to the fore by the majority of the presidential candidates nonetheless the 2010 election is likely to mark shift in the countrys longerterm strategic orientation from the path laid out by yushchenko in 2005 to the extent that the candidates have commented on the strategic future for ukraine the emphasis has been on achieving some sort of balance that will be acceptable to moscow
