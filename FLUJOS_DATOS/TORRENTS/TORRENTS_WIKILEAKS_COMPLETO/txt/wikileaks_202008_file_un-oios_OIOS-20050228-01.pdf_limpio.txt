interviews of the alleged subjec ts collected documents and records concerning the procurement including all the bids submitted and the bid evaluation documents and analyzed the evidence 5 the idoios investigation also reviewed the proj ect funded by the european agency for reconstruction ear called strengthening of publi c veterinary services in kosovo spuvesek which identified the need for personal digital assistants pdas to undertake the task of identification registration i r of an imals in kosovo the intent was to provide veterinarians in the field with electronic devices to record all movements of animals in kosovo 6 in late 2002 the ear consultant prepared the chnical specifications for the pdas based on the proposal in spuveseks inception report of ugust 2002 based on these specifications the dra launched an initial tender in november 2003 for the pdas inclusive of both hardware and software all bids submitted exceeded the amou nt set aside for the purchase of the pdas 170000 therefore that tender was cancelled in february 2004 based on advice from the central procurement entity cpe 2 7 second tender for the purchase of the required pdas was then launched in april 2004 using the same technical specifications for the cond tender the dra provided the bidders with price ceiling of 135000 and requested that they state the number of devices in total that the company could offer within the price ceiling n 19 may 2004 the deadline for the submission of bids the dra had received eight bids as required the bids were opened and certified by members of bidopening panel consist ing of dra logistics officer 1 dra procurement officer dra employee 1 and dra finan ce officer the complainant told idoios that the bid opening process occurred witho ut incident and in accordance with correct procedural requirements 8 in the preliminary prio report the price estima tes as stated in the ear consultants inception report showed five different pda models w ith integrated scanner capabilities the prices of the pda models shown ranged from usd 323 38 to usd 81830 idoios adduced that the initial estimates were of regular pdas not the more rugged pdas specified in the technical specifications and required for us by veterinarians working in inclement weather conditions idoios also found that the timates were obtained from the internet for the inception report and did not include the featur that would make it technically appropriate for the veterinarians in the field the actual tech nical specifications prepared by the ear consultant later envisaged more rugged durable p roduct that would be water dust and drop resistant the price per unit of rugged pdas as required by the technical specifications is higher than the initial estimate made in the incept ion report idoios verified this through internet research 9 the complainant raised two main issues firstly that the bid submitted by vendor 1 was the lowest bid because it offered the most number f devices within the ceiling price secondly although two other bidders offered the same product as the winning bidder but at lower price they had not been selected the prio preliminary re port also identified these issues idoios investigators reviewed all eight bids submitted and noted that dra logistics officer 1 had disqualified two vendor 2 and vendor 3 because ne ither the vendor 2 nor the vendor 3 bid was substantially responsive in that the total price of the product offered exceeded the price ceiling of 135000 during hisher prequalification of bids dra logistics officer 1 noted that vendor 2 did not include taxes cip pristina kosovo as requ ired in the bid document meaning the total price would exceed the ceiling of 135000 by more than 17000 and vendor 3s total offer did not include its yearly 16500 maintenance surcharge fee causing its bid t exceed the stated price ceiling by more than 15000 10 in order to find out why the lowest bidder ven dor 1 was still not selected idoios spoke separately with two members of the bid evalua tion panel who explained the evaluation process and why the panel recommended the selected bidder vendor 4 idoios was told that the evaluation panel examined the bid documents submit ted by the six prequalified bidders and made comments and annotations on the table provided to them by the dra logistics officer the evaluation panel relied heavily on the technical ex pertise of one panel member dra logistics officer 2 who was responsible for the evaluation f the technical features of the pdas offered dra logistics officer 2 told idoios that hisher handwritten entries on th table were based on the discussions of the entire evaluation panel but that heshe independently verified that the product offered by each bidder did possess the decl ared features and that heshe checked the 3 technical data submitted by the individual bidders with the product datasheet and brochures included in the bidding documents 11 in terms of the priority selection criteria of the evaluation panel dra logistics officer 2 stated that the dra had advised them to monitor not only the technical specifications but to focus particularly on section vii of the bidding do cuments obligatory requirements to be fulfilled by the bidders dra logistics officer 2 highlighted the criteria of afterwarranty repair service located within kosovo and repair or replacement within five working days based on the existing regulations in kosovo as to notification registration and recording of information concerning movement of animals within f ive days of the movement therefore if pda device used for the communication of such dat broke down and was not replaced within week farmers and veterinarians would run the risk of not complying with the law 12 idoios requested dra logistics officer 2 to review each individual bid and to explain hisher 13 annotations dra logistics officer 2 pointed out that vendor 4 vendor 5 and vendor 6 had offered virtually the same technical d evice heshe found out that the gotive h41 ib model offered by vendor 6 did not s ubstantially differ from the gotive h41 model offered by vendor 4 and vendor 5 dra logistics officer 2 stated that the gotive h41 model complied with l the requirements laid out in the technical specifications and pointed out that t his device was very well protected against environmental impact notably in the field 13 according to dra logistics officer 2 the pda model offered by vendor 1 was not rugged pda it did not comply with the ip54 protect ion standards essential for outdoor use at first glance vendor 1 appeared to be the lowest bidder because they offered the largest number of pdas for the stated price ceiling howeve r the product did not comply with the technical specifications and hence would be inappro priate for use by kvs veterinarians as such the members of the evaluation panel did not s hortlist vendor 1 for further examination 14 however the complainant contended that the pda mod offered by vendor 1 did match the technical specifications sought by the dra and referred idoios to vendor 1s handwritten responses to section vi technical spec ifications of the bidding documents these handwritten responses simply mark for yes and n for as to whether the product conformed to the technical specifications the hand written version shows in the column next to the technical requirement of environmental sealing investigators noted that the annex submitted by the complainant is different from the typed page of the vendor 1 response to section vi found in all three sets of bid documents submitted to the dra at the bid opening the typed page clearly indicates that the product d oes not contain the required dust and weather resistance feature required 15 idoios learned that vendor 1 did not retain copy of the completed bid documents submitted to the dra as they had only prepared thre sets all of which were submitted to the dra on 19 may the complainant seemed unaware of th discrepancy between the two versions idoios verified that the pda model offer ed by vendor 1 eia pd264xb does not 4 contain the ip54 feature that would ensure environm ental sealing against dust and rain it did appear from the complainants statements to idoios that vendor 1 did not fully understand the bidding document requirements and thus failed to of fer technically compliant product that would be appropriate for outdoor use by kosovo vete rinarians 16 idoios also addressed the issue of why vendor 4 was selected even though two other bidders offered the same model pda at lower price based on the technical specifications the evaluation panel narrowed the choices to three bidd ers whose product was technically compliant with the specifications two panel members told id oios that among the three shortlisted bidders the vendor 4 offer seemed to be slightly more expensive than th at of vendor 5 and vendor 6 more thorough review indicated that bo th vendor 5 and vendor 6 did not include vat in their offers therefore the total bid by th two vendors did not offer the best value in addition neither vendor 5 nor vendor 6 offered servicing and repair of the pdas in kosovo and the required five days turnaround time to repla ce faulty device only the selected bidder vendor 4 offered these two features along with t raining component for the price submitted given the fact that approximately 70 veterinarians were to be equipped with these pdas the training component although not included in the ob ligatory requirements seemed to be valuable addition to the evaluation panel members in the end the evaluation panel members selected vendor 4 over the two other shortlisted b idders because that bid included training as part of the total package thereby offering the best value within the stated price ceiling for drakvs iii findings 17 idoios finds that the dra finally procured p das from vendor 4 based on the fact that the product offered was in compliance with the technical specifications and met the requirements of the bid specifications the lower price estimates quoted in the inception report related to standard office use pdas as opposed to r ugged environmentally sealed pdas that would be suitable for outdoor use 18 idoios also finds that the evaluation panel lected vendor 4 because it was the only bidder that complied with all technical specificati ons as well as the obligatory requirements in section vii of the bid documents such as the 12 mon ths warranty for servicing and repair in kosovo and the five days turnaround time in additi on it offered the best value by including training component in their offer 19 the evidence adduced by the investigation furth er confirms that the pdas offered by vendor 1 did not conform to the technical specifica tions of the itb although the complainant offered the largest number of pdas within the state d ceiling price the pdas offered were not appropriate for the designated use as set forth in the bid documents 20 idoios determined that the procurement exercis was conducted in accordance with the financial rules and regulations governing procur ement and with unmiks finance administrative instruction 21999 on public procure ments using kcb funds 5 iv recommendation 21 based on the above idoios makes the following the recommendation recommendation 1 it is recommended that unmik take note of idoios findings and conclusions and advise dra staff members dra emplo yee 2 and dra logistics officer 1 of the result of this investigation id rec
