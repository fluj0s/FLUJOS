issues june 1 2006 charles henning analyst in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33452pows and mias status and accounting issues summary there has been longrunning controve rsy about the fate of certain us prisoners of war pows and servicemembe rs missing in action mias as result of various us military operations while few people familiar with the issue feel that any americans are still being held against their will in communist countries associated with the cold war more feel that some may have been so held in the past in the soviet union china north korea or north vietnam similarly few believe there has been conspiracy to cover up the existence of live pows but many would maintain that there was at least during the 1970s us government mismanagement of the issue normalization of relations with vietna m exacerbated this longstanding debate normalizations supporters contend that vietnamese cooperation on the powmia issue has greatly increased opponents argu that cooperation has in fact been much less than supporters say and that the vi etnamese can only be induced to cooperate by firmness rather than c onciliation those who believe americans are now held or were after the war ended feel that even if specific report of live americans has thus far met rigorous proofs the mass of information about live americans is compelling those who doubt live american s are still held or were after the war ended argue that despite vast efforts only one live american military prisoner remained in indochina after the war defector who returned in 1979 the us government indicates the possibility that americans are still being held in indochina cannot be ruled out some say americans may have been kept by the vietnamese after the war but killed later increased us access to vietnam has not yet led to large reduction in the number of americans still listed as unaccounted for although this may be due to some u s policies as well as the vel of vietname cooperation there is considerable evidence that prisoners from the end of world war ii the korean war and cold war shootdowns of us military aircraft may have been taken to the ussr and not returned th evidence about pows from vietnam being taken to the soviet union is more questionable there is evidence that navy pilot scott speicher shot down on the first nigh t of the 1991 persian gulf war and until recently listed as killed in action rather than missing in action was almost certainly captured by the iraqis info rmation about his fate has not yet been discovered by us and coalition forces in iraq all american pows captured by the iraqis during the initial stage of the current war were returned to us control the remains of all others listed as mia have been recovered one us army soldier captured by iraqi insurgents on april 9 2004 is currently listed as pow there has been word about his fate since his pow status was confirmed by dod on april 23

issues recent developments and issues since 1991 the us has gained subs tantial access to airc raft crash sites vietnamese records and vietnamese civilians and has established substantial permanent presence of military and civilian personnel for several years the viet namese have allowed us personnel some access to their government archives and permitted some interviews with senior vietnamese military leaders from the wa r this increased access however has not yet led to large numbers of americans being removed masse from the rolls of people who are unaccounted for between 1991 and 2005 the total number has gene rally dropped by 30 35 cases per year however much informati on or material or information obtained in vietnam does not assist in remains identification upon close study it turns out to be redundant already in us hands or pertaining to resolved cases in addition dpmo has stated that vietnamese government disinformation program has been associated with recent reporting on missing americans those re ports all pertain to the alleged recovery of remains and identifying data i dog tags by vietnamese c itizens cited in recent editions of the vietnamera unaccounted for statistical report of the dpmo located at the dpmo website some involved with the powmia issue ar gue that vietnamese cooperation on the powmia issue has actually been spotty nd uneven at best arguing that the us government has tended to equate activity with results nd resource inputs with true outputs in terms of the fate of unacc ountedfor americans they sugge st that the true cost of all us military and diplomatic activities associated with postvietnam war powmiarelated activities is much higher than stated dpmo budget outlays of approximately 15 m illion yearly perhaps as much as 50100 million yearly they allege that vietnam and north korea charge extraordinarily high fees fo r providing support to dpmojpac operations such as logistical support aviation costs food and lodging and the like and that the services received are by means as lavish as the bills presented indicate us policy and the remains issue as noted above dp mo believes of the 1815 americans listed as unaccounted for as of au gust 5 2005 that 667 are definitely dead and that further investigation could result in more evidence or remains being found such cases include those that resulted from aircraft explosions drowning or simple disappearance some believe that the vietname have documentary evidence bout the fate of at least some of them others argue that concerns over public reaction more than disagreements on the part of american analysts that the individuals concerned really are dead are holding up the decision to close these cases the question may be as follows if evidence other than remains is not conclusive what use is it if remains are available the number of cases listed forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33452crs6 further pursuit by dpmo does fluctu ate based on new evidence cases

related sections with consid erable policy significance and frequently political controversy however during 19982001 fy1999fy2002 legi slation congress was less active on powmia matters none of the national defense authorization or intelligence authorization acts of the tter period contained signifi cant powmiarelated provisions or report language with broad policy implications vietnam powmias were americans left behind are any still alive those who believe americans are still held or were held after the war ended feel that even if specific report has thus far been pr oved the numbers unaccounted for and the cumulative mass of information about live amer icans is compelling frequently people holding this view suggest that throughout the 1970s in the bitter and sour aftermath of the vietnam war there was lack of will in the government which reflect ed that of the country as whole to continue investigating the powmia issue they posit that this contributed to mindset to debunk reports of live amer icans as well as desire on the part of successive administrations to wa sh their hands of the issue those who doubt americans are s till held or were when the war ended argue that despite numerous reports exha ustive interrogations and formidable technical means used by us intelligence agencies report of an unaccountedfor live american with the exception of garwood has been validated as to who when and where the individual is or was they believe that much of the ev idence cited relates to already accountedfor americans wishful thinking or fabrication most us government analysts have come to believe that it is extremely unlikely that the north vietnamese kept us prisoners after the end of the wa r or transferred any to the ussr they appear to acknowledge the repressi ve nature of totalitari an communist regimes that the vietnamese could have opted to keep some americans they just feel that their examination of the evidence indicates that they did not significantly the progressively increasing penetration of vietnam by large am erican official presen ce american business interests and tens of thousands of american and european tourists has failed to disclose any indications that american pows were kept behind in the early 1970s let alone are still being held the coverup issue some say the us governme nt has engaged in coverup of evidence about live americans still being held in indochina they attach greater credence to some sources than does the government and suggest that the criteria set by the government for validating reports of liv americans are unreasonably and perhaps deliberately high the government responds by stating that such asse rtions are based on data that is inaccurate or fraudulent it also sserts that numerous inve stigations have cleared dia of coverup charges and that the ability to maintain coverup strains credulity in an era of press leaks and openness since 1982 it has been us policy to provide intelligence to families of unaccountedfor american s that pertains or may pe rtain to their missing men have americans remained in indochina voluntarily some americans stayed in indochina voluntarily garwood bein g the best known another defected to the viet cong in 1967 and was killed by the khmer rouge cambodian communists in 1975 or 1976 ideology collaboration with the enemy and fear of punishment upon return to the us personal problems home local wife and children brainwashing by captors orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33452crs8 combination of these factors all could have played role in other americans remaining in indochina voluntarily the vietname have always left room for such by denying americans are living in areas under their control in addition the us govern ment policy cited above on live americans is careful to refer to ame ricans still being held against their will are the vietnamese laotians or cambodians still holding the remains of dead americans there is widelyheld belief that for many years the vietnamese had collection of remains from which they released remains as they saw fit the dpmo believes that this collection may have been exhausted by august 1990 whether the vietnamese hold other remain s is not known some suggest the vietnamese have not released remains that would indicate mistreatment of pows andor that some were alive when the war ended but died in vietnamese custody thereafter although such mistreatment is well known the large number of americans lost in or over laos the number of known discrepancy cases and the few americans returned who had been captured in laos suggest that the laotians know more about the fa of unaccountedfor americans than they have yet stated on the other hand most lao governments co mmunist or not have exercised little control over large parts of their country due to vi etnamese occupation and their own lack of resources this suggests the laotians may not have the ability to provide many answers about missing americans and such answers may be better found from the vietnamese laos is however one area where searches of aircra ft crash sites have resulted in the recent identification of some unaccountedfor ameri cans recently for example in march 2005 us powmiarelated delegation held talks with lao officials to discuss ways to improve us access to information and aircraft crash sites related to us vietnam war pows korean war powsmias since the korean war ended in 1953 there have been rumors americans captured by the north koreans or chinese were or still are held against their will in north korea china or russiathe former ussr it is generally accepted that the communist powers involved in the war withheld significant amounts of information on powmia from the united states probably with more withholding by north korea and china than russia dpmo states that although th ere is firsthand direct ev idence of korean war pows being transferred to the soviet union the cu mulative weight of circumstantial evidence is so compelling that they believe that at least small numbers of americans were in fact so transferred there are indications that some si ghtings of caucasians by foreign nationals in north korea may be of several american soldiers who defected to north korea in the postkorean war era in addition some us pows were not released by china until 1955 two years after the war ended two civilian cia aircrew members shot down over north korea during the war in 1952 were impris oned for 20 years and not released until 1972 declassified us documents indicate that the us government maintained an intensive interest in live pows from the korean war throughout the 1950s the end of the korean war in 1953 was followed by intensely bitter re lations between the us the north koreans and the chinese this suggests that the two communist enemies of the united states during the korean war as well as stalinist soviet union might be inclined to hold live americans perhaps more so than vietnam in the 1970shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33452crs9 1 bradley graham us halts missions to recover remains in n korea washington post may 26 2005 p a19during the mid1950s the us demanded th north koreans and chinese account for missing americans after 1955 due to the lack of response except for the return of 1868 remains in 1954 the issue abated although the united states periodically raised the issue in 1957 house foreign affairs committee hearings on the korean mia issue aired frustrations similar to those raised since 1973 on indochina mias although the issue of korean mias began to get more attention in the early 1980s concrete results of contact with the north koreans were minimal until 1996 between mid1996 and mid1997 negotiations took place in which united states and north ko rea agreed on parameters for conducting field investigations and archival research for us mias between 1996 and 2004 us personnel completed 36 joint field activities jfas searches for american remains in north korea these teams recovered 224 remains of which 20 have been identified as those of americans agreement was reached in late 2004 for five more jfas to be conducted in 2005 the first took place between midapril and midmay 2005 however on may 25 2005 dod suspended the operations of us powmia personnel operating in north kor ea citing heightened concerns about their safety in the context of rising tensions between the united states and north korea the teams operate in north korea under terms that effectively cu t off their ability to communicate with anyone outside the countrythe only message permitted is daily situation report sent from liaison officer in pyongyang the north korean capital although acceptable to us commanders in the past this restrictive conditi on would clearly hamper any effort by other us forces to protect the rec overy teams should an emergency arise such consideration us military spokesman said played pa rt in the decision to suspend the missions1 the most recent identification of remains returned from north korea took place on july 22 2005 when dod announced that the remains of us army soldier mia from the korean war had been identified the remains had first been returned to the united states from north korea in 1993 there has been some controversy about the pa yments the us has made to north korea for powmiarelated search activity ce 1993 dpmo has paid north korea about 15 million for recovery operations as with joint recovery operations in vietnam laos and other countries the payments are calculated by negotiating the compensation provided for the workers materials facilities and equipment provided by the north koreans some have alleged that the sums are form of disguised subsidy and provide little benefit in terms

apparently obtained from german and japanese pows from world war ii several hundred thousands of whom were not released by the soviets until 19541955 pr ovided considerable evidence that some crewmembers of these aircraft had b een seen and spoken to in soviet concentration camps after the cold war ended in 19891991 the united states began to receive substantial russian cooperati on about soviet involvements in cold war shootdowns however there is little doubt that the russians have not released all available information due to varying levels of obstr uctionism and the oftendisorgan ized nature of government in postsoviet russia second type of cold war incident involve s kidnapping of us personnel in or near sovietoccupied territory in europe after the end of world war ii by soviet intelligence agents most however were defectors or had wandered into sovi etoccupied areas for nonpolitical reasons romantic entanglements drunkenness and the like the full story of such kidnappings may well not have been told and may never be there is question that numerous west germans were kidnapped by soviet and east german intelligence agencies in the late 1940s and early and mid1950s2 postcold war powmias the iraq war that began on march 19 2003 provides the most recent illustration that the powmia issue is not merely one of hist orical interest congressional concerns over americans unaccounted for during the cold war have been an integral component of the discussion about how to account for americans ssing or captured since then the largest conflicts since the cold war began to end in 1989 were the two wars with or in iraq the persian gulf war of 1991 operations desert shield and desert storm total of 49 american military personnel were in itially listed as missing in action during the persian gulf war of these 23 were captured by the iraqis and released after the war ended the remains of 13 we re recovered and another 13 we re eventually determined to be kiabnr however the status of one of the latter 13 was changed back to mia in january 2001 based on evidence that he may have survived and been captured as discussed

michael scott speicher from kia to mia speicher was the first us pilot shot down during the persian gulf war on the night of january 17 1991 his body was never recovered there is doubt hi s aircraft was shot down and crashed in iraq about 150 miles southwest of baghdad issues include the lack of remains resultant questions about whether he was in fact killed upon impact and some evid ence from variety of sources that he was taken prisoner by the iraqis when in re latively good physical condition joint dodcia report prepared at the request of the senate select committee on intelligence and first publicized in 2001 stated that we assess that iraq can account for lcdr speicher but that baghdad is concealing information about his fate lcdr speicher probably survived the loss of his aircraft and if he survived he almost certainly was captured by the iraqis crs italics significantly the occupation of iraq by us and other coalition forces since march 2003 and extensive investigation of possible l eads about speicher has not so far led to more substantive information about his fate although some leads could not be pursued due to the security threat posed by the iraqi insurgency3 in early september 2005 another navy report on speichers status was completed it reiterated conclusions reached in earlier studies that he could well have been captured that there was specific evidence of his death and that some former members they were not identified if known of the saddam hussein government of iraq were know ledgeable about his fate ccordingly it recommended that speichers status be maintained as missing rather than killed and us military and civilian agencies in iraq and the new iraqi government increase the level of attention and effort inside iraq devoted

the germans there are allegations that the ussr faile d to repatriate up to 25000 american pows liberated from the germans after world wa r ii ended in europe on may 8 1945 this appears to have foundation in f act and to result in large part from an apparent lack of rigor and care in analyzing the issue archival res earch in the united states and russia combined with interviews in russia appears to establish conclusively that virtually all such prisoners were returned in addition the large flow of information on soviet concentration camps of the stalin era beginning in the early 1960s both in writing and fro m emigre accounts has provided indication of mass imprisonment of americans some us citizens of german birth who served in the german armed forces or lived in germany were taken prisoner by the red army as it advanced into central europe in addition the soviet secret po lice singled out americans with german russian or jewish names for special attention both figures are consonant with other know ledge of the arbitrary and brutal nature of the sta linist ussr accounts of us dealings with the ussr during and immediately after world war ii on the pow issue are replete w
