summary more than 100 years of international efforts to ban chemical weapons culminated january 13 1993 in the signing of the chemical weapons convention cwc the convention entered into force april 29 1997 one hundred fiftythree of the 178 signatories have ratified the convention on april 24 1997 the senate passed the cwc resolution of ratification sres 75 105th congress by vote of 7426 president clinton signed the resolution and the united states became the 75th nation to ratify the cwc convention and congress retains continuing oversight role in its implementation the cwc bans the development production stockpiling and use of chemical weapons by members signatories it also requires the destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles and production facilities neither the united states nor russia will be able to meet the original cwcs deadlines for destruction of their cw stockpiles and have been granted extensions to at least 2012 the convention provides the most extensive and intrusive verification regime of any arms control treaty extending its coverage to not only governmental but also civilian facilities the convention also requires export controls and reporting requirements on chemicals that can be used as warfare agents and their precursors the cwc establishes the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw to oversee the conventions implementation chemical weapons convention implementing legislation pl 105277 provides the statutory authority for domestic compliance with the conventions provisions it sets criminal and civil penalties for the development production acquisition stockpiling transfer possession or use of chemical weapons it also establishes 1 procedures for seizure forfeiture and destruction of contraband chemical weapons 2 statutory authority for recordkeeping and reporting requirements relevant to the cwc 3 various restrictions on certain chemicals depending on their likelihood of being used to produce chemical weapons and 4 protective regime for confidential business information gathered from private corporations the legislation also provides detailed procedures to be used for onsite inspections by the opcw including limitations on access and search warrant procedures should they be required cwc advocates continue to express concerns over socalled treatybreaking sections of the implementing legislation and lobby for their amendment of particular concern are provisions that allow the president to block challenge inspections and that prohibit the opcw inspectors from sending chemical samples outside the united states for analysis these provisions are intended to protect us national security interests and proprietary commercial information cwc supporters however believe that blocking challenge inspection violates basic premise of the convention and that forcing inspectors analysis to be conducted within the united states undermines confidence in the verification regime these provisions may also provide an excuse for other nations to adopt similar positions this report will be updated as events warrant contents cwc ratification and implementation 1 ratifying

convention issues for congress cwc ratification and implementation ratifying legislation sres 75 105th congress the united states signed the chemical weapons convention in the last days of the first bush administration 11393 and the convention was submitted to the senate for its advice and consent in the midst of the 103rd congress 112393 in the 103rd 104th and 105th congresses an extensive series of 13 hearings were held by the foreign relations armed services intelligence and judiciary committees complemented with classified briefings from the intelligence community see for additional reading under unanimous consent agreement the cwc ratification resolution was to have been brought to the senate floor in midseptember 1996 however uncertain of sufficient votes to ensure passage its supporters postponed its consideration in his 1997 state of the union address president clinton pledged he would make the cwc high priority in 1997 pressing for senate consent early in the 105th congress after extensive negotiations between the white house and key senators and within the senate itself unanimous consent agreement was reached to bring the chemical weapons convention ratification resolution sres 75 to the senate floor on april 23 1997 the resolution contained 33 conditions 28 of which were agreed to by the white house and within the senate under the unanimous consent agreement these were not subject to further amendment or motions five conditions were not agreed to and each was struck by rollcall vote during floor debate prior to passage of the resolution the summary of the conditions below provides only the general intent of each the ratification resolution itself should be consulted for full understanding of the requirements each condition establishes the cwc ratification resolution including agreed upon conditions asserts the senates right under the constitution to add reservations to the convention assures congressional oversight of all funds provided under the cwc requires presidential certification that the opcw has an inspectorgeneral and specifies report requirements requires costsharing for rd expenditures for verification establishes standards for us intelligence sharing and reports to congress requires submission of any cwc amendments to the senate crs2 requires the president to obtain assurances from australia group members that article xi is consistent with continued export controls requires report on the assurances offered to countries that forswear the use of nuclear weapons requires presidential certification that restrictions on schedule 1 chemicals do not adversely affect the chemical biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries requires annual country reports of cw activities compliance and intelligence monitoring requires the secretary of defense to ensure the armed forces are effectively equipped organized trained and exercised for operations in cbw environments asserts the primacy of the us constitution requires the president to use the full range of his authority to enforce compliance requires the united states to reject any russian effort to make its ratification contingent on us financial assistance requires the united states to limit its cw defensive assistance under article x when extended to countries of concern to medical antidotes and treatments prescribes us responses to unauthorized release of confidential business information by the opcw or other parties states the sense of the senate that us negotiators should not agree to treaties that bar reservations prohibits transfer of inspection samples collected in the united states to laboratories outside the united states states the senate finding that chemical weapons terrorism is still threat states the senate declaration that the united states should not be denied its vote in the cwc organization sense of the senate that the us onsite inspection agency should provide assistance to facilities subject to routine inspection under the cwc limits us assessment for opcw to 25 million ties increases to the consumer price index provides for certain exceptions eg verification costs reaffirms the senates role in treaty interpretation reaffirms the senates role regarding arms control treaties requires presidential certification that the cwc does not restrict us use of riot control agents in certain specified circumstances requires notification and consultation when chemical is added to cwc schedules requires the president to explore alternative technologies for the destruction of the us chemical weapons stockpile requires criminal search warrant for challenge inspections and administrative search warrant for routine inspections if not permitted voluntarily crs3 implementing legislation pl 105277 in the 105th congress on may 23 1997 the senate unanimously passed s 610 this legislation as reported by the judiciary committee was an amendment in the nature of substitute for the administrations implementing legislation cwc supporters with objections to provisions of s 610 as reported hoped they could be resolved before final enactment perhaps in housesenate conference congressional record may 23 p s5078 however in october 1998 the house incorporated s 610s language without amendment into the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act this passed the house and senate and was signed into law october 20th 1998 pl 105277 22 usc 75 the implementing legislation sets criminal and civil penalties for the development production acquisition stockpiling transfer possession or use of chemical weapons these penalties would also apply to anyone who assists encourages induces attempts or conspires to carry out these proscribed activities it also establishes 1 procedures for seizure forfeiture and destruction of contraband chemical weapons 2 statutory authority for recordkeeping and reporting requirements relevant to the cwc 3 various restrictions on certain chemicals depending on their likelihood of being used to produce chemical weapons and 4 protective regime for confidential business information gathered from private corporations it also provides detailed procedures to be used for onsite inspections by the opcw including limitations on access and search warrant procedures should they be required the provisions now enacted into law which raise concerns from cwc supporters and the opcw include section 213 sets procedures for us firms to seek compensation from the us government should they suffer the loss of proprietary information through the actions of opcw employees critics however maintain that as worded this section does not place high enough burden of proof on the claimants and consequently could lead to excessive and unfounded claims against the government sections 237 grants the president the right to deny request for inspection if it may cause threat to us national security interests the cwc contains provision permitting denial of an inspection and critics note that doing so could place the united states in noncompliance they maintain that even if never exercised this sections existence will encourage other nations to enact similar exemptions thereby weakening the cwc verification regime section 253 exempts discrete organic chemicals not on the cwc control lists and incidental chemical byproducts or wastestreams from reporting and inspection requirements this is intended to ease potential burdens particularly on paper manufacturers but critics believe the exemption is too broadly worded and would rule out an effective nonintrusive sampling technique for inspectors sections 212 238 prohibit requiring that government contractors waive any crs4 constitutional rights for any purpose related to the cwc some believe that this could hinder the cwc routine inspection regime ussoviet bilateral agreements ussoviet memorandum of understanding wyoming mou september 1989 in 1989 as the multilateral negotiations slowed the ussoviet bilateral talks took on greater importance and assumed much higher public profile on september 23 1989 the united states and the soviet union signed bilateral memorandum of understanding mou agreeing to data declarations on cw stockpiles and trial inspections us intelligence officials believe that russian declarations have been incomplete particularly in the area of binary chemical weapons and novel chemical agents high level consultations continue to try to resolve these discrepancies compliance with this agreement is factor in the bush administrations decision not to provide the certification of russias commitment to arms control upon which further nunnlugar threat reduction aid is contingent the russian chemical weapons destruction program is beneficiary of this aid program usrussian chemical weapons destruction agreement june 1990 on june 1 1990 the united states and russia signed an agreement covering the production of chemical weapons and the destruction of current cw stockpiles this agreement as yet not implemented would permit routine bilateral monitoring and challenge inspections of the cw destruction process conducted in accordance with the provisions of the chemical weapons convention russia has communicated to the administration that the bilateral destruction agreement bda described below has outlived its usefulness and should be superseded by the chemical weapons convention us officials however still support the bda and are continuing talks on the issue russian cost estimates concluded that the bda verification regime would be more expensive than opcw monitoring and inspections provisions of the chemical weapons convention more than 100 years of international efforts to ban chemical weapons culminated january 13 1993 in the signing of the chemical weapons convention cwc the cwc bans the development production stockpiling and use of chemical weapons cw by its states parties it also requires the destruction of all chemical weapons and production facilities the convention provides the most extensive and intrusive verification regime of any arms control treaty extending its coverage to not only governmental but also civilian facilities the verification package includes instrumentmonitoring both routine and random onsite inspections and challenge inspections for sites suspected of cw storage or production the convention also requires export controls and reporting requirements on chemicals that can be used as warfare agents and their precursors administratively the convention established the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw located in the hague netherlands to crs5 oversee the conventions implementation it is permanent international organization charged with ensuring compliance with the convention and monitoring the chemical industry worldwide the opcw has three components 1 the conference of states parties comprising all signatories 2 the executive council composed of 41 signatories chosen in rotation based upon geographic region and significance of commercial chemical production and 3 the technical secretariat which will conduct daytoday administration of the convention each signatory also designates national authority to be the liaison with the opcw and administer the implementation of the cwc domestically on june 25 1999 president clinton issued an executive order designating the state department as the national authority for the implementation of the cwc and establishing an interagency group httpwwwcwcgov comprising the secretaries of state defense commerce and energy and the attorneygeneral to coordinate the implementation declarations required from each state party by the cwc include location and detailed inventory of all chemical weapons storage sites location and capacities of all chemical weapons production and research facilities all transfers of chemical weapons and cw production equipment since 1946 detailed plan and schedule for the destruction of chemical weapons and cw production facilities location and activities of any facilities using or producing controlled chemicals these declarations and ensuing reports to the opcw are released only to other states parties to provide evidence of treaty compliance other information obtained by the opcw eg through inspections is neither published or otherwise released without the permission of the countries concerned destruction of chemical weapons agents munitions and production facilities is to be completed within 10 years of the conventions entry into force 1997 or state partys ratification date whichever is earlier in extraordinary circumstances this deadline can be extended for up to 5 years with the approval of twothirds of the states parties both the united states and russia have applied for and been granted extensions the convention establishes three lists schedules httpwwwopcworghtmldbchemind_framesethtmlof chemical warfare agents and their precursor chemicals arranged in order of their importance to cw production and range of legitimate peaceful uses these chemical schedules are to be updated as needed by the opcw technical secretariat above certain quantitative thresholds these chemicals production use or transfer must be projected and subsequently reported annually to the opcw all facilities capable of producing or that use scheduled chemicals must be registered in addition all facilities that produce over 30 metric tons of discrete chemical containing phosphorous sulphur or fluorine must be registered for the chemicals included in the schedule 1 there is total ban on transfers to states not party to the convention there is also the obligation to notify the opcw crs6 of any transfer of the compounds to states parties irrespectively of the quantity and retransfer is prohibited in keeping with the cwcs provisions there has been ban on transfers of schedule 2 chemicals to nonstate parties place since the 29th of april 2000 additionally the state parties shall declare annually the total quantities transferred among of them by chemical and by country for the chemicals included in schedule 3 the convention establishes the same obligation in terms of declaration of the total annual imports and exports per country and per chemical and there is also the obligation to require an export licence called an end use certificate for exports to nonstate parties it is currently being discussed in the opcw whether other kinds of restrictions or total ban of these transfers will be put in place in the future for the united states the export controls are administered by the department of commerces bureau of industry and security httpwwwbxadocgov which maintains an informational website us chemical weapons web httpwwwcwcgov to assist us industry in compliance with these controls the opcws facility inspection regimes vary depending on the type of facility declared cw production storage or destruction sites systematic onsite inspection and continuous instrument monitoring declared noncw chemical facilities routine or random inspections depending on the schedule and amounts of chemicals produced or used all other facilities onsite challenge inspections upon request of state party and approval of the opcw executive committee cwc issues for congress the cwc raises variety of issues for congressional consideration although the vast majority of the worlds nations have signed the cwc some nations suspected of having chemical weapons have not egypt iraq libya north korea syria what effect does this lack of universality have upon the value of the convention the cwcs verification provisions are extensive but they have not stilled the debate over whether they are effective enough to deter violations and if violations are detected are enforcement procedures and sanctions sufficiently stringent because the cwc extends its provisions to the civilian sector the impact of inspections reporting requirements and export controls on commercial enterprise raises concerns unique to arms control treaties the destruction of the us chemical weapon stockpile though congressionallymandated independently of the cwc presents technical environmental and financial challenges issues deserving attention can be grouped in six general areas 1 universality 2 verification 3 impact on us industry 4 enforcement 5 technology transfer 6 destruction of chemical weapons here and in russia and 7 costs universality how many nations are willing to ratify the cwc and more importantly which nations are not 153 nations have ratified the convention 24 nations have signed but not ratified the convention and 15 nations have not signed see appendix 1 crs7 examining the signatory list most are heartened to see china iran israel and russia nations known or believed to have or be developing significant cw capability however israel has not ratified the convention and china iran and russia remain under suspicion with regard to compliance see verification and compliance some particularly troublesome nations such as iraq libya north korea and syria have not signed in addition number of middle eastern states notably egypt and jordan have refused to sign linking their participation to the removal of israels suspected nuclear capability at the april 2003 cwc review conference the us delegation called for powerful incentives both positive and negative to those states remaining outside the convention to join pointing particularly to libya north korea and syria1 critics of the cwc believe that its value is significantly reduced if all nations with the capability to develop and use chemical weapons are not parties particularly in region as volatile as the middle east the rationale is that even one nation having chemical weapons will create an incentive for its neighbors to follow suit they believe that it is unwise for the united states to relinquish its chemical weapons capability while other nations retain theirs some also maintain that the possibility of retaliation in kind ie with chemical weapons could be an important component of cw deterrence cwc supporters while agreeing to the importance of persuading all cwcapable nations to join believe that small number of holdouts does not pose sufficient threat to justify not ratifying the convention they note that in the first persian gulf war 19901991 the united states forswore retaliation with chemical weapons even if iraq were to use them against coalition forces this decision was based on the assessment that the us arsenal was adequate for both limited or massive retaliation without the use of chemical weapons cwc supporters further argue that without the convention there would be even greater incentive to acquire chemical weapons and it would be easier to accomplish they assert that cwc now provides an international regime of export controls and widely accepted international norm to which all nations signatories or not can be held verification and compliance verification of compliance is undoubtedly the thorniest issue devising an acceptable verification regime was the most difficult task for cwc negotiators and is the most challenging for those implementing the convention the cwc provides for the most intrusive and extensive verification regime of any arms control agreement to date the regime for the first time in arms control provides for routine monitoring and inspection not only of military facilities but also of certain civilian chemical facilities in addition challenge inspection provisions expand compliance verification to suspect facilities of any sort the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons httpwwwopcworgoversees the conventions compliance verification 1 united states of america national statement to the first review conference of the chemical weapons convention april 28 2003 as delivered p 2 crs8 the most serious question is whether the opcw will be able to detect all clandestine production or stockpiling of chemical weapons ironically the cwcs supporters and detractors generally agree the answer is acknowledging that the verification regime will not be absolute carries differing significance for the conventions critics and advocates those who question the conventions value believe that if compliance verification cannot be guaranteed and undetected cw possession may be possible the convention is not worth the cost and effort worse perhaps they are concerned that the convention would engender false sense of security they point out that in certain circumstances the selective use of relatively small amounts of chemical weapons could be significant militarily particularly against unprotected personnel consequently wouldbe violators need not produce or stockpile vast amounts advocates argue that though cwc may be imperfect it can provide the most intrusive and extensive verification regime in the history of disarmament and represents notable improvement over current cw nonproliferation regimes for signatories this fact could change the costbenefit analysis of cw production or stockpiling enough to deter violations provision for challenge inspections creates the likelihood that violations would become public breaches of the international norm something not possible without the cwc the most difficult challenge is to detect existing chemical weapons that nation does not declare and continues to store clandestinely detecting illicit transfers of controlled chemicals is also challenging task covert production of chemical warfare agents and the subsequent manufacture of chemical munitions are higherprofile activities and consequently more vulnerable to detection this assessment assumes that the opcw and signatories national intelligence resources will seek to uncover convention violators consequently the extent of intelligence sharing has significant impact on the cwcs effectiveness it is not clear however to what extent the states parties are sharing relevant intelligence information with the opcw it is possible that concerns over possible leaks or compromising intelligence sources have weighed more heavily than the desire to assist the opcw in its mission another factor that affects the opcws verification capabilities is the amount and reliability of its funding by the conventions signatories without adequate funding to maintain the technological and personnel resources necessary to monitor the international chemical industry and government activities the rigor of the verification regime suffers budgetary difficulties have plagued the opcw for the last several years the united states has not supported requested budget increases in the past two years sought by the opcw administration to maintain inspection schedules but rather directed the opcw instead to establish more efficient appropriate costeffective approaches 2 however with new director general overseeing the opcw the united states has now approved an overall opcw budget increase of 67 for 2004 raising the total budget to 865 million in 2002 the united states negotiated reduction of its opcw dues to 22 of the operating budget which amounts to 1903 million for 2004 delinquent dues and inspection 2 united states of america national statement to the first review conference of the chemical weapons convention april 28 2003 as delivered p 4 crs9 reimbursements still remain significant problem for the opcw amounting in total to about 42 million as of july 2003 the arms control and disarmament act 22 usc 2551 requires an annual report from the state department titled adherence to and compliance with arms control and nonproliferation agreements and commitments 3 the most recent of these reports august 2003 assesses that china iran russia and sudan are carrying out activities inconsistent with the cwc as follows china maintains an active offensive rd program possible cw stockpile and undeclared cwrelated facilities iran is retaining and modernizing elements of its cw program including rd an undeclared stockpile and an offensive production capability russia has not made complete declarations regarding cw production cw development facilities and cw agentsweapons sudan has established an offensive rd program at the cwcs first review conference april 2003 assistant secretary of state for arms control stephen rademaker reiterated us assertions against iran and sudan though secretary rademaker said that the opcw must not shrink from the task of confronting those states parties that are violating the convention the united states did not request formal opcw action regarding these allegations4 responding to those who questioned why the us did not avail itself of the cwcs challenge inspection provisions to address its suspicions the us delegation maintained that challenge inspections would be ineffective in finding illicit weapons and could falsely exonerate nations5 specific reference was made to concerns over russia or china in secretary rademakers presentation to the opcw review conference with regard to russia the concerns over verification are primarily focused on russias failure to acknowledge research and development on binary chemical weapons binary chemical weapons use two nonlethal chemicals that combine to form lethal agent after launching the united states worked on developing binary weapons sporadically from the 1950s ending the effort in 1992 when the signing of the cwc became imminent us intelligence has long believed that russia was undertaking similar program in 1992 russian scientist vil mirzayanov publicly claimed that russia had developed binary agent significantly more effective than current nerve agents he also asserted that the russian military 3 adherence to and compliance with arms control and nonproliferation agreements and commitments department of state august 2003 p 33 4 united states of america national statement to the first review conference of the chemical weapons convention april 28 2003 as delivered p 4 5 the cbw conventions bulletin june 2003 p 29 crs10 leadership continued the program after president gorbachev declared russias chemical weapons development at an end concern over this russian program rekindled in 1997 with the leaking of classified dod report to the press written at the us ground intelligence center the report supposedly maintains that the new agent can be manufactured in significant amounts in modified pesticide plants from chemicals not covered by the cwc washington times february 4 1997 p1 cwc opponents believe this information highlights the difficulties of verification and the lack of russian trustworthiness cwc supporters have responded that without the cwc such program is legal but with the cwc and accession to it it would be illegal and suspect facilities would be subject to inspection the united states having specifically requested an accounting of the russian binary program and received inadequate responses is continuing discussions to resolve these discrepancies although the current data exchange is independent of the cwc russian recalcitrance on this issue could adversely affect support for the convention if russia is unwilling to be forthright in what is generally judged to be an open secret it raises the question of how seriously it considers the prohibitions of the cwc and consequently places greater emphasis on effective verification the bush administration has highlighted this point by its decision not to provide the certification of russias commitment to arms control upon which nunnlugar threat reduction aid is contingent unless russia provides further information on these programs see below chemical weapons stockpiles and facilities destruction impact on us industry many us enterprises do not meet the cwc threshold requirements for reporting and others may have minimal obligations eg onepage reports because of the nature of the chemicals they handle for the most part the heaviest burden annual reports on productionconsumptiontransfer and at least one initial inspection falls upon enterprises that deal with substantial amounts of chemicals that could be very useful in the production of cw warfare agents implementing legislation for the cwc addressed some issues that are novel for arms control agreements the convention grants the opcw inspection rights routine random and challenge over purely civilian privately owned facilities these inspection rights are harmonized with us constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure through procedures for obtaining administrative or criminal search warrants if necessary 22 usc 6725 loss of proprietary information trade secrets potential loss of trade secrets is of great concern to private industry and the question arises whether forced or incidental disclosure of such information during cwc inspection would constitute seizure under the fourth amendment implementing legislation addressed this issue by restricting information collection providing nondisclosure protection and penalties for unauthorized disclosure of conventionrelated information to date there have been prosecutions for unlawful disclosures chemical industries emphasize that it is essential to protect proprietary information or trade secrets to maintain competitive advantage in the marketplace and the cwc through its enforcement and verification procedures will require greater crs11 level of openness regarding production processes and rates product composition and market distribution however the us chemical industry represented through the chemical manufacturers association now the american chemistry council and the pharmaceutical manufacturers association strongly endorsed the conventions confidentiality measures and supported the cwcs ratification export controls the cwc requires restrictions on the export or transfer of controlled chemicals to nonstates parties these restrictions vary in severity depending upon the chemicals involved also as an incentive for nations to sign the cwc the restrictions tighten in the years following the convention coming into force as noted earlier there is total ban on the export of chemicals on schedules 1 2 there are ongoing discussions on whether to apply this ban to schedule 3 chemicals in the near future see above provisions of the chemical weapons convention the united states already had variety of export controls on cwrelated chemicals equipment and technology6 these stem from both unilateral action and steps the united states has taken as member of the australia group ag7 the cwc export control provisions have consequently not engendered significant controversy domestically the export control regime of the australia group remains an issue of contention with developing countries who maintain that it inhibits legitimate technology transfer and should not be applied to nations that are cwc states parties the australia group members have not found this argument persuasive and remain convinced that the ag regime remains useful complement to the cwc particularly given that its control lists are more extensive than those negotiated for the convention 6 see crs report rl31559 proliferation control regimes background and status 7 in response to the use of chemical weapons in the iraniraq war in the 1980s the united states and several other countries began to implement export controls on chemicals that could be used to manufacture chemical weapons in 1985 australia proposed that concerned countries meet in order to coordinate their export controls and share information to enhance their effectiveness the first meeting took place in june 1985 and biennial meetings continue at the australian embassy in paris the australia group first established list of cwrelated chemicals and equipment to control in 1990 in response to growing concerns over the proliferation of covert biological weapons programs certain biological agents and researchproduction equipment were added to the control list australia group guidelines do not call for prohibiting the export of control list items but rather establishing export monitoring and licensing procedures with export denial only if there is reason to suspect potential contribution to cbw program the groups list does not curtail legitimate trade national governments administer their own export control programs as an informal effort it is not based on international treaty is not affiliated with any international organization and has independent administrative structure it operates entirely upon consensus of its 33 members

germany greece hungary iceland ireland italy japan republic of korea luxembourg the netherlands new zealand norway poland portugal romania slovakia spain switzerland turkey united kingdom the united states and the european commission crs12 enforcementsanctions the question of sanctions was addressed late in the cwc negotiations the consultative nature of the conventions provisions and the lack of specificity regarding sanctions to be levied against convention violators reflect the difficulty of those negotiations it is generally anticipated that international sanctions would consist of trade and perhaps arms embargoes cwc critics believe that its enforcement sanctions are too vague to be an effective deterrent they question the effectiveness of economic and arms embargoes maintaining that 1 embargoes are almost impossible to enforce internationally 2 they historically have seldom achieved their foreign policy objectives and 3 if they are effective at all it is only over the long term cwc supporters argue that the lack of specificity regarding possible sanctions heightens potential violators uncertainty about breaking the convention they believe that this uncertainty and the international approbation that would be generated by the enforcement procedure will sufficiently affect the costbenefit analysis of chemical weapons production to deter potential violator they also do not accept the assertion that international sanctions are without effect maintaining that at minimum they significantly degrade nations ability to maintain cw program they point to the evidence that the international sanctions and inspection regime imposed upon iraq in the 1990s apparently stymied iraqs cw production and research to far greater extent than initially believed by many chemical weapons stockpiles and facilities destruction the cwc mandates the destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles and production facilities within 10 years of the conventions coming into force ie april 2007 the convention also specifies the order in which different types of weapons shall be destroyed and interim deadlines clause permitting an extension of up to five years upon approval of the conference of state parties was included specifically in anticipation of russias not being able to meet the destruction deadline given its political and economic instability in the 1990s however now both russia and the united states have had to request extensions of both interim and final destruction deadlines u s chemical weapons destruction program in october the united states acknowledged that it would not be able to destroy 45 of its cw stockpile by the interim deadline of april 29 2004 of particular interest is that the united states requested an extension of the 45 interim deadline to december 2007 full eight months after the conventions deadline for the destruction of the entire stockpile this request and its implication that the united states will not be able to meet the final destruction deadline of april 2007 reflects the many difficulties the destruction program has encountered over the last 18 years accepting that the united states is undertaking good faith effort to destroy its stockpile on october 24 the eighth opcw conference of states parties approved the extension of the 45 deadline to december 2007 and the extension of the final deadline in principle with date specified these deadline extensions notwithstanding the united states is by far the country most advanced in its cw destruction program in the early 1980s dod crs13 declared approximately 90 of the us chemical stockpile 28000 agent tons obsolete this decision coupled with 1985 congressional directive to destroy these munitions led dod to begin planning destruction program almost two decades ago nevertheless it is now entirely clear that the united states will be not able to meet the 2007 cwc deadline until very recently dod estimates have called for completing destruction on time but critics of the program have maintained for some time that these expectations were unrealistic indeed in october 1998 an independent analysis commissioned by dod and conducted by the arthur anderson firm estimated that none of the cw destruction facilities had even 5 chance of meeting their destruction deadlines dod rebutted the audit maintaining that it was based on old data and did not reflect increased efficiencies8 in 2001 the controversy arose again when the senate appropriations subcommittee on defense obtained an internal army report operations schedule task force 2000final report that first indicated that it was doubtful that even an extended final deadline of 2012 could be met the report detailed the actual munition destruction rates at the johnston atoll depot showing them to be much lower than previous official estimates and indicated that substantially the same destruction rates should be expected at other incineration facilities if so the cw stockpile destruction program would extend beyond 2014 dod initially contended that the report was worst case scenario but then the dod selected acquisition report released in april 2002 revealed an 80 increase in the destruction programs costs owing specifically to revised destruction rates and schedule extensions the task force 2000final report reflects the challenges at depots where incineration is the destruction method

chemical residue which must be treated as hazardous material and its safe disposal has become an issue of public concern9 among the factors dod has identified as contributing to the delays are revised destruction rates new environmental regulations worsethanexpected stockpile condition and unanticipated emergency preparedness requirements in addition to these factors which are mostly out of dods control there has been fairly consistent criticism of the destruction programs management almost since its inception the 8 report sees overruns of 34 months 289 billion in weapons disposal associated

has issued several program assessments with the most recent continuing to emphasize significant administrative problems the chemical demilitarization program remains in turmoil because number of longstanding leadership organizational and strategic planning issues remain unresolved the program lacks stable leadership at the upper management levels for example the program has had frequent turnover in the leadership providing oversight further recent reorganizations have done little to reduce the complex and fragmented organization of the program as result roles and responsibilities are often unclear and program actions are not always coordinated finally the absence of comprehensive strategy leaves the program without clear road map and methods to monitor program performance without these key elements dod and the army have assurance of meeting their goal to destroy the chemical stockpile in safe and timely manner and within cost estimates10 gao issued several recommendations to improve program management eg establish longterm objectives define roles and responsibilities of dod and army offices and develop shortterm performance measures dod has concurred with those recommendations and has begun implementation however given that the us request to the opcw for destruction deadline extensions left the date for final completion unspecified it would seem that uncertainty about the pace of the destruction program remains high difficulties that the united states has encountered with the chemical weapons destruction program have been reflected in the significant cost estimate growth since its inception in 1985 for example dod estimated the total program cost would be between 12 to 20 billion these cost estimates routinely increased reaching 132 billion in 2001 then in april 2002 acknowledging the program delays noted above the department of defense selected acquisition report announced new 80 increase in the total cost estimate raising it to 237 billion for fy2004 the defense department requested total of 165 billion for the chemical demilitarization program rd 251 million procurement 79 million operations maintenance 12 billion and military construction 119million congress appropriated these funds as requested russian cw destruction program russia possesses the worlds largest chemical weapons stockpile estimated to be 40000 to 50000 tons russian officials have made it clear that both technological and financial assistance is needed to destroy its chemical weapons as part of the comprehensive threat reduction assistance programs often called nunnlugar programs the united states has appropriated approximately 437 million between fy1992fy2003 to assist in the design and construction of nerve agent destruction facility in shchuchye in addition the united states has agreed to share destruction technology and participate 10 sustained leadership along with key strategic management tools is needed to guide dods destruction program general accounting office september 2003 report gao031031 p 1 crs15 in the exchange of technical experts to facilitate these efforts the united states has opened chemical weapons destruction support office cwdso in moscow11 during consideration of the fy2000 dod budget request both the house and senate armed services committees expressed strong reservations about russias ability to fund operation of the shchuchye facility if constructed and noted the relative paucity of assistance from other nations for this program consequently the fy2000 dod authorization act pl 10665 sec 1305 forbade further funding for chemical weapons facility in russia dods efforts in the fy2001 budget considerations to have this provision repealed and 35 million appropriated for shchuchye facility met continued congressional skepticism house and senate armed services committee conferees accepted senate amendment in the dod fy2001 authorization act hr 4205 which amended the existing statutory prohibition to permit shchuchye funding only after dod certification that russia has agreed to provide 25 million annually for construction and operation russia has agreed to use the facility to destroy its four other nerve agent stockpiles the united states has obtained multiyear commitments from the international community to assist infrastructure improvement around shchuchye russia has agreed to destroy its cw production facilities at volgograd and novocheboksark these conditions were coupled with dod reporting requirement on russian and international financial contributions towards the safeguarding and destruction of russias nerve agent stockpiles for fy2002 and fy2003 congress satisfied that sufficient progress has been made in meeting these conditions approved appropriation of 35 million and 55 million for the shchuchye facility though these amounts were substantially below dods budget request for fy2004 the congress agreed to appropriate the administrations full budget request of 200 million even with foreign assistance russia will not be able to meet cwc destruction deadlines it has requested an extension until 2012 but few believe that extension will be sufficient consequently the cwc conference of states parties has approved an extension of russias interim deadline to destroy 20 of its stockpile to april 2007 and also agreed to an extension of subsequent deadlines in principle with date specified the general accounting office has estimated that without additional destruction facilities it could take at least 40 years for russian to complete destruction of its nerve agent stockpile12 11 see also crs report rl31957 nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance us programs in the former soviet union 12 weapons of mass
