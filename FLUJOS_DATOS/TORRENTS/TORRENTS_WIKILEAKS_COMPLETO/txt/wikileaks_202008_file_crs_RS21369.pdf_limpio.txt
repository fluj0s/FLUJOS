describing that they had constructed inf ectious poliovirus from mailordered pieces of dna1 this research was funded by the depa rtment of defense through the defense advanced research projects agency darpa the publication of this report has intensified the debate on how best to balance the need for openness in science with the need to protect national security technical background the disease poliomyelitis or polio is caused by poliovirus like many viruses the genetic material of poliovirus is made of rna ribonucleic acid instead of dna deoxyribonucleic acid which comprises human genes

viruses poliovirus cannot reproduce on its own it must hijack its hos ts proteinmaking enzymes to reproduce after infecting the host cell poliovirus for ces the host cell to produce so many viral copies that eventually the cell bursts this re leases the viral copies freeing them to infect other cells2 to make poliovirus in the laboratory th scientists first assembled dna version of the viral rna genome this was done because dna is much easier to manipulate in the laboratory than rna and short pref abricated custommad dna pieces are readily available by mail order fro m laboratory supply companies the complete genetic sequence of poliovirus has been known si nce 1981 and can be downloaded from the internet from sites that cater to researchers3 polio is one of the smallest of all viruses with genome of only about 7500 bases for comparison smallpox has about 185000 bases and humans have over 3 billion bases because only short pieces of custommade dna are available for mail order the scie ntists ordered over one hundred dna snippets at cost of about 1000004 these snippets were painstakingly strung together in the correct order although theoretically simple this process is tec hnically demanding and requires great deal of thorough double check ing done by skilled molecular biologists when the scientists finished the dna version of the complete viral genome they used an enzyme to make an rna ve rsion of their dna template when placed in test tube with appropriate chemicals and proteinmaking enzymes the pieces of rna did what they do in natu re made duplicates of themselves this included the required protein shells which s pontaneously enclosed the viral rna the researchers proved that the ne w viral particles were functional by showing that mice infected with this virus developed polio and became paralyzed reaction to the publication the publication of this research produced an instant debate among the public other scientists and the federa l government about the merits of this type of research the ethics of doing or publishing this type of resear ch and the ramificati ons it may have on public health and bioterrorism defense public reaction to this research was largely negative the public was taken by surprise there had been previous indication in the popular press that such thing could be remotely possible these experiments seemed to arm

believed that this approach would work9 dr wimmer the studys director disagreed re portedly stating this appro ach has been talked about but people didnt take it seriously now people have to ta ke it seriously10 dr donald kennedy the editor of science argued that the public debate following the publication justified his decision to publish this work11 however some may feel that the wide dissemination of this knowledge was too high cost for sparking debate that could have been started through more benign means some scientists also questioned the ethics of publicizing recipe for recreating disease that the world health organizati on and the united nations childrens fund have almost eliminated from nature as the humangenomesequencing pioneer dr j craig venter reportedly stated

regarding the publication of instructions on how to creat synthetic human polio virus it called on the scientific and publishing community to adopt guidelines to avoid similar publications in the future it also requested that the executive branch examine all policies including national security directives to ensure that information that may be useful in the development of chemical bi ological or nuclear weapons is not made accessible to terrorists or countries of pr oliferation concern this re solution referred to the house science energy and commerce and arme d services committees

vaccination is still required in the ited states the population is well protected against any outbreak also even without vaccination program poliovirus would be an unlikely choice for terrorists since it is weakly infective has low mortality and morbidity and causes symptoms only in low pe rcentage of infected people related concern is the use of this techni to make other mo re dangerous viruses dr wimmer suggested that this same technique could be used to make other viruses with small genomes such as hiv hepatitis b and c and yellow fever14 however it would be easier cheaper and quicker to obtain thes viruses from naturally occurring sources15 one obvious exception is that it would be difficult to obtain the smallpox virus variola major from nature the only two acknowle dged sources are under guard one in russia and the other in the unite d states therefore making variola major from scratch may be easier than obtaining it from these sources based on the costs and length of time required to produce poliovirus making variola major the exact same way would take more than 2 million for mailor dered dna and about 50 years to string it together based on current technology16 bioterrorists could shorten the time considerably by increasing the number of welltrained team members but it would still likely take many years also because the infectious mechanisms of variola major are more complicated than those of poliovirus this exact technique would not work molecular biological methods that would probably work for variola major are known to some experts in the field but these methods are considered much more technically demanding than those used for poliovirus because of these issues most experts believe it would be much easier to make variola major by modifying an easily obtained and cl osely related virus such as camelpox17 although ebola virus is theoretically availa ble in nature some experts believe that it is difficult to obtain18 ebolas genome is only twice the length of polios but its infectious mechanisms are as complex as those of smallpox it may be possible to make in the lab but as one expert reportedly put it few people in the world have that

surfing for satan bug op citbalance the need for openness in science with the need to protect national security several approaches to strike the ppropriate balance ve been proposed one such proposal is to increase oversig ht of custom dna suppliers ironically shortly before the publication of the synthe tic polio report integrated dna technologies the suppliers of mailordered dna for the st udy had reportedly writte n to the department of defense suggesting that some oversight of the industry was needed one suggestion was that orders should be screened for speci fic sequences and that suspect orders should be investigated by some federal agency20 however others argue that it would be hard to implement such strategy because of the nature of dna sequences it may be difficult to identify that short sequence belongs to an individual pathogen of concern rather than to completely different unr elated and harmless organism21 some also fear that terrorist could easily circumvent any such regulations by splitting orders among several companies or by making the specific redfl agraising sequences themselves additional steps such as regulating and tracking the sale of dnasynthesizing machinery and encouraging know thy customer expecta tion for dna suppliers may help increase the effectiveness of increas ed industry oversight22 different approach would be to limit access to the genetic information of pathogens of concern however current fede ral policy is to not classify basic research information funded or held by the govern ment if it does not ve national security implications the genetic sequences of pathogens has been viewed hitherto as falling outside this category currently the entire genomes of many potentially dangerous viruses are accessible on the internet some have suggested removing this sequence information from these database s and not publishing future sequences of any potential biological weapons however some feel th at legitimate and benefi cial research will be hurt by this for example dr paul keim s reportedly stated that it would have been impossible for him to develop the method that is being used to distinguish between closely related strains of anthrax in the inve stigation of the anthrax mailings without open access to the genome information23 however in an editorial the journal new scientist responded to this fear by arguing removing the genomes of certain pathogens from public databases need not impede any bona fide research legitimate labs could apply for licenses to access the information even if complete control will never be possible we could make the information harder to get hold of24 some policymakers may feel that although removing this information now would not recall the copies already obtained online it would stop any future terrorists from gettinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21369crs6 25 house science committee conducting research during the war on terrorism balancing openness and

terrorism security actions on re search development and higher education them as easily this approach would be more effective for the pathogens of concern that have not yet had thei r sequences published another approach that has drawn support of some policymakers is the development of guidelines to prevent the publication of information that could help terrorists the house committee on science held hearing to explore options of such policies25 the option generally preferred by so scientists and the publishi ng industry would be to have the scientific community develop and implement set of guidelines the american society for microbiology has adopted formal guidelines26 for the prepublication review of papers in its journals that deal with ag ents deemed by the centers for disease control and prevention to have the potential to pose severe threat to public health and safety27 under these guidelines peer reviewers flag manuscripts that cont ain details of methods or materials that might be misused these papers are subjected to greater scrutiny by the editors and the publications board the manuscript can be rejected if it is felt that it may pose threat to public safety it should be noted however that these policies would likely still have allowed for the publica tion of the polio paper since polio is not select agent because science publishing is an internati onal and competitive business even if most publishers agree to adhere to standards othe rs might publish the papers if they deem that there is market niche that th ey could capture by choosing not to adhere to any standards other than scientific merit the national academy of sciences plan to hold conference on this topic in 2003 the bush administration is conferring with federal agencies and representatives from academia and scientific publishers to examine the possibility of withholding from the public some nonclassified but sensitive information held by federal agencies28 the secretary of health and human services and the administrator of the environmental protection agency have been given original classification authority29 before receiving this power these entities did not have mechanism for limiting distribution of any information developed through in tramural or extramural research some scientists say that this type of clearly defined mechanism is preferable to new ambiguous category like sensitive but unclassified while many scientists share the desire to limit potential terrorists access to some information some fear that implementa tion of new policies might result in tendency to not publish many important findings if there is any question of sensitivity30
