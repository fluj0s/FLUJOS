michael f martin analyst in asian political economy foreign affairs defense and trade division asia pacific economic cooperation apec and the 2007 meetings in sydney australia summary there is apparent agreement between congress and the bush administration that the asia pacific economic cooperation apec is potential vehicle for advancing us economic trade diplomatic and security interests both globally and regionally in particular apec offers the united states an organizational counterpoint to other proposed regional associations in asia however the organizations approach and perspective on these issues may pose problems for the united states by design apec operates on the basis of consensus under which its members voluntarily liberalize their economic and trade policies as result apec lacks enforcement mechanisms commonly seen in other multilateral organizations the main topics of discussion during the september 2007 twoday leaders meeting and the twoday ministerial meeting were climate change and regional economic integration the leaders issued separate joint declaration on climate change which included aspirational commitments to reduce energy intensity by at least 25 by 2030 and to increase regional forest cover by at least 20 million hectares by 2020 apecs consensus position on the latter topic entitled strengthening regional economic integration was endorsed by the leaders the apec meetings also discussed the recent global problem with food and product safety for the bush administration the apec meetings provided an opportunity to reiterate its interest in forming free trade area of the asiapacific ftaap and to hold bilateral talks with number of important asia leaders during the apec meetings australian prime minister john howard and president george bush signed the usaustralia defense trade cooperation treaty also during his speech to the apec business summit president bush proposed the creation of an asia pacific democracy partnership some apec members were critical of the departure of president bush and secretary rice prior to the end of the leaders meeting proponents of greater us involvement in apec argue that the association provide the united states with vehicle to reenergize its involvement in asian trade discussions and to take more active diplomatic role in the region they suggest the united states should increase its financial assistance to apec through the annual contribution and specific assistance programs and alterations in us laws and policies on key issues others maintain that apec may not be an effective mechanism for advancing us interests in the region the presidents initiatives at sydney present the 110th congress with opportunities to weigh in on the issue congress may take up the issue of the current level of direct and indirect financial support for apec also congress may consider apecs goals of trade and investment liberalization when legislating on various other programs in

the 2007 meetings in sydney australia introduction the asia pacific economic cooperation apec has been identified by both congress and the bush administration as an organization that may help promote the us goal of liberalizing international trade and investment in asia and possibly the rest of the world in addition because of the unique nature of apecs membership and organization the association provides forum at which the united states can hold bilateral discussions on noneconomic matters such as international security and human rights as one indicator of congressional interest in apec in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 pl 109163 congress called for the president to develop comprehensive strategy to address the emergence of china economically diplomatically and militarily promote mutually beneficial trade relations with china and encourage chinas adherence to international norms in the areas of trade international security and human rights1 it continues by specifying that this comprehensive strategy should identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize united states engagement in east asia the act then states the initiatives should have regional focus and complement bilateral efforts the asia pacific economic cooperation forum apec offers ready mechanism for pursuit of such initiatives2 emphasis added the notion that apec may be an effective forum for advancing us interests in asia is apparently shared by the bush administration during white house pre trip press briefing on august 30 2007 national security council senior director dennis wilder stated the importance that the president attaches to apec is demonstrated by the fact that he has not missed an apec leaders meeting since taking office3 in addition senior administration officials indicate that the white house sees apec as model for regional economic integration in the asia pacific which allows the united states to play significant role in the regions political and economic development some members of the association of southeast asian nations 1 pl 109163 section 1234b 2 pl 109163 section 1234c4 3 press briefing on the presidents trip to australia and the apec summit by senior administration officials us department of state august 30 2007 crs2 asean4 have been actively pursuing alternative asian only models for regional economic development including asean 1 asean and china asean 3 asean china japan and south korea and the east asia summit eas also known as asean 6 asean australia china india japan new zealand and south korea the bush administrations interest in apec may bring up the regional forum before the 110th congress in several ways first congress may choose to consider the level of direct and indirect financial support provided to apec second congress may take into account us commitments to apec when considering legislation on various trade and nontrade issues third congress may increase oversight of apecrelated activities and programs of the us trade representative the department of state and other federal departments and agencies although both congress and the bush administration view apec as important to us trade and economic and human security interests in the asia it is uncertain that apec is reliable mechanism for advancing those interests and if congress and the bush administration share common view of what the us interests in asia are in particular the organizational and operational structure of apec is unusual among multilateral associations reflecting an atypical approach to trade liberalization as result apecs approach organization and operations may make it difficult for the united states to promote its positions on various issues through its activities in apec apecs approach to trade liberalization apec is an association of 21 member economies5 bordering the pacific ocean that are working cooperatively to promote economic growth and prosperity in the asiapacific region during the 1994 meetings in bogor indonesia apec established the bogor goals of free and open trade and investment in the asiapacific by 2010 for industrialized economies and 2020 for developing economies6 these goals have been reaffirmed at the leaders meeting each subsequent year apec began in 1989 as an australian initiative backed by japan and new zealand in recognition of the growing interdependence among asiapacific 4 asean members include brunei darussalam burma myanmar cambodia indonesia laos malaysia the philippines singapore thailand and vietnam 5 it currently consists of 21 member economies australia brunei darussalam canada chile chinese taipei taiwan hong kong china indonesia japan malaysia mexico new zealand papua new guinea the peoples republic of china peru the republic of korea the republic of the philippines the russian federation singapore thailand the united states and vietnam the members of apec are referred to as economies or members not nations or countries due to the concurrent membership of hong kong the peoples republic of china and taiwan 6 the complete text of the bogor goals is available on apecs web page at httpwwwapecorgapecleaders__declarations1994html crs3 economies and in response to the freetrade areas that had developed in europe and north america it is the only international trade organization in which hong kong mainland china and taiwan are all members in contrast to most other multilateral organizations apec is cooperative forum in which members arrive at decisions via consensus all commitments made by members are voluntary apec has formal enforcement mechanisms to compel members to comply with any trade liberalization policies previously declared at apec meetings an approach often referred to as open regionalism7 point 9 of the 1994 apec economic leaders declaration of common resolve states apec economies that are ready to initiate and implement cooperative arrangement may proceed to do so while those that are not yet ready to participate may join at later date8 the underlying notion of the apec approach to trade liberalization is that voluntary commitments are easier to achieve and more likely to be implemented than obligatory commitments derived from agreements negotiated by more traditional and potentially confrontational methods by establishing common vision or goal for the organization the belief is that future apec discussions can make more rapid progress towards the organizations goals by seeking consensus views with which members are willing to comply by contrast trade agreements negotiated according to more traditional approaches tend to foster confrontation and expectations of reciprocal concessions lacking shared goal or objectives it may be difficult to resolve differences among the parties and complete an agreement later on if any party to the agreement feels that it was inequitable they may fail to comply with the terms of the agreement or withdraw from the agreement in its entirety even if there are formal sanction or grievance provisions within the agreement apec strives to meet the bogor goals in three broad areas of cooperation first members consult with each other to formulate individual and collective actions to liberalize merchandise and service trade as well as international investment second members discuss their domestic regulations and procedures to find ways of facilitating international business third the members engage in economic and technical cooperation or ecotech to provide training and foster greater cooperation among apec members in 1995 apec created template to achieve the bogor goals in its osaka action agenda9 the osaka action agenda emphasizes apecs resolute opposition to an inwardlooking trading bloc that would divert from the pursuit

httpwwwapecorgapecleaders__declarations 1995html crs4 global free trade by accepting set of fundamental principles for apecs trade and investment liberalization and facilitation these principles include comprehensiveness wto consistency comparability nondiscrimination transparency flexibility and cooperation apec organization and operation apecs unusual approach to trade liberalization is reflected in its organization and operation apecs organization consists of small secretariat in singapore which reports to the constituents of five separate groups the preeminent leaders meeting the apec business advisory council the ministerial meeting the sectoral minister meetings and the senior officials meetings the secretariat in turn supervisors the work of six different groups the committee on trade and investment the economic committee the steering committee on ecotech the budget and management committee special task groups and working groups each member of apec seconds representatives to work on the secretariats staff to serve as program directors10 figure 1 apec organization the focal point of apec activities is the annual leaders meeting in which the apec leaders set goals publicize them and provide momentum for the process11 this is usually held in october or november of each year and is attended by heads of state except for those from taiwan and hong kong who because of chinas 10 in 2006 the united states seconded scott smith to work with the apec secretariat 11 the leaders meetings are technically not summits because of the presence of hong kong and taiwan whose leaders are not officially heads of state crs5 objections send other representatives the first leaders meeting was held in 1993 on blake island near seattle washington major decisions are generally affirmed andor announced at the leaders meeting the meeting also provides platform for and gives momentum to major apec initiatives although apec confines its agenda primarily to economic issues the leaders often hold bilateral meetings during the leaders meeting to discuss international security human rights and other issues most of the decisions announced at the leaders meeting are first considered in series of ministerial meetings held throughout the year these include the respective ministers dealing with trade finance transportation telecommunications human resources development education energy environment science and technology and small and mediumsized enterprises the largest ministerial is the annual joint ministerial meeting which precedes the leaders meeting it usually is attended by foreign trade or commerce ministers from member states the various ministerial meetings make recommendations to the leaders meeting they do not have the authority to act independently on behalf of apec working under the direction of the various apec ministers the senior officials coordinate the activities of the various committees working groups and task forces within apec senior officials meetings are held three or four times year the current us senior official for apec is ambassador patricia m haslach the apec business advisory council abac consists of up to three individuals appointed by each apec member it provides advice on implementing the apec agenda and other specific businessrelated issues12 abac also can make comments on the recommendations of the various ministerial meetings most of the specific tasks before apec are addressed in committees working groups or expert groups that deal with economic issues of importance to the region for implementing the bogor goals the committee on trade and investment plays the key role apec has ten working groups that work on specific areas of cooperation and facilitation 1 trade and investment data 2 trade promotion 3 industrial science and technology 4 human resources development 5 energy cooperation 6 marine resource conservation 7 telecommunications 8 transportation 9 tourism and 10 fisheries each working group has one or more shepherds members who take responsibility for coordinating the work of the group the apec chair rotates annually and since 1989 has been held by in order australia singapore south korea thailand the united states indonesia japan the philippines canada malaysia new zealand brunei peoples republic of china mexico thailand chile south korea and vietnam in 2007 australia was once again the apec chair with the leaders meeting held on september 89 in sydney 12 us representatives to abac are spencer kim chairman of cbol corporation and michael phillips chairman of russell investment group crs6 decisions within apecs various organizational bodies are based on the consensus approach of apec most committees working groups and special task groups have representatives from all 21 members and select their leadership from amongst themselves members may delay or refrain from any action recommended or approved by meeting committee working group or special task force without facing sanctions or recriminations from other members however all decisions and agreements of the various meetings committees and working groups must be implemented in accordance with the osaka action agenda apec actions take place at three levels actions by individual members actions with the confines of apec and collective apec actions with respect to other multinational organizations the primary form of individual member actions are the individual action plans or iaps each year apec members submit at the ministerial meeting an iap that spells out what steps the member has taken andor will take to advance their trade regime towards the achievement of the bogor goals iaps typically are organized along both sectoral eg architectural services and topical eg customs procedures lines although members cannot impose changes on each others iaps the osaka action agenda calls on each member to consult submit and review the iaps to foster comparability transparency and cooperation amongst the iaps the internal actions of apec generally involve research on topics related to trade liberalization the exchange of best practices and the standardization of policies and procedures related to international trade and investment in some cases apec will create working group on particular topic with the goals of generating collective action plan or cap in some cases the caps are little more than topical summary of the member iaps in other cases the working group plays more active role in promoting trade liberalization and facilitation via the caps another example of an apecs internal action is the apec business travel card an idea advanced by the abac business travelers possessing an apec business travel card are allowed fasttrack entry and exit through special apec lanes at major airports and multiple visafree entry amongst members that recognize the card collective actions of apec usually involve joint or coordinated efforts to advance trade and investment liberalization in other multilateral organizations most recently apecs collective actions have focused on helping complete the doha round of the wto for example following the 2006 leaders meeting in hanoi apec released statement on the doha development agenda of the wto that affirmed the members collective and individual commitments to concluding an ambitious and balanced wto doha agreement by each member moving beyond our current positions in key areas of the round the key areas mentioned were tradedistorting farm support market access in agriculture real cuts in industrial tariffs and new openings in services trade crs7 results of the 2007 meetings in sydney in january 2007 australia assumed the chair of apec and was the host for the various apec meetings held throughout the year following the meetings in 2006 various goals were suggested for 2007 including further studies on ways and means to promote regional economic integration13 the official theme for the apec 2007 meetings was strengthening our community building sustainable future in the runup to the events in sydney the host country indicated that the main foci for the meetings would be climate change and regional economic integration these themes were echoed in preevent statements by several other apec members including china successful conclusion of the doha round

guidance on which areas of trade liberalization and facilitation are of the greatest interest among the member economies in their joint declaration the leaders endorsed three specific areas where apec

to hold bilateral meetings with number of important government leaders at one location in particular the annual apec gathering is the one time when top officials from china hong kong and taiwan are attending the same event as result it has not been unusual for the us president to schedule series of bilateral meetings during the week of the apec leaders meeting in 2007 president bush continued the tradition of bilateral meetings during his time in sydney he met with australias prime minister john howard chinas president hu jintao indonesias president susilo bambang yudhoyono japans prime

minister howard was the signing of usaustralia defense trade cooperation treaty white house summary of the terms of the treaty indicates that most us and australian military articles would be able to

talks with north korea and the situation in iraq the pending uskorea free trade agreement was not mentioned in white house summary of the content of the meeting the official postmeeting statements by both presidents focused on the talks with north korea and the prospects for the end of the korean war at postmeeting press conference president roh asked president bush to be little bit clearer in your message on supposed us declaration to end the korean war president bush responded i cant make it any more clear mr president we look forward to the day when we can end the korean war that will end will happen when north korean president kim jongil verifiably gets rid of his weapons programs and his weapons36 the brief exchange was the subject of discussion in the international media and among korea analysts some speculate that president bush had omitted an agreed upon statement in his summary of the meeting and president roh was reminding him of the missing statement others have speculated that president roh attempted to press the issue in hopes of obtaining stronger statement on the subject from the us president there have also been claims that the exchange was the result of translation error during the presidents meeting whatever the cause president rohs break with the usual postmeeting protocol and the apparent irritation it caused president bush was viewed by many as another example of lingering tensions between the two presidents asean leaders during the working lunch on september 7 2007 president bush announced his decision to create the position of ambassador

meetings in sydney were 1 progress on the development of ftaap 2 the endorsement of the apec report on regional economic integration 3 agreement on joint declaration on climate control and 4 the leaders joint statement on the wto negotiations looking ahead to the 2008 meetings in lima peru the white house is primarily concerned about some hesitance on the part of some of asian apec members to fully participate in the meetings progress on ftaap the us proposal to explore the possible creation of ftaap was accepted at last years apec leaders meeting in hanoi but in relatively general terms in the view of the white house various elements of this years apec meetings indicate progress was being made in obtaining more interest and support for the concept of an ftaap in particular the inclusion of the exploration of ftaap as one of the agreed actions in the report on regional economic integration was perceived as qualitative change in apecs overall attitude from year before in addition by endorsing the report the leaders have given green light to specific research projects described in the report that may become precursor to larger feasibility study for ftaap however the bush administration is aware that china japan and some asean members remain skeptical about the feasibility and desirability of creating ftaap regional economic integration to the bush administration the report on regional economic integration creates an umbrella over much of apecs work on trade and investment liberalization as well as advances the discussion on forming ftaap see above in addition to its agreed actions on the exploration of ftaap the report on regional economic integration includes agreed actions on the promotion of highquality comprehensive rtasftas the reduction of behindtheborder barriers to trade and investment support for structural reform of member economies the strengthening of financial markets the improvement of 38 ibid 39 press briefing by deputy press

in this section is based on publicly available materials from various executive branch agencies and conversations with senior trade officials in the bush administration crs16 key sectors in apec including transportation mining and the environment and capacity building for apecs developing economies as described by one administration official the agreed actions provide apec with clearer agenda for its trade and investment liberalization efforts climate change the significance of apecs joint declaration on climate control is largely in the inclusion of both the united states and china as endorsers of the document while the environmental objectives in the joint declaration are non binding the document does find common ground between china and the united states on pollution reduction efforts wto negotiations although this years joint statement on the wto negotiations is considered softer in tone and less specific in content that last years statement the bush administration considers it useful to have all 21 apec members endorsing the concept of completing the doha round negotiations in addition the bush administration points to the statements agreement that the resumption of negotiations on the basis of the draft texts tabled by the chairs of the negotiating groups as significant outcome concerns about meetings in lima from its inception there has been mixed attitude within apec about the inclusion of members from the eastern rim of the pacific ocean for some of the asian members of apec their economic interest and connections to the eastern rim of the pacific are focused almost exclusively in the united states as result according to administration officials it may be difficult for some asian members to drum up sufficient domestic support to finance delegation to the meetings in lima comparable in size and stature as those sent to apec meetings held in asia the concern is that reduced representation from asia may undermine the ability to make much progress during the 2008 meetings comments from the media the early departure of both secretary rice and president bush from their respective meetings was heavily discussed by the media the decision by president bush to depart after the first day of the twoday leaders meeting42 came only few days before the start of the apec meetings and was considered by some commentators blow to relations with australia and counterproductive to us ambitions to forward its agenda during the event to some analysts bushs early arrival did little to counteract the negative impact of the early departure in the weeks prior to the apec meetings the media ran stories indicating that many of president bushs top advisors were recommending that he not attend the apec meetings at all the perceived slight to apec was compounded by president bushs misstatement in which he referred to apec as opec and his comments about visiting austrian troops in iraq when he meant australian troops in addition secretary rices decision to depart with president bush as well as her decision not to attend the recent asean meetings exacerbated existing regional 42 us trade representative susan schwab represented the united states at the second day of the leaders meeting crs17 concerns that the bush administration is not giving adequate attention to the asia pacific region during the pretrip press briefing president bushs early departure was the focus of two questions the first question asked if the white house was worried that it sends the wrong signal to the region that he is not interested in their concerns or that hes giving short shrift to their concerns43 the second question raised concerns that by not giving asia the attention it deserves the bush administration has created an opening for china to increase its clout44 senior director wilder replied that he did not find such criticisms very credible in addition deputy national security advisor dan price during press briefing on september 7 2007 made the following unsolicited statement now theres been fair amount of chatter in some circles questioning the us commitment to this region as the president made clear today as well as in the meetings and as he will make clear us engagement in apec is permanent unshakeable and growing45 besides the perceived inattention to the region as whole the late changes in president bushs schedule supposedly created some tension with australia and prime minister howard according to media accounts prime minister howard had pressed president bush to remain for both days or at least designate secretary rice as his replacement for the second day of meetings both requests were unmet by the united states in addition the changes in security arrangements made necessary by bushs early arrival and early departure added to the already high 140 million security bill for the event prime minister howard was already facing sharp domestic criticism for the high cost and tight security arrangements implemented for the apec meetings the apec leaders joint declaration on climate control received mixed response by the international media to some the fact that the 21 apec members including china japan and the united states had agreed to common targets for improvements in energy efficiency and reforestation was promising development for the creation of postkyoto protocol agreement on pollution control however others pointed to the voluntary nature of the aspirational global emission reduction goals as proof that the statement has little real value or significance other commentators felt that domestic political forces for example prime minister howards concerns about the upcoming elections had driven apecs willingness to agree to the joint declaration on climate control the second major document coming out of the 2007 apec meetings the report on regional economic integration also was met with mixed response some observers criticized the report for being too general and too encompassing in content and as result provided little sense of overall direction or guidance for apec for 43 press briefing on the presidents trip to australia and the apec

of press secretary september 7 2007 crs18 example they say the report presents the growing number of ftas and rtas the longterm possibility of forming free trade area of the asiapacific and the continued development of the wto as forces promoting regional economic integration but does not explore the possible tensions between those three trends upon closer reading the report endorses all three approaches to greater trade and investment liberalization without discussing potential contradictions that might ensue president bushs proposal of an asiapacific democracy partnership adp garnered modest attention in the media and from other apec members according to one report while china does not welcome the democracy partnership it is not overly alarmed either46 the press in taiwan noted with some apparent pleasure that president bush included taiwan among the examples of democracy in asia47 commentators expressed misgivings about president bushs vagueness about the membership and financing of the adp and were concerned that some apec members might be apprehensive about how their participation in the adp would impact their relations with china apec and international trade the primary goal of apec is to foster international trade by means of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation since its inception in 1993 and the adoption of the bogor goals in 1994 apec members have lowered their trade restrictions to varying degrees with over decade of history one question is whether or not there has been corresponding rise in apec members foreign trade accompanying their liberalization and facilitation efforts assessing apecs impact on exports and imports figure 2 compares the growth of intraapec and total apec exports to the growth of global exports starting in 1981 total apec exports begin growing faster than global exports and intraapec exports are outstripping total apec exports however the pace of export growth slows for all three categories in 1995 with noticeable downturns in apec exports occurring in 1998 and 2001 corresponding to the asia financial crisis and the attacks on the world trade center and the 46 china unfazed by democracy partnership

difference in the import growth rate for intraapec total apec and the world starting in 1981 apecs imports both from amongst its members and from the world begin to increase faster than world imports the divergence between apec import growth and world imports continues until 1997 when the asian financial crisis precipitates sharp decline in apecs imports and global imports in 1998 for the next two years 1999 and 2000 global imports and apecs imports recover only to drop once again following the attacks on september 11 2001 import levels grew modestly in 2002 for both apec and the world and then

trade data appear to support the notion that apec has promoted trade growth for its members the results are not conclusive although apecs exports and imports have grown at faster rate than world trade figures since the creation of apec it is uncertain if its trade growth is the result of trade liberalization and facilitation or caused by other economic factors apecs members include several of the fastest growing economies in the world for example china and vietnam so the average economic growth rate for apec members is higher than the global average apecs greater economic growth rate could be sufficient to explain most of its better trade performance compared to global figures however the fact that intraapec exports and imports are growing at faster rate than total apec trade raises concerns about possible trade diversion on the one hand the greater growth of intraapec trade could be the result of lower intraapec trade barriers stemming from the members actions via their iaps and caps and the spread of rtas and ftas amongst apec members on the other hand the higher intraapec trade expansion could represent the diversion of trade from other nations as apec members form preferential bilateral trade agreements that siphon off trade from nonapec members apec as vehicle for liberalizing trade even with its open regionalism approach to trade and investment liberalization apec has been seen since its inception as possible vehicle for liberalizing both regional and global trade in general observers focus on two methods by which apec may help foster greater trade and investment liberalization crs21 the first method is by forming coalition during wto negotiations the efforts of the apec geneva caucus during the recent doha discussions are often cited as an example of how apec can help promote trade and investment liberalization there is little disagreement among experts that apec has been positive force for trade and investment liberalization within the wto the second method is more controversial over the last decade the number of asiapacific bilateral trade agreements btas has grown dramatically49 however according to one observer the result is competitive form of liberalization as occurred within apec itself there are competing models of ftas that cannot be integrated50 reporter described the phenomena as follows the trade diplomacy of east asia has become so blindingly complex that even the metaphors are getting muddled the subtitle of one academic paper on free trade agreements ftas suggests using spaghetti bowls as building blocks another describes patchwork of bilateral hubandspoke ftas in noodle bowl according to some experts the growth of bilateral trade agreements btas amongst apec members represents an unsystematic process that could lead to the formation of an apecwide regional trade agreement rta much like the proposed ftaap according to this view the actions of apec via the iaps caps and the various committee reports forms commonality of perspective on issues thereby permitting some members to conclude limited btas the idea is that over time the network btas will form the basis for the creation of rta however other experts view the proliferation of btas as forming barrier to trade and investment liberalization as described by one scholar the resulting web of agreements and negotiations is fragmented uncoordinated and uneven in content and coverage51 because many btas are politically not economically motivated the emerging btas in asia generally suffer from several problems wto incompatibility narrow sector focus discriminatory rules of origin roos that make future amalgamation of the btas nearly impossible as one expert describes it the predictable results of foreign policydriven fta negotiations light on economic strategy are bitty quickfix sectoral deals politically sensitive sectors in goods and services are carved out little progress is usually made in tackling domestic regulatory barriers finally the sway of power politics can result in 49 for description of the recent growth of btas in asia see crs report rl33653 east asian regional architecture new economic and

is major player52 even if the merger of the various btas into an asiapacific rta were accomplished there are concerns that the resulting agreement would institutionalize number of tariff and nontariff trade barriers in the region us trade official was quoted as saying bilateral ftas being pursued by china and japan and korea to some extent risk falling to the lowest common denominator as someone once quipped they are neither f nor t nor a53 some observers go on to argue that the rising number of btas in the region is generating dynamics that are preventing the formation of ftaap and progress in the doha round despite the best efforts of apec one scholar writes i note how the current discussions with the asiapacific economic cooperation apec forum to establish free trade area of the asiapacific ftaap writes one scholar was also proposed at apecs santiago summit just two years ago it failed then as it will probably fail now because of the immense political and technical challenge of harmonizing large number of heterogeneous bilateral ftas into unified regional agreement54 another scholar is even more dismissive of apecs potential writing it cannot be expected to contribute anything serious to regional economic integration55 others see slightly different effect of the btas on prospects for the creation of ftaap56 in this view the stalled doha round is fostering the further disintegration of the global trading system generating rising number of btas and increasing the risk of the creation of discriminatory and undesirable east asia free trade area eafta the fear is that the eafta would become another barrier to the completion of the doha round and possibly generate protectionist reactions from the european union and the united states to counteract these trends some experts say apec should push for the creation of ftaap in this view advancing the idea of ftaap apec might improve the prospects for the doha round as nonapec members may prefer to see progress at the wto over the creation of ftaap however even if doha talks remain stalled discussion of the creation of ftaap could limit the growth of btas in asia andor help insure that any new btas are less discriminatory and wtocompatible 52 ftas and the prospects for regional integration in asia by razeen sally ecipe working paper 1 2006 53 complex curse east asia exposes the limits of the

example of this view is c fred bergstens speech the free trade area of the asia pacific is the next step forward for apec and for the world trading system presented to apecs ceo summit on nov 18 2006 in hanoi vietnam crs23 in summary supporters of this view see apec playing four roles in this new regional dynamic57 those roles are 1 organizing regular meetings of regional trade and finance ministers and political leaders to advance the process at the multilateral and bilateral levels 2 reinforcing the bogor goal of free and open trade and investment by 20102020 and authenticating neoliberal trade policies 3 developing model measures for ftas and rtas to achieve high quality liberalization and consistency and 4 promoting wtoplus ftas that are consistent with the policy agenda of the international and regional financial institutions apec and human security initially apec was viewed as purely economic forum apec carefully kept its distance from political matters for fear that such issues would cause divisions within the group particularly among china japan russia taiwan and the united states such divisions could thwart cooperation in achieving economic goals consideration of noneconomic issues was confined to bilateral meetings held before and after the leaders meeting in 1995 the issue was raised of whether apec should be expanded to include consideration of regional security issues the consensus in 1995 among apec members seemed to be that regional security issues should be discussed in the asean regional forum and other fora rather than in apec58 starting in 2001 however security was added to the official agenda of the leaders meeting at the october 2001 meetings in shanghai the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon overshadowed the economic agenda the leaders issued joint statement condemning the attacks apecs first joint statement on noneconomic issues since 2001 the agenda for the leaders meeting has included issues related to human security with focus on three topics terrorism disease and disasters 57 kelsey op cit 58 the asean regional forum usually meets after the asean ministerial conference and in

terrorism first some member economies face domestic extremists who episodically conduct acts of violence targeted at the civilian population second there is some evidence suggesting that international terrorist networks including qaeda are utilizing financial institutions in the asiapacific region to funnel money across international borders third apec member economies wish to restrict the movement of suspected terrorists through the region fourth apec has made the security of trade one of its key priorities over the last five years apec has developed programs to respond to each of these concerns to oversee its efforts on terrorism apec established the counterterrorism task force cttf in october 2002 the cttf reports directly to the apecs senior officials its mission is to identify and assess counterterrorism needs coordinate capacity building and technical assistance programs cooperate with international and regional organizations and facilitate cooperation between apec fora on counterterrorism issues59 the cttf generally meets quarterly in coordination with the senior officials meetings at meeting held in cairns australia in july 2007 the cttf set up study group to develop plan to facilitate trade recovery in the aftermath of major terrorist event in addition to the work of the cttf each apec member has created counterterrorism action plan ctap60 much of apecs counterterrorism efforts have focused on the issue of secure trade in 2002 apec created the secure trade in the apec region star initiative the star initiative is focused on policies and procedures to enhance security and efficiency in the apec regions seaports airports and other access points including port and airport security shipping container security coastal patrol capacity building financial assistance and private sector initiatives61 the most recent star conference held in sydney on june 27 and 28 2007 focused on enhancing security and safety while containing costs diseases in 2003 apec established its ad hoc health task force htf to deal with the threats posed by emerging infectious diseases in part the htf was created in response to the february 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in several apec member economies not only did the people of several apec members suffer serious health problems due to sars the economies of both 59 for more details about

2004 with the outbreak of avian influenza h5n1 in 2004 besides its responses to sars and avian influenza apec is also concerned about the threat posed by hivaids during the second senior officials meeting in 2007 apec endorsed the transformation of the health task force to the health working group hwg in 2008 most of apecs efforts on disease have focused on the exchange of medical information and research building rapidresponse and containment program and the exchange of best practices for sars and avian influenza apec has held series of meetings to discuss means of more rapidly identifying and responding to possible outbreaks and sharing best practices in areas such as passenger screening techniques and safeguarding measures for poultry regarding hivaids apecs htf is fostering the exchange of information on members programs to prevent the spread of the disease and improving workplace management of hivaids the second apec health ministers meeting was held on june 7 and 8 2007 in sydney australia during the meeting the health ministers released apecs guidelines for employers to create workplace environment supportive for workers with hivaids63 natural disasters the third form of threat to human security of great concern to apec are natural disasters in december 2004 93 earthquake off the coast of indonesia propagated devastating tsunami that killed thousands of people in several nations bordering the indian ocean although there was tsunami warning system in place many people were not warned of the impending natural disaster and fell victim to the tsunami in response to the indian ocean tsunami apec senior officials adopted in march 2005 an apec strategy on response to and preparedness for natural disasters and emergencies they also established apecs task force for emergency preparedness tfep working with apecs industrial science and technology working group istwg the tfep has held number of seminars and training sessions to help apec members improve their seismic monitoring systems disaster response infrastructure building and infrastructure construction codes and public education systems to reduce their exposure to natural disasters apec

identified apec as the primary regional institution in the asiapacific for promoting open trade and practical economic cooperation apec is also seen as useful forum for advancing us concerns on issues related to human security since apecs inception in 1989 congressional interest and involvement with apec has focused on two areas 1 direct and indirect financial support for apec and 2 oversight of us participation in apec previous congressional actions on apec section 424 of the foreign relations authorization act fiscal years 1994 and 1995 authorized the president to maintain united states membership in the asia pacific economic cooperation and provided for us contributions of apec out of appropriations for contributions to international organizations the science state justice commerce and related agencies appropriations act of 2006 appropriated total of 117 billion to meet annual obligations of membership in international multilateral organizations including apec the current level of direct us financial support for apec is 601000 per year65 section 2540 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 made noncommunist country that was member nation of the asia pacific economic cooperation apec as of october 31 1993 eligible to participate in loan guarantee program arising out of the financing of the sale or longterm lease of defense articles defense services or design and construction services66 the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 pl 104127 included finding by congress that during the period 1996 through 2002 there will be several opportunities for the united states to negotiate fairer trade in agricultural products including further negotiations under the world trade organization and steps toward possible free trade agreements of the americas and asianpacific economic 64 hr 1674 section 32 65 the united states provides indirect support for apec programs and activities on case bycase basis through discretionary

militarily 2 promote mutually beneficial trade relations with china and 3 encourage chinas adherence to international norms in the areas of trade international security and human rights to be included in that strategy are actions to encourage united states diplomatic efforts to identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize united states engagement in east asia the initiatives should have regional focus and complement bilateral efforts the asiapacific economic cooperation forum apec offers ready mechanism for pursuit of such initiatives issues for the 110th congress for the 110th congress issues related to apec could arise in variety of direct and indirect ways in addition to the issue of us financial support for apec congress may choose to express its sense on different policy issues also there are oversight issues raised by us participation in various apec activities proposed legislation in the 110th congress one proposed bill specifically mentions apec the united stateschina diplomatic expansion act of 2007 hr 327269 introduced by representative mark kirk and cosponsored by representatives rick larsen steve israel susan davis and charles boustany hr 3272 would authorize

mission in china 6 million for other state department personnel 10 million for various chinese language programs and 2 million for rule of law initiatives in china the bill also would authorize the appropriation of 3 million for us contribution to apec potential senate action as previously mentioned the usaustralia defense trade cooperation treaty signed during the apec meetings would be subject to the approval of the senate once submitted to the senate by the president in addition if and when the president nominates someone to be ambassador to asean the appointment would be subject to senate advice and consent financial support the most direct issue would be the level of us financial support for apec although the president does have the authority under current federal law to determine the level of apecs funding without action by congress congress may choose to take up this issue see above for example congress could consider setting funding levels directly or indirectly for apecs trade facilitation programs independently from the amounts announced in august 2007 apec as vehicle for promoting ftaap congress has recognized the potential of apec as vehicle for promoting free trade in addition to the issue of possible free trade area of the asiapacific negotiations over regional trade integration under apec would likely raise issues related to labor rights and environment protection and whether the united states would be able to respond to foreign country violations of labor or environmental standards with economic sanctions or monetary fines as stipulated in the ussingaporechile ftas progress on the doha round successful completion of the doha round is major trade priority for the bush administration however negotiations are complicated in part by the us merchandise trade deficit especially bilateral trade deficits with some apec member economies while many economists attribute the us trade deficit to us macroeconomic conditions when combined with specific trade disputes with some apec members prospects for adjustments in the us offer on doha are uncertain the 2006 leaders joint declaration called on all apec members including the united states to spare efforts to break through the current deadlocks this years statement on the wto negotiations takes slightly softer tone stating that consensus will only be possible on the basis of an ambitious balanced result that delivers real and substantial market access improvements for agricultural and industrial goods and services and real and substantial reductions in tradedistorting
