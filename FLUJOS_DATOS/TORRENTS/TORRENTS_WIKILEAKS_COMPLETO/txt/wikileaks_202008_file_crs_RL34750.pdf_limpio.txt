ffice dndo of the department of homeland security dhs is charged with developing and pr ocuring equipment to prevent terrorist nuclear or radiological attack in the united states at the forefront of dndos efforts are technologies curre ntly deployed and under development whose purpose is to detect smuggled nucl ear and radiological materials these technologies include existing radiation portal monitors and nextgeneration replacements known as advanced spectroscopic portals asps radiation portal monitors are used to detect radiation being emitted by conveyances such as trucks that are tering the united states combined with additional equipment to identify the source of the emitted radiati on they provide for detection and identification capability to detect smuggled nuclear and radiological materials the asps currently under testing integrate these detection and identification steps into single process by doing so dhs aims to reduce the impact of such radiation screening on commerce while increasing its ability to detect illicit nuclear material the speed of asp development and deployment the readiness of asp technology and the potential be nefits of the asp program re lative to its cost have all been topics of extensive congressional inte rest congress has held oversight hearings regarding the asp program additionally since fy2007 congress has each year required that the secretary of homeland security certify that asps will result in significant increase in operational effectiveness before dhs can obligate appropriated funds for fulls cale asp procurement secr etarial certification is still pending testing of the asps in the laboratory and in the field costbenefit analysis and other activities are underway to inform the secretarys cer tification decision among the issues congress faces are wh ether to further define the expected performance of the asp systems through additional legislati on how to assess whether the asp systems are technologically ready to be deployed how to weigh the potential economic and security benefits of asp deployment versus the increased financial cost and whether that certificati on process developed by dhs to establish significant increase in operationa l effectiveness is well foundedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34750contents introduction 1 history and background 1 i s s u s f r c n g r s s 5

since that time the federal government has expanded existing programs developed new programs and deployed new equipment at us borders and elsewhere the global nuclear detection architecture has multiple facets including security to make acquiring threat material more difficult intelligence activities law enforcement activities and deployment of radiation detection equipment1 new technologies

as the dvanced spectroscopic portal asp this report provides an overview of the asp pr ograms history and outlines issues for congress as the program moves forward history and background the asp program is an effort by the department of homeland security dhs to develop procure and deploy successor to the existing radia tion detection portals radiation detection portals so known as radiation portal m onitors are to detect the emission of radiation from objects that pa ss by them the current portals are generally deployed at the us land nd sea borders by dhss domestic nuclear detection office dndo and operated by dhss customs and border protection cbp when entering the united states cargo c onveyances such as trucks are to pass through radiation detection portal this process is called primary screening if radiation is present the cbp officer is to be alerted the conveyance is to be directed to second radiation detection portal whic h would confirm the presence of radiation and where additional equipment can be used to identify the origin of the radiation and determine if it comes from potential thr eat this process is called secondary screening consequently the current

prohibited dhs from obligating fy2007 funds for fullscale procurement of asps until the secretary of homeland security has certified that significan t increase in operationa l effectiveness will be achieved the act did not define or explain the phrase significant increase in operational effectiveness faced with criticism of its test results and costbenefit analysis dndo engaged in further round of asp testing in 2007 these tests were to generate the data needed to support secretaria l certification and to provide additional information regarding the capabilities of the asp systems8 the gao reviewed the 2007 asp tests and criticized them as being methodologically flawed9 the gaos criticisms included the use of the same radiation sources and shielding material for both calibration and performance testing and the inclusion of test results that might not have statistical significance in ptember 2008 gao issued another report critical of dndos ongoing asp testing10 it found that further testing by dndo provided little information about the actual performance capabilities of the asps and that the resulting test report should not be used in determining whether asps are significant improvement over cu rrently deployed equipment the dndo strongly disputed these criticisms in response to gaos initial critique dhs convened an inde pendent review team to address the

aspects of the testing process were not ideal12 the independent review team also concluded that the test results and measures of effectiveness were not properly linked to operational outcomes the testing up to that point was properly characterized as developmental and independent opera tional testing and evaluation had been conducted13 following the independent review team review dndo undertook another r ound of asp testing in the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 signed into law december 26 2007 congress prohibited th obligation of fy2008 funds for full scale asp procurement until the secret ary of homeland security certified significant increase in operational effectiveness the same language as in the fy2007 act this time the act also directed the secretary to consult with the national academy of sciences before issuing the certification and to submit separate certifications for asps use in primary and secondary screening14 if primary screening detects potential threat secondary screening is undertaken to confirm the detection and identify the source the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 pl 110329

defined or explained in either act the dndo continues to engage in add itional testing and evaluation which it expects will lead to secretarial decisi on regarding certification in november 2008 but dndo officials have stated that they will move forward with the certification decision only when the available test results and other information are sufficient to support it if the secretary of

example thomas b cochran and matthew g mckinzie detecting nuclear smuggling scientific american april 2008describes the number of asps to be proc ured and how they would be deployed reportedly longer reflects dndos current plans15 issues for congress through hearings letters legislation and report language some members of congress have expressed cern about the asp program and support for it these actions raise issues in several areas the effectiveness of asp t echnology at detecting and identifying threats the asp progra ms costs relative to its benefits the secretarys criteria for determining whether asps will provide significant increase in operational effectiveness and future actions following secretarial certification capability to detect and identify threats the effectiveness of asp technology hinges on its ability to both detect radiation and identify its source these tasks are currently performed sequentially using two different types of equipment the asp technology would integrate these tasks into single step key question for congress is whether asps would perform sufficiently better than the existing systems to make investment in them worthwhile since the asp technology is intended to perform both detection and identification this question can be asked w ith respect to both functions the dndos ongoing testing is intended to provide the remaining information needed to compare asp performance with the performance of existing systems because of the criticism of past asp test campaigns by gao and others congress directed dhs to have the national acad emies examine the methodology and results of the asp test campaigns and evaluate how dndo uses those results to assess asp performance congress may wish to consider the sufficiency of dhss plans for further asp development procurement nd deployment in light of the national academies assessment some nongovernmental critics be lieve that even if asps are better than existing radiation portal monitors at detecting and identifying radioactive material they cannot provide sufficient defe nse these critics state th at nuclear material can be shielded or divided into amounts too sma ll to be detected and that detection equipment can be avoided by illegally entering the united states away from official ports of entry16 these arguments challenge the belief that better detection systems are an effective way to protect against the threat of nuclear and radiological terrorismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34750crs6 17 government accountability office combating nuclear smugg ling dhss program to procure and deploy advanced radiation detecti on portal monitors is likely to exceed the departments previous cost estimates gao081108r september 22 2008costs and benefits in 2006 dndo conducted costbenefit analysis for the development and deployment of asp systems additional dndo costbenefit analyses are to be used as input to the secretary s certification decision it appears that the analyses conducted so far have focuse d mainly on the economic co sts of implementation and the economic benefits to commerce of making the radiation screening process more efficient the expected economic cost of proc uring and deploying asp systems has changed since the inception of the program as have the number type and purpose of the systems themselves rather than an allinclusive suite of asp varieties dndo has chosen to focus on single type of asp used to screen cargo conveyances according to analysis by gao the cost of the asp program has increased from the original 12 billion to approximately 31 bi llion for the previously planned full deployment or approximately 21 billion for the currently planned reduced deployment the dndo asse rts that the actual number of deployed systems may change dramatically dependi ng on the results of ongoing testing17 the dndo asserts that the number of nui sance alarms in which radiation is detected correctly but turns out to come from an innocuous source would be greatly reduced following deployment of the asp systems this reduction would result from the asps ab ility to identify the source of the radiation it detects and discriminate between dangerous and innocuous sources because of this expected reduction the number of conveyances that would be requi red to go through subsequent more in depth screening would be reduced and as result the radiation screening process would have less impact on commerce th dndo stated in 2006 based on its cost benefit analysis at that time that the value of the reduced impact on commerce outweighed the cost of the asp program nd caused deployment of the asp systems to be preferred outcome it appears that dndos costbenefit analys have not attemp ted to quantify the security benefit of making ra diation screening more effectiv the avoided cost of nuclear or radiological attack in the united states that more effective system might prevent the omission of this avoided cost from costbenefit analysis might be justified in several ways one might be that the like lihood of an avoided successful attack is the same between existing radiation portal systems and the asp systems another might be that it is too difficult to determine quantitatively the benefit from an incremental increase in detection effectiveness because the potential consequences of nuclear or radiological attack would vary widely depending on the location of the attac k and the likelihood and timing of an attack occurring would depend on terrorist adversary having the requisite intent and capability calculating the benefits of an avoided attack may have significant uncertainties absent such an analysis however it is difficult to assess whether small increase in detector effectiveness would lead to substantia l reduction of the overall security riskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34750crs7 18 government accountability office combating nuclear smuggling dhs needs to consider the full costs and complete all sts prior to making decision on whether to purchase advanced portal monitors gao081178t september 25 2008the increased cost of the asp program and related changes in procurement and deployment plans have led to uncertainty regarding the total costs and benefits of the program congress is likely to continue to be interested in the scope of the asp program its total cost how asp systems would be deployed th calculated benefits of that potential deployment and the degree to which this nextgeneration technology increases homeland security additionally congress may be particularly interested in the degree to which potential deployme nt of asp systems reduces the likelihood of successful attack and how such consid erations are weighed and balanced against other economic factors criteria for secretarial certification the appropriations acts that establishe d the certification re quirement provided definition or explanation of the phr ase significant increase in operational effectiveness absent further congre ssional guidance dhs has established definition based on list of criteria and published it as memorandum for the record the gao and others have criticized these cr iteria congress ma be interested in examining whether the criteria meet the certification requirements intent on the other hand considering that congress has provided explanation of the requirement in statute or report langua ge it may have intended to leave the definition to dhss discretion in the dhs memorandum for the record in july 2008 dhs agencies including dndo and cbp jointly established certification criteria that cons titute their definition of significant increase in ope rational effectivene ss the memorandum is unclassified and less than two pages long it is possible that additional details supporting the certification criteria are provided elsewhere but the memorandum gives indication that this is the case amount of improvement several of the criteria require an improvement in some aspect of performance without sp ecifying minimum amount of improvement for the criteria that do specify min imum amount of improvement dhs does not explain how it determined that amount for those with specified minimum an improvement so small as to be operationally insignificant would apparently be sufficient the gao criticized this approach which it said set low bar for improvement for exam ple by requiring asps to perform at least as well as current generation equipment when nuclear material is present in cargo but not specifying an actual improvement18 on the other hand if the performance of existing systems is already sufficient in certain respects it may be appropriate simply to preclude backsliding in those areas while seeking to make larger improvements in other areas where current performance is less acceptable for exam ple dndo states that for so threat types current systems are already expected to detect correctly 100 of the time so

quantitative targets might also allow the criteria to be reused for future decisions about further equipment upgrades verification of performance the memorandum establishing the criteria does not define under what test conditions or with which st data the criteria are to be verified for example it does not speci fy the types amounts or configurations of threat material that are to be detecte d other documents may provide these details or dndo may have specific plans that it has not documented formally in some cases dndo officials have stated how par ticular criteria will be assessed for example previously scheduled field valid ation tests that involve the screening of trucks in actual commerce are to be used to assess the time required for secondary screening and the results of specific test campaign at the nevada test site are to be used to assess the asps ability to detect special nuclear material20 performance aspects addressed the criteria address certain aspects of performance such as detection rates nd false alarm rates but do not expressly address others such as reliability ease of use and cost for example the criteria compare asp performance versus the performance of current systems on oneto one basis without regard to cost even though asps are more expensive than current systems as the technology developer dndo and the technology user cbp jointly established these criteria these choices presumably re flect dhss conclusions about which aspects of performance are most impor tant nevertheless some experts have expressed concern about the cr iterias balance sserting that the criteria should focus more on increasing the likelihood of detec ting genuine threat rather than on reducing the false alarm rate21 procedural changes the memorandum establishi ng the criteria states that performance comparisons against currently deployed systems are to be made on the basis of current concepts of operations conops and standard operating procedures sops the asp systems are to combine radiation detection t he goal of primary screening with identification of the radiation source the goal of secondary screening one might expect that either adding an identification capability to the detection stage or adding detection capability to the identification stage would be accompanied by changes in conops and so ps but such changes are reflected in the criteria if changes in conops and sops could improve the performance of the asps in the field then assessing performance using test data may not reflect their full capabilities detection threshold finally the criteria compare asp performance against the performance of current systems set at current operational tection thresholds they do not compare performance against the same equipment set at other thresholds that might have different ope rational ramifications such as higher detection and falsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34750crs9 22 the dndo recei ved approximately 107 million in fy2007 and

secretarial certification the date for secretarial certification has been post poned several times the current reported date is november 2008 but dndo official s have stated that they will move forward with the certification decision only when the available test results and other information are sufficient to support it at the same time as the secretarial certification dhs would determine whethe r to proceed with fullscale production of the asp systems if the certification decision is postponed further little time would remain for it to occur before the end of the bush administration this possibility may create pressure on the secretary to make the decision before the end of the administration especially if he fears that valuable time and experience could be lost during the presidential transition alternatively th secretary might choose to postpone the certification decision to give the next administration flexibility if it has different views on the utility or appropria teness of the asp technology if the current secretary of homeland security or his successor decides to make the required certification seve ral choices would remain bout how to proceed the secretary may decide that asp systems s hould be fully deployed the dhs could use whatever funds remain from prioryear appropriations for asp procurement to begin this process and would likely request additional funds in future fiscal years to continue and comp lete the process22 the secretary may decide that while asp systems do represent significant improvement in operational effectiveness their costs make them less desirable than other possible detection improvements for example rather than procure asp systems dhs might invest in additiona l existing secondary inspection systems while achieving comparable reductions in secondary screening time the dhs has stated that costbenefit analyses will inform the secretarys certification decision even though the criteria do not mention cost the secretary may decide to acquire and deploy asp systems on limited basis for example asp systems might be deploy ed at highthroughput locations only it is possible that the benefits of asps out weigh their cost in some locations but not others while preferring to procure asp systems in large numbers for system performance uniformity and economies of scal dndo has stated that it will present

certificati on congress may be intere sted in the manner and scale of asp procurement where and how initial asp systems would be deployed and the projected future deployment of th systems the existing radiation portal monitor program has been multiyear program with continued phased deployment consequently the required time to replace these systems may be of congressional interest finally if the existing radiation portals are superseded by asp systems congress may be interested in the expected lifetime of those asp systems and dhss expectation of the development of nextgeneration system to replace those asp systems options for congress congress has several options for addressing the asp program those options include providing legislative guidance to dhs regarding certification of the asp systems and awaiting the secretarys decisions regarding certification and procurement key question of possible congressional interest might be whether the approach taken by dhs in determining significant increase in operational effectiveness meets congressional intent the definiti on developed by dhs for significant increase in operational effectiveness ma meet congressional intent and congress may be fully supportive of dndo moving forward with asp procurement and deployment alternatively congress might choose to restrict the secretarys discretion by defining significant incr ease in operational effectiveness for dhs or by delineating what areas need to be addressed by dhs when it defines significant increase in operational effec tiveness congress could even prohibit further action on the asp program if it disagreed with the secretarys judgment regarding certification the next generation radi ation screening act of 2008 hr 5531 takes this approach hr 5531 would direct dhs to develop quantitative metrics to use as certification criteria for the asp program these metrics would be required to include quantitative definition of signifi cant increase in operational effectiveness specification of all relevant threat materials and all relevant masking scenarios and costbenefit analysis under specified guidelines the bill would also allow the secretary of homeland security to consid er relevant reports from outside groups such as gao or an independent review team and any other information the secretary determined to be relevant the house of re presentatives passed hr 5531 on july 30 2 008 and the bill was re ferred to the senate committee on homeland security and government affairs on july 31 2008 an alternative approach to providing gislative guidance would be for congress to set deadline for secretarial certif ication the dhs has not met previous expectations for the date of certifica tion instead it has engaged in further development and testing following criticisms of its test procedures and resultshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34750crs11 congress might pass legislation directing dhs make determination regarding the significant increase in operational effectiveness by specified date rather than continuing with more test s and developmental work congress might also choose to continue to leave the criteria and schedule for secretarial certification to dhs focusing instead on oversight activities both the 109th and the 110th congress held series of oversig ht hearings on the asp program further scrutiny of dhs and oversight of the testing and certification process may help to ensure that dhss decision to certify and procure the asp system is well founded if secretarial certification occurs but congress determines the certification did not meet its legislative intent congre ss might place additional restrictions or requirements on the asp program examples of such restrictions or requirements might include limiting the rate of procurem ent of asp systems directing dhs to reevaluate its decisionmaking process or requiring analysis of the certification decision by third party congress could even rescind asp procurement funding appropriated in previous years lastly congress might choose to chan ge the direction of the program if secretarial certification does not go forwar d as planned policymakers might choose to direct dndo to change its expectati ons of the asp technology performance and scope so as to match the tested capabilities alternatively policymakers might direct dndo to invest additional funds into furthe r development for fixed period of time to transfer the program focus away fro m procurement and to wards development milestones finally policymakers might di rect dndo to enhance their development of alternate technologies beyond those inco rporated in the asp systems attempting to achieve breakthrough in technology development
