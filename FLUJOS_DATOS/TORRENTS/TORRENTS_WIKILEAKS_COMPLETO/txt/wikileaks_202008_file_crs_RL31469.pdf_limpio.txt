and high voltage transmission has become high priority californias attempt at electric utility restructuring the enr on bankruptcy and the august 2003 blackout have increased the concern bout maintaining reliability at high level while trying to achieve the desired benefits of marketoriented electric power system maintaining reliability is im portant because power inte rruptions result in economic losses costing over an estimated 100 billi on per year in the united states many attribute the utility industry probl ems as loss in reliability brought on by electric utility restructuring restru cturing advocates asse rt that functional changes in the electric utility industry resultin g from restructuring are designed to add certainty and therefore improve reliability wh ile providing lower prices to consumers functional changes such as improved planni ng and coordination the ability to attract new market participants increased redunda ncy and the development of ancillary service markets all tend to lower risk and ultimately improve reliability restructuring opponents argue that resulting functional changes in the industry tend to increase uncertainty these changes include added complexity added risk for investors unclear responsibilitie s for reliability and the potential to manipulate markets in ways that may cause power supply instability most experts conclude that industry changes from restructuring designed to improve reliability have not been realized while the factors tending to degrade reliability are having an effect in general the existing bulk power system was designed for operation by vertically integrated utilities with minimally required transmission connections between them re structuring of the electric utility industry requires that an ample set of suppliers nd consumers negotiate transactions across robust transmission system with high capacity therefore the reliability of the existing bulk power system appears to be degrading because it was not designed to operate in restructured environment and market procedures have not been developed to overcome these deficiencies this report will be update d as events

restructuring maintaining bulk power system reliability introduction as result of devastating outage in the northeastern portion of the united states during november 1965 the north american electric reliability council nerc was formed to promote reliab ility of the interconnected electric power system nercs membership consists of representatives from utilities across north america and provides forum for the elect ric utility industry to develop policies standards and guidelines designed to maintain reliability at high level ten regional councils have been formed to address reliability i ssues within various regions of the united states canada nd mexico in add ition nerc has assumed role as coordinator for the electric utility sector to address security threats and provide critical infrastructure protecti on nerc membership has always been voluntary prior to restructuring fe deral legislation wa s used to promote organizations such as nerc tasked with maintaining reliability of the bulk power system1 reliability was dictated at the retail level by laws enacted by state legislators and enforced by state public utility commissions pucs restructuring of the electric utility indus try was initiated at the federal level by congress through passage of the 1978 p ublic utility regula tory policies act purpa2 and the 1992 energy policy act epact3 the restructuring effort is intended to promote more competition in th industry and ultimately to lower the cost of electricity for customers in the united states reliability of the bulk power system was concern for federal legislators ev before the passage of epact in 19924 many industry experts now asse rt that restructuring the electric utility industry makes it difficult to maintain reliability and this reliability

still in place the wholesale competitive energy markets have been abandoned 10 congressional budget office causes and lessons of the ca lifornia electricity crisis september 2001adequately5 several assert that the pressures of competition have already lowered the level of reliability6 others contend that restructuring policy changes must be completed to improve reliability7 at issue is whether the desired reliability levels can be maintained or even enhanced as electric industry rest ructuring continues because the federal power act of 1935 fpa gave the federal government economic regulatory authority over whol esale transactions across the bulk power system reliability has become an important concern for congress as new electricity legislation is designed to encourage competition and improve performance within the electric utility industry total of 24 states and the district of columbia have enacted legislation or issued orders that provide retail access to multiple suppliers for electricity customers most of those states are in the northeastern portion of the united states five of those states have now delayed their pr ocess to provide retail access arkansas montana nevada new mexico and oklahoma total of 27 states are not actively pursuing retail access most of these states are in the southeastern united states california was the first state to impleme nt retail access in 1996 but that state has suspended competitive market operations indefinitely8 several events occurred in recent years that have caused many to conclude that restructuring of the electric utility i ndustry will result in an unacceptable loss of reliability first the electric utility restructuring in california resulted in forced blackouts and federal energy regulatory commission ferc investigations into market manipulation californias attempt9 to restructure that states utility system has been analyzed by many10 there are numerous reasons for the resulting market

some that restructuring of the electric utility industry could result in ss of reliability rons bankruptcy did not result in blackouts anywhere in the united states see appendix however some of enrons trading practices in ca lifornia may have cont ributed to blackouts during that states energy crisis11 some have concluded that enrons collapse was primarily due to poor busin ess practices and should not be blamed on industry restructuring12 the august 2003 blackout once again focuse d concerns on relia bility of the us electric power system as high priority when large scale problems in the electric utility industry occur there is an imme diate reaction by the general public legislators and the administration nume rous studies have analyzed power system outages to determine how to avoid them in the future13 to consider how restructuring affects reliability this report will first reference the nerc definition of reliability and discuss the relationship between maximizing reliability and minimizing uncertainty factors that increase or decrease uncertainty will be identified uncertainty factors that result from the changes promoted by industry during electric utility restructuring will be identified finally reliability issues addressed by proposed legislation will be discussed reliability definition reliability of the electric grid has been defined by nerc in terms of two functional aspects14 these include adequacy the ability of the electric system to supply the aggregate electrical demand and energy requirements of the customers at all times taking into account scheduled and reasonably expected unscheduled outages security the ability of the electric system to withstand sudden disturbances such as electric short circuits or nticipated loss of system elementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs4 in considering these two functional aspects it is important to consider the phrase at all times used to describe the adequacy of the electric grid since there is storage capability on the grid supply must meet demand at every moment in time if total supply does not meet mand then the electric grid will respond automatically to restore the balance critical imbalance can happen within seconds after large block of power is disconnected or added to the system since there are real restrictions on the fluctuations of demand on the electric grid and customers may change their requirements for power at any time by simply throwing switch imbalance between supply and demand occurs on regular basis changes in overall supply must respond within minutes to match each demand change under normal conditions predictions of load are accurate and demand changes that vary from scheduled predictions are small so the imbalance is restored within minutes reliability improvements reliability improvements to the bulk power system are made in general by minimizing risk and taking away uncertainty this implies that all potential operating conditions are known and anticipat ed if all potentia l operating conditions of the bulk power system can be anticip ated then equipment can be designed constructed and opera ted to minimize uncertainty when all known conditions are identified and addre ssed then reliability is maximiz ed conditions that must be anticipated include variations in weathe r fuel supplies population and industrial loads which make bulk power system cont rol complex operation in spite of the difficulty the electric utility industry has b een dealing with these issues for many years and industrys reliability record imp lies the capability to predict these types of variations has been adequate and in many cases excellent there are two basic options for improving reliability the first option is to construct the bulk power system with high level of adequacy using large generation and transmission capability under this scenario risk and uncertainty are minimized because the bulk power system is constructed to handle stresses well beyond what are predicted to occur unfortuna tely the cost of this option is high and the redundancy in the infrastructure does not contribute to in creased electricity production the second reliab ility improvement option is to improve the operational methods or efficiency of the power syst em demand management is an example of operational methods that limit or interrupt loads when necessary to improve reliability demand management occurs when customer allows the utility to shut down electric services to maintain the bala nce between generation and load another example of the efficiency improvement option is the training of operators in procedures to avoid outages or provide quick recovery when outages occur risk and uncertainty are overcome by operating the existing bulk power system in an efficient way cost is reduced by using the s econd option but reliability is not assured realistically some combination of the above two options probably is needed to reduce risk and uncertainty and ultimately improve reliab ility in both cases the uncertainty and risks to the bulk power system must be identified and then eliminated as the risk level rises the potential for problems increases and reliability degrades ideally the added risks are identified and addre ssed before actualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs5 15 the utility control area contained all the bulk power system equipment owned by the utility within the utility control area cust omers received electric power only from that utility the control area was also referred to as the franchised areaproblems occur as the risks are eliminated the potential for problems decreases and reliability is improved predicting reliability it is difficult to predict reliability performance measuring reliability after the fact is easily accomplished by counting the number of times blackouts or other outages occur predicting that particular system will be reliable in the future is much more difficult rather than quantifying reliability measures this report will consider changes to the bulk power system that are adding or taking away risk and uncertainty when uncertainty is added reliability is decreased and problems may occur conversely if uncertainty is removed reliability is increased and potential problems have been eliminated the traditional electric power system has provided reliability that is envied in many other parts of the world therefore this report will further assume that reliability levels provided by the us electric utility system before restructuring can be used as benchmark that benchmark will be considered the desired minimum standard for reliability the report will first look at changes in uncertainty and risk to the bulk power system that have ccurred since restructuring and wholesale competition was first introduced by epact in 1992 finally the report will consider how proposed legislation could affect uncertainty overview of electric utility restructuring in order to understand the discussions that follow brief overview of restructuring changes occurring within the electric utility industry is necessary figure 1 provides simple view of the traditional industry structure before competition was introduced the us electric utility industry consisted of approximately 200 vertica lly integrated utilities th at provided generation transmission and distribution services th figure depicts two such utilities with transmission connection between them th utilities each have their own customers in their particular control areas15 the utility control area was geographic area within one state franchised to the utility by the state governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs6 16 retail customers are the ultimate consumers of electricity while wholesale customers purchase electricity for resale to others 17 also referred to as revenue requirement 18 most of the industry consisted of investorowned utilities with ror regulated by the state puc however approximately 25 of the industry includes public power utilities that continued figure 1 traditional vertically integrated utilities source congressional research service the two utilities in figure 1 have single trans mission connection between them which represents the numerous transmission connections between the traditional vertically integrated utilities beginning in the 1930s utilities generally developed enough generation capacity in thei r own control areas to provide for all their own customers only small amounts of electricity were purchased at wholesale level across these transmission connections between utilities during the last quarter of the 20th century utilities became more and more dependent on wholesale purchases across the transmission connections as other factors drove up the cost of providing generation internal to their control areas in some cases utilities constructed large remotelylocated and jointlyowned powerplants requiring transmission of electricity over long distances to their customers greater efficiency was achieved because the transmission c onnections allowed utilities to help each other under changing load conditions wit hout having their own redundant generating capacity figure 2 shows the traditional regulatory stru cture for the vertically integrated utilities in return for providing service to all retail customers within geographically defined control area u tilities received monopoly status across the control area the utility rates for retail customers16 were generally regulated by state public utilities commission puc the rates were set to guarantee the utility and its investors revenue17 sufficient to achieve fair rate of return ror the rates provided dividends nd funded improvements ope rations and maintenance activities18 state pucs enforced laws passed by the individual state legislatures thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs7 18 continued are nonprofit and

powers include power to order reasonable improvements as will reasonably promote the public interest and power to prescribe from time to time the efficiency of the electric supply system see new york state public service commission httpwwwdpsstatenyus figure 2 traditional regulatory structure for vertically inte grated utilitiesset quality of service standards for electricity the state laws vary but they generally allow the commissions to order service improvements investigate the methods employed by utilities to provide service and to order such reasonable improvements as will best promote the public interest pr eserve the public health and protect those using such gas or electric service19 in general standards were set at the retail level for the amount of time allowed to restore service after an outage for the required voltage stability and for the number of outages allowed in particular time frame the utilities worked to identify improvements required to maintain quality of service and the commissions reviewed and authoriz ed costs required to make improvements source congressional research service the federal power act fpa of 1935 provi des the federal gove rnment with the authority to regulate interstate transmission and the contracts between utilities for wholesale generation ferc regulates the wholesale electricity market but these regulations prior to restructuring were primarily economic and did not focus on reliability of the power system the securities and exchange commission sechttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs8 figure 3 main participants in electric industry restructuring generalizedregulates the financial trans actions of the industry re liability standards have been the responsibility of nerc nerc whos membership is taken from the utility industry provides ope rational standards that all u tilities voluntarily follow larger utilities have tended to participate more heavily in nerc since their liabilities for poor reliability are much great er several voluntary methods are used to encourage compliance with the voluntary standards such as publishing compliance reports that recognize high performance levels source congressional research service beginning with the passage of epact in 1992 the structure of the electric utility industry began to change figure 3 shows the main participants in the present day structure the structure is designed to provide competition within both retail and wholesale markets in order to accomplish this the classic vertically integrated utility has been broken into at most four companies first separate transmission company has been formed by many utilities the separate transmission company is generally required by ferc to assure open and fair transmission access without giving preference to any energy supplier in some cases vertically integrated utilities have become both transmission and distribution company by selling their generation assets figure 3 shows how service to retail customers is provided in some cases by forming separate distri bution company the powerplants owned previously by the utility are sold to one or more generation owners finally marketing company provides the financial connection between the generation owners the transmission owners and the distribution companies the ultimate goal is to provide retail customers the ability to purchase electricity from any electric supplier either marketer without its ow n generation capacity or an electric supplier that owns generating capacity the tr ansmission owner and distribution ownerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs9 figure 4 proposed regulatory structure for restructured elect ric utility industryreceive fees for the usage of their sy stems but fair competition between the generation owners will dictate how the transmission system is used source congressional research service proposed legislation would authorize th regulatory structur for the electric utility industry shown in figure 4 the goal of the legislation is to improve bulk power system efficiency and promote competition fe rcs order 2000 encouraged the formation of regional transmission or ganizations rtos that would provide vehicle for transition to competitive markets for wholesale electricity rtos are expected to provide both operational and pl anning functions for group of generation and transmission owners proposals also advocate the formati on of an electric reliability organization ero based on the traditional nerc structure an ero would develop mandatory standards for all activities on the bulk power system violation of mandatory standards would result in penalties and the threat of penalties might encourage participants to maintain reliability features even when the standards were not perceived as economically benefi cial to the transmission owner state pucs would continue to re gulate the retail markets and protect retail

restructuring activities in the electric utility industry several changes are occurring that have the potential to affect reliability the various changes can be grouped into the following six areas 1 institutional structure 2 return on investments 3 wholesale markets and competition 4 reliability responsibilities 5 retail customer base 6 retail service obligations for each of these six areas this repor t will compare functionality before and after restructuring risk factors associated with the changes that may contribute to increased or decreased reliability are discu ssed some of the risk factors identified are projected for the future while others are already occurring summary of all identified risk factors is provided in table 1 at the end of this section institutional structure prior to restructuring prior to restructuring the electric utility i ndustry had comparatively simple structure see figure 1 utilities were vertically integrated each utility owned major portion of the bulk power system generation and high voltage transmission within its control area and the utility was required to support the retail customers who were connected to the distribution system in its control area transition to restructuring as restructuring occurs vertically integrated utilities give way to multiple companies providing multiple individual services figure 3 in ferc order 888 electric serv ices which previously were bundled into one product are now being unbundled ideally the unbundling will restructure the industry such that multiple compan ies provide generati on transmission and distribution services and marketing co mpanies will link suppliers with users in competitive markets nerc has developed reliability model that can be used as basic guide for participants in competitive markets20 the model shows relationships among 11 various functions performed by individual companies or entities in competitive market risk factors ferc hopes to decrease

california perspective was controlling maintenance schedules of generators after most california utilities sold thei r generation facilities to i ndependent power producers the california iso had real control over units taken out of service for maintenance in order to encourage generators to return to service the california iso developed website that provides pub lic access to generator outage schedules26 eventually ferc provided the iso with the authority to demand outage schedules from generators allowing these schedules to be driven only by market mechanisms resulted in allegations that several powerpl ants were taken out of service based on market decisions rather than on predic ted system needs for generation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs12 27 hirst eric and kirby brendan trans

was pr imarily dependent upon re tail rates that were regulated by the state puc because the return was regulated the risk associated with investment was relatively low the advantage of the process was consistent and predictable rateofreturn for the utility therefore the financial risk to utility investors for capital improvements was relatively low transition to restructuring restructuring directs companies to participate in competitive generation markets the responsibility for obtaining return on investments is now dependent on performance in competitive market if company builds or purchases new powerplant the return on that investment will depend on marketbased rates the companys ability to analyze the market is key factor in providing investors with an acceptable rate of return ror risk factors reliability improvements result when profitable rate of return is achieved by companies providing good qua lity service in regions where there is demand for power the potential to receive profitable rate of return dictated by marketbased rates is expected to attract new set of more efficient participants to electricity markets it is argued that these participants will provide new investments in the bulk power system that otherwis would not be available such new investments would hold the potential to not only improve the reliability of the power system but to provide technol ogy improvements as well the transmission portion of the bulk power system has been characterized by lack of investment in recent years ccording to study sponsored by the edison electric institute eei average transmi ssion system growth exceeded the growth in summer peak usage between 1979 and 1989 wh both were appr oximately 3 per year27 since that time the transmission system has grown an average of approximately 05 per year while the summer peak usage has grown an average of approximately 25 per cent per year the cost to maintain the current level of adequacy for the next 10 years is estimated at 56 billion in investment in another eei study two primary barri ers to building new transmission lines were identified28 first the study shows that difficulties in siting transmission lines have discouraged investors second the study asserts that adequate return on equity roe for investors does not exist ther are several reasons provided for the lack of

competition prior to restructuring wholesale markets prior to restructuring accounted for relatively small amount of the entire electricity production in the united states utilities normally performed sy stem planning with the goal of providing enough generation internal to their control area to supply high percentage of their own customers with electricity see figure 1 in many cases the wholesale markets were characterized by long term fairly stable contracts between utilities to take advantage of seasonal variations transition to restructuring during restructuring the number and size of transactions occurring in the wholesale ma rket have increased dramatically the increase in the number of wholesale market transactions is direct result of the unbundling of the generation services gene ration and transmission services are now generally sold separately th number of merchant powerplants30 is increasing and contributing to the increased number of w holesale market transactions todays wholesale markets are characterized by contracts with much shorter time frames that use dayahead and hourahead markets risk factors the increase in market activity is characteristic of healthy growing market that should support improve d reliability the economic health of the market supports reliability by encourag ing new investments where demands for transmission and generation resources are hi gh the increased number of participants creates more opportunities to receive ssistance during emergencies and provides greater redundancy wholesale market development that improves reliability by decreasing risk is the implementation of ancillary services markets31 ancillary services have been identified as an operational commodity that needs to be purchased by an independent system

number of transactions and short time frames represent challenge to the reliability of the bulk power system all of these factors tend to contribute to increased volatility and uncertainty therefore it is possible for marketer to initiate transactions that push the bulk power system closer to capability limits because proper system studies are not performed transmission system congestion results when bulk power transactions force tr ansmission system operation beyond capacity limits this is problem because the w holesale transactions focus on matching desired suppliers with consumers and do not give as much consideration to the resulting transmission system congestion eei reported that transmission conges tion grew by more than 200 between august 1999 and august 200033 us department of

reliability we re very clearly given to the individual utilities as discussed previously nerc was formed to provide format for utilities to join together in developing reliability standards for the operation of the bulk power system the utility owners knew that reliability of the bulk power system depended on each utility following certain standards the standards deve loped were based on voluntary system that worked well during the last three decades of the 20th century see figure 3 qualityofservice laws were passed by most state legislatures and enforced by the state pucs to ensure

maintaining reliability in competitive us electric industry 1998 executive summary page xi puc to improve local reliability most reliability problems occurred in the local distribution systems rather than within the bulk power system transition to restructuring during restructuring the electric utility industry has initiated several changes to address ne w reliability responsibilities for competitive entities nerc has initiated transformation from voluntary organization to selfregulatory organi zation doe ferc and the utility industry are all working to provide guidance and pro cedures that may be used by regulators and participants in developing competitive markets risk factors reliability respons ibilities during restructuring are much more difficult to determine the increased number of participants create additional risk new set of participants that market electricity enter and leave the market on an irregular basis while paration between the market and those responsible for reliability must be achieved to avoid market abuse the coordination between various participants must continue to achieve high levels of reliability the task force commissioned by doe found uncertainty regarding statutory and regulatory authority over reliability management36 customer base prior to restructuring prior to restructuring the customer base for regulated utility was determined by the utility control area the utility was obligated to provide service to all retail customers in the control area as mentioned previously the utility received monopoly stat us from the state puc as compensation for taking on the obligation to serve all customers the u tility timated customer demands based on weather industrial activities and pr ojected growth planning studies were normally employed to determine generation needs internal to the control area while considering external power purchasing constraints economic analysis was used to determine the leastcost overall solution to achieve the desired reliability in states that have not restructured their retail markets this condition still exists transition to restructuring during restructuring competition or customer choice is provided to retail consumers this implies that distributors of electricity must account for changing customer base resulting from their choosing different suppliers supplier must tinue to predict loads based on all the information used before restructuring w eather population growth industrial growth while adding the factor associated with customer choice risk factors there is reliability improvement provided to the customer by having multiple redundant suppliers if one supplier is not acceptable from price or reliability standpoint then customer has an option to switch suppliers this ability for customers to choose suppliers is an advantage over the previous structure in which choice was provided however the reliability of the bulk power system could degrade if the added unknown of cu stomers changing suppliers becomes noticeablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs16 37 california stat ute ab1890 334 38 texas section 36 subchapt er chapter 38 section 38005 39 illinois 220 ilcs 516126most existing data indicate that few customers with the ability to c hoose suppliers are exercising their option to change and relatively small numbers of supplier changes by residential customers will not affect electricity flows in the bulk power system however larg er industrial customers that move from one supplier to another could affect the bulk power system reliability depending on the physical location of the new wholesale supplier to keep reliability at the same level large customer base changes resulting from rge demand moving from one supplier to another supplier must be accommodated without causing reliability problems in the wholesale supply and transmissi on of electricity the eff ect of these changes on bulk power system reliability is difficult to predict service obligations prior to restructuring as has been mentioned vertically integrated utilities were given monopoly territory in return for taking on the obligation to serve all customers in that territory the customers within the control area received reliable source of electricity as dict ated by state qualityofservice legislation the obligation to serve accepted by the utilitie s translated to wellde fined reliability level for customers transition to restructuring in states that have authorized competitive markets the obligation to serve exists at the distribution level however suppliers longer have any such obligati on generators who previously were part of regulated utility that did have an obligation to serve are now focusing on participation in the competitive market electricity generators are longer regulated by state qualityof service legislation but are driven by making profit an electricity service provider may sacrifice reliability in one area to achieve an improved profit margin by lowering existing qualityofservice or by serving different area within california statute the legislature noted that the proposed restructuring of the electricity industry would transfer responsibility for ensuring short and longterm reliability away from electric utilities and regulatory bodies to the independent system operator and various marketbased mechanisms37 risk factors in an effort to maintain reliability several states have passed restructuring legislation requiring minimally acceptable level of retail service some states have statutes that require service record s for unplanned outages to be reviewed by public authorities and certain other service reliability measures38 other states have requirements for adequate reserve margins and require reliability criteria to be equal to nerc standards39 these laws apply only to retail service therefore if retail service outages result from lack of bulk power system performance it is not clear how the state legislation will affect needed improvements in the wholesale supplyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs17 summary table 1 provides summary of all the risk factors identified in this section increased risk is an indication of potential reliability problems reliability issues result from situations where uncertainty or risk is not identified and eliminated the summation at the bottom of table 1 is based on an observation that many of the reliability improvements associated with rest ructuring have not been realized to large degree real simplification of control areas has been seen and new capital for transmission has not been made ava ilable even though ma rkets have attracted many new generation suppliers the major factor increasing uncertainty is the desired use of the bulk power system to support competition which was not envisioned by the original power system designers in order for the bulk power system to reliably support competition many argue that it must be developed into more of superhighway with higher capacities and less congestion table 1 summary of factors from functional changes in the electric utility industry resulting from restructuring

when their state retail markets will transition to competitive structure40 under current federal law ferc has jurisdiction over the wholesale markets and the bulk power system unbundled transmission system41 state restructuring legislation can have an effect on the reliability of the bulk power system retail changes such as the promotion of customer choice and the lack of an obligation to serve by merchant generators may affect reliability under current laws federal legisla tion does not directly affect indus try changes at the retail level the federal power act limits federal jurisdiction to unbundled transmission however the bulk power system must be capable of addressing uncertainty resulting from competitive retail markets the goal of much federal legislation dealing with electric utility restructuring is to suppl framework for development of bulk power system that will support compe tition at the retail level public power utilities in various portions of the united states also create jurisdictional issues for both state and federal agencies public power utilities own approximately one quarter of the bulk power systems generating capacity and approximately 30 of the transmission sy stem under current federal law ferc does not have jurisdiction over the tran smission owned and operated by these utilities ferc does review costbased rate s set by public utilities therefore the present jurisdiction for ferc includes only the portion of the bulk power system owned and operated by forprofit entities which includes investorowned utilities and nonutility entities generators marketers di stributors some legislative proposals would modify the definition of an electric utility in the federal power act to include federal and state spons ored utilities and municipalities proposed federal legislative solutions even though the goal of existing federa l law purpa epact is to encourage competition in electric markets while maintaining reliability the complex technical requirements associated with open acce ss were not fully understood when the legislation was enacted the factors identif ied in the previous sections suggest thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs19 level of risk that has been placed on the bulk power system the risk comes from attempts to implement competition at both wholesale and retail levels using bulk power system that was designed to rvice franchise control areas owned and operated by regulated monopolies many of the anticipat ed risk improvements which were expected to result from restructurin g efforts have not been realized various legislation has been proposed at the federal level to improve reliability of the bulk power system during the restru cturing process these proposals have the potential to affect reliability of the bulk power system in the following sections the provisions in the legislation will be identified and potential effects on reliability will be discussed table 2 provides summary of the purposes and issues for each legislative provision participation in regional transmission organizations some congressional proposals address par ticipation by electri c utilities in rtos these include encouraging ferc to provide incentive rates for transmission for those that do allowing the tennessee valle authority and fede ral power marketing administrations to join an rto requiring ferc to convene discussions with state regulatory authorities to termine whether an rto is necessary in region and prohibiting ferc from requiring transmitting utility to transfer operational control of its transmitting facilities to an rto or iso purpose ferc initiated the rto implementation process in december 1999 by issuing order 2000 ferc intends for th rtos to have in part the following characteristics independence from stakeholders broad scope and regi onal configuration broad operational authority including interconnections control over shortterm reliability therefore the purpose of encouraging utilities to form rtos is to create change in institutional structure that would promote reliability of the bulk power system within region rtos would coordinate improvements and ad minister reliability requirements to distribute costs fairly among the regional participants issues as has been discussed the imp lementation of rtos holds the potential to reduce risk through providing central control and planning function reducing the number of control areas and simplifying the institutional structure many industry participants support the imp lementation of rtos if constructed to provide fair access to the transmission system the difficulty has been achievement of that goal originally order 2000 called for imp lementation of rtos across the united states by december 2001 only one rto the midwest rto had been approved by ferc by the end of 2001 ot her rtos are in various stages of the approval process however th implementation of these organizations has been slow there are several coordination issues relating to rtos the number of rtos to be implemented in the united states bulk power system is uncertain the coordination of the planning functions is not clear nor how planning and capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs20 improvements to maintain reliability of th transmission system will be encouraged it is also not clear whether reduction in the number of control areas will be accomplished transmission congestion issues will be difficult to solve opponents of the ferc rto proposals argue that the cost of setting up the rto may be too high and will create financial burden for so participants that is unacceptable all of these unknowns add to uncertain ty and therefore increase risk ferc jurisdiction over bulk power system reliability at the present time nerc has responsib ility for reliability of the bulk power system legislation has been propos ed in every congress since the 105th to improve reliability and give ferc jurisdiction over an electric reliability organization ero purpose the purpose of the proposed legi slation is to provide federal jurisdiction over activities that are require d to support reliability of the us bulk power system the federal power act gives ferc jurisdiction over unbundled transmission and was intended to regulate wholesale rates however authority was provided to regulate reliability clarifying ferc authority to establish and regulate an ero is intended to improve reliability as restructuring of the us bulk power system proceeds issues advocates of giving ferc authority over the ero contend that central jurisdiction would provide more accountability ferc would be ultimately responsible for reliability issues if th penalties employed by the ero were not successful then ferc would have the authority to enforce penalties for entities that did not comply with reliability standards establishing this new relationship between ferc and the ero would have the poten tial to improve coordination between market functions and re liability functions those opposed to giving ferc jurisdiction over bulk power system reliability contend that ferc has experience in this area if ferc is given this authority it would have to rely on nerc for much of its expertise placing ferc in this position may add to the uncertainty associated with the changes in institutional structure as ferc takes on this new role transmissi on siting providing ferc with the authority to site transmission lines in regions where interstate transmission is needed to relie ve congestion has been another proposed yet controversial solution to increase long term reliability of the bulk power system state pucs have transmission siting author ity at the present time some proposals would provide for federal and state coordination of permitting for electric transmission facilities others would authorize ferc to issue transmission construction permits in areas found by doe to be congested purpose the purpose of the legislation is to make sure required transmission capacity can be constructed in situations where state puc siting procedures do not give adequate consideration to bulk power system reliability congestion on the transmission system conti nues to be problematic httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs21 42 hunt isaac c hr 3406 the electric s upply and

has seve ral purposes according to the sec the regulations in the act became redundant in the 1980s state retail regulation of utilities has been strengthened and the sec has enhanced its regulation of securities including those of public utility holding companies advocat for puhca repeal believe the act limits capital investment in the electric utility industry more specifically some believe puhca limits the formation of companies that would construct transmission capacity over broad interstate regions43 the purpose of the puhca repeal language is to eliminate legislation that is seen as unnecessary and as limiting industry expansion issues those opposed to puhca repeal argue that the law maintains necessary safeguards for the industry b ecause it tends to limit formation of large interstate companies that by their nature could control the marketplace opponents of the repeal are primarily concerned bout consumer protecti ons there are also concerns about market failure s resulting in loss of conf idence by investors which translates to reliability problem when new transmission and generation cannot be constructed puhca repeal could have both negative and positive

development group reliable affordable and environmentally sound energy for americas future may 17 2001 httpwwwwh itehousegovenergy199844 one of the recommendations was the development of forceable reliability standards this recommendation was also made in the energy plan developed by vice president cheney and the nati onal energy policy development group45 as mentioned in previous sections the reliability standards set by nerc prior to restructuring were voluntary proposed legislation and nerc have adopted the approach of developing mandatory sta ndards through an ero based on the nerc voluntary standards with penalties that could be imposed on violators purpose one key element that can be used to improve bulk power system reliability is imposing econo mic penalties for reliability standard noncompliance in many cases there is little economic be nefit realized by following reliability standards that have been veloped by nerc the purpose of the federal legislation is to authorize the use of mandatory standards and the assessment of penalties associated with failure to comply with the standards the assessment of economic penalties provides method of attaching value to maintaining reliability when penalties are properly set co mpliance should lower risk the concept of mandatory standards has received support from nerc and many representatives from the electric utility industry issues questions still remain about how effective mandatory standards would be can enforceable standa rds for reliability be devel oped that fairly distribute responsibilities among the participants to ma intain high level of reliability will the standards be clear these and other questions are key to the successful implementation of mandatory standards if the standards are perceived as high and the noncompliance penalty is less expensive than potential profits participants may not give proper attention to th standards if the standards are too low then even though participants comply with the sta ndards the potential exists for outages that could have been avoided the process of setting standards for many different types of owners and operators in united states canada and mexico presents challenge another area of difficulty relates to liability when outages do occur if market participant does not properly schedule an outage or maintain particular piece of equipment and the procedural miscue leads to largescale power outage should the market participant be liable for any or all of the costs associated with the outage which could be high in the past local power outages by utilities were analyzed by pucs to determine if negligence was factor state pucs use legislated tools to require level of performance from the utility and to penalize the utility if that level of performance is not achieved however liability for largescale outages has never systematically been assessed against participants that caused the outage responsibility for standards development all previously proposed re liability legislation authorizes the establishment of an ero to develop the reliability standards the ero would be certified by ferchttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs23 and would most likely be based on th present nerc organization with its 10 regional councils the ero would take primary responsibility for the validity of the standards and would provide in itial detection of noncompliance purpose the legislative proposals would direct nerc as the ero to continue in its present role as reliability standards administrator however ferc would maintain jurisdiction over nerc the regional councils in nerc would deal with reliability issues unique to their particular portions of the power system maintaining reliability must include efforts to coordinate with canada and mexico since there are many interconnections that cross those borders and allow bulk power systems in those countries to have an effect on the us system the existing relationship nerc has with canadian and mexican utilities would be resource to promote reliability across nort h american interconnections issues many existing nerc standards ve been developed based on the principles of interconnected systems ev though many of the basic standards can be retained and built on some may need to be modified and others eliminated to account for the effects of competitive markets on the interconnect system table 2 summary of provisions in proposed legislation that could affect reliability proposed legislative provisionspurpose issues required rto

areas much closer to customers this would eliminate some needs for high voltage and l ong distance transmission of electricity and would allow for the customization of reliability needs to meet unique user requirements conclusion the bulk power system in the united states has been reliable source of electricity for its industries and citizens the outage during 1965 in the northeastern united states which left 30 million customer s without electricity service was the largest in us history until the august 2003 blackout since 1968 nerc has been vehicle for utilities to develop industry st andards that promote reliability service reliability by utilities during the last 30 years has been excellent in most areas of the united states beginning in 1992 the industry has undergone significant changes with the goal of lowering rates by encouraging compe tition industry changes that have increased uncertainty and risk have occurred in veral areas including the following more complex institutional structure guaran teed rateofreturn for utilities lack of investment in the transmission system much more complex wholesale market distribution of reliability responsibilitie s among many partic ipants and retail customers with choice of suppliers these changes ultimately have the potential to adversely affect reliability of the electri city supply and they are forcing the bulk power system to be opera ted under conditions it was not designed to support not all of the changes to promote competition add to risk and uncertainty some of the changes tend to lower uncertainty and they include the potential to lower the number of control areas and imp rove coordination centralized planning improvements for larger regions new capital from larger number of participants and greater redundancy from larger number of suppliers and providers however many of the changes that would lower risk ve not been realized to date therefore the electric utility industry is operating under conditions of greater risk now than it was decade ago this greater risk can pot entially lead to lowering of reliability which some feel has already been borne out in the restructuring of the california electric utilities restructuring proposals may lead to less risk in the future however those changes and the benefits from those changes have been slow to materialize the transmission portion of the bulk pow er system remains concern the transmission system was designed to provide for the needs of the utility industry prior to 1992 when utilities held monopoly status in their particul ar control areas transmission facilities were c onstructed to support only tr ansactions between those utilities competition requires the bulk power system to be used in much different way than was envisioned by those earlier transmission system designers many observers assert that methods are needed to transform the transmission system into superhighway that can support competition among multiple suppliers and multiple consumers in areas where congestion on the transmission system occurs reliability will be problem the respons ibilities and methods that will be used to effect this transformation of the trans mission system remain unclear technology improvements may assist with these issues in the future distributed generation46 and conservation both hold potential httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31469crs25 47 see footnote 44 which defines unbundled tr ansmission in the section titled federal and state jurisdictionfederal legislation has been proposed that includes several provisions that could improve reliability provisi ons that have received mo re support and hold potential for reliability improvement are the jurisdictional role provided to ferc and the establishment of an ero to develop mandatory reliability standards both of these provisions are intended to add some clarity and stability that would lower risk and improve reliability ferc has already started to take this role with the issuance of order 2000 the supreme court decisi on of march 4 2002 which supported the ferc definition of unbundled trans mission adds further clarity47 proposed legislation would further provide ferc with legal authority to take on the ultimate responsibility for bulk power system reliab ility legislative mandate for an ero with enforceable standards could add certainty in an area that is already being pursued by the industry whether the proposed legislation can pr ovide the desired re liability has yet to be seen the details of the implement ation by ferc nerc and the industry participants would be the key the answer to the question of whether reliability can be maintained while restructuring the elect ric utility industry is difficult to predict there has been much concern about the t opic however the proposals remain for the most part untested and unproven proposed legislative remedies will be successful only if and when they result in the necessary capability flexibility and efficiency in the existing system required to overcome the added risks
