contributing factors in unemployment compensation uc bene fit exhaustion rates to counter the disincentive effect of benefit receipt most state uc programs limit the duration of uc benefits to maximum of 26 weeks and many require some evidence of job search the limited duration of uc benefits results in some unemployed individuals exhausting their bene fits before finding work or voluntarily leaving the labor force furthermore th availability of compensation uc benefits may create disincentives to search for nd accept reemployment these disincentives are alleviated by decreasing the generosity of the uc benefits and increasing the cost of benefit receipt throug h additional program requi rements the somewhat paradoxical policy of cutting uc benefits and increasing the burden of uc program requirements in order to help the unemployed leads to competing policy choices benefit adequacy is traded off against the disincentive effect or unemployment is increased at the expense of employment exhaustion rates increased over the last 30 years there has been an important change in the relationship among unemplo yment and the exhaustion of benefits unemployment levels are lower in the 1990s than in the 1980s and 1970s for equivalent economic periods however these lower unemployment rates are associated with higher expected rates of benefit exhaustion this trend has many complex contributing factors including ch anging program benefit generosity and administration workforce demogra phics and genera l economic cond itions research indicates that 1 increased uc coverage and lowered progra m requirements 2 increased proportion of wome n minorities and older workers in the workforce 3 decreased manufacturing positions and 4 decreased temporary layoffs all contribute to an increase in uc benefit exhaustion the uc benefit exhaustion rate also increases during economic recessions after economic recovery the uc benefit exhaustion rate decreases this pape r will be updated

duration based on calculati ons that take into account work experience and earnings history the limited duration of uc benefits results in some unemployed individuals exhausting their uc benefits before findi ng work or voluntarily leaving the labor force for other activities such as retiremen t disability family care or education generally the exhaustion of uc benefits is not considered to be reliable indicator of uc abuse by an individual in fact empirical research suggests that workers who exhaust benefits search at similar or higher levels of intensity than workers who do find employment before benefit exhaustion6 unemployment compensation benefit exhaustion disincentive effects the jobsearch behavior of the unemployed can be influenced by changing the timing generosity and duration of uc compensation7 economic theory suggests that unemployment compensation will have negativeeffect on the recipients willingness to search for and accept new job higher benefit levels and easier program requirements for benefits will cause recipients to be less willing to accept jobs and may indu ce some of the employed to quit and become unemployed 8 thus the availability of compensation uc benefits may create disincentive9 to search for and accept reemployment research in this area examines how these disincentives are allevi ated by decreasing the generosity of the uc benefits and increasing the cost of benefit receipt throug h additional program requirements10 tradeoffs the somewhat paradoxical policy of cutting uc benefits and increasing the burden of uc program

congress often has passed temporary programs to supplement the uc system during economic slowdowns11 defining unemployment compensation benefit exhaustion the department of labor dol estimates the rate of uc benefit exhaustion and reports annual averages as well as movi ng yearly average reported on monthly basis12 conceptual description of uc exhaustion abstracting from actual available data the exhausti on rate should measure the pr oportion of all uc benefit recipients who exhaust their receipt elig ibility before finding job that is hypothetical uc exhaus tion rate uc exhaustees week t uc recipients that would have been eligible to exhaust in week t however current administrative constraints in data collection do not allow for this exact calculation each state collects and tracks th eir own uc benefit data aggregate weekly information from the state is passed on to the us department of labor which then constructs an estimate of the uc exhaustion statistic construction of uc ex haustion statistic the uc benefit exhaustion rate is constructed from two statistics that are also reported separately the first is the average number of claimants drawing the final payment of their original entitlement for given program in the previ ous year t the second is the average number of firstweek uc benefit recipients for the year beginning 6 months before the year t t6 months according to the dol this is to account for the normal flow of claimants through the program13 note that the tally of the number of firstweek uc recipients is not the actual number of uc recipients that have the potential to exhaust their benefits in week t but rather represents construct of what it would be if all uc recipients were eligible to collect benefits for exactly 26 weeks the dol calculation is uc exhaustion rate uc exhaustees t uc firstweek recipients t6 months httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32111crs4 14 daniel mcmurrer and amy chasanovtre nds in unemployment insurance benefits monthly labor review sept 1995 pp 3039 while the percentage of the unemployed who receive uc benefits generally increases during economic recessions these increases have also lowered over time for mont hly trends see section 3 unemployment compensation table 42 insured unemployment as percent of total unemployment by month selected years 19672002 in the greenbook 2003 at httpwaysandmeans housegovdocumentsaspsection813 15 the average total unemployment rate is form ed from estimates that include all workers who are unemployed and is not based upon uc eligibility the statistic has been seasonally adjusted and may be found at httpwwwblsgovcps by selecting most requested statistics 16 while this has the unfortunate result of lagging the exhaustion rate actual monthly exhaustion rates are extremely volatile and calc ulation of actual monthly changes in rates are of little value for policy decisions for example the exhaustion rate repor ted for july 2003 will be the number of uc benefit recipients who exhaust thei r potential durations uc exhaustees from august 2002 until july 2003 divided by the number of uc firstweek recipients reported from february 2002 until january 2003 caveats for uc exhaustion statistic since not all uc benefit recipients are eligible to receive full 26 weeks of benefits this statistic may overstate the rate of uc benefit exhaustion at the beginni ng of an economic recession since the lagged estimated number firstweek recipients may be smaller than the actual number of firstweek recipients who w ould have been eligible for exhaustion in that week likewise the statistic may understate the rate of uc benefit exhaustion as the economy begins to improve since the lagged estimated number of firstweek recipients may be larger than the actual number of firstweek benefit recipients who would have been eligible for exhaustion in that week this is because the relationship of uc exhaustions with the bus iness cycle may vary and be substantially higher or lower at different points of the business cycle in particular as recessions end the severity of the problem of increased benefit exhaustion may be underestimated current trends in uc benefit exhaustion over the past 30 years the percentage of the unemployed receiving unemployment compensation benefits has declined steadily14 during this period there also has been an increase in the per centage of uc benefit recipients exhausting their benefits figure 1 displays the monthly average total unemployment rate15 monthly annual average weeks of benefit collection and monthly

and stephen wandner eds we upjohn institute for employment research kalamazoo michigan 1997 pp 211283potential causes of increased uc benefit exhaustion there are many factors with complex in teractions contributing to exhaustion rates these factors include program be nefit generosity and program requirements workforce demographics and economic conditions program benefit generosity and program administration more generous state benefits and lower levels of program requirements increase uc benefit exhaustion rates generally the more generous the uc benefit and the less onerous the process for receipt the greater likeli hood of benefit receipt and likewise benefit exhaustion the most recent significant in creases in uc coverage were in the 1970s when state and local government empl oyees many household domestic workers and employees of small businesses were covered17 although many state policy changes have restricted eligibility individual nominal wages have increased due to inflation allowing more individuals to reach the minimum earnings thresholds in the 1980s numerous state uc laws were changed to restrict eligibility and reduce benefit levels partially in response to the 1982 requirement to repay federal loans to state uc trust funds with in terest in 1986 all unemployment benefits became subject to federal income taxati on in the 1990s in response to lowered federal administrative funding program rules that required intensive monitoring such as weekly proof of job search and week ly attendance requireme nts were relaxed or replaced with telephone respons or internet reporting systems in some states in addition some states began to expand be nefits to workers with more limited work histories through the alternative wage bases for uc benefit calculations the variance in potential durations of receiving uc insurance benefits has implications for the exhaustion rate eight states have uniform duration of benefits18 of 26 weeks while others have varying duration19 based upon an applicants earnings and labor market history research estimates find that states with higher average potential duration of benefits have lower percentage of exhaustees after controlling for unemployment levels20 for example in nonrecessionary period of the late 1980s carson and dynarski 1 990 find that 26 of exhaustees hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32111crs10 21 see karen needels walter corson and walter nicholson left out of the boom economy ui recipients in the late 1990s eta occasional paper 200203 may 2002 us department of labor also s ee corson and dynarski study of unemployment insurancepotential uc durations of less than 20 weeks as compared with only 12 of nonexhaustees having such low potential durations workforce demographics in general over the last 30 years the changing demographics of the workforce have cont ributed to the increased likelihood of uc benefit exhaustion while the recession nding in november 2001 is too recent for new research to have been completed prev ious research indicates that uc benefit exhaustees differ from other workers who receive uc benefits21 uc benefit exhaustees are more likely to have lower vels of education be female hispanic or black have less stable work history and therefore qualify for lower benefits and shorter potential durations be older not belong to union not be employed in manufacturing and not have recall date or be more likely to be on permanent layoff during the last economic boom needel s et 2002 find that those uc recipient characteristics that increased exhaustion rates during the most recent economic boom include an aging recipi ent population an increase in hispanic recipients and decrease in the proportion of uc recipients who were previously in manufacturing jobs and those who had defin ite recall dates the characteristics of uc exhaustees mirrored early studies to the extent that they were more likely than nonexhaustees to be females and racial or ethnic minorities had lowerpaying parttime jobs or were in temporary jobs carson and dynarski 1990 find the majo r distinction between exhaustees and nonexhaustees is the workers expectation and ultimate likelihood of recall by their previous employer they also find that the uc exhaustees were more likely to be female older black or hisp anic and to have less than high school degree their research also suggests that there are two diverging demographic trends among exhaustees those with low skills and low wages and those with high skills and high wages workers with low skills experienced decreasing demand for their labor increasing the likelihood that they exhaus t their uc benefits generally higher skilled workers experience lower rates of unemployment than other workers during recessions in the 1980s however higher sk illed workers experienced higher rates of unemployment than experienced during th economic expansions empirically higher skilled workers require more time to find appropriate jobs as result this longer search time for higher skilled workers increases the overall uc exhaustion rates during economic recessions economic conditions during economic recessions uc benefit exhaustion increases after economic recovery the uc benefit exhaustion rate declines there is substantial evidence to suggest that the economic cycle does matter in which type of workers are more likely to exhaust th uc benefits cars on and dynarski 1990 find that the characteristics of the exhaustees depends on whether there is recessionary economy the proportion of exha ustees who have s ubstantial attachment to their job is likely to rise during recessionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32111crs11 general economic changes have also increased uc exhaustion rates in particular the decline in the manufacturing sector more likely to use temporary lay offs than other sectors the decline in unionization union members are more likely to experience temporary layoffs and are more likely to apply for benefits for shorter unemployment spells decreasing the overall uc exhaustion rate and the increase in the service sector service sector layoffs are more likely to be permanent all have contributed to the overall in crease in exhaustion rates
