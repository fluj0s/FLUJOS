plane crash in the potomac river in january 1982 is often cited as the impetus for expandi ng interoperability in the capital area public safety communications policy background public safety agencies include the nation s first responders suc h as firefighters police officers and ambulance services 911 call center sta ff and number of local state federal and sometimes regional authorities communications often wireless radios are vital to these agencies effectiveness and to the safety of their members and the public wi reless technology requires radio frequency capacity in order to function and exis ting wireless technology is designed to work within specified frequency ranges different operations different applications different rules and standards and different radio frequencies are among the pr oblems first responders face in trying to communicate with each other interoperab ility also referred to as compatibility or connectivity refers to the capability for di fferent systems to readily connect to each other facilitating inte roperability has been polic concern of public safety officials for number of years1 however public safety agencies especially at the local level tend to rely on vendors for tec hnical expertise interoperable solutions therefore are often based on proprietary systems limiting the scope of connectivity one way to bypass the vendordriven planni ng that characterizes and limits public safety communications could be to imple ment national plan that encouraged resourcesharing and standardized interfaces while promoting the transition to open source architecture at the level of na tional policy for emergency planning and response for example goals for inter operability could incl ude interchangeability assuring that equipment from any agency state or community could be used to replace or supplement equipment in any ar ea of the country as needed since september 11 2001 when communica tions failures added to the horror of the day achieving inte roperability for public safety communications has become an important policy concern for cong ress the damage to communications infrastructure caused by hurri cane katrina and subsequent flooding has revealed the extent to which the concerns of congress as expressed in legisl ation have yet to be acted upon although many replacements fo r lost communications equipment were rushed to critical sites in the gulf coast states they were usually different systems using different radio frequencies with little or capability for cross communication although inter operability in communications is correctly perceived as subset of the larger problem of providing comprehensive communications support it is pivotal solution inter operability provides re dundancy and backup capacity key elements for robust network some have suggested that the currenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32594crs2 2 one frequentlycited definition of interoperability has been provided by the government agency safecom in general interoperability refers to the ability of public safety emergency responders to work seamlessly w ith other systems or products without any special effort wireless communications inter operability specifically re fers to the ability of public safety officials to share information via voice and data signals on demand in real time when needed and as authorized httpwwwsafecomprogramgov 3 for example testimony from telecommunications executives at hearing of senate committee on commerce science and transportation communications in disaster september 22 2005definition widely used in discussing interoperability may be too general2 and that fuller articulation of planning goals shoul d be developed to guide policy many experts agree that at this point in what can only be described as an ongoing crisis in communications capacity critical missing element is planning at the national level in this view na tional planning whether under taken at the federal level through consortium of states or other m eans is needed to transcend proprietary solutions and bring about consensus on co mmon interfaces with uniform standards that permit full interoperability and interchangeability for newer digital equipment federal policy also could guide public sa fety communications purchases toward transition to open source platforms sta ndardized interfaces can link existing non standard eg proprietary systems and networks for pl anning purposes this could require for example federal mandate fo r interoperable standa rds for cross talk systems provide by companies such as ma com motorola and raytheon open architecture standards would ensure that systems were fully interoperable with equipment that was fully interchangeable an example of planning would be program to encourage the development and use of open source architectures planning post katrina federalization of emergency response for disasters or catastrophic events could become inevitable unless states and communities have adequate resources to act in timely manner current disaster res ponse plans of the federal emergency management agency fema are built on the assumption that local resources will be adequate after disaster strikes until additional resources arrive the destructive chaos that followed in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita revealed many weakness in current assumptions and plans such as those in the national response plan and the national incident management system two critical pieces of infrastructure failed early on electrical power and

demanded further advances6 despite indications of progress much remains to be done issues that could be addr essed collectively or singly by congress the administration the private sector or others include the development of long term strategy th at coordinates both pub lic safety spectrum needs and interoperable communications n eeds and the coordination of the various studies requested by congress and by the administration the findings and recommendations from these studies could be valuable in the advancement of policy for public safety accountability and oversight the achievement of

katrina on the gulf coast states brought home to many how large the gap is between intentions and execution as noted in another crs report9 after fema was absorbed by dhs it was effectively strippe d

between access to spectrum and the effectiveness of communications technology briefly the recommendation says free up and assign more spectrum for public safety use establish communications support the role of signal corps typically is to provide informati on systems and networks for real time command and control with interoperable communications connectivity and prioritize funding these co mmunications operations for highrisk urban areas spectrum allocation although cumulatively radio frequenc ies designated for nonfederal public safety total over 90 mhz25 the characteristics of these frequencies are dissimilar requiring different technol ogical solutions the fragmentation of spectrum assignments for public safety is significant barrier to achieving needed capacity for the future and is presently among the t echnical problems that plague public safety communications such as out ofdate equipment proprietary solutions congestion and interference an immediate barrier to interoperability is simply put that uhf and vhf frequencies26 cannot connect directly with each other and that older analog equipment widely used below 512 mhz cannot connect with newer digital equipment at 800 mhz technology for ne w frequencies at 49 ghz is still in the early stage of development but these freque ncies appear suitable primarily for local area shortrange transmission none

that additional spectrum should be assigned for public safety use and not exclusively for first responders30 in addition to providing spectrum for other types of users the spectrum available for public safety should be able to support high speed transmissions capable of quickly sending data such as photographs floor plans and live video this requires pr oviding frequencies w ith greater bandwidth to enable wireless broadba nd and newgeneration technol ogies although radio frequencies have been designated for state and local public safety use in the 700 mhz range there are allocations specifica lly for federal use at 700 mhz and the bandwidth assignments are judged by mo st experts to be too narrow for full broadband many have advocated that dditional spectrum be allocated at 700 mhz to accommodate federal users and to suppor t newer broadband wi reless technologies as part of nationwide network for pub lic safety communications the spectrum coalition for public safety for example s circulated proposals that would allocate additional spectrum at 700 mhz for use by state and local firs t responders critical infrastructure industries and fe deral public safety agencies31 in the study requested by congress the fcc sought comment on whether additional spectrum should be made available for public safety possibly from the 700 mhz band comments received from the pub lic

spectrum allocations in the short term although it stated that it agreed that public safety could make use of such an allocation in the longterm to provide broadband services32 it qualified this

established will the proposed interface between federal law enforcement personnel and selected state nd local officials be extendable to say interoperability between those officials nd local

federal agencies and the need for an indepth gap analysis the assessment of current levels of interoperable communications capability compared to requirements the gao has recommended that the director of the office of management and budget work with dhs to review safeco ms functions and establish longterm program with appropria authority and funding to coor dinate interope rability efforts across the federal government111 other notable observations from the gao include the fragmented federal grant stru cture for first responders does not support statewide interoperab ility planning safecom has developed grant guidance for in teroperability but cannot require that consistent guidance be incorpor ated in all federal first responder grants the federal government can provi the leadership longterm commitment and focus to help state and local governments meet interoperability goals for example the federal government can provide the leadership and suppor t for developing 1 national database of interoperable co mmunications frequencies 2 common nomenclature for those frequencies 3 national architecture that identifies communications requirements and technical standards and 4 stat ewide interoperable communications plans112 safecom however articulated differe nt approach in testimony and its 2003 strategy planning session in its strategy summary it reported that it intends over the course of 10 to 20 years to adopt national strategy from the bottom up to incorporate effective public safety communications113 boyd also reaffirmed his belief that any effort to improve

to be giving the greatest attention to improving radio interoperability particularly through the deployment of crosstalk hardware this decision in turn leads to an emphasis on increasing the amount of equipment standardization impr oving operating standa rds and protocols and consulting on how to install and use new equipment according to boyds testimony the focus for safecom is on three areas creation of an architectural framework the development of standards and the coordination of federal activities115 the architectural framework is intended to aid safecom in determining priorities for the development of standards the framework will reflect systemofsystems approach to develop interface standards to help improve the problem of communications interoperability116 it appears that it will be modeled along the lines of pyramid with decision making starting at the base and building up the organic nature of the safecom model for infrastructure development apparently requires long timeline usually extending in testimony to 20 years and resists description in terms of longterm goals and deadlines by describing its achievements and plans within the framework of shortterm milestones many of which involve the preparation of studies by outside consultant s safecom appears to have avoided addr essing many of the strategic go als originally envisioned for its mission without an official explan ation for the shift in emphasis safecom strategy as an government initiative in 2002 and 2003 omb sequentially desc ribed safecoms mission milestone s and goals it appears that many of these goals have not been met or have been modified the 2002 government strategy doc ument described safecoms mission as follows for public safety officials to be effec tive in their daily responsibilities as well as before during and after an emergency event public safety agencies throughout all levels of government ie federal state and local must be able to communicate with each other this initiative would address the nations critical shortcomings in efforts by public safety agencies to achieve interoperability and eliminate redundant wireless communications infrastructures

dination of all federal interoperability efforts in ombs description of longt erm strategic goals as outlined in the 2003 egov plan there appears to be an implicit assumption that there are redundant wireless communications infrastructures that can be identified and eliminated this planning document describes the safecom initiative as addressing critical shortcomings including two sign ificant points where communications interoperability is lacking interoperability between state and local authorities as well as interoperability between federal public safety networks the plan indicates that some unidentified networks would be consolidated to yield costs savings further billions of dollars in savings are presumed by creating rightsized set of consolidated interoperable federal networks li nked to state wireless networks to date there appears to be informati on on safecom plans for improving wireless communications networks at the national or regional level the focus of the program on hardware solutions at the incident leve l would seem to preclude plans for network interoperability or the estab lishment of standards for ne w interoperable technologies such as mesh networks or cognitive radios work at the incident level is primarily local focused on shortrange interoperability solutions wide area networks and nationwide endtoend communications re ly on technologies not being tested or evaluated by safecom at the incident level in particular the buildfromthebotto mup approach for interoperability advocated by safecom would appear to be at odds with the egovernment goal of achieving efficiencies at the communications network level m odern networks with their incorporation of software programs on chips other softwareprogrammable technologies nanotechnology and meshed communications systems to cite some examples are generally built out from common design requiring some degree of centralization in that respect the goals of the iwn appear to be more aligned to the original goals of the egovernment strategy its intentions include the construction of national network the identification nd prioritization of enduser functional requirements and the use of open
