5 18 april 2002 eu restricted commission working document does not necessarily represent the views of the commission services draft review report for the active substance picolinafen finalised in the standing committee on the food chain and animal health at its meeting on 19 april 2002 in view of the inclusion of picolinafen in annex i of directive 91414eec 1 procedure followed for the evaluation process this review report has been established as result of the evaluation of the new active substance picolinafen made in the context of the work provide d for in articles 5 and 6 of directive 91414eec concerning the placing of plant protecti on products on the market with view to the possible inclusion of this substance in annex i to the directive in accordance with the provisions of article 62 f directive 91414eec the german authorities received on 10 may 1999 an application from basf formerly cyanamid hereafter referred to as the applicant for the inclusion of the active substance picolinafen in annex i to the directive german authorities indicated to the commission on 3 june 1 999 the results of first examination of the completeness of the dossier with regard to the data and information requirements provided for in annex ii and for at ast one plant protection product containing the active substance concerned in annex iii to the directive subsequently and in accordance with the requirements of article 62 dossier on picolinafen was distributed to the member states and the commission the commission referred the dossier to the standing committee on plant health in the meeting of the working group legislation thereof on 10 june 1999 during which the member states confirmed the receipt of the dossier in accordance with the provisions of article 63 which requires the confirmation at community level that the dossier is to be considere d as satisfying in principle the data and information requirements provided for in annex ii an d for at least one plant protection product 2 containing the active substance concerned in annex iii to the directive and in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 20 of the direct ive the commission confirmed in its decision 1999555ec 1 of 2 july 1999 that these requirements were satisf ied within the framework of that decision and with vi ew to the further organisation of the works related to the detailed examination of the dossier p rovided for in article 62 and 4 of directive 91414eec it was agreed between the mem ber states and the commission that germany as rapporteur member state would carry out the detailed examination of the dossier and report the conclusions of the examination accomp anied by any recommendations on the inclusion or noninclusion and any conditions relat ing thereto to the commission as soon as possible and at the latest within period of one ear germany submitted to the commission on 21 december 2000 the report of its detailed scienti fic examination hereafter referred to as the draft asse ssment report including as required recommendation concerning the possible inclusion of picolinafen in annex i to the directive on receipt of the draft assessment report the comm ission forwarded it for consultation to all the member states on 15 november 2000 as well as to basf being the sole applicant on 21 december 2000 further discussion between the rapporteur member st ate and the united kingdom acting as corapporteur member state were organised to revie w the draft assessment report and the comments received thereon in particular on each of the following disciplines identity and physical chemical properties fate and behaviour in the environment ecotoxicology mammalian toxicology residues and analytical methods regulatory questions the report of this peer review ie the reporting table was circulated for further consultation to member states and the sole applicant on 30 augus t 2001 the dossier revised draft assessment report and th peer review report ie reporting table including in particular an outline resum√© of the re maining technical questions were referred to the standing committee on plant health and specialised wor king groups of this committee for final examination with participation of experts from the 15 member states this final examination took place from october 2002 to december 2002 and was finalised in the meeting of the standing committee on 19 april 2002 the present review report contains the conclusions of this final examination given the importance of the revised draft assessment report the peer review report ie reporting table and the comments and clarifications submitted after the revision of the draft assessment report as basic information for the final examination proce ss these documents are considered respectively as background documents b and c to this review report and are part of it 1 oj l210 1008 1999 p22 3 the review did not reveal any open questions which would have required consultation of the scientific committee on plants 2 purposes of this review report this review report including the background docume nts and appendices thereto have been developed and finalised in support of the directive 00 eec concerning the inclusion of picolinafen in annex i to directive 91414eec and to assist the member states in decisions on individual plant protection products containing picolinafen they have to take in accordance with the provisions of that directive and in parti cular the provisions of article 41 and the uniform principles laid down in annex vi this review report provides also for the evaluation required under section a2b of the above mentioned uniform principles as well as under seve ral specific sections of part b of these principles in these sections it is provided that m ember states in evaluating applications and granting authorisations shall take into account th information concerning the active substance in annex ii of the directive submitted for the purp ose of inclusion of the active substance in annex i as well as the result of the evaluation of those data in parallel with the provisions of article 76 of regulation 360092 for existing active substances the commission and the member states wi ll keep available or make available this review report for consultation by any interested par ties or will make it available to them on their specific request moreover the commission will send copy f this review report not including the background documents to the applicant the information in this review report is at least partly based on information which is confidential andor protected under the provisions of directive 91414eec it is therefore recommended that this review report would not be ac cepted to support any registration outside the context of directive 91414eec eg in third c ountries for which the applicant has not demonstrated possession of regulatory access to the information on which this review report is based 3 overall conclusion in the context of directive 9 1414eec the overall conclusion from the evaluation is that it may be expected that plant protection products containing picolinafen will fulfil the saf ety requirements laid down in article 51a and b of directive 91414eec this conclusion is however subject to compliance with the particular requirements in sections 4 5 6 and 7 f this report as well as to the implementation of the provisions of article 41 and the uniform p rinciples laid down in annex vi of directive 91414eec for each picolinafen containing plant p rotection product for which member states will grant or review the authorisation furthermore these conclusions were reached within the framework of the following uses which were proposed and supported by the sole submitter herbicide in winter cereals with application rate up to 01 kg asha 4 extension of the use pattern beyond those described above wil l require an evaluation at member state level in order to establish whether the propo sed extensions of use can satisfy the requirements of article 41 and of the uniform pri nciples laid down in annex vi of directive 91414eec 4 specific conclusions which are highlighted in th is evaluation 41 residues of picolinafen in foodstuffs the review has established that the residues arisin g from the proposed uses consequent on application consistent with good plant protection p ractice have harmful effects on human or animal health the theoretical maximum daily intake tmdi for 60 kg adult is 11 of the acceptable daily intake adi based on the faowho european diet august 1994 this low intake value reflects the current limited use p attern for this active substance 42 exposure of operators workers and bystanders the review has identified acceptable exposure scenar ios for operators workers and bystanders which require however confirmation for each plant protection product in accordance with the relevant sections of the above mentioned uniform pr inciples 43 ecotoxicology the review has also concluded that under the propos ed and supported conditions of use there are unacceptable effects on the environment as provided for in article 4 1 b iv and v of directive 91414eec provided that certain cond itions are taken into account as detailed in section 7 of this report 5 identity and physicalchemical properties the main identity and the physicalchemical propert ies of picolinafen are given in appendix i the active substance shall have minimum purity of 970 gkg technical product the review has established that for the active subs tance notified by the applicant basf none of the manufacturing impurities considered are on the basis of information currently available of toxicological or environmental concern 6 endpoints and related information in order to facilitate member states in granting or reviewi ng authorisations to apply adequately the provisions of article 41 of directive 91414 eec and the uniform principles laid down in annex vi of that directive the most important endpo ints as identified during the evaluation process are listed in appendix ii 5 7 particular conditions to be taken into account n short term basis by member states in relation to the granting of authorisation s of plant protection products containing picolinafen on the basis of the proposed and supported uses ma x application rate of 01 kg asha the following particular issues have been identified as requiring particular and short term within 12 months at the latest attention from the member sta tes in the framework of any authorisations to be granted varied or withdrawn as appropriate particular attention should be paid to the protecti on of aquatic organisms conditions of authorisation should include risk mitigation measur where appropriate 8 list of studies to be generated further studies were identified which were consi dered at this stage and under the current inclusion conditions necessary in relation to the i nclusion of picolinafen in annex i when granting authorisations member states may also require additional information to ensure protection of surface water bodies also refined assessment of dermal absorption may be required to ensure protection of operators 9 updating of this review report the technical information in this report may requir periodic updating to take account of technical and scientific developments as well as of the results of the examination of any information referred to the commission in the frame work of articles 7 10 or 11 of directive 91414eec such adaptations will be examined and finali sed in the standing committee on the food chain and animal health in connection with an amendment of the inclusion conditions for picolinafen in annex i of the directive 6
