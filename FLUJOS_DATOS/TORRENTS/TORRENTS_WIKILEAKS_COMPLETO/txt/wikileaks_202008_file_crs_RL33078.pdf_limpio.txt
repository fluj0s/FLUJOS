they have been used to respond to past disasters the report begins by introducing the c oncept of continuum of housing needs following disaster displaced families needs range from emergency shelter to temporary and permanent housing wh ile the federal em ergency management agency fema has primary responsibility fo r coordinating disaster relief efforts and providing certain services to help communities recover other federal agencies including hud also play an important role huds programs fall into three distin ct categories the direct housing assistance programs include the secti on 8 housing choice voucher program the public housing program and projectbased rental assistance i ncluding section 202 and section 811 programs for the elderly and disabled they can be used to provide temporary housing for both families who were receiving housing assistance at the time of the disaster as well as those who were not the block grant programs the community development block grant cdb g and home investment partnerships programs provide flexible funding sources to states and localities to meet housing and other community development needs including those in times of disaster the federal housing administration fha at hud provides singlefamily and multi family mortgage insurance the rules of which become more flexible following disaster in order to better understand the role hud has played in response to disasters this report profiles crises in which the housing stock was severely damaged congress provided emergency supplemental funding to hud in response to each of the

before looking at existing housing resources it is useful to think about the housing needs that emerge after disa ster research by quarantelli1 identified four major stages of housing need following disaster emergency shelter temporary shelter temporary housing and permanent housing emer gency shelter is designed to provide safe location during or immediately after disaster in the case of hurricane katrina people sought emergenc shelter on roofs and overpasses for example temporary shelter is one stage beyond emergency shelte r and while it lasts longer than emergency shelter families are generally not able to establish daytoday routines during their stay temporary sh elter includes mass shelters that provide food and sleeping accommodation and homes temporarily shared by friends or family temporary housing is housing that is unique to family and allows them to begin to establish daytoday routines but is not seen as permanent it can last for months or even years and examples in clude the temporary trailers often made available while damaged homes are underg oing repair permanent housing is familiar concept and can include families return to their former residences new residences in or near their original communities or permanent relocation in another community while most aspects of emergency response are led and organized at the state and local level the federal

assistance act pl 93288 fema helps localities designate evacuation areas to provide emergency shelter and it coordinates with municipalities and organizations such as the american red cross and other charitable organizations to establish tem porary shelters fema also provides in conjunction with states and municipalities temporary housing options including rental assistance payments sometimes under contract with hud3 that allow families to find temporary accommodation in the private rental market as well as temporary physical structures such as tr ailer homes finally fema also provides loans and grants to help families repair damaged homes4 while fema is the primary disaster response agency other federal agencies so contribute housing resources including the department of commerce the small business administration primarily the department of agricu lture the rural housing service the treasury various tax prog rams and incentives including the low income housing tax credit lihtc and hud the agency that is the focus of this report5 furthermore large majority of th restoration and creation of permanent housing is met through the use of private and public insurance6 existing hud

discussion of section 8 vouchers in response to hurricane katrina see crs report rl33173 hurricane katrina questions regar ding the section 8 housing voucher program by maggie mccarty 8 housing is generally considered affordable if its costs account for more than 30 of familys income 9 the formula is more complicated than presented here for more information see crs report rl32284 an overview of the ction 8 housing program by maggie mccarty 10 very low income is defined as income at or below 50 of the local area median income 11 extremely low income is defined as income at or below 30 of the local area median income 12 the fy2005 appropriation for the public housing operating fund was artificially low by about 1 billion because of onetime savings that congress was able to realize for more information see crs report rl32869 the department of housing and urban development hud fy2006 budget by maggie mccarty libby perl bruce foote and eugene boyddirect assist ance programs one primary form of direct assistan ce provided by hud is rental assistance provided through the section 8 housing choice voucher program7 section 8 vouchers are used by lowin come families to reduce their housing costs in the private market to an affordable level8 families with vouchers pa 30 of their incomes towards rent and the federal government pays the difference between the families contributions and the actual rent up to limit9 in order to be eligible families must be very low income10 however 75 of all vouchers are statutorily targeted to extremely low income families11 the subsidies are portable meaning families can move anywhere in the country with thei r vouchers the program is administered at the local level by quasigovernmental public housing authorities phas and congress currently funds approximately 2 million vouche rs in fy2005 congress provided almost 15 billion for the voucher program another form of direct assistance provided by hud is lowrent public housing very low income families are eligible to live in one of the nearly 12 million units of public housing owned and ma intained by local phas families living in public housing pay 30 of their incomes towards th eir housing costs and phas receive two streams of federal subsidie s operating funds and capital funds to help make up the difference between tenant rents and the costs of maintaining the properties operating funds are used to help cover da ytoday expenses including utilities social services staff and security capital funds are used to meet modernization needs such as building repair and refurb ishment in fy2005 congress provided approximately 25 billion each to the capital and operating funds12 the final form of direct assistan ce provided by hud is hybrid between vouchers and public housing called projectb ased rental assist ance the primary projectbased rental assistance programs are section 8 projectbased rental assistance the section 202 program for the elderly and the section 811 program for the disabled in all three programs private landlords own and manage housing units for which the rent is subsidized by the federal government families who live in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33078crs4 13 note that the appropriations level for project based section 8 is lower than the program level because number of units are funded under longterm contracts that do not require annual appropriations until the contracts expire also note that the appropriations provided to the section 202 and 811 programs include funding for capital grants in addition to rental assistanceunits pay roughly 30 of their incomes towa rds rent and the fede ral government pays the landlord the difference between the nant contribution nd the negotiated rent for the unit generally these buildings are fhainsured see discussion of fha insurance below in fy2004 1309427 units received projectbased section 8 rental assistance 75227 units received s ection 202 rental assistance and 21646 units received section 811 rental assist ance in fy2005 congress provided over 5 billion for projectbased section 8 over 230 million for section 811 and over 740 million for section 20213 huds direct assistance programs can be both affected by disasters as well as used as tools in recovering from disaster s when public housing units are damaged hud can tap into an existing emergency cap ital reserve for private owners of hudassisted units insurance is often ava ilable to cover damage as are sba loans and hud loans discussed below hudassisted families displaced by disast er retain their ssistance displaced voucher holders are eligible to find another unit in which to use their vouchers for public housing and other projectbased assisted families hud identifies vacant hudassisted units to which they are eligible to relocate hud can also provide resources to non assisted households in other words households that were not previously r eceiving hud housing assistance prior to disaster vacant units of hud directa ssistance housing can be made available during disaster for nonassisted households in the past congress has also created special emergency shortterm vouchers th at can be used to provide temporary housing to displaced families flexible bl ock grants hud administers number of flexible bl ock grant programs that provide funds to states and localities the community development block grant cdbg program is the largest of these funde d at 49 billion in fy2005 cdbg funds are formulaallocated to states and local governments in support of 23 categories of eligible activities includi ng neighborhood revitalization economic development and housing activities seventy per cent of cdbg funds must be used on eligible activities and projects that principa lly benefit

must meet 25 match requirement and 90 of all assistance must primarily benefit familie s at or below 60 of the area median income for both home and cdbg grant ees must submit consolidated plans detailing how they intend to use funds to meet local needs hud also administers several other sp ecial purpose grants and block grants targeting special populations including th native american housing block grant the homeless assistance grants and the housing for persons with aids grants when communities are impacted by disa ster hud has the authority to waive many regulatory require ments governing the use of home and cdbg funds14 generally hud will issue such waivers and permit local communities to redirect home and cdbg funds to meet disaster r ecovery needs both short and longterm congress has also used cdbg and to smaller extent home as vehicles for providing emergency funds to co mmunities impacted by disasters mortgage programs while hud does not provide any direct mo rtgage loan programs the federal housing administration fha does provide both single and multifamily mortgage insurance these insurance programs provi security to lenders to encourage them to make loans on terms that would not otherwise be available to prospective homebuyers and to investors wishing to develop multifamily projects serving low and moderateincome families when the president declares disaster as in the case of hurricane katrina the declaration automatically triggers certain procedures with regard to fhainsured mortgages in the affected areas the procedures remain in effect for one year from the date of the declaration the followin g procedures become effective 1 moratorium on foreclosures is in effect for 90 days from th date of declaration 2 lenders are encouraged to offer speci forbearance mortgage modification refinancing and waiver of late charges to affected borrowers 3 families whose residences were destroyed or severely damaged are elig ible for 100 financing under section 203h of the nati onal housing act for the cost of reconstruction or replacement of the residences 4 damaged properties become eligible for section 203k financing under which the costs to purchase and to reha bilitate the property are included in one loan and hud waives th requirement that the property has been completed for more than one year prior to application for section 203k mortgage 5 the underwriting guidelines are relaxed to permit disaster vi ctims to qualify for loans even if their total monthly debt in cluding the proposed mortgage would equal 45 of gross income and 6 lenders are di rected to ensure that hazard claims are expeditiously filed and settle d and lenders may not retain hazard insurance proceeds to make up an existing arrearage wit hout the written consent of the borrowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33078crs6 the section 203h program is available for borrowe rs who already own homes in the affected area the loans are limited to the fha loan limit for the area subject to the provision that the loan may not ex ceed 100 of the appraised value of the property in some cases it may not be po ssible to obtain 100 financing it may often be the case that the cost to repair or replace the property exceeds the appraised value of the property this is the reas on that most lenders require borrowers to obtain hazard insurance that covers the replacement cost of the property instead of its appraised value the section 203k program permits bo rrowers who do not already own homes to purchase and rehabilitate properties in the area th at are either abandoned by owners or are being sold by owners who do not want to repair them and remain in the area the current fha underwriting guidelines provide that prospective borrowers total debt including the proposed mortgage payment may not exceed 41 of the borrowers gross monthly income in recogniti on of the fact that borrowers in these areas may have to incur debt to replace personal property the underwriting guidelines are relaxed to permit loans to borrowers whose total debt is up to 45 of gross monthly income the limit may even be exceeded if justified by compensating factors

to economic development and business assistance projects including those designed to promote job creation andor retention third priority is given to housing repair and development projects the plan

when the united states housing act of 1937 set forth housing policy for the nation it stated that the federal government should act where there is serious need that private citizens or groups cannot or are not addressing responsibly54 while the federal emergency management agency is the primary federal entity charged with responding to disaster hud is the primary entity charged with meeting the nations housing needs the ex act role that each agency is to play following disaster is not entirely clear fema assistance is available to meet range of housing needs from emergency shelte rs to trailers to home repair grants the review of past disasters included in this report shows that huds programs have primarily been used to provide longerter m housing aid such as rental vouchers and new housing construction as well as aid to communities to repair infrastructure and promote economic development in the months following 2005s hurricane katrina huds programs were not called on to play major role in responding to families housing needs femas response has b een met with criticism from observers including members of congress some of whom have called for an expansion of huds role as the focus shifts from respons to katrina to the inevitable review of that response the appropriate role for hud to play following disaster may be the subject of congressional debate
