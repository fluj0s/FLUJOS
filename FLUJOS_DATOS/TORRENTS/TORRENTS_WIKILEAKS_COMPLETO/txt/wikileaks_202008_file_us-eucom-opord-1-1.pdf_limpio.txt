provides guidance for planning implementation and execution of the useucom atfp program b area of concern 1 area of responsibility aor see useucom standard plan 4000 2 area of interest aoi countries

threat assessments published under separate cover d friendly forces 1 us cincassigned forces 2 us noncinc assigned forces 3 nato and other coalition forces 4 us political and diplomatic agencies and personnel assumptions 1 hostile elements may target dod personnel supporting personnel their families us installations and property hostile elements may target dod personnel or property for political criminal or other intentions these hostile elements may be indigenous to the host nation or may come from third party nations when dod elements andor personnel deploy on operations or exercises various hostile elements may look for opportunities to discredit the united states andor the host nation or simply seek to publicize their cause change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only 4 for official use only 2 dod elements and personnel also may be at risk of harm due to collateral damage when hostile element targets personnel or property of host nation or other foreign nationals residing in given host nation 3 dod elements and personnel cannot rely solely on host nation support to provide necessary force protection 4 terrorist attacks typically will be of brief duration for example terrorists will probably use hitandrun tactics with little or warning instead of prolonged encounter also terrorists usually will engage in extensive preattack surveillance of potential target implementing security measures to detect this type of activity will enhance opportunities to disrupt terrorist planning and contribute to thwarting terrorist attacks 5 implementation of atfp design standards will significantly reduce the risk of catastrophic loss of life when integrated with procedural measures into an overall installation atfp plan application of the atfp design standards alone will not prevent injury or loss of life from determined terrorist group but will reduce risk considerably and should be factored into aspects of atfp planning the impact of incorporating atfp design standards into construction projects will be significantly less than the unnecessary loss of life 6 individuals groups or countries opposed to the united states will use niprnet sources to obtain intelligence about the us military these actors also may attempt to infiltrate the siprnet and niprnet to disrupt or destroy information systems 2 mission on continual basis uscinceur executes comprehensive atfp program to provide an appropriate level of safety and security for all dod personnel their family members materiel facilities and equipment within the useucom aor and not otherwise under the security responsibility of the department of state consistent with operational mission accomplishment 3 execution intent my intent is to establish comprehensive and aggressive program to enhance the security of all dod personnel their families facilities and property against attack by terroristcriminal groups or individuals within our aor we will accomplish this by implementing atfp measures designed to 1 give local commanders operational control authority responsibility and support for force protection matters 2 deter attack by any terroristcriminal element through physical and operational security measures 3 ensure intelligence provides early warning of any change in the threat 4 ensure that procedures exist to respond to terrorist attack should it occur and 5 ensure all of our personnel understand the threat and their personal responsibilities in combating terrorism change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only 5 for official use only force protection is one of my highest priorities the potential for useucom forces to be exposed to terrorist activity is real the elements are present and given our current policy of active engagement the question is not if we will experience an attack against our forces but rather when thus every effort must be made to deter such an attack and force protection must become one of everyones highest priorities b the desired end state for our ongoing atfp efforts is safer environment in which our personnel can live and conduct their operational missions our most diligent efforts may not prevent determined terrorist attack however we will reduce the opportunity for such an attack and mitigate the effects of an attack should one occur c concept of operations hq useucom directs and implements atfp measures for cincassigned forces and certain designated noncinc assigned forces hq useucom coordinates atfp activities through the united states defense representative usdr with the com host nation police security and military forces atfp measures and activities protect dod elements and personnel from civil disturbances terroristcriminal activities and secure the facilities and equipment under our command and control the atfp program consists of the following key elements 1 plans operations and exercises the development of comprehensive and executable atfp plans for installations and us forces transiting the useucom aor the review and modification of atfp plans as required the incorporation of atfp into all operations and exercises 2 intelligencecounterintelligence the identification of threats information collection analysis of the threats and dissemination of threat information and warnings application of dod terrorist threat analysis methodology and establishment of terrorism threat levels 3 training and education the fostering of awareness vigilance and caution designation of trained antiterrorism officers ato training on how to deal with hostage and kidnap situations predeployment and aor specific training specialized training for personnel assigned to highrisk positions and billets 4 higher headquarters and locally conducted atfp program reviews and vulnerability assessmentsig inspectionsstaff assistance the continuing process of identifying atfp program shortfalls and enhancements inherent to this process is the establishment of mechanisms eg atfp working groups to assist in the coordinated development of atfp plans prioritizing requirements resourcing program improvements and resolving atfp issues 5 physical security based on risk assessments those measures designed to reduce vulnerabilities and provide baseline atfp posture milcon change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only 6 for official use only considerations the application of advanced technology and implementation of sound procedures are essential elements of an effective physical security program 6 terrorist force protection conditions this term also is referred to as simply force protection condition fpcon and was formerly known as threat conditions threatcon coordinated implementation of force protection conditions with mixture of protective measures tailored to the local environment key feature of this system is the use of random antiterrorism measures ram to introduce highly visible element of unpredictability into daytoday operations and activities 7 operations security opsec measures directed to protect security of communications systems information activities and personnel integrated into physical security and personal protection programs by limiting release of critical information unclassified and classified related to operations 8 interagency and interservice cooperation the sharing of information and intelligence resources and expertise with other us government elements in the aor 9 terrorist incident response measures those planned measures within each force protection condition designed to respond to broad range of terrorist threats including wmd the scope and extent of terrorist incident response measures will be expanded as threat levels andor force protection conditions increase measures will include the protection of personnel residing off of the installation or site 10 consequence management measures the wide range of emergency response and disaster preparedness actions designed to mitigate and recover from the effects of terrorist attack the full range of consequence management measures should include coordination with higher headquarters other us government agencies andor host nation authorities as

administration this opord supercedes uscinceur atfp opord 9901 the glossary contained in annex lists definitions of terms and acronyms 5 command and control with an aor comprised of 91 countries useucom is unique among the unified commands and management of atfp efforts from the headquarters in germany presents many diverse challenges exacerbating the effort is the complicated command structure in the aor with deployed useucom operational forces security assistance activities and numerous stovepipe organizations often functioning in the same vicinity the secdef has issued guidance and direction in dodd 200012 reference g to streamline the structure for atfp purposes by giving uscinceur tacon for force protection over all dod personnel and their dependents except those for whom the com retains security responsibility b in the development of cinccom moas there are several principles that apply in determining who should have security responsibility over dod elements and personnel in country 1 force protection is an inherent responsibility of command the commander on the ground must aggressively implement all reasonable measures to ensure the force protection of the members of hisher command 2 the chief of mission has the ultimate responsibility for noncinc assigned forces and the cinc has the ultimate responsibility for cinc assigned forces however under the terms of the doddos universal mou reference f the com and cinc may agree to change operational security responsibility based on whether the com or cinc forces are better situated to provide force protection coverage for the element or personnel in question b the organic force protection capabilities of the element or personnel in question c given the above factors the type of mission does it support the com or the cinc c essentially all dod elements and personnel in the aor fall under one of the following categories 1 cinc assigned forces and drus all service component command forces fall under the command of uscinceur through component commander jtf commander or the senior us military official within ctf this includes cocom opcon or supporting units specifically deployed with or in support of operations or exercises conducted by useucom through its components andor change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only 19 for official use only jtfctf uscinceur also is responsible for the force protection of drus for example medical flags medflag uscinceur will provide support for these forces using the best means available unless otherwise specified in the cinccom moa uscinceur retains full authority and responsibility for the protection of both cinc assigned forces and drus regardless of location or mission all theater clearances and tdy deployment orders must clearly indicate whether uscinceur or the com is responsible for force protection and specify local force protection contacts at the tdy site as required by the doddos universal mou reference f 2 dod elements and personnel under the security responsibility of com in the absence of cinccom moa the com is responsible for the security of all united states government usg personnel on official duty in given country in the useucom aor other than those dod elements and personnel under the command of uscinceur as specified in public law references through per the doddos universal mou reference f dod elements under com include the defense attaché offices us marine security guards and offices of defense cooperation odc when cinccom moa is in effect those dod elements and personnel listed in annex of the moa are under the security responsibility of the com the usdr is the primary military member responsible for coordination with the com and regional security officer rso in each country for security issues for each of these elements and personnel the useucom atfp program does not usurp the com authority and responsibility for security but rather facilitates and assists the com and rso in this task 3 noncinc assigned forces certain noncinc assigned forces stove piped organizations representing various dod agencies and activities may fall under uscinceur for force protection on casebycase basis uscinceur may assume responsibility for force protection of dod elements and personnel assigned or attached to various other operations or missions such as those under the united nations or north atlantic treaty organization nato normally the atfp responsibility for these forces and individuals will be based on geographic location the authority either the cinc or com who is best situated to provide force protection support oversight and command control will do so in most circumstances the service component command the lead component responsible for force protection at given location eg installation facility or encampment in the useucom aor will be responsible for noncinc assigned forces deployed to or stationed at that same location b under the provisions of an moa between uscinceur and the com for given country the appropriate usdr may be responsible for coordinating atfp for certain forces listed in annex b of the moa the usdr will coordinate any additional support requirements necessary to accomplish this task through ecj2 ecj4 only for turkey and ecj5 with ecsm change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only 20 for official use only c situations may arise where dod elements or personnel in given country are not listed explicitly in given moa or caa due to exercises tdys or intransit status thus all theater clearances and tdydeployment orders must clearly indicate whether uscinceur or the com is responsible for force protection d secdef has granted uscinceur tactical control tacon for force protection over those noncinc assigned elements and personnel for whom the uscinceur is responsible through the execution of cinccom moa uscinceur generally will delegate this authority to the appropriate subordinate commander who is best positioned to provide atfp support and oversight tacon for force protection consists of the following authority 1 enables uscinceur or designated representative to order implementation of force protection measures and to exercise authority over all security programs governed by the doddos universal mou and respective cinccom moas 2 authorizes uscinceur or designated representative to change modify prescribe and enforce force protection measures for all dod elements and personnel under the cinc for force protection tacon for force protection includes the authority to inspectassess security requirements to direct dod activities to identify the resources required to correct deficiencies and to submit budget requests to parent organizations to fund identified corrections 3 uscinceur also may direct immediate force protection measures including temporary relocation and departure when in his judgment such measures must be accomplished without delay to ensure the safety of the dod elements or personnel involved individuals assigned to nato billets 1 individuals are either on temporary duty with or permanently assigned to the us military delegation to nato the nato international military staff shape and other such nato billets fall under the security responsibility of the com for the country where they are permanently assigned the cinc and com can agree to transfer force protection responsibility through cinccom moa 2 through the execution of cinccom moa whenever the cinc accepts responsibility over individuals assigned to nato billets within particular nato element he will delegate tacon for force protection to an appropriate local commander normally through service component command 3 the appropriate command will coordinate atfp requirements with the most senior individual assigned to the nato element in question this senior individual will act as the representative for all other dod personnel assigned to the nato element in question this representative will coordinate any atfp issues and requirements change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only 21 for official use only through hisher nato chain of command if issues arise where local command command having force protection responsibility for individuals assigned to nato billets atfp requirements come into conflict with nato elements requirements every effort will be made to resolve locally any incompatibilities having an adverse impact on force protection if unsuccessful the representative should raise the incompatibilities through the appropriate chain of command for resolution f dod elements or personnel assigned to nato organizations us forces assigned to nato are first assigned cocom or opcon to uscinceur these forces are then assigned nato opcon to nato commanders through the transfer of authority toa process whenever placed under the command and control of nato us forces have two chains of authorityresponsibility with respect to force protection it is incumbent upon the us commander of these forces to implement us doduseucom atfp standards 1 uscinceur has delegated opcon of us forces to component commanders who may further delegate to subordinate commanders thus the local commanders have atfp responsibility for those forces us commanders under the command and control of nato are still required to follow all applicable us rules and regulations pertaining to force protection for their personnel 2 as nato commanders the us commanders have nato opcon similar to us tacon of their forces and thus have the authority to accomplish specific tasks that are usually limited by function time andor location to deploy the units concerned and to retain or assign tactical control of those units nato opcon does not include the authority to assign separate employment of components of the units nor does it include administrative or logistic control 3 us commanders who are dualhatted as nato commanders must follow uscinceur rules and regulations pertaining to force protection for opcon of us units to the extent it is consistent with uscinceur requirements dualhatted commanders should provide the force protection required by nato for nato opcon units when these two sets of requirements are incompatible dualhatted commanders have the responsibility to implement the standards that provide the greatest security for us forces consistent with mission accomplishment in addition every effort will be made by commands to resolve locally any incompatibilities having an adverse impact on force protection if unsuccessful raise the incompatibilities

intelligence to uscinceur atfp opord 0101 1 dod terrorist threat analysis thorough analysis of the threat is critical to understanding the antiterrorism force protection atfp concerns the threat analysis process results in the implementation of atfp plans and the allocation and expenditure of force protection resources in addition threat analysis provides the intelligence officer with information upon which to base warnings ecj2 in consultation with the dia embassy staffs and applicable hostnation authorities obtains analyzes and reports information specific to the useucom aor in order for atfp elements to take action to protect assets b the primary sources of intelligence information for the dod combating terrorism program are government sources open source materials commercial news media criminal information and local information 2 dod threat analysis methodology dod developed methodology to assess the terrorist threat to dod personnel facilities materiel and interests dod is the only user of this methodology other us government departments and agencies may apply their own analytical methodology to form their own terrorist threat analyses this methodology does not address threats from conventional forms ie hostile conventional armed forces in addition this methodology does not address the criminal threat if unrelated to known or suspected terrorist activity the dod terrorism threat level assessment methodology uses all source analysis the system is flexible and threat levels are revised as terrorism indicators warnings and activities occur or change b dod identifies four factors to use in shaping the collection and analysis of information from all sources bearing on the terrorist threat the factors in making terrorist threat analyses are applied on countrybycountry basis 1 operational capability how dangerous are terrorists in this country 2 intentions how threatening are the terrorists in this country 3 activity what type of activity are the terrorists engaged in 4 operating environment how do circumstances impede or constrain terrorist operations 3 terrorism threat levels change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only b22 for official use only the dod terrorist threat analysis community developed notation system to describe the countryspecific results of terrorist threat analysis based on the terrorism threat analysis methodology briefly described above though general terrorism threat level is given for each country the actual terrorist threat in that country may vary from region to region based on the modus operandi of existing groups b dod uses four step scale to describe the severity of the threat as judged by intelligence analysts these four steps from highest to lowest are 1 terrorism threat level high antius terrorist group is operationally active and uses large casualtyproducing attacks as its preferred modus operandi there is substantial dod presence and the operating environment favors terrorists 2 terrorism threat level significant antius terrorists are operationally active and attack personnel as their preferred method of operation or group uses large casualtyproducing attacks as its preferred method but has limited operational activity the operating environment is neutral 3 terrorism threat level moderate terrorists are present but there is indication of antius activity possible collateral threat the operating environment favors the host nationus 4 terrorism threat level low terrorist group detected or terrorist group activity is nonthreatening c terrorism threat levels describe the terrorist threat environment in country or region where terrorist activity occurs with distinct definitions for each threat level threat levels are assigned based on analyzing available intelligence d terrorism threat levels do not specify given force protection condition terrorism threat levels do not allocate protective resources threat levels do not address when the terrorist attack will occur the issuance of terrorism threat levels is not warning notice in and of itself formal terrorism warning reports are issued separately see paragraph 4b below changes in terrorism threat level declarations analysis of terrorism is an ongoing process although each analysis relies on information included in previous assessments judgments with respect to threats to dodaffiliated personnel facilities and assets begin anew with each analysis formal escalation ladder of terrorism threat levels exists terrorism threat level designations for each country or region are applied on the basis of current information and analysis 4 dissemination of threat warnings change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only b23 for official use only the threat warning report replaces the previous critical threat level it is intended to expedite warning and to be treated as distinct from threat level change terrorist threat warning is accomplished in dod using two mechanisms the intelligence community system issues fully coordinated terrorist threat alerts and terrorist threat advisories the services are accorded the opportunity to comment upon proposed warnings the services direct their responses through dia the agency representing the dod in the structure the executive coordinator community counterterrorism board is responsible for coordinating threat warnings outside conus the fbi is responsible for coordinating and issuing intelligence community warnings for threats in conus b the dods defense indications and warning system diws comprises second independent system in which members at any level may initiate unilateral threat warnings these are termed terrorism warning reports twrs warnings within the dod system generally stay within the system and are primarily for use of dod activities diws terrorist threat warning reports may be prepared and issued by any member of the diws system 1 individual commands also have the right to independently notify their members of impending threats if an intelligence activity receives information leading to an assessment of an imminent terrorist attack it may exercise its right to issue unilateral warning to its units installations or personnel identified as targets for the attack if an intelligence activity issues unilateral warning it must label threat information disseminated as unilateral judgment and should inform dia of its action 2 terrorism warnings are issued when specificity of targeting and timing exist or when analysts determine sufficient information indicates us personnel facilities or interests particularly those of dod are being targeted for attack terrorism warnings need not be country specific and warning can cover an entire region the key to effective terrorism warnings is the terrorism analyst recognizing the preincident indicators for an attack are present see also annex b appendix 4 blue dart program 3 diws terrorism warning reports are specific products they are unambiguousit is clear to the recipients they are being warned warnings are intended for distribution up down and laterally through the chain of commandnot just downward warnings of impending terrorist activity are likely to have national implications and will be provided routinely to decision makers at the policy level of the us government 5 host nationnato intelligence sharing whenever possible intelligence producers must consider user needs many installationsactivities work closely with their host nation counterparts either as the primary or secondary means of installationactivity security in addition number of installationsactivities are home to combined operations or headquarters such as nato or even the change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only b24 for official use only whenever possible intelligence and threat warning producers should classify material to allow for use by the host nation or nato eg secretrel nato or secretrel ukgeit providing unclassified tear lines to share as much of the threat data as possible will also increase interoperability as we address the security risk b intelligence consumers if document is marked secret unless something exists allowing release through the foreign disclosure process only us access is authorized if it is releasable to another country or nato the appropriate markings would have to be applied in order to properly release it if not so marked and you have need to release the intelligence outside of us channels you must go to the originator of the information to determine whether it can be released 6 department of state dos threat assessments and threat levels dos publishes an important series of useful threat assessments to dod atfp program managers but should not be confused with the assessments and terrorism threat levels resulting from the dod threat analysis methodology b under the provisions of the diplomatic security act of 1986 22 usc 4804 4 the bureau of diplomatic security ds has specific statutory responsibility and authority for conducting threat analysis programs on behalf of dos as part of these ongoing programs ds updates and publishes on semiannual basis security environment threat list setl reflecting threat levels for all active foreign service posts permanently staffed by directhire us personnel and noncombatant command us military elements operating under the authority of chief of mission com the setl may also reflect threat levels for some select foreign service posts where operations have been temporary suspended or closed but where threat levels continue to be relative to certain ds programs c the dos threat assessment process evaluates allsource information relative to six broad threat categories then determines corresponding threat levels each of the six categories is assigned threat level for specific post the following describes the dos threat categories and reflects the appropriate classification level when the designated threat level is associated with specific post or posts by name 1 transnational terrorism sensitive but unclassified sbu 2 indigenous terrorism sensitive but unclassified sbu 3 political violence includes

ds management in prioritizing overseas security programs and ensuring the effective allocation of resources that are applied to ospb overseas security policy board interagency coordinated standards 1 the setl reflects an evaluation of threat levels for particular period of time and these levels may be raised or lowered during scheduled reviews as situations change the setl does not attempt to reflect the daytoday security environment of given locality but rather is intended to provide longerterm picture for planning and resource allocation force protection purposes 2 dos has the capability to immediately warn personnel under com authority of specific terrorist threats in instances when dosds deems threat information to warrant an immediate response dos will commit security resources as necessary to deal with particular situations regardless of the assigned setl threat levels 3 dos threat levels are the result of post inputs and coordination within diplomatic security dos and other usg agencies at the national level exactly which agencies are consulted varies according to the threat category however as the setl is intended to assist dosdiplomatic security for planning and operational purposes the final arbiter for disputed threat levels is the director of diplomatic security 7 double standard the us government has adopted policy of double standard terrorist threat warning may not be issued solely to personnel in the us government if the general public is included in or can be construed to be part of terrorist targeting terrorist threat warnings may be issued

use only appendix 4 blue dart program to annex b intelligence to uscinceur atfp opord 0101 1 general blue dart is an antiterrorismforce protection atfp threatwarning program designed to rapidly disseminate threat information as fast as possible directly to affected areas and units in simple easy to understand format the program covers all useucom subordinate and tenant units as well as other official us sponsored organizations in the aor the program also applies to nato and allied units operating under us auspices and other nonmilitary us organizations including us embassies blue dart is commandwide program and dissemination of blue dart warning messages will not be limited to intelligence channels b any unit or entity covered by the program can initiate blue dart because blue dart warnings are designed to provide actionable timecritical warning to threatened units useucom developed specific set of criteria information must meet in order to be issued as blue dart this information must contain specific threatened location unit and means of threat and must be applicable within specific neartime frame specificity is the key principle of this program if information cannot be used to provide specific actionable warning it will not be treated as blue dart however in order to ensure timely warning information included in blue dart does not need to be validated or confirmed before transmission this approach may result in the passing of some erroneous information but some false reporting is accepted in order to ensure timely warning of specific threats c blue dart requires two forms of notification immediate voice notification by telephone or radio directly to the targeted unit or installation ensures threat information is passed by the fastest means possible and provides immediate feedback from the receiving unit thereby confirming its reception and interpretation followup notification is then accomplished through appropriate message handling systems according to useucom guidelines initial voice notification must be completed within 10 minutes of threat information reception throughout repeated exercises and numerous realworld situations useucom has demonstrated the ability to meet this timeline and averages approximately 2 minutes d hq useucom ecj23 intelligence operations center ioc exercises overall staff proponent for the blue dart program in coordination with ecsm the ioc is responsible for implementing blue dart warnings conducting quarterly tests of the system and providing feedback to ecj23 to establish and adjust the theaterwide threat warning policy for all systems to include blue dart ecsm is responsible for providing guidance regarding prescriptive measures for reacting to blue dart and other threat warnings scope of program change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only b42 for official use only 1 blue dart applies to real world and blue dart exercise imminent threat warning 2 broadcast of blue dart reports is preferred for widest dissemination 3 priority should be given to the threatened units within 10 minutes of receipt of the initial warning information 4 immediate upand crossechelon reporting is required to ensure commanders have information on which to base guidance and assistance to threatened subordinate units 5 in general blue dart messages should not be held while information contained in them is verified some false alarms may be reported without this verification nevertheless some level of false reporting is accepted to guarantee rapid reporting 6 feedback is requested both on realworld and exercise messages 7 imminent threat warning reports not containing the words blue dart but meeting blue dart reporting criteria should be disseminated immediately as blue dart warning reports 8 blue dart is meant for timecritical threat warning of specific nature warnings not conveying an imminent threat and identifying specific unit ship or location generally should not be reported as blue dart unless an incident suggests followon threats are likely and imminent 9 any unit in receipt of information meeting blue dart criteria is required to immediately initiate blue dart warning report 10 examples threat report with specific threatened location eg tuzla ab specific threatened unit eg tf eagle specific threat means eg car bomb attack against checkpoint within specific nearterm time frame eg at 2300z or within the next two hours or some combination of these normally would be reported as blue dart b report of general threat to troops without location time frame or means would not be blue dart change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only b43 for official use only c report of an individual or isolated incident explosion sniper fire that has already taken place would not normally be reported as blue dart unless it is believed more incidents are about to follow d examples of what should or should not be blue dart cannot be all inclusive ultimately we must rely on the judgment of our watch standers analysts and operators overuse of the term blue dart will diminish its usefulness as means of imminent threat warning however when in doubt erring on the side of using the term blue dart is recommended terrorism threat warning not meeting blue dart criteria will be disseminated iaw normal procedures 2 execution threat dissemination 1 initial warning blue dart warnings will be passed to the targeted unit by the fastest means possible unclassified communications may be used but only when nonsecure means are unavailable or judged too slow component intelligence organizations and deployed task forces will establish written procedures to ensure timely introduction of blue dart threat warning to command and control nets while continuing to relay information via intelligence nets operational organizations will execute blue dart procedures and inform supporting intelligence organizations when they identify threat information meeting blue dart criteria this allows further dissemination of information and provides focused intelligence support to the problem 2 subsequent reports after initial voice notification to the targeted unit the organization originating blue dart will followup with flash precedence record message traffic up its chain to hq useucom including jac molesworth and all pertinent theater component watches and intelligence elements b installation and unit procedures each command with access to communications is responsible for establishing local procedures and watch standards for passing blue dart threat warning information procedures will address dissemination to lower adjacent and higher units c command center procedures tactical and fixed command centers at all levels are responsible for creating or modifying local procedures and training watch standers to carry out blue dart guidance command centers at all echelons will maintain the capability to execute blue dart warnings and have checklists in place to facilitate the rapid dissemination of blue dart messages imminent threat warning information must be passed immediately up down and crossechelon on assigned command nets the first priority is to the threatened units however reports must be passed up and crossechelon as well as downechelon to ensure responsible commanders and headquarters have information on which to base further guidance and assistance change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only b44 for official use only d protection of classified information classified threat warning information will be protected to the maximum extent possible consistent with the need to inform threatened units within 10 minutes of receipt of the initial blue dart warning message certain sensitive sources of information if compromised would be irreplaceable potentially leading to significant degradation of intelligence to the supported commander despite this risk of loss nothing in this guidance overrides units responsibility to report information critical to the protection and survival of us and allied forces by the most expedient secure means where immediately available or by the most expedient means when secure means are not immediately available redundant communications voice and message dissemination are necessary to ensure timely delivery of imminent threat warning information followup initial reporting with hard copy record message email or fax messages when blue dart warning is carried out via voice send voice reports to followup and to confirm receipt of initial reporting when is carried out via message email or data link such as voice alert upon receipt of tibs or tdds information displaying the location of specific threat use broadcast wherever possible to ensure widest dissemination in the shortest time 3 administration and logistics commanders are responsible for immediately informing uscinceur via the chainofcommand of equipment or procedural shortfalls that would prevent execution of provisions of this guidance 4 command and control secure telephone or secure radio if available will be used for the immediate voice notification if secure means is not available then nonsecure telephone or radio may be used the follow up will be sent via hard copy message 5 blue dart exercise procedures hq useucom ecj23 intelligence operations center ioc watch will exercise blue dart procedures quarterly to maintain awareness and proficiency theater exercise messages will be sent only with the express permission of hq useucom ioc who will coordinate the action with other appropriate staff elements eg ecj3 etcc ecsm etc the ioc will identify an exercise opr to initiate the theater exercise by originating message from field unit headquarters or supporting intelligence center in or out of theater test considerations are as follows 1 exercise messages will be sent from variety of locations based on notional intelligence collection from different sources humint imint sigint etc 2 exercise messages are intended to be received by variety of units to ensure circuits and procedures function properly change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only b45 for official use only 3 exercise messages will not contain any scenario information this will preclude an exercise message being accidentally accepted as valid threat 4 exercises messages will be unclassified preventing compromise of classified information should nonsecure circuits be used to pass the exercise message b immediately acknowledge receipt of the blue dart message to the sender the ultimate recipient of the warning will report back to useucom headquarters within two hours the time received from whom and by what means report back by siprnet to j2watcheucomsmilmil sci email to useucom iochqeucomic gov via coastline tan isso or issp or message to hq useucom vaihingen geecj23ecj23iocetcc with information copy to hq useucom vaihingen ge ecj2ecj3ecj6ecsm provide information copies to others in chain of

terminate exercise blue dart unquote and repeat the call all units involved in the exercise report back to useucom headquarters as described in paragraph c above the information collected up to exercise termination the unit terminating the exercise is also to provide the reason for exercise termination d example exercise message fmto exercise exercise exercise u subj exercise blue dart xxx99 pass this exercise message to exercise exercise exercise component and other theater units may initiate internal threat notification exercises as part of their training programs however only the ioc may initiate or approve blue dart exercise due to the required coordination to involve theater resources if component or other subordinate theater unit wishes to conduct blue dart exercise they must coordinate it with the ioc and receive the iocs approval minimum of two weeks before conducting the exercise change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only b46 for official use only 6 there should never be confusion about whether blue dart is real or an exercise four things distinguish the exercise message from the realworld one exercise blue dart in the subject line b an exercise number in the subject line c the word exercise three times before and three times after the text and d only passing instructions in the text scenario realworld blue dart contains specific threat additional words in the subject line or message such as tipper or warning do not change the fact that the message is realworld blue dart 7 to date it is unproven blue dart reports have prevented any casualties however the program is having the intended consequences service members stop what they are doing and pay attention because taking immediate action might save life single instance of this programs prevention

antiterrorismforce protection atfp planning training and equipment requirements are critical to mission success deploying units must consider atfp an integral part of the mission not an afterthought the requirements for exercises and operations are very similar except exercises usually have the luxury of longer planning process operations require the same type of planning but with the planning cycle condensed into days or possibly hours each operation or exercise has different requirements and challenges 2 mission to provide definitive guidance regarding atfp considerations for commands and units deploying forces within the useucom aor 3 execution scheme of support this appendix provides guidance and establishes atfp planning responsibilities for forces deploying to conduct operations exercises or training in the useucom aor the guidance is general in nature and designed so that units can adapt it to particular deployment tab to this appendix lists minimum training and equipment requirements for any deployment within the useucom aor b tasks to subordinate units 1 commanders of the service components task forces joint task forces combined task forces and deploying units down to battalion squadron and ship level controlling participating in or supporting an operation or exercise are responsible for ensuring an antiterrorism officer ato is appointed to serve as the subject matter expert on atfp matters for the command smaller units eg company flight must also meet this requirement when deploying without their higher headquarters unless deploying as subordinate element to unit that will have an ato 2 ensure the ato is trained to employ methods to reduce risk or mitigate the effects of terrorist attack the ato must also be familiar with predeployment atfp training requirements assignment as the ato may be collateral or additional duty for the individual appointed 3 ensure the ato has attended an approved level ii atfp course of instruction prior to the deployment note commanders in the grade of 06 or above may waive this requirement for period to exceed six months if they appoint an individual who has had formal atfp training andor experience in unitindividual protection programs eg military police security forces special agents commanders change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only c12 for official use only may continue to waive formal level ii training for personnel who only provide level i training given they have sufficient background and experience 4 consider deploying the ato early in the flow of deploying forces to execute atfp tasks which are requisite to the deployment eg site survey assessment coordination of security requirements with host nation typically useucom deploys eucom survey and assessment team esat to conduct an initial onscene assessment of the area of operations the esat will assess and report atfp requirements for the operation 5 ensure proper atfp planning occurs and is executed properly specific planning factors vary with each operation but the following represent basic issues to consider based on the nature of the operational mission develop prioritized list of atfp factors for site selectionsurvey teams use these criteria to determine if facilities either currently occupied or under consideration for occupancy by dod personnel can adequately protect occupants against terrorist attack b do not assume existing or host units at the site automatically will provide atfp likewise do not assume the host nation will provide adequate security all deployed dod elements should have some type of inherent security capability based on the mission as well as the type and level of threat at the deployment location deploying units may have to bring security forces or equipment and must take this into account when planning lift and support requirements close coordination between the deploying force and hq useucom is required to ensure all atfp requirements are rapidly determined c atfp requirements must be factored into time phased force deployment data tpfdd planning lift requirements and timing the arrival of atfp assets may impact adversely on mission capability if not carefully planned c coordinating instructions 1 host nation restrictions and sensitivities may limit atfp options therefore early coordination with the usdr should be affected to resolve issues 2 by their nature contingency operations are time constrained and each operation has unique challenges atfp should be factored into the planning process from the beginning atfp guidance must appear in all warning planning alert deployment or execute orders 3 regardless of the nature of an operation or exercise it is incumbent upon the parent command to ensure that all deploying personnel are properly

within geographical areas based on the assessed terrorist threat for that area 3 when terrorist threat against dod interests in particular area of useucom affects more than one service component commander the useucom deputy commanderinchief dcinceur is responsible to ensure uniform military response to the threat 4 force protection conditions normally are based on terrorist threat assessments produced by assigned or supporting terrorism intelligence analysts combined with determination of hostnation authorities and componentbaseunit capabilities to implement and sustain security measures and the overall impact of the atfp measures upon the organizations mission however the terrorism threat level does not dictate the specific force protection condition to assume commanders are responsible for force protection condition declarations and should consider the value of particular areas installationssites and facilities as targets along with any special vulnerabilities 5 each force protection condition is designed to produce detection assessment and response capability commensurate with the existing terrorist threat escalating the force protection condition should enhance these capabilities and send clear signal of increased readiness 6 tab to this appendix describes security measures associated with each force protection condition these measures are the minimum for

commissary complexesisolated activity buildings commanders should consider these measures when developing local installation force protection condition measures and physical security plans 2 concept commanders can increase security and reduce the opportunity for hostile agent to exploit known vulnerabilities by implementing some low cost procedures as well as applying programmatic solutions prior to implementing any of these strategies commanders should review existing assessment reports or conduct supplemental vulnerability assessment to identify the most vulnerable points of given facility 3 low costprocedural measures g71g20establish regular high visibility security patrols of the facilities should if possible include host nation assets g71g20conduct increased random antiterrorism

annex provides an overview of the potential use of wmd by terrorists and broad guidance implementing useucom prescriptive atfp program for official use only c32 for official use only standard 10 see annex m appendix 1 wmd include biological and chemical agents or material plant and animal toxins radiological material nuclear devices and high yield explosives used as weapons against personnel animals plants material or facilities 2 wmd planning considerations general the threat of terrorist use of wmd poses great challenges for military organizations previous concerns regarding wmd use focused on battlefield employment against warned and protected military personnel the threat has expanded in recent years as terrorist organizations have grown in sophistication and now have the ability to acquire and employ wmd this growing threat now means units must plan for the possible use of wmd against peacetime forces and noncombatants b existing military doctrine addresses the use of chemical biological radiological nuclear and high yield explosive cbrne weapons and their effects on personnel and facilities planning factors for battlefield use of these weapons may have direct application when planning for terrorist use of wmd list of current publications that address cbrne weapons their effects and planning factors is provided as references in the basic order and this appendix table c31 below summarizes planning considerations in existing doctrinal publications on the use of cbrne weapons table c31 doctrinal nbc planning considerations considerations include contamination avoidance contamination control detection and warning identification and marking and passive defense measures protection individual protection and collective protection decontamination immediate operational and thorough decontamination medical aspects treatment interventioncountermeasures and casualty evacuation and handling other considerations dod dependents civilians and contractors host nation and multinational forces and personnel 3 potential threat of terrorist use of wmd the potentially devastating effects of terrorist use of wmd mandates that organizations conduct thorough analysis of the threat in their aor the unique aspects of the terrorist capability to acquire and employ wmd should be considered as distinct element of the overall threat assessment b the useucom proponent for wmd efforts is ecj5 ecj2 in conjunction with ecj5 will establish an integrated collection and analysis program that draws detailed threat data from all available sources to support command wmd efforts c collection plans should address the essential elements of information eei of the terrorist capability to acquire and use of wmd eeis should be integrated into for official use only c33 for official use only subordinate elements collection plans and reviewed as new or evolving threats emerge the plan should consider terrorist threats from commercial industrial and medical source material as well as traditional military cbrne weapons and agents d new or changing terrorist capabilities to acquire or employ wmd must be rapidly disseminated through command channels units should include procedures for immediate reporting of changing terrorist threats or actual use of wmd notification should be sent through the chain of command as outlined in annex c appendix 2 4 vulnerability assessments of terrorist use of wmd organizations will assess the vulnerability of installations facilities and personnel in their aor to terrorist use of wmd vulnerability assessments will be based on the threat assessments and application of the guidance and procedures in annex m appendix 2 b as minimum assessments should include information from intelligence logistics medical physical security facility engineering meteorological explosive ordnance disposal and cbrne staff elements the entire range of potential terrorist wmd use should be considered when conducting assessments as previously mentioned threats from commercial chemical biological nuclear and radiological sources should be included as well as traditional military agents examples of possible vulnerabilities could include g71g20individual protective clothing and equipment g71g20collective protection equipment and facilities g71g20medical response and emergency services capability g71g20training of personnel g71g20physical security and protective barriers g71g20facility design and construction g71g20early warning and detection g71g20alarms and attack warning g71g20threat intelligence g71g20sustainment operations and follow on support g71g20preventive medicine and vaccination programs g71g20storage of bulk hazardous material g71g20explosive ordnance disposal response capabilityavailability 5 consequence management mitigation of terrorist use of wmd units and installations will take appropriate measures to protect personnel and facilities and reduce their vulnerability to terrorist use of wmd mitigating the consequences of the actual terrorist use of wmd is critical to reducing the loss of life and property this includes actions taken prior to use as well as actions taken subsequent to the attack actions may be physical security improvements such as for official use only c34 for official use only installing an integrated large area siren and warning system or procedural improvements such as exercising and validating the wmd emergency response annex or plan b as part of the overall installationactivity atfp plan commanders should address the wmd threat and exercise the wmd part of the plan to determine its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of an attack in addition to providing crisis action and consequence management procedures planning should include preattack measures and consideration for the collateral damage wmd may have on adjacent facilities and surrounding communities plans should provide sufficient detail to permit organizations to rapidly recognize and respond to any terrorist event using wmd c the following contains additional crisis action planning considerations that should be included in addressing terrorist use of wmd 1 commanders estimate of the potential for use of wmd this forms the basis for all facts and assumptions that drive the planning and preparation for any use of wmd by potential threat organizations as such the commanders estimate is the cornerstone of any successful program and must be reviewed frequently to incorporate any new or emerging threats 2 typenumber of threats accurate identification of the wmd threats posed by terrorist organizations provides mechanism to determine the resources needed to counter the threat and respond effectively if they are used planners should also factor in the magnitude and diversity of the threats throughout an aor 3 most likelymost vulnerable targets most organizations cant provide total protection for all personnel and facilities in their aor however identification of the most likely and vulnerable targets enables more detailed planning which then drives responsible organizations to improve security measures further responsible organizations can take measures to improve the security for these areas 4 target value analysis certain areas pose different challenges due to their specific value to terrorists these targets may not be mission related or of high military value but their value to terrorists may be very high because of inherent vulnerabilities and the potential for mass casualties high use areas such as shopping facilities or office complexes have inherent problems with access control and usually have large concentrations of unprotected personnel present special analysis and planning should be done to help reduce the vulnerability of these types of areas 5 coordination with local authorities coordination with local authorities is essential when planning for terrorist wmd use it is likely that an attack on either the dod facility or the local civilian populace will affect both communities dispersion of the agent effects by environmental factors wind water or animals can quickly spread to surrounding areas thorough coordination between dod organizations and local officials provides means to improve the response time and offers the opportunity to for official use only c35 for official use only share critical resources needed to mitigate the effects of an attack these arrangements should be formalized in memoranda of agreement with local officials 6 attack recognition and agent characterization unless prior warning is obtained of an impending attack most organizations will not have automatic detection devices and alarms in operation attack recognition may come only when symptoms first appear in exposed personnel agent identification will probably be done by first responders or medical personnel planning must address this potential vulnerability and incorporate procedures that include adequate training individual protective equipment and detection equipment for first responders and minimize the delay from attack initiation until detection 7 warning systems because wmd attacks can cover large areas timely warning can reduce the number of personnel who would otherwise be exposed to agent effects combination of outdoor warning sirens telephonic notification and broadcast announcements provide redundant warning systems that will reach large portion of the population special consideration should be given to unique populations such as the visually or hearing impaired to ensure effective warning systems are in place to provide for their safety 8 response levels different agents require different responses plans should include details on the appropriate response for the agents identified in commanders assessment and the equipment needed to implement that level of response 9 hazardous material response teams host nation laws and directives may contain specific requirements for personnel responding to hazardous material and substances commanders must be aware of these requirements and emergency responders must have the equipment and training necessary to protect themselves treat casualties and decontaminate the site planning should include adequate time and resources to ensure response teams have the appropriate equipment and level of training 10 reporting procedures because of the sensitivity of terrorist use of wmd many agencies require formatted reports on the nature of the event plans should include preformatted templates for reporting requirements and message addresses and phone numbers for the agencies and commands that must be notified communications can rapidly overload available communications means during crisis brevity codes established crisis action communication procedures and predetermined local reporting requirements will all assist in the management of crisis by providing timely and accurate information to the emergency operations center the procedures for reporting terrorist incidents in annex c appendix 2 should be used as guide for reporting wmd incidents 11 crisis action team responsibilities emergency operations centers normally have only small staff on duty and will require immediate augmentation when an attack occurs staff elements should be fully trained and prepared to implement the for official use only c36 for official use only appropriate plan to reduce the effects of the wmd attack it may be necessary to operate in protective equipment during the initial stages of the crisis training on the use of protective equipment and their specific duties as part of the emergency operations center staff should be regularly exercised to maintain proficiency in crisis action responsibilities 12 first responder responsibilities first responders will be called on to perform many critical functions during wmd attack law enforcement fire medical explosive ordnance disposal and facility engineer teams will usually be some of the first organizations to react to an event careful planning and training is needed to address the special needs of these groups the actions they take during the initial stages of an event will have very important impact on the consequence management steps that follow 13 medical support treatment and transportation requirements prior coordination with host nation medical facilities is necessary to ensure medical plans include procedures to treat and care for contaminated or infected personnel medical teams require special training in the treatment and handling of contaminated casualties and remains medical facilities should have areas designated to treat and segregate contaminated patients preventive medicine specialists and pathologists need to have database of naturally occurring diseases and procedures to quickly assess and identify suspicious illnesses and diseases antidotes and treatments for potential agents from commercial or industrial sources should be considered in the casualty management plan contaminated patient transport and contamination control measures should be incorporated into litter and ambulance operations 14 temporary shelters evacuation routes and care centers there will always be requirement to clear an area and provide orderly evacuation to safe areas when wmd is used temporary shelters evacuation routes and care centers should be identified during the planning process commanders should identify facilities for potential use in defense against chemical radiological and biological agents existing facilities may be suitable for adaptation as temporary shelterstoxicfree areas since sufficient collective protection resources may be inadequate law enforcement and security personnel need to determine traffic control points to facilitate evacuation and prevent personnel from entering potentially contaminated areas copies of the routes and locations of care centers should be available to installation workers and residents 15 public affairs the demand for information from the public and the media will be intense at the onset of an event public affairs planning should include background information on the potential agents and materials that pose threat basic information on the properties effects treatment duration and decontamination of likely threat agents should be included in the public affairs reference materials brought to the emergency operations center and joint information center rapid and accurate information on the hazard during the early stages of an event will assist in protecting civilians from hazard and foster confidence in the commands ability to safely manage the crisis for official use only c37 for official use only 16 crime scene procedures for agent material terrorist use of any wmd material is criminal act local plans should include procedures to control crime scene in contaminated environment and provide for the recovery of evidence that may be hazardous these plans also should include procedures that are required under host nation laws or status of forces agreements 17 follow on assistance any wmd event may generate the requirement for some form of external support or assistance plans should determine the type amount and time frame for followon assistance the logistics of managing large contingent of external support organizations has the potential of overwhelming the ability of the local commander to control its effective employment 18 hazard prediction when an event occurs there is an immediate need to predict the size of the potential hazard zone reports from first responders will contain the location of the incident site but the initial estimate of the hazard area should be made by emergency operations center personnel procedures should be incorporated into emergency operations centers that allow for quick initial hazard prediction and methods for its rapid dissemination detailed predictions can be made when more information is provided on the agent type and dissemination means 19 meteorological support as indicated above hazard prediction must be done quickly current and reliable weather data is critical to providing accurate hazard predictions updated weather data should be routinely provided to emergency operations centers so that it is available at the onset of an event organizations providing data should be part of the planning process so they can develop weather products that support hazard prediction models or programs 20 contamination control containing and limiting the spread of contamination is essential in reducing the effects of wmd attack procedures for personnel responding to the attack site should include methods that minimize their direct contact with contaminated material work crews should use sumps to collect runoff from decontamination operations access into the site should be through designated points and along designated routes 21 decontamination and hot line operations decontamination procedures should be developed using the resources locally available decontaminating exposed personnel first responders and site work teams requires the rapid establishment of decontamination site plans should consider the requirement to maintain decontamination operations for extended periods and the potentially large personnel and logistics need generated to support this type of operation 22 sampling and analysis sampling will be required at the attack site and in the predicted hazard areas to establish the presence or absence of contamination plans should include procedures to determine sampling requirements and protocols for the collection of agent material to include procedures for maintaining chain of for official use only c38 for official use only custody analysis of samples may be done locally at the onset of an attack but may be shipped offsite for confirmation or for detailed analysis if local facilities cannot identify the material 23 monitoring operations monitoring plans should include procedures to deploy detection equipment to known or suspected hazard locations detection equipment intended for military tactical level employment does not detect agent concentrations that are considered hazardous by the epa and the occupational safety and health administration environmental and safety planners must be aware of the hazardous material exposure limits for civilian populations and understand the limitations of using military equipment to determine when areas are considered free of contamination 24 reentry and remediation operations preliminary planning should address the considerations for these operations reentry includes actions required to permit personnel to safely enter an area following an attack remediation includes actions to remove all contamination from the site and restore the environment to its original condition both of these processes can potentially take several days to weeks to complete external support will probably be needed to ensure these tasks are properly accomplished 25 training requirements training programs should provide comprehensive approach to meeting the needs identified in mitigation efforts actions required to reduce the vulnerability to attack and to respond as the result of terrorist wmd incident involve many different tasks and levels of training at minimum training programs should include individual first responder functional response team and emergency operations

annual basis using several interlinked systems such as the joint monthly readiness report jmrr and the joint warfighting capabilities assessment jwca these reporting mechanisms provide means to track and report force protection readiness as well as to raise and address force protection issues with the joint staff and the services 2 jmrr the jmrr provides an ongoing assessment of useucoms readiness to execute the national military strategy nms through comprehensive current overview of unit and joint readiness and commitments at all three levels of war tactical operational and strategic force protection readiness status of each of the component commands and hq useucom is reviewed as part of the jmrr force protection issues should be highlighted separately in the jmrr but categorized into one of the eight functional areas in the jmrr force protection related issues are assessed and assigned colorcoded indicator to indicate the current force protection readiness of the component command across the theater on given date typically as part of the full jmrr process hq useucom and the component commands then have to assess force protection readiness in the useucom aor out to some future date usually to 1 year and also on some possible scenario occurring that would impact useucom eg major theater war for example is it expected that force protection readiness will improve or decline over time what if any impact will major theater war mtw have on force protection readiness in this theater the jmrr process rates each functional area using colorcoded clevels 1 c1 dark green the

supports future upgrades commanders should use this data and local security risk assessments to identify and prioritize needed improvements as part of routine facilities upgrades and support requests for additional funding c for existing leased inhabited facilities that do not meet the minimum design standards it is recommended these leases not be renewed if new lease contract is entered into the

official use only rpgs and improvised explosive devices ied with explosive equivalents of 100 kilograms of tnt at the requiredavailable standoff distances this should be done unless it has been determined that higher threat severity exists andor higher level of protection is warranted the intent is for the structure to survive well enough to allow people inside the building to safely evacuate in the event of an attack to provide sufficient protection for personnel survivability and to mitigate collateral damage without bunker mentality after an explosive event the building may longer be usable and repair may not be economical at minimum one planningdesign engineer from each major area ie asg bsb air force base navsta nas will be trained in security engineering both the us

standards atfp design standards apply to all locations controlled or used by us military forces and defense agencies in the useucom aor regardless of the current area threat level the primary purpose of these standards is to protect personnel refer to the definitions in paragraph 4d below for guidance and clarification of terminology baseline threat weapons the development of the specific standards considered the following weapons 1 improvised explosive devices ied an explosive device with net explosive weight of 100 kilograms of tnt equivalent 2 direct fire weapons rocket propelled grenade rpg7 with 500 meter effective range and 568 grams 125 lbs of tnt equivalent shaped charge warhead 3 indirect fire weapons the primary threat is assumed to be from 60 mm andor 82 mm mortars 60 mm mortar rounds typically contain approximately 200 grams of tnt the minimum range for most systems is approximately 90 meters with maximum range of up to approximately 3000 meters most 82 mm mortar systems have minimum range of approximately 90 meters and maximum effective range of approximately 4300 meters an 82 mm mortar high explosive rounds characteristics are varied with total projectile weights of approximately 3 kilograms and an explosive weight of approximately 1 kilogram of tnt 4 chemical biological radiological cbr agents at this time it is not possible to quantify baseline however use of chemical agents is viewed as the most likely type of cbr attack to expect b required minimum atfp design and physical security standards the following standards shall be applied in accordance with table d11 facility construction standards matrix change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only d14 for official use only 1 screening from direct fire weapons screening shall be installed where observation from off installation is possible the purpose of screening is not to defeat the projectiles from direct fire weapons but to prevent targeting of personnel from off the installation aluminum louvers reflective film or trees are examples of suitable screening combination of screening elements may be used with the intent to adequately screen occupants on all stories from targeting by direct fire weapons 2 building separation when the separation distance between inhabited buildings is less than 10 meters 15 meters for troop billeting primary gathering spaces ensure that the building cladding can provide low level of protection against the design blast pressure from 1kilogram tnt indirect fire projectile at onehalf the available separation distance 3 perimeter standoff the minimum standoff distance required is 45 meters from the installation site or facility perimeter this perimeter may or may not be physically secured ie fence wall etc but should be defined as the area where control andor jurisdiction by us forces begins for facilities less than 45 meters from perimeter incorporate hardening of the facility to provide low level of protection from 100 kilogram tnt equivalent ied never site facility less than 15 meters from the perimeter wherever possible increase the perimeter standoff the intent is to prevent mass casualties associated with both building collapse and glass fragmentation hazards 4 superstructure for all structures of three stories or more design to sustain local damage with the structural system as whole remaining stable and not being damaged to an extent disproportionate to the original local damage to achieve this structural elements must be arranged to provide stability to the entire structural system by transferring loads from any locally damaged region to adjacent regions capable of resisting those loads without collapse this shall be accomplished by providing sufficient continuity redundancy energy dissipating capacity ductility or combination thereof in the members of the structure that design analysis will include removal of one primary vertical or one primary lateral loadcarrying element without progressive collapse in the event of close proximity explosion by the design ied for further guidance refer to american society of civil engineers standard 798 minimum design loads for buildings and other structures only professionally qualified structural engineers should undertake design and assessment of this standard 5 window treatments new construction or major renovation windows must be able to resist blast pressures from an ied with an explosive equivalent of 100 kilograms of tnt at the requiredavailable standoff without creating high level glass fragmentation hazard to personnel inside the facility for new construction or major renovation windows shall use as minimum 75 mm laminated glass with minimum interlayer thickness of 15 mm if doublepaned window is installed the interior pane

facility as minimum 75 mm laminated glass with minimum interlayer thickness of 15 mm if doublepaned window is installed the interior pane shall be laminated 75 mm minimum window frames for these types of glazing constructions must be designed and verified by inspection to ensure proper frame strength and anchorage c hazard mitigation in existing buildings evaluation criteria all inhabited facilities which do not provide low glass fragmentation hazard level of protection must be identified in accordance with the administrative reporting requirements of this document in these facilities later selected for hazard mitigation window replacement is the preferred method of improvement due to the recurring maintenance and operational requirements curtains must be closed catcher bars must remain in place associated with other methods however the addition of devices such as fragment retention film frf frf in conjunction with catcher bars or blast curtains may be used as appropriate in cases where glazing will be retrofitted to fracture but remain in the frame design engineers must evaluate the strength of the window frame and window frame anchorage in addition design engineers must determine the proper thickness of film coupled with the best use of catcher barsblast curtains glass replacement with 75 mm laminated glass minimum is acceptable if frames and anchorage have sufficient strength to transfer the reactions from the glass if some form of frf is used in retrofit application then minimum of 4mil 0004 or 01 mm thick film is required and must be installed on the insidefacing portion of the glass where film is applied such that it extends only to the exposed edges of the glass daylight application the energy of the failed glass pane must be sufficiently reduced so that glass fragments are not higher than ½ meter above the floor at distance of 3 meters into the room methods to reduce this effect include adding structuralsilicon type caulking to the edges connecting the film to the window frame andor installation of catcher bars or blast curtains d the glazing requirements and criteria outlined in paragraphs 5ac above need not be applied for windowsopenings into typically unoccupied areas eg basements attics etc 6 protection of entrances and exits to include emergency exits locate exterior doors to buildings so they cannot be targeted from vantage points located off the installation the intent is to prevent personnel evacuating building from being targeted from off the installation exterior doors to inhabited structures will open outward as minimum doors shall be 18 gauge hollow metal and any glazing will be 75 mm laminated glass intent is to prevent secondary fragmentation hazards 7 parking lots and roadways locate parking lots minimum of 25 meters and roadways minimum of 10 meters from inhabited structures for troop billeting primary gathering spaces maintain minimum standoff distance of 25 meters from roadways

requirement however where standoff distances exist for housing areas those distances will not be encroached during renovations or upgrades parking beneath inhabited buildings is not allowed drive updrop off areas closer than 25 meters are allowed but facilities with these areas must be designedmodified as follows establish driveup and drop off area or drive thru lane of traffic near the building using physical barriers that clearly define the area and the intended use physical barriers may include curbing planters jersey barriers etc or combinations of different systems b the drop off area shall have signs that clearly identify the location and the intended use signs should include wording such as do not leave vehicles unattended trucks allowed passenger loading and unloading only or combinations thereof c the driveup or drivethru area shall be configured such that access to vehicles can be curtailed at force protection conditions that restrict standoff distances d access to driveup or drivethru area shall be from point outside of the standoff zone established for the building the initial approach shall be parallel to the building or barrier erected that precludes direct movement towards the building 8 building perimeter protectionstandoff zone delineation standoff zones shall have boundaries clearly defined by barriers if threat analysis does not identify moving vehicle bomb tactic these barriers need not provide physical resistance to stop vehicles they need only make it difficult to cross the boundary without drawing attention the aggressors goal in the stationary vehicle bomb tactic is to remain covert until the device is detonated hard landscaping incorporating steps and mounds is one way to define and maintain standoff similarly the planting of trees or hedges soft landscaping at strategic points can prevent overlooking and can also be used to define and maintain standoff however weigh the employment of such measures against the opportunities that could be presented to an intruder for concealment andor for the hiding of explosive devices b when the threat analysis indicates the existence of moving vehicle threat to building concrete bollards or other crash rated vehicle barriers must be considered the purpose of these barriers are to prevent vehicle from jumping curb and parking next to building or approaching the front entrance these barriers must be designed based on the expected maximum speed the vehicle can attain based on the site conditions 9 external storage areas external storage areas shall be sitedrelocated

examples of storage areas include trash containers recycling bins stand alone storage buildings etc 10 security lighting incorporate security lighting into the project at the initial planning stage requirements for boundary entry control point and area lighting must conform to tm 5811lafm 889 based upon the identified facility threat lighting for closed circuit television cctv where it is determined to be necessary by other requirements must be designed in conjunction with the cctv system in accordance with tm 58534 11 mail rooms and delivery points locate mailrooms and delivery points to the perimeter of inhabited structures locate key utilities including communications fire detection and alarm water mains etc and sensitive equipment away from walls common with these areas in inhabited structures locate mailrooms and delivery points away from population concentrations allow space for security screening devices such as bomb detection equipment 12 mechanical and utility systems locate air intakes at least three 3 meters above existing grade or on the roof of singlestory inhabited structures and restrict access to the intakes control access to roofs of inhabited structures avoid external ladder access by providing entry from internal stairways or ladders such as in mechanical rooms include an emergency shutoff switch in the control system that immediately shuts down the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system of inhabited structures ensure that redundant utilities in inhabited structures do not run in the same locations or chases secure exterior access to power heating plants gas mains water supplies communications electrical service or other support facilities or infrastructure construct fire protection systems in inhabited structures using seismic detailing 13 construction of temporary expeditionary structures although not specifically required the design guidance listed above in paragraphs 3b1 through 3b12 should be considered when constructing temporary and expeditionary structures commanders also are expected to use expeditionary protective measures commensurate with the identified terrorism threat level and existing force protection condition examples of expeditionary measures available to reduce primary blast effects and fragmentation are soil berms sandbags sand grids and concrete modular revetments these and other expeditionary measures are discussed in tm 58551afpam 321147navfacp1080 dahscweman97 change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only d18 for official use only c facility construction

containing more than 12 units d additional design considerations compensatory measures although not specifically required the following measures listed below should be considered for incorporation in the design and construction of inhabited facilities 1 perimeter countermobility all installations should have physically secured perimeter that includes continuous barrier that marks the perimeter boundary and that provides physical obstacle to vehicle penetration if threat analysis does not identify moving vehicle bomb tactic these barriers need not provide physical resistance to stop vehicles only make it difficult to cross the boundary without drawing attention the aggressors goal in the stationary vehicle bomb tactic is to remain covert until the device is detonated b where moving vehicle threat is identified through threat analysis the barriers on the secured perimeter must be designed to stop the moving vehicle where vehicle approach to the perimeter is possible vehicle weight maximum attainable velocity and angle of impact shall be considered when selecting crash rated perimeter barriers calculate requirements by using procedures in tm 5853afman 321071 and mil handbook 10131a 2 perimeter security and control of entry to installation consider protecting the installation by perimeter security fence through which access is controlled at an established entry control point effective security lighting at the entry points to support the security check and inspections should be incorporated at the design stage change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only d19 for official use only the entry control point must be able to process vehicles in such way that during increased force protection conditions entry is not impeded thus impairing traffic flow the reason for this is twofold to prevent personnel awaiting entry from becoming vulnerable to attack and b to prevent pressure being put on the guards to forgo security checks in order to speed up traffic flow b the control of entry system should include provisions for visitor parking pass office search areas guard positions and turning area where unauthorized vehicles may be turned around and ejected from the facilityinstallation without gaining access c where indicated by threat analysis provide shielding or hardening of the guard structure to protect entry control point guards against driveby attacks using small arms the entry control point should employ active vehicle barriers appropriate for the threat and integrated with the passive perimeter barriers to ensure there are weak spots in the perimeter however professional advice should be sought before installing some active barriers such as popup barriers in order to ensure that the proposed equipment is operationally effective 3 access roads consider siting the main headquarters building and areas where large numbers of personnel congregate away from local roads outside the perimeter and away from primary access roads onto the facility this will reduce vulnerability to vehicleborne explosive devices and to standoff attack 4 protected areas consider the incorporation of protected areas pa pa is specifically designated area within building where vulnerabilities from blast effects of an explosion are minimized it is location where occupants are advised to go in the event of bomb threat warning consider this at the design stage for new construction in existing buildings professionally qualified structural engineers with experience of explosive effects should undertake pa identification pa should meet the following minimum criteria away from windows external doors and external walls b toward the center of the building c generally not in stairwells or areas having access to an elevator shaft since blast overpressures are likely to propagate into these areas d locate in areas surrounded by full height masonry or concrete walls if possible eg internal corridors internal toilet areas etc the size of the rooms must be such that it will provide minimum of 09 square meters 10 square feet of space for each person who will occupy the room 5 location of highrisk personnel hrp offices consider locating hrp offices away from overlooking points these offices should not be sited in areas that would make the change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only d110 for official use only hrp vulnerable to standoff attack office layout should also bear this in mind consider the use of bullet resistant glass where possible cover or protect the arrivaldeparture area for hrps to increase their safety at this vulnerable stage of movement 6 searchscreening areas consider the incorporation of separate searchscreening areas at entry points to facilities that would be attractive targets of terrorists eg headquarters buildings searchscreening areas should provide place where personnel desiring entry who are not preauthorized could be taken and searched if necessary searchscreening area also provides an area where person can wait until hisher credentials are confirmed separate area for this function relieves the pressure on the security guard force performing routine pass and identification checks 7 personnel alerting systems pas consider the incorporation of building and installation pas so that personnel can be warned via audible alarm and given directions as to what to do in the event of an attack or emergency by voice messaging pas systems should be capable of warning and directing personnel for various emergencies such as bomb attack mortar attack fire and earthquake 4 administration reporting requirements all existing inhabited structures will be evaluated against the useucom construction standards contained in paragraph 3b above each installationactivity commander will submit through their component command headquarters to hq useucom ecsmecj4en their plan to evaluate existing inhabited structures including family housing containing more than 12 units each installationactivity will also submit through their component command headquarters recurring status report to hq useucom ecsmecj4en that delineates the progress made as well as any steps taken or scheduled to mitigate the potential of terrorist attack and to prevent mass casualties within existing inhabited structures these reports will be due annually on the 15 th of april b deviation program the hq useucom chief of staff is the approval authority for any exception waiver or variance to the atfp construction design standards contained in this opord when circumstances preclude compliance with these standards installation commanders should submit request for deviation exception waiver or variance through their component command headquarters to hq useucom using the format provided at tab to this appendix waivers will be considered if compliance with the standard at particular installation or facility will adversely affect mission accomplishment unacceptably affect relations with the host nation exceed local capabilities or require substantial expenditure of funds at location where forces will be removed or relocated in the near future 1 types of deviations all requests for deviations from atfp design standards will be identified in one of the following three categories permanent deviations exceptions permanent deviations or exceptions must be requested when condition of noncompliance exists that cannot be corrected or change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only d111 for official use only when compliance would result in more serious vulnerabilitiesproblems or not produce cost effective solution permanent deviations require compensatory measures and have expiration dates b temporary deviations waivers temporary deviations or waivers must be requested when correctable condition of noncompliance exists and can not be immediately corrected all requests for waiver will identify compensatory measures and specify an anticipated date for correcting the condition of noncompliance waivers will not be approved for more than one 1 year for significant and high terrorism threat level areas and not more than two 2 years for all other locations subsequent requests for the extension of waivered requirements will be considered for approval when fully justified c technical deviations variances technical deviations or variances should be requested when condition exists that satisfies the intent of the requirement and does not threaten security but technically differs from specifications directed by higher headquarters conditions approved as variances may or may not require compensatory measures or further actions 2 using the format in tab to this appendix ensure that all deviation requests specify the category exception waiver or variance and as minimum include the following identify the particular standards for which an exception waiver or variance is requested b describe the full scope of the deviation requested and the expiration date c describe the anticipated impact of the deviation if any on the safety of dod elements and personnel d describe the justification for the deviation and if an exception permanent deviation is being requested explain why partial andor temporary deviation would not be sufficient where applicable describe attempts to comply with standards that have not been approved by host

hazard level glazing fragments are thrown for distance of approximately 13 meters but do not exceed height of 05 meters above the floor at the 3 meter distance injuries would be limited to lower body cuts and fatalities would not be expected although there would be some risk to persons within 12 meters of the window b high hazard level glazing fragments are thrown much further into the room and at high velocity above the 05meter height at the 3 meter range serious injuries including cuts to the upper body and face from the flying fragments would be expected fatalities could occur 10 laminated glass two or more individual sheets of glass bonded together by polyvinyl butyral pvb plastic or other equivalent material interlayer 11 level of protection the degree to which an asset is protected against tactic based on the assets value levels of protection refer to the amount of damage structure is allowed to sustain or the probability that an aggressor attack will be defeated by the protective system 12 low level of protection damaged unrepairable the facility or protected space will sustain high degree of damage without collapse although collapse is prevented occupants may be injured and other assets may be damaged but will survive damaged building components including structural members will require replacement depending on the scale of the blast damage its location and facility characteristics the facility may be completely unrepairable requiring demolition and replacement the damage allowed may make surviving assets vulnerable to subsequent attack change 1 08 mar

research development test and evaluation rdte for potential materiel solutions to commandidentified high priority combating terrorism cbt deficiencies the useucom program is based on guidance in the cjcsi 526201 combating terrorism technology request process 2 policy the cbt technology request process enables field commanders at the cinc service component command and facility levels to solicit commercial offtheshelf cots testing or rapid prototyping rp of potential materiel solutions from the physical security equipment action group pseag andor the technical support working group tswg as applicable b requests must directly support antiterrorismforce protection atfp for dod personnel their family members dod facilities and dod equipment c the goal of the technology request process is to identify needed atfp capabilities determine whether cots options exist or whether technology is mature enough to support rp test the options if warranted and provide product capability information to field commanders then based on the threat acceptable risk and affordability field commanders should purchase the option that satisfies their immediate needs d if the tswg or pseag cannot identify or provide potential options then the deficiency must be addressed through the services requirements generation process thus the secondary goal is to aid the services in identifying cbt deficiencies that are systematic and require permanent solution 3 the four phases of the technology request process are discovery 1 identification field commanders identify deficiencies or atfp capabilities that stem from changes in the terrorist threat political situations doctrine and vulnerability assessments commanders then determine if solution is materiel or technological or if it is nonmateriel such as procedures policy or personnel for official use only d42 for official use only 2 determination if materiel solution is warranted field commanders should consult the force protection and physical

0101 references see basic order 1 situation numerous dod elements personnel and assets constantly transit or are deployed within the useucom area of responsibility aor for the purposes of this opord these dod elements personnel and assets are collectively referred to as intransit forces such forces often are traveling or conducting missions in areas outside of us controlled areas thus particular attention must be given to the threat and sometimes unique vulnerabilities confronting intransit forces 2 mission to provide policy and guidance regarding antiterrorismforce protection atfp requirements for dod elements personnel and assets transiting or deployed to the useucom aor 3 execution scheme of support 1 the policy and guidance in this annex is applicable to dod elements personnel and assets to include aircraft and ships under the security responsibility of uscinceur specific guidance regarding command and control arrangements and the scope of the cincs authority tacon for force protection is contained in paragraph 5 of this order in most cases categories and identification of dod elements and personnel under the security authority of uscinceur are specified country specific comcinc memoranda of agreement moa which are available via the siprnet at the useucom force protection homepage httpwww2eucomsmilmilhqecsmmoamoahtml 2 commanders with fp responsibility for transiting force shall ensure the execution of predeployment at vulnerability assessments prior to deployment to locations where the terrorism threat level is significant or high or where geographically specific terrorism warning report is in effect this includes movement routes that may be used by transiting dod forces ships and aircraft assessments of ports and airfields will be accomplished for dod ships and aircraft iaw the appendices to this annex regardless of the threat level component commanders and supporting cincs may waive these requirements for deployments andor visits to dod controlled locations such as existing military installations or ships afloat predeployment assessments of locations where the terrorism threat level is low or moderate will be at the discretion of the responsible commander unless otherwise specified for official use only e2 for official use only b transiting forces for the purpose of this annex include all dod ships and aircraft and dod units that could present lucrative terrorist targets minimally those units or groups consisting of more than 50 personnel commanders may lower this threshold of unit size at their prerogative c since variety of factors could impact the timing of assessments for in transit forces specific timeline is established the intent is to conduct assessments sufficiently in advance of missions to facilitate development of security procedures acquisition of necessary materials tailored and focused intelligence security support augmentation if necessary and coordination with the host nation but within timeframe that provides the commander with current situational information thus an original assessment significantly in advance of deployment may necessitate followon validation prior to the deployment 3 the appendices to this annex outline policies and processes for assessments of airfields ports and ground locations previous and periodic assessments of many locations will be available to commanders these assessments may satisfy many predeployment assessment requirements and provide data that can be updated andor validated to alleviate the need for an additional assessment and reduce the scope of the assessment if it is warranted 4 deploying commanders shall implement appropriate at measures to reduce risk and vulnerability if warranted commanders faced with emergent atfp requirements prior to movement of forces should submit chairman combating terrorism readiness initiatives fund cbt rif requests through established channels to procure necessary materials or equipment for required protective measures 5 equipment and technology can significantly enhance atfp for all dod forces and in particular the security posture of transiting units against terrorist threats for this reason component commanders should research and identify at equipment andor technology requirements to their chain of command the use of commercialofftheshelf cots or governmentofftheshelf gots products should be stressed to meet nearterm requirements 6 security plan for each deployment should be prepared and while not to the detail of an installation atfp plan should address the following

marforeur d assessment criteria will depend on the type of location 1 annual vulnerability assessments which are performed by host units will suffice for us installations us military controlled 2 other security category cat airfields require an annual confirmation of adequate security presence and policies see paragraph 5 below this confirmation may be conducted by transiting forces eg aircrews andor the us embassy dao or regional security officer rso and should examine all aspects of security and safety using the airfield assessment checklist tab f to this appendix 3 airfields designated security category b cat b require more stringent securityvulnerability assessments see paragraph 6 below an annual onsite assessment by multidisciplined team well versed in antiterrorismforce protection is required for cat b airfields critical to wartime or contingency operations andor cat b airfields that large troop movements 50 or more traverse at single time cat b airfields not meeting the above criteria will also be assessed annually as well however the assessments may be conducted by transiting aircrews security force personnel or for official use only e14 for official use only the us embassy rsodao verification of the information should be conducted by aircrews and security force personnel accompanying each flight time permitting for cat b airfields infrequently used the annual assessment requirement may be postponed until such time mission is planned to transit that location in such cases the assessment must be conducted prior to mission arrival and in sufficient time to allow mission vetting by the appropriate twg in all cases the airfield assessment checklist will as minimum be completed if current assessment does not exist the respective useucom component commander or supporting cinc eg ustranscom or their respective twg will decide mission execution using available information and intelligence 4 the component command twg will determine individual vice team requirements for initial assessments of airfields that are not critical to wartime or contingency operations and are not used for large troop movements these assessments may be conducted by multidiscipline teams individuals or us embassy rsodao the twg should consider the threat and status cat or b of other assessed airfields in the countryregion when determining initial assessment criteria 5 regardless of the category type mission planners mission commanders and twgs must consider the frequency type and quality of securityrelated assessment information as well as current threat when making risk management decisions on aircraft movements as the executive agent for the airfield ramp hq usafe is the lead agency for useucom in determining aircraft security and airfield risk assessment policies for transiting aircraft to include deploying aircraft from conus and other geographic aors in this capacity hq usafe will perform as liaison between the component

designation 5 transient operations to security cat airfields cat airfields by definition do not normally require security augmentation for routine operations under normal circumstances exceptions to this may occur in the event intelligence indicates specific threat that indicates terrorist targeting of airfields or aircraft additional security should also be afforded for high visibility transits and those involving largescale unit deployments security and planning guidance applicable to cat b airfields should be incorporated on casebycase basis 6 transient operations to security cat b airfields the following provides general policy for agencies and crewmembers as it relates to planning and executing aircraft securityforce protection measures at cat b airfields in some situations the limitations levied by host nations may affect the ability to achieve these measures aircrews mission commanders and security personnel must strive to meet these baselines wherever possible prior to departure 1 the aircrew must receive tailored comprehensive planning package that beyond standard flight planning information includes summary of threats along the route of flight the terminal area and at the airfield itself the package also will contain us embassy country team information to include rso contact numbersnames usdr who usually is the defense attaché datt contact numbers and how to contact localcontracted security at the airfield of intended destination imagery of the airfield if available should indicate the likely parking location so that the aircrew can determine escape routes should that become necessary the package should include the person or persons by name who will meet the aircraft in order to provide liaison and updates on security conditions as they exist at the time of arrival if operating at for official use only e16 for official use only civilian airfield the package should include the name of the companies that will be providing aircraft servicing 2 if the airfield is designated in ramp as location requiring onboard security personnel to accompany the mission armed escortssecurity forces the security members will receive the same information and be present and participate in the aircraft commanders mission briefing security personnel will cover standard briefing items to include how they will operate when the aircraft arrives and to confirm signals and other means of communicating with the crew prior to the crew leaving their seats after engine shutdown they will brief on the carrying of weapons armedcovertovert during the mission to include the use of force and rules of engagement roe see tab c to this appendix the designated component command element twg or twoperson security team hereafter referred to as security team st leader and st member will make contact with member of the us embassy country team nlt 24 hours prior to departure for current airfield information component commands will determine the appropriate coordination procedures with country teams to ensure adequate exchange of information without unnecessary and redundant interactions 3 if required security for the aircraft will be conducted on 24hour basis aircrews and mission planners should plan accordingly 4 when the type or size of the aircraft does not permit onboard security personnel and such support is identified as requirement the component command or supporting cinc will request additional host nation security support see sample request at tab b to this appendix or send advance us security elements when host nation support will still not satisfy doduseucom requirements and us provided security is not feasible the respective twg will advise the appropriate commander for decision regarding execution of the mission b route from force protection standpoint there must be continuous route voice communication capability between dod aircraft and their corresponding c2 organization the c2 organization must be able to maintain continuous contact with transiting aircraft the c2 organization must be able to pass latebreaking updated threat information to its aircraft route possibly leading to an route change of destination c arrival normally aircrews expect either followme vehicle or directions from tower personnel or combination of the two providing guidance to their designated parking location for missions with additional security support on board adhere to the following procedures 1 taxi to parking during taxi in the two security personnel will position themselves in such way as to scan the ramp area for suspicious personnel vehicles or activity country team personnel eg rsodao or designatedcontracted security personnel will normally be requested to meet the aircraft as the aircraft stops in parking the aircrew will leave one engine or apu running while security personnel for official use only e17 for official use only deplane cockpit crewmembers will remain strapped in poised to restart engines to taxi away from the area or even take off if the situation warrants st leader will observe ground personnel during chocking of the aircraft positioning of power carts and fire bottles as appropriate st member will scan the area while circling the aircraft st leader will then meet with the local security representative where they should be briefed on the following status of airfield security b

duties and taxation and immune from search seizure inspection including customs and safety inspections and other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation aircraft commanders ac and security team members st members may not authorize the search seizure inspection or other exercise of jurisdiction by foreign authorities unless directed by the appropriate higher authority eg service headquarters or the local us embassy if foreign government or military officials attempt to force their way aboard dod aircraft sts should not physically restrain them unless they attempt to harm dod personnel or property the st will contact the ac and local us embassy personnel immediately b if foreign nationals who are not military or governmental officials attempt to enter dod aircraft without permission st members may use appropriate force to resist if this situation arises st members contact the ac and local us embassy personnel immediately 2 in general whether inside or outside the aircraft st members may use force according to cjcsi 312101 standing rules of engagement for us forces and appropriate component instructions 3 inside the aircraft an area of us sovereignty st members may apprehend and prevent the escape of person who has committed an offense outside the aircraft st members may not seek to apprehend or prevent the escape of foreign national this is considered local law enforcement

proximate threat presents itself weapons retrieved from within an aircraft by unarmed guards to neutralize threat should be returned to the aircraft as soon as possible if staged operation is being conducted and the weapons will be carried outside the aircraft the aircrafts assigned command and control agency will be the focal point to coordinate weapon permits with the local us embassy at the location of concern b given that the threat to dod assets can change quickly there may be situations local rioting bombings etc that warrant the removal of the weapons from the aircraft at deployed airfield in situations other than an immediate hostile threat to dod assets the ac commander or st leader will contact the us embassy representative eg defense attaché officer datt or regional security officer rso for authorization to remove weapons from the aircraft the ac or st leader also will contact their assigned command and control agency as soon as possible to provide detailed briefing of the current conditions c after completing security coordination and prior to entering crew rest upon receiving proper authorization per paragraphs 5a and b above the ac or st leader will arrange to store all weapons and ammunition in secure dod us embassy or nato armory if service regulations or directives permit such storage if these facilities are not available st will store weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft in locked container if service regulations or directives permit such storage suggest securing weapons in locked container that is properly secured to the aircraft and that weapons and ammunition be stored in separate containers 6 if foreign national approaches an acst member to request political asylum or temporary refuge entry to the interior of the aircraft will not be permitted ac or st should refer immediately all situations of this type to the nearest us embassy or consulate the senior commander or ac may afford temporary refuge in order to secure the

effective planning and execution of antiterrorism force protection atfp measures for dod ground forces transiting in or through the eucom aor 2 applicability this appendix applies to all ground units that could present lucrative terrorist targets minimally those units or groups consisting of more than 50 personnel or larger dod elements conducting ground operations or ground movements in the useucom aor and for which uscinceur has force protection responsibility commanders are encouraged to apply these measures to lesser movements when time and resources permit 3 policy although uscinceur exercises tacon for force protection over all dod elements and personnel assigned attached or transiting through the useucom aor and not under the security authority of chief of mission com commanders at all levels are inherently responsible for the security of their forces this appendix provides directive guidance to commanders and outlines the minimum force protection requirements for transiting units 4 assessments general prior to movement commanders must conduct terrorist threat assessment and vulnerability assessment of all locations and routes their troops will transit including arrival sites movement routes planned halts and departure sites this requirement applies to operations to or through areas where the terrorism threat level is significant or high or where geographically specific terrorism warning report is in effect and for all operations involving an airfield or port pending full implementation of the useucom joint risk assessment management program jramp and ground ramp database commanders must view the usareur force protection web site on the siprnet at wwwodcsopshqusareurarmysmilmildivisionsopsdivforceprotectiondocst obeshare dhtm for previous assessments on specific ground locations and routes airfield assessments and related information can be found on the hq usafe airfield ramp database at httpcoldfusionramsteinafsmilmilrampindexcfm coordinate directly

from higher headquarters for transit operations through ports or airfields requiring expertise beyond the ability of the commander to provide internally c assessment checklist attached at tab is sample assessment checklistguide for use in conducting predeployment assessments and developing mission security measures although not all items will apply to every type of movement the checklist provides detailed list of force protectionspecific considerations related to ground transit operations d assessment locations ground transit operations in the useucom aor will typically begin at an aerial port of debarkation apod or seaport of debarkation spod coordinate with hq usafe andor hq usnaveur to acquire any assessment data they may have and update their information as necessary however the component command ground assessment will include data that is not routinely collected in conjunction with usafe or usnaveur assessment the focus on protecting personnel conducting ground operations versus flight or naval operations requires additional assessment criteria oriented to the threat specific to the ground portion of the mission 1 rail movements typically support transfer of equipment in the useucom aor however onloadoffload operations are considered transit operations and component commands must conduct assessments and develop security plans for railhead operations 2 routes between arrival points and destination points must be assessed consider mission profile and terrorist threat in determining the level of detail for the assessment higher threat areas may require thorough route reconnaissance prior to movement while map reconnaissance may suffice for lower threat areas 3 forwarddeployed units conducting missions or exercises rarely remain confined on base camp the installation or base camp atfp plan should address security measures for operations at the base camp while the requirements in this appendix apply to movements of forces away from the operating location that are not integral to the mission or to the execution of the base camp security plan for shortduration missions or exercises the base camp itself is considered transit location requiring assessment and development of security plan under the provisions of this appendix 5 movement security planning commanders will develop movement security plan focused on intransit operations and synchronize this for official use only e33 for official use only plan with the overall movement plan the security plan must include specific measures addressing security at arrival sites on movement routes during planned halts and at departure sites address route planning vehicle requirements weapons and equipment requirements night vision equipments and vehicle escort and movement requirements for repetitive movements consider varying routes and times to prevent establishing routine that facilitates terrorist planning b procedures for maintenance recovery operations including security of the recovery team c procedures for medical evacuation including security of the medical team d command and controlcommunications elements must establish clear chain of command for movement the commander or senior officer present is responsible for ensuring security measures adequately address vulnerabilities transiting elements should establish secure communications with an operations center capable of coordinating response operations rules of engagement for each country or area that the element will transit or occupy f provisions for host nation security support when appropriate host nation police or military can be an invaluable asset to transiting units as local forces generally have much greater understanding of the threats to transiting forces g operations security thorough mission planning includes determination of critical information essential elements of friendly information eefi that must be safeguarded from unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure following analysis of opsec indicators and vulnerabilities assess the threat to us forces and decide what level of risk to assume finally incorporate appropriate opsec procedures into the overall security plan to ensure the protection of information critical to us forces and the mission opsec applies not only to protecting information during the planning stages of an operation but during the operation as well 6 threat working grouprisk management based on information provided during the threat and vulnerability assessments operational commanders identify specific measures designed to reduce risk these measures form the basis of the movement security plan to ensure the decision to conduct operations is made at the appropriate level component commanders will establish policies and procedures to ensure the component command and appropriate subordinate command headquarters have formal process to assess risk including specific approval authority for for official use only e34 for official use only each level of risk all highrisk movements require generalflag officer approval prior to execution movements considered to be highrisk may include those involving particularly sensitive resources or highrisk personnel or movements in areas where the terrorism warning reports have been issued or the threat level is significant or high b frequently occurring highrisk movements do not require generalflag officer approval for each movement the initial movement briefing will include information on planned future movements and the generalflag officer may approve future operations contingent upon continuously updated risk assessments that determine change in risk level 7 predeployment training transiting elements must complete all required training prior to arrival in theater or movement although parent units are responsible for training their forces the commander responsible for force protection during the operation must ensure all forces have completed the required training mandatory training includes completion of level i atfp training for all personnel b completion of level ii atfp training for each battalionseparate company squadron or ship antiterrorism officer ato c individual and collective training on all tasks supporting the security measures contained in the security plan training should be performanceoriented and include vignettes and antiterrorism scenarios to provide challenging and realistic training d review of the rules of engagement for all countries or areas the element will transit or occupy training must include scenarios that require forces to apply the rules of engagement in various scenarios they are likely to encounter while transiting comprehensive country or area threat briefs f training on all weapons and equipment that the element may use in the execution of security measures 8 intransit operations the unit commander or senior officer accompanying the movement is responsible for the implementation of the movement security plan this includes continuous assessment of the threat during the operation and revision of the plan as necessary to mitigate emerging vulnerabilities during movement 9 postdeployment after action reports aar for all operations outside of germany italy or the benelux units must provide after action for official use only e35 for official use only reports electronically to the hq usareur force protection

management and oversight of actions required by this opord 2 general this document contains sensitive information related to antiterrorism and force protection atfp of dod elements to include personnel engaged in tactical operations in forward deployed environments the document is marked to be handled for official use only and the information contained herein must remain under the control of us government electronic transmission of this document and portions thereof must be made over protected systems eg the secret internet protocol router network siprnet or higher dod directives strictly prohibit the transmission or revelation of information contained herein in any manner to an unauthorized person it is crucial that information generated and used in support of this opord not be overclassified since it must be made readily available to those personnel and agencies responsible for implementation andor correction however because of the farreaching applicability of the requirements care must be exercised to ensure that classified and sensitive unclassified national defense information is not compromised this is especially true in the useucom aor where there are requirements to work closely with our allies and host nation as well as other noncleared personnel to implement appropriate measures in support of the atfp program to achieve balance between making information available and yet providing sufficient protection any atfp plan with complete listing of sitespecific atfp measures linked to force protection condition will be classified as minimum

dod 52001r references and b this scg constitutes the authority for classification regrading and declassification of information relating to the affected programs changes in classification required by application of this scg shall be made immediately information classified in accordance with this scg is by authority of the commander in chief us european command uscinceur 4 applicability this scg applies to all information generated by assessments done within theater by component headquarters and other subordinate commands classification of joint staff integrated vulnerability assessments jsiva will be in accordance with the dtra force protection security classification guide reference dated information cited from another scg or other derivative source that bears classification or other restrictive marking shall retain the original markings classification and downgrading instructions this is the process of derivative classification all reports or information related to the useucom atfp program normally should be marked and handled as for official use only or other appropriate caveat for the type of information unless classified at higher level 5 releasability unclassified or unclassified sensitive information may be released to the host nation authorities on need to know basis when it directly impacts on an organizations ability to implement the atfp program or correct noted deficiencies identified during vulnerability assessment or program review b classified information that must be released to or shared with the host nation of the affected installation or location must be appropriately cleared through foreign disclosure channels to the national military information disclosure policy committee see ndp1 national policy and procedures for disclosure of classified military for official use only l3 for official use only information to foreign governments and international organizations reference d for the proper procedures to follow when addressing this area ndp1 also contains listings by country of that information that has already been cleared for release 6 declassification classified information in reports generated by useucom vulnerability assessment teams shall be declassified ten years from the date of publication of each assessment report unless otherwise stated in this guide or other classification source during the declassification process information contained in those reports that is classified by other sources andor is exempt from declassification shall be removed from the reports and filed appropriately or destroyed exemption categories or declassification dateevent must be typed or printed on the front page together with the classification authority and the reason for classification see section iii paragraph 4 below for examples of proper marking of classified documents also consult dod pamphlet 52001ph b documents or information generated by useucom atfp assessment teams and extracted from such reports shall be automatically declassified at the same time as the report reports or other documents generated in support of the local or theater implementation of atfp programs will be downgradeddeclassified in accordance with theater specific classification guidance andor other classification sources used to classify information relating to weapons systems or other programs specific to the affected location or theater of operation for official use only l4 for official use only section i general discussion 1 vulnerabilities major vulnerability is exposure of humans to loss of life or serious injury resulting from an act of terrorism major vulnerability may result from the exposure of critical asset such as water or food supplies to compromise or destruction for example if an isolated installation has but one water supply that water supply is critical asset the probability of its contamination would constitute major vulnerability b minor vulnerability is exposure of sensitive assets to compromise or destruction for example if the utilities in an underground command center were interrupted eventually fresh air would become unavailable 3 unclassified information the fact that certain information is marked unclassified may cause it to be authorized for public release therefore information that should not be released to the general public although unclassified should be marked with the appropriate caveat for category of information contained an example would be for official use only b information is marked unclassified when 1 it is not classifiable on its own merits at given moment but is included with or extracted from classified document or 2 it has been reviewed by classification management analyst because of question about its classifiability and found to be not classifiable at the time of review it may however be classifiable when aggregated or compiled with other information c any information pertaining to official government functions or business is the property of the united states government and remains such until released into the public domain by proper authority 4 marking classified document all classified information whether contained in report document or briefing or derived from report shall be conspicuously marked with the appropriate level of classification if information is unclassified it must be conspicuously marked unclassified each classified document shall bear classification authority and declassification date that is ten years from the date of the report unless classified for longer period by other pertinent classification source the term oadr is longer permitted the following is the sample format to be used for information that is classified iaw this scg and that contains information classified by another source for official use only l5 for official use only classified by uscinceur atfp opord 0101 xx jan 01 reasons 15a and 15g declassify on 30 august 2010 date that is ten years from the date of the report report that contains information classified by this scg in addition to information that is classified by other or multiple sources is called document derivatively classified by multiple sources to properly mark such document you must consult dod 5200ir chapter 5 section 2 or dod 52001ph section 2 additional marking requirements the following statement must be placed at the bottom of each report that is classified higher than any of its individual constituent portions while the majority of portions in this document are unclassified on individual merit this compilation of those portions is classified secret confidential because it reveals vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems installations projects or plans relating to the national security for official use only l6 for official use only section ii classification topics authority for classification for each topic section 15 and section 15 g declassification 10 years from date of report unless otherwise noted in remarks or notes topic class or exemption remarks 1 scheduling coordination oconus 1 if host country is on the department of state warning list dswl fouo or c declassify on completion of trip see remarks below 2 if host country is not on the dswl u remarks handle on casebycase basis to determine need for classification at the confidential level this would normally be consideration when generalflag officer or civilian equivalent in critical position accompanies the team also it would be consideration when traveling to certain significant or high terrorism threat level areas 2 administrative preparation medical legal u b orders u see remarks below remarks if location to be visited is classified specific information that is classified sould be data masked so that travel orders may remain unclassified 3 assessment inbrief u c or s tbd by team leader see remarks below b outbrief u c or s tbd by team leader see remarks below remarks if other classified topics are to be discussed classification will be at the level determined by the briefing topics also cumulative classification should be considered as described in note 1 of the guide 4 post

resource being protected f details revealing assigned ammunition load ready loads number of persons absent morale state of readiness u c or s see remarks below remarks classification of the aggregate of this type of information may be classified per note 1 depending on the weapons system or program usually other classification guidance exists which normally would be used the team chief would make these determinations based on that guidance 7 logistics billeting u fouo use opsec guidelines 8 intelligence assessments see note 2 below note 1 the final report shall be marked with the highest level of any single portion however the report may warrant classification at level higher than any of its individual constituent portions due to the compilation of information mark each portion of the document with its own classification and mark the document and each page with the overall classification of the document due to compilation note 2 if you cite intelligence assessments in your final report ensure that you retain and carry forward all protective markings assigned by the originator intelligence information will almost always be derivatively classified note 3 the front cover of each

available on the siprnet to track the results of vas this passwordprotected database is available through the hq useucom force protection homepage of the siprnet the vamp provides commanders with an accurate and current picture of vulnerabilities and the status of action being taken to correct identified weaknesses database also allows for the prioritization of all atfp requirements in theater see annex m appendix 2 tab 7 ensure subordinate commands input required va results in the vamp database 8 provide advice and expertise to service component commands and defense agencies who are loading data in the vamp 9 monitor va results compiling requests for assistance from local commanders unable to implement measures recommended in vas b all useucom activitiesinstallations 1 conduct vas iaw useucom standard 26 in annex m appendix 1 and the guidelines in annex m appendix 2 in addition all activities must include the offpost residences of dod personnel and their family members in these assessments 2 update the vamp database as vas of installations or activities occur or as recommendations are implemented or when there is change in local threat level or force protection condition 3 whenever the threat level changes or threatforce protection alert or advisory is issued compare the current va report and existing vulnerabilities with new threat information report any changes to status to useucom ecsm through the appropriate service component command and update the vamp database 4 ensure all vas give particular emphasis to assessing the vulnerability of personnel installations and facilities to terrorist use of wmd chemical biological or radiological agents 5 document the results of each va units may use service component or locally generated checklists or the checklists enclosed in this opord annex m appendix 2 to conduct vas in addition dod handbook 200012h reference h contains number of other checklists to aid in the conduct of va note the for official use only m3 for official use only security measures provided in the checklists may not be applicable to all units or activities however these checklists can serve as basis for establishing or updating atfp programs c deficiencies noted by subordinate commanders will be prioritized and forwarded for resolution through that service components chain of command as necessary component commands will inform hq useucom ecsm without delay if required service support to correct deficiency is not validated or is inadequate d dod elements and personnel under the security responsibility of the com 1 per dodd 200012 reference g uscinceur is responsible to conduct security reviews of dod elements and personnel under the security responsibility of the com if review is determined to be necessary hq useucom ecsm will normally conduct these reviews in coordination with the usdr and the rso 2 the objective of security review is to identify any disparities in security coverage 3 areas of physical security concerning dod elements and personnel under the force protection responsibility of the com that fail to comply with ospb standards or are disparate from doduseucom standards should be identified to the rso for corrective action if this coordination fails to correct noted deficiencies refer to annex c appendix 4 resolution of conflict on post note the term post is department of state term which means an overseas diplomatic mission eg embassy or consulate commanders must ensure procedures are implemented and included in their respective atfp plans for the timely followup of corrective measures associated with each va or program review by higher headquarters this is particularly critical for combatant units who rotate to the useucom aor occupying the same location as the

cinc down to the installationsite level for permanent andor temporary operations 3 deviations the inability to meet minimum dod and useucom atfp standards and requirements may result in higher atfp program risk commanders constantly must weigh risks involved in complying with the requirements and standards contained in this order all commanders accepting higher risk and deviating from this opord must seek approval through their service component headquarters commanders who report directly to hq useucom will seek approval for deviation requests directly from hq useucom approval authority for deviations from the dod at standards contained in dod directive 200012 and dod instruction 200016 as specified in this opord is the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low intensity conflict asd solic requests for such deviations must be forwarded through the chain of command to hq useucom ecsm for review prior to forwarding to the joint staff the hq useucom chief of staff will approve all deviations from useucomdirected standards and requirements which exceed andor are more stringent than dod standards b it is anticipated that most deviations from new emerging

and format provided in that appendix to prepare and process deviations to the standards listed below for official use only m12 for official use only 4 prescriptive standards all components and commanders for whom uscinceur has atfp responsibility shall comply with the requirements specified in the following standards useucom standard 1 antiterrorism and force protection policy commanders at all levels are responsible for the implementation of dod atfp policies within their organizations component commanders must develop policies to ensure subordinate commanders comply with established requirements b useucom standard 2 development of atfp program standards the atfp program standards contained in this appendix are the baseline standards for useucom commanders at all levels must tailor these standards to service and site specific requirements and may issue more stringent requirements to supplement the standards contained herein as minimum component command programs must address the following areas 1 procedures to collect and analyze terrorist threat information threat capabilities and vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks 2 terrorism threat assessments risk assessments and atfp plans to include terrorist incident response and terrorist consequence management measures 3 procedures to enhance atfp protection which might include but not limited to training programs awareness campaigns and technology applications 4 procedures to identify atfp requirements and to program for resources necessary to meet security requirements 5 vulnerability assessments and

whose force protection responsibility rests with the com comply with ospb standards 4 disputes regarding atfp matters between dod and dos officials will be promptly reported to hq useucom ecsm the conflict resolution process outlined in dodd 521084 reference r should be followed and every effort made to resolve the matter locally useucom standard 5 atfp program development implementation and assessment commanders at all levels shall develop and implement comprehensive atfp program to meet the requirements of this opord and at minimum the six specific areas identified in standard 2 additionally atfp program elements will include threat assessments planning exercises program reviews training and vulnerability assessments as well as process or sequence of reviews of the atfp program elements to continuously refine atfp plans 1 component commanders will designate in writing staff officer to supervise inspect exercise review assess and report on installation atfp programs for official use only m14 for official use only within their command component command programs must establish procedures to verify subordinate commands compliance with all requirements established in this opord 2 at the theater level the hq useucom special assistant for security matters ecsm is the designated staff officer responsible for atfp program development implementation and assessment 3 another critical link to operating forces and potential vulnerability is logistics support when it is necessary to contract logistics support and that support could affect the security of operating forces commanders at all levels will ensure that atfp measures are considered during the development of contracting requirements and the award process contracts should be structured to ensure atfp oversight is in place during the execution phase of the contract and mechanism exists to identify atfp shortfalls in the evaluation process component commanders shall establish procedures with supporting contracting offices and agencies to verify that all logistics support contracts and agreements consider atfp for the particular security environment f useucom standard 6 assignment of antiterrorism officers ato commanders shall designate commissioned officer noncommissioned officer or civilian staff officer in writing as the ato for each installation or base and deploying organization eg battalion squadron ship under their command the designated ato shall be trained in atfp procedures in formal serviceapproved level ii at syllabus course component commanders must develop process to verify units deploying into the aor or transiting through the aor have trained assigned ato see appendix 5 to this annex for criteria g useucom standard 7 application of dod terrorism threat analysis methodology the dod terrorism threat level classification system will be used to identify terrorism threat levels in specific country within the useucom aor see annex b appendix 2 1 the department of defense terrorism threat level classification system is set of standardized terms used to quantify the level of terrorism threat on countrybycountry basis the terrorism threat level terms are low moderate significant and high the system evaluates the threat using variety of analytical threat factors 2 terrorism threat levels for each country in the useucom aor are set by dia however uscinceur may set terrorism threat levels for specific regions personnel family members units and installations based on more precise and focused intelligence reporting and analysis commanders at all levels shall use their own intelligence analysis to include terrorist criminal and other potential threats as well as the security environment of the host nation as tool in developing and updating plans and programs to protect assets within their command for official use only m15 for official use only 3 terrorism threat levels are estimates with direct relationship to specific force protection condition force protection condition is security posture promulgated by the commander in consideration of variety of factors eg mission requirements terrorism threat analysis threat level risk assessment etc terrorism threat levels should not be confused with force protection conditions 4 effective application of the terrorism threat level classification system requires an integrated terrorism threat analysis incorporating information collection from all sources while terrorism threat levels provide the basis for planning and programming atfp measures terrorism warning reports and current assessments are the trip wires for commanders to adjust security postures and implement increased atfp measures h useucom standard 8 threat information collection and analysis identifying the threat is the first step and most critical element of an effective at program and forms the basis for all planning considerations commanders at all levels shall task the appropriate organizations under their command to collect analyze and disseminate terrorist threat information collection efforts should exploit the full capabilities of law enforcement security forces intelligence counterintelligence and other available resources to report information of individuals events and situations that could pose threat to dod personnel families facilities and resources commanders at all levels also should establish awareness programs and procedures to encourage all personnel under their command to properly report information on events or situations that could pose threat to the security of dod personnel families facilities and resources i useucom standard 9 threat information flow commanders at all levels shall develop process to forward threat information throughout the chain of command to ensure maximum dissemination to all information pertaining to terrorist threat or acts of terrorism involving dod personnel or assets in the aor this notification system must include all dod elements and personnel who may be impacted by the information andor for whom the commander has atfp responsibility eg noncinc assigned forces in nato billets or other geographically separated units as well as appropriate us embassies 1 when notification to or coordination with an us embassy country team is required the us defense representative usdr will act as the uscinceur executive agent use guidance in annex c appendix 2 2 when local information gaps exist unit commanders should forward requests for information rfi via appropriate intelligence collection and production channels see annex b and accompanying appendices for more detailed guidance transiting forces shall be provided with tailored terrorist threat information in accordance with the guidance in annex for official use only m16 for official use only j useucom standard 10 potential threat of terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction wmd commanders at all levels shall take appropriate measures to protect dod personnel families facilities and materiel and reduce the vulnerability to terrorist use of wmd as minimum this shall include the development of estimates for potential terrorist use of wmd in their area of operation ao threat assessments and collection plans should address the essential elements of information eei of the terrorist capability to acquire and use of wmd immediately report through the chain of command when significant information is obtained identifying organizations with wmd capabilities operating in the ao k useucom standard 11 adjustment of force protection conditions commanders at all levels shall develop and document process based on terrorism threat information mission requirements andor guidance from higher headquarters to raise or lower force protection conditions all dod installations sites facilities and activities in the useucom aor shall comply with instructions in annex c appendix 2 and tab thereto l useucom standard 12 force protection condition measures implementation commanders shall ensure that force protection condition transition procedures and measures are properly disseminated and implemented within their ao an atfp plan with complete listing of sitespecific at measures linked to force protection condition will be classified as minimum confidential when separated from the atfp plan specific at measures and force protection conditions remain for official use only fouo all dod installations sites facilities and activities in the useucom aor shall comply with instructions in annex c appendix 2 m useucom standard 13 force protection condition measures commanders at all levels shall develop sitespecific measures or action tasks for each force protection condition using the security measuresactions required for each force protection condition per annex c appendix 2 tab 1 locally developed force protection condition measures should be tailored to the environment and mission as

using the guidelines and criteria in annex m appendix 1 and this appendix these criteria are in addition to any standards promulgated by their higher headquarters hhq command or cinc that constitute their chain of command in the event of conflict between standards the useucom standards will override the conflicting commands standards iaw dodd 200012 and dodi 200016 additionally commanders at all levels shall conduct internal atfp program reviews as well as program reviews of their immediate subordinates in the chain of command these atfp program reviews will be designed to determine compliance with dod and useucom atfp standards and will satisfy the requirements specified in standard 20 additionally local commanders will conduct vas using the guidelines provided in standard 26 and arrange for higher headquarters hhq vas to satisfy the frequency criteria specified in standard 26 table m12 2 concept the intent of hhq va is to assess an activitys overarching atfp program and to provide focused expertise to facilitate atfp enhancements the intent of local va is to provide the installation activity detailed comprehensive assessment that identifies vulnerabilities at the earliest juncture validates the local atfp plans by ensuring they are executable and ensures all stovepiped organizations either located on the installation or for whom the installationactivity has atfp responsibility are integrated into the local atfp planning directive and are afforded the same level of atfp support as local cincassigned forces locally conducted vas should provide the commander with all of the necessary data required to identify mission essential or vulnerable areas meva and to conduct mission risk assessments nothing precludes local commanders from combining the standard 20 program review and standard 26 va as long as both program objectives are achieved 3 assessment criteria local vas must be comprehensive review addressing the broad range of physical threats to all mission critical areas activities facilities resources and primary gathering facilities as defined in annex d appendix 1 hhq vas are not required to physically assess every single activity on the installation but instead must assess an appropriate number to confirm the effectiveness of atfp procedures which are in place for the entire installation site or activity additionally offinstallation housing should be incorporated in the assessments process using the guidance provided in standard 30 4 assessment team composition though team composition may vary based on the type of

this section provides an example of the activities an assessment or program review team may perform when preparing to provide an atfp assistance visit and upon completion of the field visit the tasks include the site survey actions and followon actions subsequent to the trip the length of an assessment may vary based on the nature of the assessment the example below is based on fiveday assessment schedule for specific requirements associated with joint staff integrated vulnerability assessments jsiva see paragraph 6 below preassessment preparations schedule assessments at least 30 day prior to the visit to allow specific travel requirements such as medical visa ticket cost minimization and threat and site information to be accommodated the assessmentprogram review team should coordinate the particulars of the visit with the installation poc including theatercountry clearances change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only m25 for official use only 1 the administrativelogistics preparations include any requirements for invitational travel orders passports visas inoculations insurance health and life and other legal issues and emergency information forms preparations also include travel arrangements tickets lodging or billeting travel kits pharmaceuticals and supplies equipment checkout and packagingshipping 2 security preparations include submitting requests for countrysite clearances identifying classified courier requirements coordinating secure storage identifying security representative presenting mandatory threat and security procedures briefing 3 the key element of preparation is the site folder development the site folder is the official record of all assessment team information gathering analysis recommendations and assistance for the installation commander critical aspect of the site folder formation is the intelligence information gathering relative to the terrorist threat 4 the team should obtain all intelligence on groups motivation intent tactics weapons activities and operating areas from dia jac molesworth and other sources request in advance complete list of activityinstallation characteristics including layouts drawings functions personnel and procedures be sent to the atfp assessment team or be made available upon arrival 5 obtain copy of the installationactivitys comprehensive atfp plan and any supporting plans or agreements at least 60 days in advance ensure all requiredcore assessment team members receive copy of these documents and review them prior to the assessment additionally as instructed by the commander directing the assessment provide copy of these documents to potential team members supplemental members such as medical chemical biological radiological and nuclear explosive ordnance disposal communication and information operations officers these officers should review the plan from the standpoint of their functional expertise they should make recommendations on the adequacy of the plan as it relates to their functional area recommend any follow up action and questions for the assessment team and if warranted recommend inclusion of additional functional experts on individual assessments for example if the commands medical officer does not believe identified concerns for particular assessment can be adequately addressed by requiredcore team members he or she should recommend inclusion of component medical expert on the assessment team when the assessment will be conducted by joint staff integrated vulnerability assessment jsiva team the component headquarters and ecsm will coordinate for the additional component functional expert to accompany the team in order to accomplish this coordination the component headquarters and ecsm must be officially informed of this request 30 days in

then inputs data relative to the assessment assessment specific data includes the team summary copy and paste from written report and commanders summary figure m1a20 change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only m2a15 for official use only eight critical program requirements are derived from dodi 200016 and identified in this opord selecting on any one of these requirements results in program assessed as red commanders summary is critical since this is the first place to identify commanders assessment of hisher atfp program priorities of work to address each vulnerability and document any risk assessment decisions the commander can also use this area to document decisions to change the overall program assessment for green to amber or red although it should be noted commander cannot change program assessment from red to amber or green without correcting the deficiency if it is one of the eight critical program requirements figure m1a21 c observation screen user inputs observation discussion options first select the specific category from the drop down list categories are limited to major areas in the jsiva reports and the same categories should be used for local assessments figure m1a22 change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only m2a16 for official use only enter observation data by either copy and pasting from the written report or compose the observation data directly into vamp funding decisions and command risk assessments may be based on the information in this block so the data should be specific so as to be easily understood by anyone reading it length of the input is only limited by other program restrictions ie any data printed to an excel spreadsheet is limited to 255 characters per field while the vamp observation block will accept pages of data observation should be concise and specific user must also annotate the appropriate classification otherwise vamp will return an error message use the jsiva observation classification or for local assessments refer to annex l of this opord for guidance figure m1a19 the discussion and options blocks are on the same page as the observations user should copy paste from original report or directly input options figure m1a23 change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only m2a17 for official use only use the discussion block to input discussion directly from the jsiva report or to further clarify an observation this is the area to amplify the observation with details to clearly describe the vulnerability for others not familiar with the observation also this is an area to identify commanders risk assessment decision following an assessment either hhq or local note if documenting commanders risk assessment decision use the abbreviation cra at the end of the text in the discussion block specifically adding cra will allow users to search the database and identify all observations andor vulnerabilities for which the commander has accepted the risk this is the area to document commanders decision to mitigate impact of vulnerabilities that are either impractical or too costly to correct for example if dormitory is within 10 meters of perimeter wall bordering an offbase road and the commander has decided to accept the risk in lower fpcons document the decision in the discussion block also include the appropriate compensatory measures in place to reduce the risk in higher fpcons this will be especially useful to brief new commanders on existing vulnerabilities accepted by the previous commander and the installations compensatory measures to mitigate the risk use the options block to identify specific alternatives including tactics techniques and procedures to mitigate the vulnerability do not necessarily address only resource requirements or technologies ensure the observation poc is accurate and not always the at officernco for example an observation in the fire dept should probably identify the fire chief as the poc the default for procedural observation is so if the observation is procedural select yes and vamp will not consider this observation in the prioritization of vulnerabilities the default for use rating scoring is yes so if this is procedural observation and the user does not change this setting the observation will be scored and prioritized with all other vulnerabilities to eliminate procedural observations from the scoring methodology select accept the default for programmatic vulnerabilities those requiring funds to score and prioritize the vulnerability since vamp only allows users to access vulnerabilities within their service users must select the appropriate block if other facilities affected selecting block here allows the responsible agencycomponent force protection office access to the data if photos are available and provide better understanding of the vulnerability vamp provides the ability again consider the impact of the photo to better represent your requirements for funding or concerns for risk assessments change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only m2a18 for official use only finally one of the most important aspects of vamp is the prioritization methodology user selects the most appropriate description from each drop down menu vamp assigns point values for each area and the current threat level and fpcon according to the vulnerability prioritization methodology reflected in the following categories figure m1a24 command priority indicates the responsible commanders priority ie installation wing or asgbsb commander commanders can only prioritize their top 10 vulnerabilities in the vamp methodology the current breakout of command priority provides the user with the current numbers of all ranked observations for an installationactivity do not exceed the limit one critical two high etc otherwise user risks skewing the data installation access controls identify the method of controlling access to the installationactivity regardless of the location of the vulnerability for example vulnerability resulting from public roadway adjacent to fenced installation with us forces on the entry gates should be identified as us controlledfenced activity population centers refers to the specific vulnerability not the entire installation symbolic value selfexplanatory security equipmentconstruction select the most appropriate category for the recommended corrective action vulnerability mitigatedcorrective action taken select the most appropriate rating if interim corrective actions or compensatory measures is the appropriate response be sure to explain commanders risk assessment decision on the corrective actions page at program effectiveness identify the part of the installation at program most significantly impacted by the vulnerability change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only m2a19 for official use only d corrective action screen user identifies what if any corrective action the installation will take to address the vulnerability figure m1a25 component and unit priority impact options will be removed under next revision ce tracking number ce is air force term for civil engineer input the engineer public works work order number provides ability for longterm project tracking project number enter the funding project number normally assigned by the component command after the fact important to keep this number linked to the ce tracking number since projects are funded by project number but completed by engineers work order number start date completion date design project status are input once the work actually begins proj poc at unit list the person actually responsible not necessarily the at nco or security officer corrective action status limited to 255 characters to fit into an excel spreadsheet otherwise characters are unlimited use to update the status of steps taken to mitigate the vulnerability place the date at the beginning of each entry to show when the update was accomplished be as specific as possible identifying corrective actions and if compensatory measures are possible identify commanders decision to accept the associated risk funding screen user completes funding data to identify requirements to higher headquarters specific directions for each data entry point are available through the hyperlink resource requirements worksheet on the page every item must be completed if unsure input na or unknown for boxes requiring key stroke entries data is limited to 255 characters since the end product is an excel spreadsheet items to consider obligation year realistically the obligation year will be the first year of the next ppbs cycle normally 2 fiscal years from the date entered for example data entered in 2002 will normally be considered for funding in fy05 oct 04 for change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only m2a20 for official use only emergent or emergency projects consider funding through the combating terrorism readiness initiatives fund cbt rif but still include data in the ppbs cycle since cbt rif is not guaranteed source of funding figure m1a26 change 1 08 mar 2002 for official use only m2a21 for official use only funding requirements m ensure you input costs in millions not thousands also consider lifecycle costs for maintenance repair or replacement for example new radios procured in fy04 will require annual maintenance contracts at the end of the normal 12month warranty period so include maintenance costs in fy 0690 also consider the replacement costs for new radios batteries etc after 35 years supplier information screen this section provides continuity and followup status for corrective actions requiring resources continuity of funding projects and corrective actions is dependent on documenting sources of supply so it is very important to complete this data entry once user identifies source of supply figure m1a27 the next step in adding new observation is reviewing the data by clicking the review observation button the next screen provides single page view of each piece of data entered on the six screens individual pages can be edited by selecting the corresponding edit button which will return you to the appropriate screen after correcting the data continue through the following pages until you return to the edit page it is not necessary to reenter correct data but you must select the commit button at the bottom of the edit page to commit data to vamp

terrorist acts should be considered as distinct possibility when planning visits of highranking personnel to the useucom aor as well as the travel of useucom high ranking personnel within the aor planning visits hosting and safeguarding these officials is essential to the success of the useucom mission and is clear demonstration of americas positive presence 2 mission to provide definitive guidance to ensure individuals designated as high risk personnel or serving in designated high risk billets are provided an appropriate level of protection within the useucom aor 3 execution scheme of support personnel may be designated high risk based on assignment to highrisk billet or based on personal factors regardless of position examples of the former include senior general officers serving in prominent positions who could serve as symbolic targets for terrorist attack and us military personnel of all ranks operating in area where there is an active insurgency or frequent antiusnato violence there are two levels of highrisk personnel hrp 1 level 1 hrp who have such significantly high potential as terrorist or criminal targets as to warrant assignment of fulltime protective services this would include longterm protective services based on assignment location or shortterm protective services based on specific threat 2 level 2 hrp who do not warrant assignment of fulltime protective services but require such additional office residential and travel security measures as deemed appropriate based on local conditions b tasks to subordinate units commanders at each echelon will follow the following guidance as appropriate to ensure the safety and security of individuals designated as hrp or assigned to highrisk billets 1 designation of hrp use service guidelines to determine who may make such designations the dcinceur will make any such designations for dod personnel and family members in the useucom aor who are not assigned to component commands for personnel

training specific to hrp and their protection is found in annex m appendix 5 in the absence of hosting unit when notified of an impending hrp visit the usdr should consider hrp personal protection the usdr should establish immediate contact with the us embassy rso and advise the rso of the impending visit the usdr should designate security poc for hrp visits to facilitate coordination the type of protection requested or desired by the hrp must first be ascertained full protection minimal high profile low profile etc request all host nation security assistance through the rso experience has shown host nation agencies receiving distinguished visitors do not necessarily initiate protective security measures as matter of course therefore make requests for such support through rso channels b if the useucom host activity is responsible for arranging proper security do the following g71g20 1 determine if there is high threat requiring special protective measures if the threat is not high then g71g20obtain secure accommodations g71g20obtain driver and vehicle g71g20request host nation security forces to provide security while the hrp are traveling in quarters visiting locations and at

above guidance the key words are detailed travel itineraries as opposed to limited extracts desk calendars scheduled meetings partial itineraries and announced appearances do not have to be classified unless there is specific threat to the hrp location or event 3 for unclassified schedules or portions of itineraries for hrp take precautions to avoid release of information earlier than necessary limit dissemination of details to those who have needtoknow and protect the fouo information where available use secure voice when hrp visit details are discussed by telephone in some instances facetoface coordination of visit arrangements are preferred to written notification of sensitive details 4 the necessity for release of hrp visit information to certain host nation agencies is recognized however make every effort to limit dissemination to those agencies directly supporting the hrp visit further the intent of this policy is to limit the ability of terrorist to obtain information on an itinerary far enough in advance to plan an attack consequently do not release information to host nation prematurely rather necessary information should be released as late as practical for the circumstances unique to each country finally the usdr should solicit the host nation to consider security in disseminating hrp travel information 5 although allinclusive rules to fit every occasion are impractical the following conditions generally increase the need to classify an itinerary g71g20receipt of specific threat information g71g20extensive hrp involvement in nonus

appendix 3 high risk personnel to annex m physical security to uscinceur atfp opord 0101 1 background transportation security is critical antiterrorism issue empirical data and statistical evidence clearly indicates this is one of if not the most vulnerable time periods for targeting and attack of high risk personnel by terrorists providing trained drivers is at least as important as other transportation security measures to include armored vehicles protective service details and special authority to use government transportation for unofficial travel home to work etc b armored vehicles are designed to provide additional protection and increase drivers ability to escape from an attack site without specialized driver training an armored vehicle loses much of its capability trained drivers first and foremost are aware of measures that reduce vulnerability they also learn how to detect potential threats and finally how to use evasive driving procedures if necessary msgt robert judd survived terrorist attack in normal vehicle because he knew and applied evasive driving procedures mr leamon hunt director general of the multinational force and observers was killed in an armored vehicle because his driver did not number of successful or near miss attacks may have been prevented foiled or reacted to in more appropriate fashion if the driver had been properly trained and had applied these lessons and skills the attack on general frederick kroesen is classic example of the latter c procedures exists to authorize highrisk personnel hrp the use of government transportation for unofficial travel hometowork etc if certain conditions are met such unofficial use must also satisfy number of irs requirements to avoid significant tax liabilities for example if driver is provided the valuation of such chauffeur services is the amount that an individual would have to pay in an armslength transaction to obtain the same or comparable chauffeur services in the geographical area including the time the chauffeur is on call as well as actual driving time treasury regulation 16121b5ia to exempt this value from taxable income the individual must meet certain requirements if an employer provides an employee with vehicle transportation and bodyguardchauffeur for bona fide businessoriented security concern and but for the bona fide businessoriented security concern the employee would not have had bodyguard or chauffeur then the entire value of the services of the bodyguard chauffeur is excludable from gross income as working condition fringe for purposes of this section bodyguard chauffeur must be trained in evasive driving techniques an individual who performs services as driver for an employee is not bodyguardchauffeur if the individual is not trained in evasive driving techniques thus part of the value of services from such an individual is excludable from gross income under paragraph m 5 treasury regulation 1325 m5 for official use only m3d2 for official use only 2 policy the following personnel will successfully complete antiterrorist evasive driver training 1 personnel who operate nontactical armored vehicles for the purpose of transporting hrp 2 personnel assigned to drive for individuals officially designated as hrp see annex m appendix 3 of this opord 3 service members and dod civilians who have been officially designated as an hrp and frequently operate government vehicles 4 personnel assigned to drive for individuals who are authorized the use of government transportation for unofficial travel due to security reasons 5 personnel who are authorized the use of government transportation for unofficial travel due to security reasons and drive the government vehicle themselves b antiterrorism evasive driver training should be considered for service members and dod civilians who are permanently stationed in an area where the terrorism threat level is high and frequently operate government vehicles off of us facility c antiterrorist evasive driver training courses must be approved by dod an individual service defense agency eg dia dtra or other us government department eg justice fbi state department the evasive driver training can be separate or part of related course eg protective service agent training d proficiency in evasive driving requires periodic training since these unique and generally unused skills are perishable all personnel required to attend an evasive driving course should receive refresher training and be provided the opportunity to practice these skills at least annually maximize the use of incountry training opportunities mobile training teams defense agencies us embassy regional security officers etc 3 driver qualifications selecting driver is at the discretion of the individual charged with hiring the driver using guidance provided by hisher service or agency the following information should assist those personnel who may not be familiar with desirable characteristics for specialized driver particularly when screening local national hires an interview can help to determine the drivers ability to speak and understand english an interview can also provide insight into how the candidate feels about driving under hazardous conditions about damaging the vehicle in attempting to avoid an attack and the drivers knowledge concerning his duties having the candidate take road test can provide invaluable information characteristics to look for include the drivers general comfort level with operating the vehicle coordination style of driving overly

personnel who are in combat zone or hostile fire area or personnel who carry weapon as normal course of their duties such as law enforcement or security personnel b this appendix does not supersede service component command authority vested by their various services to authorize the use of firearms for personal protection 2 policy it is the dod policy to limit and control the carrying of firearms by dod personnel an authorization to carry firearms may be issued only when there is reasonable expectation that life or property will be jeopardized if firearms are not carried evaluation of the necessity to carry firearm shall be made considering this expectation and the possible consequences of accidental or indiscriminate use of firearms authorization will be for period not to exceed 1 year users may request an extension of the authorization continual evaluation of the threat will be conducted to determine the need to extend or terminate the authorization to carry firearms 3 procedures military personnel may be authorized to carry government owned firearms for personal protection in the useucom aor only after intelligence analysis identifies credible threat against the us personnel in the area firearms will not be issued indiscriminately for this purpose for all personnel other than those assignedattached and under the authority of service component commander uscinceur or his designated representatives the deputy uscinceur or hq useucom chief of staff are the only individuals who may authorize personnel on casebycase basis to carry firearms for personal protection authorization is only applicable for the geographic location approved by uscinceur or his designated representative b any person issued weapon for personal protection must receive in advance qualification and certification training on the weapon to be carried in addition prior to submitting the request commanders must screen the individuals medical and personnel records to ensure

to uscinceur atfp opord 0101 references see basic order 1 purpose when used in this appendix the term mail applies to all mail packages and parcel deliveries both intertheater and intratheater to include apos international mail localhost nation postal services and commercial delivery services such as ups fedex dhl etc the intent of the appendix is to assist in developing procedures and employing detection capabilities to prevent the introduction of an explosive device or other harmful material by means of the mail systems into us facilities or other locations where us personnel or employees are located use of this tactic to date has been very limited but aggressors could resort to this tactic at any time as we continue to harden our facilities and implement effective force protection condition atfp measures to defeat other types of threats attempts may be made to use the mail systems for hostile purposes we must develop and exercise plans and capabilities to increase our defenses against attempted attacks through the mail systems these plans exercises and capabilities will serve as deterrents will increase our ability to defend ourselves should such attacks be identified as threat and will increase our chances of thwarting an unpredicted attack 2 concept prior to implementing this strategy or elements thereof review your existing mail reception and delivery systems also review existing assessment reports andor conduct supplemental vulnerability assessmentrisk assessment of these operations to determine potential vulnerabilities associated with mail delivery use these assessments to determine the most vulnerable points within the process and develop potential means of reducing these vulnerabilities the example measuresactions detailed below are good starting point to correct potential vulnerabilities all procedures and recommended action must be coordinated with the local atfp program manager and the local atfp working group members do not attempt to develop these procedures without consulting mail organizations military policesecurity forces explosive ordnance disposal eod unit fire departments engineers and your medical support element all activities that receive mail should be included in this coordination to ensure current or proposed procedures are comprehensive and functionally sound upon final approval these procedures must become part of the basic installation security plan 3 mail screening minimum training and standard operating procedures development mail screening procedures have proven very effective major part of such screening is visual and physical recognition although some of the indicators or warning signs listed below seem obvious in daytoday routine they can be easily overlooked even those installations with the best screening technologies need to train their mail handlers to use these basicscreening techniques the first step in effectively screening mail is to ensure all mail is routed through at least one person trained to screen postal material for signs it might contain an explosive for official use only m62 for official use only device ideally all mail would be routed through central point for screening and distribution should such an arrangement prove impractical personnel at all receiving points apo front offices hotel desk clerks etc should be trained in identifying suspect mail the following list of recognition features for suspect mail should be used by personnel handling processing and delivering mail at all levels special emphasis should be given to training professional postal personnel and to staffs of identified high risk personnel hrp indicators of suspect postal material g71g20letters feel rigid appear uneven or lopsided or are bulkier than normal g71g20oil stains are present on the wrapper g71g20excessive amounts of postage are used g71g20sender is unknown or return address is given g71g20name and title of addressee are not accurate g71g20the address is prepared to ensure anonymity of the sender eg homemade labels cut andpaste lettering g71g20the addressee does not normally receive personal mail at the office g71g20handwriting of sender appears distorted or indicates foreign style not normally encountered g71g20weight the letter or package seems heavy for its size letters will normally weigh up to 1 ounce effective postal bombs will weigh more than 2 ounces and require more postage they may be unusually thick ie 316 inch or more g71g20weight of the package is uneven g71g20package has an irregular shape soft spots or bulges g71g20cancellation or postmark location is different from the return address location g71g20protruding wires tinfoil strings or components some devices have come apart in the mail g71g20mailing appears to have been disassembled or reglued g71g20several combinations of tape are used to secure the parcel g71g20wrapping shows evidence of previous use or suspicious traces of glue mailing labels return addresses or tape g71g20the package emits peculiar smell or suspicious odors may smell like almonds or shoe polish g71g20contents of the parcel make sloshing sound g71g20package makes buzzing or ticking noise this is unusual for mail type device but could be present for an explosive device that is delivered by local delivery service g71g20loose components rattle around g71g20a small hole in the envelope or package wrapping provision for an armingsafety wire g71g20restrictive markings eg confidential personal g71g20unprofessionally wrapped parcel is endorsed fragile handle with care or do not delay g71g20misspellings of common words g71g20visual distractions such as pornography or currency g71g20pressure or resistance is noted when removing the contents 4 suspect package handling procedures for official use only m63 for official use only develop procedures using united states postal service usps guidelines in coordination with eod and mpsf to respond to suspect mail some basic guidelines follow g71g20do not open the article g71g20isolate the package and secure the immediate area contact the mpsf who will establish cordon and contact the responsible eod element g71g20do not put the article in water or confined space such as desk drawer safe or filing cabinet eod will need ready access to the suspect packagepre coordinate suspicious package sops with your responsible eod and mpsf g71g20if possible open windows and doors in the immediate area to assist in venting pressure should an explosion occur evacuate adjacent rooms upper lower and sides and adjacent outside areas g71g20once contact is made with the emergency response element make sure you have someone who is familiar with the device location and other specifics immediately available to meet the first responders to describe the item and to expedite access b establishing quick reaction checklist qrc for dealing with suspect packages and posting it where mail clerks have ready access to it may be helpful in ensuring all required steps are taken when reacting to suspicious mail 5 more advanced screening techniques and equipment before expending limited resources to procure scanning system evaluate the threat determine your requirements employ low cost solutions and consult technical references and official sources of assistance determine how and where you plan to use scanning device conducting an assessment of the mailpackage delivery process on your installationfacility is an ideal way to determine your requirements once you understand your local process then determine what procedural measures could be changed to streamline and centralize the process ideally all mail should be delivered to one central mailroom or other delivery point for screening and subsequent distribution if you decide to establish maildelivery screening area consider locating this facility to take into account the addition of other security screening devices such as explosives detection equipment also since an explosive or other dangerous device could be delivered to such facility place these facilities away from any sensitive equipment or facilities that hold large numbers of personnel b technological experts have validated that large volume mail screening is costly and in many cases requires significant additional manpower and equipment shortterm and lower cost solutions include use of available military explosive detector dog teams eddts and onhand xray machines while eddts are recognized as being highly effective they also have limitations and more importantly are already overtasked any use of this high demand resource will take direct coordination with your local security forcesmilitary police if available these teams can quickly and effectively for official use only m64 for official use only screen packages and delivery trucks include the use of eddts in your plans and exercises as random antiterrorism measure ram to the extent possible exercise coordination for and use of these assets on regular basis quarterly if possible additionally use available technology although the xray screening devices currently in use have many limitations they do provide additional capability over simple visual examination and increase the potential for identifying an explosive device c longterm solutions will require prescreening of mail in an effort to cut down on the quantity of mail that will require detailed technological examination backscatter xray metal detection etc some potential prescreening techniques follow separate official personal and foreign mail official and foreign mail is probably more likely terrorist target examine high profilehigh risk personnels mailpackages with available technology for example commanders designated high risk personnel hrp and personnel in the news use the suspect mail screening guide in paragraph 3 aboveuse technology to screen those that fit the suspect criteria for example only screen packages or letters weighing more than 1 ounce effective postal bombs will weigh more than 2 ounces and require more postage d for installations that are examining procurement of explosive detection equipment ede the department of defense has established home page detailing variety of resources and materials on ede and the ede program httpwwwexplosiv edetectionnfescnavymil this site also includes technical information library that has summary of current explosive detection technology in addition the site contains the catalog of explosive detection equipment and other ede program products the site also provides threepage document procurement considerations and provides detailed list of questions that you can present to ede vendors prior to ordering finally command science advisors and component and eucom atfp offices may be of assistance in defining your requirements and identifying appropriate ede to fulfill your needs 6 summary to date use of postal and package delivery systems to introduce bomb or harmful material onto dod facilities has been very limited but aggressors could resort to this tactic at any time prudent policies and procedures must be developed and implemented to prevent such attacks should they be attempted without warning and to prepare for them should intelligence sources provide warnings of such attacks initial steps should include implementing low cost measures such as manual screening of mail using onhand technology such as xray machines and periodically employing eddts to increase our capability to screen more mail on more regular basis we should establish screening procedures identify technological solutions and obtain funding for them through the normal budgeting process emphasis should be placed on making everyone from professional postal personnel to individual service for official use only m65 for official use only members and civilian employees aware of the characteristics of suspect packages and procedures for handling suspect packages
