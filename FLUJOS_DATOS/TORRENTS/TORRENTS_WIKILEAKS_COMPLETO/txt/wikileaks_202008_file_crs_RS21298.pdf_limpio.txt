access to scores awareness and understanding of scoring sy stems consistency of scor and accuracy of scores credit scores are not easily explained the score provides picture of the consumers credit history and worthiness at one point in time when the score is calculated lenders and ot her businesses may use thei r own credit scoring model different scoring models for different purposes or generi c model developed by credit scoring company credit scoring models use complex statistical formulas and the models vary among creditors and for different types of credit technological advances have allowed large number of predictive variab to be rapidly evaluated during the calculation of credit score models can be solely based on in formation from credit reports or the model may in clude other

three bureaus independently collect data on indivi dual consumers and use this information to create consumer credit report the fair credit reporting act fcra3 provides consumer protections to deal with inaccurate and inappropriate use of personal information the fcra sets out requirement s for all consumer reporting agencies and users of credit information four categorie s of data are collected for credit report personal information credit history pub lic record information and inquiries4 data in an individuals credit report will then be fed into creditscoring model and used to calculate credit score credit report files are c ontinually updated as the bureaus receive new information since they work independently the three bureaus do not necessarily collect identical information and the three use vari ous models therefore not only can credit scores frequently change but each agency can generate different score for the same consumerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21298crs3 5 for additional information concerning cred it scores and insurance see crs report rs21341 credit scores creditbased insurance scores by baird webel five factors scoring models generally evaluate five factors from credit report when calculating credit score different weights can be ssigned to each factor for different types of credit applications the five are payment hi story amounts owed length of credit history new credit accounts or requests and types of credit accounts payment history is usually heavily weig hted factor payment information on many types of accounts is collected in credit re port accounts include credit cards retail accounts credit from stores finance co mpany accounts and mortgage loans consumers timely payment of bills such as phone or gas does not influence this factor unless consumers account has been sent to collection agency late or missed payment information would in clude details such as how late amount owed and how recent was the event also included in this factor are public record and collection items including bankruptcies foreclosur suits and wage attachments amounts owed is also significant factor in credit scoring this factor evaluates the amount of debt consumer has compared to his or her credit limit is the consumer over extended any amount owed on all accounts is considered and different types of accounts are compared outstanding debt is compared with the original loan amounts the length of consumers credit histor provides credit track record how long have accounts been established in general the longer an individual has had credit history the better an insufficient cred it history including credit history can negatively affect score applying for new credit can affect cr edit scores how many new accounts does consumer have requests for credit generate inquiries reque sts by lenders to get copy of an individuals credit report applyi ng for too many new accounts can negatively affect score inquiries by creditors who are monitoring consum ers account or looking at credit reports to make presc reened offers are not counted how many and what types of credit account s an individual has affects ones credit profile while it is ge nerally good to have tablished credit accounts too many or certain types of credit accounts may aff ect score negatively some scoring systems do not rate loans from finance companies favorably policy issues the pervasive use of credit scoring has ra ised concerns about consumer awareness of and access to credit scores as well as the consistency and accuracy of scoring systems credit scores are standard factor in cons umer credit decisions and are increasingly used as rating variable in insurance underwriting5 in addition employers have used credit scores to evaluate job appli cants and landlords have used them judge prospective tenantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21298crs4 so credit scores are being used not only to measure consumers credit worthiness but also as factor in the ev aluation of consumers fina ncial stability responsibility and potential risk the use of credit scores in mortgage lending has generated most of the legislative attention the use of credit sc oring in noncreditrela ted businesses has been increasingly controversial in part because the connection between credit scores and insurance or renting is not obvious until recently the credit scoring industry did not provide consumers with access to their credit scores public pressure nd 2001 california state law prompted wider availability of credit scores nationwide still many cons umers first knowledge of the existence and importance of credit scores comes as result of not qualifying for loan consumer advocates stat that more needs to be done to educate consumers about credit scores to make the scoring systems more transparent and to provide consumers less costly or free access to their scores the fcra permits credit bureaus to charge up to 900 for credit report and allows additional fees for credit scores for exampl fico scores have been available from equifax as part of credit profile packag for 1295 consumer is entitled to free report if the consumer was nied credit or was notified by an insurance company of an adverse action based on info rmation provided by credit bureau the consumer must place request within 60 days of either of those events consumers have been entitled to free annual credit bureau re ports upon request under state w in six states colorado georgia maryland massachusetts new jersey and vermont consumer can end up with multitude of scores depending on the credit data used and the scoring model scor are available from variety of score providers and some lenders fees vary in addition the credit score the consumer pays for may not be the score particular lender used in the lending decisionmaking process consumer can have difficult time discovering what score was used individual lenders or insurance companies do not always provide this information just as important as obtaining the sc ore is understanding what it represents especially if consumer want s to improve it consumer advocates argue that complete disclosure of exactly what factors were cons idered and how they are weighted is required to really understand score fu ll disclosure they say would also allow testing of scoring models and formulas to determine how accurately they evaluate consumers the computations involved in scoring models ar closely guarded proprietary information score providers such as fair isaac co mpany have published some explanatory information to help consumer s understand scores but they say to disclose more about their model would hurt the company competitively they say they would in effect be giving away what they are currently selling consumer advocates have argued that steps need to be taken to assure the same credit information is submitted to each bureau to minimize the differences between the credit reports generated if the information filed with credit bureaus were more consistent then the scores calculated from th eir credit reports would vary less advocates also backed better and more consistent reporting of positive credit information to enhance the accuracy of credit reports httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21298crs5 6 credit score accuracy and implications for consumers report by the consumer federation of america and the national cred it reporting association dec 17 2002p47 7 for more information on the preemp tion provisions see crs report rs21449 fair credit reporting act preemp tion of state law by angie welborn in december 2002 the consumer federati on of america and the national credit reporting association published study of the accuracy of credit scores and credit report information6 the study was based on survey of 502623 archived credit files generated by request for the reports and scores fro m all three national credit reporting agencies the study found that scores from the three bur eaus for consumer varied substantially many credit files had additional reports that did not belong to the consumers file and many had conflicting information the reports provided limited information to help individuals understand their pa rticular score the study concluded that while many consumers are unharmed by these findings milli ons of consumers are at risk of being adversely affected by inaccurate information and incorrect scores the potential exists for individuals to either be denied credit or be placed into more expensive pricing range consumers can take steps to ensure the calculations are made on accurate information individuals can request their credit reports from all three major bureaus and check for incorrect or obsol ete information correcting mistakes can be costly time consuming and frustrating the bureau s 30 days to confirm an entry with the reporting creditor and must make changes to the credit report if the mistake is confirmed if creditor fails to respond the entry must be removed this may require follow up inquiry by the consumer to make sure correc ting steps were taken therefore consumer may need to begin the process well in advance of applying for credit to guard against an adverse lending decision while correcting mistakes can improve consumers score this is not guaranteed outcome because the consumer does not know how particular entry fits into an individual scoring formula in addition scor ing models may be ba sed on more than the information found in credit report for ex ample the model may include data from the loan application such as employment history legislation congress established consumer credit protections with the enactment of several laws dealing with specific credit practices incl uding the fcra in 1970 the fcra has been amended to meet the developing needs of consumers for credit protections congress continues to monitor the effectiveness of th fcras provisions as the use of consumer credit
