largest source of direct aid supporting students postsecondary educational pursuits in award year ay 20082009 it is estimated that these pr ograms will provide 72 billion in new loans to students and their parents under the ffel program loan capital is provided by private lenders and the federal government guarantees lenders ag ainst loss through borrower default death permanent disability or in

different sources of capital and different administrativ structures but essentially disburse the same set of loans subsidized stafford loans and unsubsidized stafford loans for undergraduate graduate and professional students plus loans for graduate and professional student s and parents of undergraduate dependent students and consolidation loans through which borro wers may combine their federal student loans into single loan payable over l onger term which varies according to the combined loan balance the loans made through the ffel and dl programs are lowinterest loans with maximum interest rates for each type of loan established by statute subsidized stafford loans are needbased loans and are only available to students demonstrating financial need the secretary pays the interest that accrues on subsidized stafford loans while borrowers are in school dur ing sixmonth grace period and during authorized periods of deferment unsubs idized stafford loans and plus loans are nonneedbased

action taken by these entities s hould not limit the secretarys authority with regard to the llr program nor the secretarys authority to purchase loans previously made under the ffel program the ec

has been the subject of default determination bankruptcy discharge foreclosure re possession tax lien wage garnis hment or writeoff of title iv debt8 regulations have also required lenders to retain record of the basis for determining that extenuating circumstan ces existed for any borrower such as an updated credit report or doc umentation from the creditor that the borrower has made satisfactory arrangements to repay the debt9 the ecasla amended the hea to specify certain extenuating circumstances under which eligible lenders may extend plus loans to individuals who otherwise would have been determined to have adverse credit hi stories this amendment permitted eligible lenders to determine that extenuating circumstances existed if during the period from january 1 2007 through december 31 2009 an applicant was more than 180 days delinquent on mort gage payments for primary residence or medical bill payments or if an appli cant was more than 89 days delinquent on any

provides the secretary with authority to take range of actions to restore the availability of llr loans prior to the enactment of the ecasla the hea authorized the secretary to make emergency advances of federal funds to guaranty agencies for purposes of making available llr loans if the secretary determined that borrowers eligible fo r subsidized stafford loans were unable to obtain such loans b that the guaranty agency had the capability to provide llr loans but could not do so without an adva nce of federal capital and c that it would be costeffective to advance such funds the hea also specified that the secretary was authorized to make em ergency advances of federa l capital funds to another guaranty agency for purposes of making llr loans if the secretary determined that the designated guaranty agency for state did not have the capacity to make available llr loans however while the statute au thorized the secretary to advance funds to guaranty agencies for purposes of making llr loans it did not clearly provide nor identify source of funds for the secret ary to draw upon to make such advances this ambiguity in the statute led to deliberation over the extent of the secretarys authority to advance funds to guaranty ag encies for purposes of making llr loans12 under the ecasla several amendments were made to the llr program these are briefly described below student eligibility for llr loans previously the hea specified that guaranty agencies had an obligation to ensure that llr loans would be made available to students eligible to borrow subsidized
