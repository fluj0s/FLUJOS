108th congress the security and freedom ensured act of 2003 safe act estela i velez pollack legislative attorney american law division summary this report is section by section expl anation of the effects of s 1709 the safe act on current law the safe act wa s introduced in the 108th congress to amend the usa patriot act to pl ace reasonable limitations on the use of surveillance and the issuance of search warrants section 1 short title section 1 of the bill contains the short title the security and freedom ensured act of 2003 or safe act section 2 limitation on roving wiretaps under the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 proposed amendment of 50 usc 1805c1 section 1805c1 lists the information required to be specified in an order approving an electronic surveillance subparagraphs and b of this section stat that an order for an electronic surveillance would need to specify amongst other things the identity if known or description of the target and b the natu re and location of each of th facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance will be directed if known therefore the statute allows for orders to be issued without requiring the g overnment to specifically identify the target or the place of the electr onic surveillance section 2 of the safe act proposes to amend 50 usc 1805c1 in two ways by requiring an order for electronic surveillance hereinafter referred to as order to identify either the target of the order or the place the safe act proposes to amend 1805c by adding language that would require that if the identity of the target is not known the order provide scription of the target and the nature and location of the facilities and places at which the electronic rveillance will be directed furthermore in cases where the facilities or places of surv eillance are not known it would require the order to identify the target in effect the safe act would only allow electronichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21743crs2 1 this interpretation is based on the common meaning of the words may and will may is defined as indicating possibility or probability while will is used to express inevitability merriam webster s collegiate dictionary 767 1433 11th ed 2003surveillances in instances wher either the identity of the target or the location of the surveillance is known and would longer llow an electronic surveillance where neither the target nor the place of the surveillance is known b proposed amendment of 50 usc 1805c2 title 50 usc 1805c2 currently places restrictions on when the surveillance of place may be conducted thus allowing an order for the electronic surveillance of location to be conducted at any time and without specific ta rget identified or present at the location section 2 of the safe act proposes to ame nd this section by adding an additional requirement that b in cases where the f acility or place at which the surveillance will be directed is not known at the time the order is issued that the rveillance be conducted only when the presence of the ta rget at particular facility or place is ascertained by the person conducting the surveillance the safe act would only allow for the electronic surveillance of location when the target of the surveillance is present and not at any time section 3 limitation on authority to delay notice of search warrants proposed amendment of 18 usc 3103ab1 title 18 usc 3103ab1 addresses the circumstances under which notice of the execution of search warrant may be delayed it states that notice of search warrant may be delayed if the court finds reasonable cause to believe that providing immediate notification of the execution of the warrant may have an adverse result s defined in section 2705 emphasis added in turn 2705 defines adverse result as being 1 endangering the life or physical safety of an individual 2 flight from prosecution 3 destruction or tampering with evidence 4 intimidation of potential witnesses or catchall provision 5 otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying trial therefore under current law the government can delay giving notice of search warrant if it can show that there is possibility th at any of the abovementioned results would occur the safe act proposes to amend 3103ab1 by striking may have an adverse result as defined in section 2705 and inserting in its pl ace will endanger the life or physical safety of an individual b resu lt in flight from prosecution or c result in the destruction of or tampering with the ev idence sought under the warrant the effect of the amendment is twofold first by changing may to will the government would longer be able to show just possibility of the listed negative results but it would be required to show that any one of these results is inevitable1 second the proposed amendment would narrow the list of negative results that would be considered when determining if delay in notice is needed by deleting two of the results 1 intimidation of potential witnesses and the catchall provision 2 otherwise seriously jeopardize an investigation or unduly lay trial this proposed amendment addresses the criticisms of the usa patriot act on its departure from the fourth amendment standards for searches and seizures th fourth amendment provides protection fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21743crs3 2 see terry v ohio 392 us

2003statement of sen craigwarrantless searches and seizures subject to very specific exceptions more commonly known as exigent circumstances2 the usa patriot act has been criticized for its deviation from those very narrowly tailo red exceptions by creating exceptions not currently considered exigent circum stances under the fourth amendment3 this amendment is meant to bring the usa patriot act back into parallel with the exigent circumstances exceptions of the fourth amendment b proposed amendment of 18 usc 3103ab2 title 18 usc 3103ab2 discusses the timetable for providi ng notice of the execution of search warrant the current law allows for notification to take place within reasonable period of its execution and allows for extens ions by court for good cause shown accordingly there are specific time limits for notification and instead it is left for the courts to determine how long reasonable period of time is additionally current law does not put cap on the length of the extensi ons granted by the courts in effect allowing for an indefinite extension the amendment proposed by section 3 of th safe act seeks to strike the language within reasonable period and instead set more specific timetable for the notifications and the granting of extensions it would re quire that notification be given later than 7 days after the execution of the warrant and it would allow for extensions of that period of time by more than 7 days at time furthermore the amendment would change the standard for determining the need of an extension from good cause shown which allows for more subjective interpretation to more objective and specific standard it would require that it be proven that notice of the execution of the warrant will 1 endanger the life or physical safety of an individual 2 re sult in flight from prosecution or 3 result in the destruction of or tampering with the evidence sought under the warrant once again note the use of the word will in the amendment which creates higher standard than the one in the current law also while the current law does not state who is allowed to request the extensions on the notificati ons the proposed amendment would require that the request be made by the attorney gene ral the deputy attorney general or an associate attorney general c addition of new subsection to 18 usc 3103a in addition section 3 of the safe act proposes to add one more subsection to 3103a subsection c the proposed subsection c would impose new requirement on the attorney general for reports to congress on the request s made for delays of notice and extensions of delays of notice it would require report to be submitted every 6 months stating how many requests for delay of notice with respect to warrants have been gr anted denied or are pending and for each request for delayed noti ce that was granted the number of requests for extensions of the delay of notice categor ized as granted denied or pending the proposed amendments would give congress the ability to monitor the notification processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21743crs4 4 tangible things includes books records papers documents and other items 50 usc 1861a1d sunset provision finally section 3 of the safe act proposes to add the proposed amendments of 18 usc 3 103a to th sunset provision of the usa patriot act it would therefore make the current law expire on december 31 2005 however it would allow the current law to rema in in effect and be applicable to those investigations which predate the imple mentation of the proposed amendment section 4 privacy protections for library bookseller and other personal records under foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 proposed amendment of section 501b2 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 50 usc 1861b2 title 50 usc 1861 addresses the requirements for seek ing the production of tangible things4 hereinafter referred to as records for foreign intelligence and international terrorism investigations subsection b2 requires th government to specify that the records sought are for an authorized investigation to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning united states person or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities it allows the government to put in request for the production of records from any person so long as it states that it is for an authorized investigation it does not restrict the produc tion by ownership of the records but rather only by the reason for the requested produc tion the proposed amendment would add requirement that the records sought belong to person who is believed to be foreign power or an agent of foreign power it would longer make it possible for the government to seek records concerning an person but only those for whom it provides specific and articulable facts to believe that they are foreign power or an agent of foreign power b proposed amendm ent of section 501c1 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 50 usc 1861c1 title 50 usc 1861c1 requires that judge find that th application for the production of records meets the requirements under 1861a and b section 4 of the safe act seeks to amend 1861c1 by adding an additiona l finding that the judge reviewing the application must make prior to granting th application the am endment would require the judge to not only find that the applica tion meets the requirements of the section but also to make an independent finding that t here are specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the person to whom th records pertain is foreign power or an agent of foreign power it would require that the application is sought based on the subject of the records and not solely on their relevance c proposed amendments of section 502a of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 50 usc 1862a title 50 usc 1862 states that the attorney general is required to fully inform the permanent select committee on intelligence of the house of representatives and the select committee on intelligence of the senate concerning all requests for th production of documents under 50 usc

safe act proposes to add an exception to this sec tion which would exclude libraries from being considered wire or electronic comm unication service providers the proposed amendment would narrow the definition of wire and electronic communication service provider for purposes of 18 usc 2709 b addition of new subsection to 18 usc 2709 section 5 of the safe act seeks to add new subsection subsecti on f to 18 usc 2709 this subsection would provide the definition of library for purposes of 18 usc 2709 library would include public library public ementary or secondary school library an academic

part of an institution of higher education or private library or other special library but only if the state in which such private or special library is located determines that the library should be
