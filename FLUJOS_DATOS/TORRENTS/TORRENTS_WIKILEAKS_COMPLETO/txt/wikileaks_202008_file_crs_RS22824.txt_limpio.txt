of 2008 however prices are likely to exhibit substantial variability until global stock levels can be rebuilt the initial impetus for rising prices over the past year has been 30year low in global stocks following seven out of eight years in which global consumption exceeded production however in recent months several other factors including reluctance of traditional exporters to make further supplies available to international markets strong international demand the rapid growth in the demand for grains and oilseeds as feedstock for biofuels production and usdas announcement that last falls winter wheat plantings were less than expected have contributed to sharp rise in cash and futures contract prices particularly for higherprotein wheat varieties this report will be updated as events warrant background wheat is grown in almost every temperatezone country of north america europe asia and south america the largest wheatproducing countries are china india the united states russia canada and australia us wheat production accounts for about 910 of world production but the united states is the worlds leading wheat exporter with roughly 25 share of annual world trade however the international wheat market is very competitive and foreign sales often hinge on wheat variety and product characteristics as well as price1 1 crs report rl33204 price determination in agricultural commodity markets primer by continued crs2 us wheat is produced as both winter and spring crop2 the united states produces all six of the worlds major wheat classes hard red winter hrw hard red spring hrs soft red winter srw hard white soft white and durum hard wheats generally contain higher protein levels desirable trait for bread making while softer wheats may be preferable for making noodles crackers and pastries durum wheat is ground into coarse flour called semolina that is used for making pastas in local markets the demand for particular wheat class and quality relative to its nearby supply will determine local prices traditional higherprotein wheats command premium over lowerprotein varieties often referred to as the protein premium figure 1 however linkages to national and global markets bring additional factors such as transportation costs competitors supplies and foreign demand into play in determining the price of particular wheat type and quality wheat

larger the share of exports to production the greater the vulnerability to international market forces in the us domestic market flour millers are the major users of wheat milling about 24 of annual wheat production into flour since 20003 in most cases wheat buyer at flour mill will source wheat by general location and primary quality attributes such as protein quantity and quality ie gluten share and baking performance price premiums andor discounts reflecting quality differences often develop and can also influence buyer preferences other major wheat processors include breakfast food pet food and feed manufacturers wheat may be used directly in feed rations when alternate feedstuffs are lacking or when productionrelated quality damage makes the wheat unmarketable as food wheat milling byproducts such as bran shorts and middlings are also used by feed manufacturers in the production of animal feeds 1 continued randy schnepf 2 for current data and information on us and world

situation and outlook yearbook whs2007 usda ers march 2007 crs3 key factors contributing to higher wheat prices in 20074 poor harvests in many major wheatproducing countries early in 2007 estimates of australias wheat production and exports were reduced because of severe drought in 2006 then latespring freeze damage in the united states and heavy rains at harvest in the united states and western europe reduced the output and quality of wheat next dry weather hurt crops in eastern europe and some countries of the former soviet union drought in southeastern europe reduced that areas wheat and corn crops forcing livestock producers in the european union eu to import wheat and feed grains for feed rations by midsummer it became apparent that canada and the ukraine would reap smaller wheat crops because of poor weather conditions limited export supplies the production shortfalls curtailed exports from most traditional wheat exporters in the spring of 2007 both ukraine and argentina initiated export restrictions in efforts to control food price inflation the ukraine imposed ban on wheat exports and argentina stopped issuing export registrations which significantly slowed export sales during the rest of the year although the eu was able to export wheat without export subsidies shipments out of the eu slowed sharply by late summer as httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22824 wheat increasingly replaced corn used for feed by early fall only the united states russia and kazakhstan had large volumes of wheat available for export recently kazakhstan officials have said that they also intend on slowing their countrys wheat export pace via higher custom duties due to declining supplies5 strong international demand projected tight us supplies combined with reduced export competition caused importers to buy us wheat in late 2007 at pace not seen since the 1970s us wheat export sales were very strong despite higher prices and recordhigh ocean freight rates imports by highincome countries which are not very price sensitive followed normal seasonal purchase patterns however number of low and middleincome countries generally expected to be more sensitive to price changes continued to purchase wheat even while prices were rising some importers even bought larger amounts at record high prices apparently out of fear that less wheat would be available in the future and prices would be even higher in most years us wheat export shipments decline seasonally during the winter spring and summer months but in 2007 shipments generally rose during this period significantly exceeding expectations almost every month in august and september us wheat export volume spiked rising from monthly averages of less than 25 million metric tons to more than 4 million tons this occurred as wheat prices climbed to record highs record high outstanding export sales ie wheat that has been purchased but not yet exported suggest that many importers have already purchased their future needs far in advance of normal purchasing patterns and that large monthly us wheat shipments can be expected to continue for some months to come regardless of future price movements 4

have also risen sharply in recent months white wheat is used to produce very popular type of noodle eaten throughout eastern asia australia is traditionally the worlds largest supplier of white wheat but last years droughtreduced harvest drastically limited its export supplies as result china and other asian countries have been competing for dwindling us and international supplies of white wheat and this has pushed prices sharply higher pressures from other crops that compete for the same area us wheat planted area has been steadily declining for the past 40 years as low relative returns have led many farmers to shift to other more profitable activities this phenomenon has clearly been evident in the northern plains where the development of shortseason corn and soybean varieties has

about 4 as result assuming normal weather and average yields us wheat production is expected to rise by nearly 13 in addition usda projects that global wheat plantings and output will rise substantially although official estimate for 2008 global production is released until may larger global wheat supplies are expected to significantly reduce international demand for us wheat in the latter half of 2008 thus the combination of higher production and lower exports is expected to allow us domestic wheat stocks to rebuild and wheat prices to decline from their early 2007 peaks while remaining high relative to past years markets are likely to exhibit substantial price variability until global stock levels can be rebuilt longterm outlook10 as the global supply rebounds from the shortfalls of 2007 higher projected production is expected to facilitate the rebuilding of stocks and the return of prices to the 4 to 5 per bushel range over the next five to tenyear period food price effects domestic food price inflation the rise in agricultural prices combined with high oil prices have contributed to higher food inflation in the united states and around the world us food prices increased by 4 during 2007 the highest oneyear rise since 1990 prices for cereals and bakery products were up by 44 usda predicts that food price inflation for 2008 will be in the range of 3 to 4 while bakery goods are expected to rise by 55 to 6511 inflation concerns were further heightened when the us bureau of labor statistics announced that food prices had jumped by 17 during the 9 grain

briefing room food cpi prices and expenditures ers usda february 25 2008 crs6 month of january 2008 the biggest monthly increase in three years12 despite the sharp increases in commodity prices in 2007 most economists agree that fuel costs have played larger role in food price inflation than have commodity prices13 in general retail food prices are much less volatile than farmlevel prices and tend to rise by fraction of the change in farm prices this is because the actual farm product represents only small share of the eventual retail price whereas transportation processing packaging advertising handling and other costs all vulnerable to higher fuel prices comprise the majority of the final sales price international food prices and aid due to trade linkages high commodity prices ripple through international markets where impacts vary widely based on grain import dependence and the ability to respond to higher commodity prices import dependent developing country markets are put at greater food security risk due to the higher cost of imported commodities the overall impact to consumers from higher food prices depends on the proportion of income that is spent on food since food costs represent relatively small share of consumer spending for most us households about 10 food price increases from httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22824 whatever source are absorbed relatively easily in the short run however lowincome consumers spend much greater proportion of their income on food than do highincome consumers their larger share combined with less flexibility to adjust expenditures in other budget areas means that any increase in food prices potentially could cause hardship in particular lowerincome households in many foreign markets where food imports are an important share of national consumption and where food expenses represent larger portion of the household budget may be affected by higher food prices14 humanitarian groups have expressed concern for the potential difficulties that higher grain prices imply for developing countries that are net food importers15 international food aid is the united states major response to reducing global hunger16 because most us food aid activities are fixed in value by annual appropriations the amount of commodities that can be purchased declines with rising food prices in 2006 the united states provided 21 billion of such assistance which paid for the delivery and distribution of more than 3 million metric tons of us agricultural commodities the united states provided food aid to 65 countries in 2006 more than
