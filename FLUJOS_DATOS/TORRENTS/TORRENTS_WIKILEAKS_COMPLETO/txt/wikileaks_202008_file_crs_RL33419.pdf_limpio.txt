issues rebecca rskinner and richard n apling domestic social policy division may 11 2006 abstract before the proposed changes in s 250 can be analyzed it is critical to develop an understanding of how state grants are determined under current law as such this report provides detailed analysis of the formula currently used to determine state grants focusing on provisions that result in states receiving larger state grants than they would have if only population and per capita income pci factors were included in the formula it also includes brief discussion of minimum grant provisions from prior vocational education laws followed by an examination of the changes s 250 would make to the current state grant formula the subsequent sections of the report consider the amount of funding required to provide all states with minimum grant of at least and analyze additional strategies to accomplish similar outcomes to those that may be achieved under s

vocational and technical education act of 1998 pl 105332 referred to as current law one major issue is the formula used to determine basic state grants referred to as state grants while hr 366 the vocational nd technical education for the future act would not alter the formula used to determin state grants s 250 the carl d perkins career and technical edu cation improvement act of 2005 would make substantive changes to the formula these bills have been passed by the house and senate respectively this report provides deta iled examination of the state grant formula under current law focusing particularly on provisions that result in states receiving larger grants than they would have if only popul ation and per capita income pci factors were considered the results demonstrate that multiple st ates receive substantial increase in funding over their initial alloca tion due to factors other than population and per capita income this increase in funding is supported by ratable reduction for all other state grants it should be noted however that provisions added during the 1990 reauthorization of vo cational education limited the increases in funding that states could receive above their initial allocation as result eight states do not receive the full minimum grant of ½ of total funding this is followed by an analysis of the changes s 250 would make to the current state grant formula s 250 would elimin ate provisions that prevent states from receiving the full minimum grant of ½ it would also use any new funding that exceeds the fy2006 appropriation to provide th eight states that do not receive minimum grant of ½ with minimum gr ant award prior to distributing any additional funding to the other states s 250 also contains hold harmless provision that in the absence of an increase in appropriations would also provide the eight states with minimum grant of ½ by ratably reducing the grants received by all other states several alternatives to the formula proposed in s 250 are also discussed one set of strategies provides alternatives to the hold harmless provisions included in s 250 the remaining strategies are design ed to provide the aforementioned eight states with additional funding while also llowing other states to benefit immediately from increases in appropriations rather than having to wait for the eight states to reach minimum grant of ½ these strategies are offered for discussion purposes only crs takes position with respect to these alternatives this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33419contents c u r r n t l w 1

its analyses do not take into account tech prep funding under current law techpre p funding is determin ed independently of state grants hr 366 would combine stat grant funding and techprep funding into single state grant program while s 250 would retain current law given the complexities of dealing solely with the state grant formula and the uncertainty concerning whether the two programs w ill be combined techprep funding is not included in the analyses current law this section begins with an examina tion of how grant amounts are determined under current law this is followed by discussion of the estimated fy2006 grant awards and how these awards compare to states initial allocations the section concludes with an analysis of the amount of funding provided to each state on per person basishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33419crs2 1 the virgin islands and puerto rico are required to be assigned an allotment ratio of 060calculation of grants under current law the initial factors that determine state grants are population factors and per capita income population is based on the number of individuals in three age groups nd the total number of individuals in these age groups each of these groups is weig hted in formula that calculates total population the largest weight 05 is ssigned to the age group including persons aged 15 to 19 the age group including persons aged 20 to 24 is assigned weight of 02 while the age group including persons aged 25 to 65 is assigned weight of 015 the final age group included in the calculation includes all individuals aged 15 to 65 and is assigned weight of 015 thus among states with similar number of people aged 15 to 65 states with rela tively younger populations will have higher weighted population count than states whose populations are relatively older per capita income also affects the we ighted population count for each state through an allotment ratio per capita income is defined as the total personal income in state divided by the population of the st ate for the purposes of determining state grants each state is assigned an allotment ratio the allotment ratio is calculated by dividing the pci for given state by the pci for all states combined the result is multiplied by 05 and subtracted from one th is calculation assigns higher values to states with pcis lower than the national average and lower values to states with higherthanaverage pcis state however may have an allotment ratio higher than 060 or lower than 0401 this allotment ratio is multiplied by the total number of individuals in each of the aforementione d age groups prior to the weighting of the population counts in each group the inclusion of pci in the formula helps to provide states with lower pcis with dditional grant funds and vice versa the resulting calculation of state grants based on population and pci factors is referred to as states initial allocation column b in table 1 details what these estimated grant amounts

prepared by crs apr 17 2006 based on unpublished state estimates provided by the us department of education budg et service notes details may not add to totals due to rounding the final strategy for determining the state grants column reflects the relev ant requirement in the state grant formula that determines the states grants ratably reduced means that states initial grant was at or above the 05 minimum grant amo unt thus the grant was subsequently ratably reduced to provide states whose initial allocations were below the 05 minimum grant amount with additional funding the expression 150 nappp means that states grant was u ltimately determined based on the states population multiplied by 150 of the nappp ½ minimum grant means that states grant was u ltimately determined to be the minimum grant of ½ and fy1998 means that the state was held harmless at its fy1998 state grant amount weighted perperson funding was c alculated using the weighted population counts that are used in determining state grants these are estimated grants only in addition to other limitations some of the data that will be used to calculate final grant s are not yet available these estimates are provided solely to assist in comparisons of the relative impact of alternative fo rmulas and funding levels in the legislative process they ar not intended to predict specific amounts states will receivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33419crs7 2 the nappp is determined for each state by dividing the total amount allocated to all states by total population ages 15 to 65 in all states the resulting amount the national average per pupil payment is then multiplied by each states total unweighted population count for individuals aged 15 to 65 3 ratable reduction refers to the reduction of ea ch states grants except for those receiving some minimum grant amount by the same percentage notice in column g of table 1 that many states have their initial allocation reduced by 162 4 states other than delaware that have th eir estimated fy2006 grants based on 150 of the nappp include montana south dakota and the virgin islandsunder current law there are several provisions that alter these initial allocations to ensure that states allocation is below certain minimum grant levels one minimum amount is the states fy1998 grant the other minimum is ½ of the total allocated to states the ½ minimum may be adjusted based on the following calculations first it is determined what the state would receive if provided with minimum grant of ½ this amount is compared with the grant amount that would be awarded to the state under special rule that provides the state with the lesser of 1 150 of their prior year grant or 2 state population multiplied by 150 of the national average per pupil payment nappp2 based on these calculations the state then receives the lesser of ½ of total funding or the grant amount calculated under the special rule referred to as the adju sted ½ minimum grant this amount is subsequently compared with the amount the state received in fy1998 and the larger amount is awarded for states whose initial grants exceed the minimum grant amount of ½ their initial llocations are ratably reduced3 to provide states whose initial allocations were below the ½ minimum grant with their final grants however the resulting ratably reduced grants may be further adjusted it the results fall below states fy1998 grant or the adjusted ½ minimum grant amount for state figure 1 and four examples are provided to demonstrate how the formula works in practice example 1 delaware based on population and pci fact ors delaware would recei ve an initial allocation of 29 million or 025 of total funding as this is below minimum grant of ½ 58 million minimum grant of ½ is calcu lated and the special rule is used to determine delawares final award under the special rule delaware would receive 74 million based on 150 of its prior year grant and 48 million when state population is multiplied by 150 of the nappp the smaller of these two payments is the latter this is then compared with the minimum grant amount of ½ as the amount obtained by multiplying the state s populati on by 150 of the national average perpupil payment is the smaller of the two grant amounts but is greater than delawares fy1998 grant laware receives the 48 million4 this is referred to as the 150 nappp strategy in column d of table 1 example 2 hawaii based on population and pci factors hawaii would recei ve an initial allocation of 49 million or 042 of total funding as this is below

states other than alaska that have th eir estimated fy2006 grants based on their fy1998 grants include north dakota vermont west virginia wyoming and the district of columbia 7 all states not previously mentioned in ex amples 1 2 or 3 have their initial allocation determined by population and pci factors and th eir final grants determined after ratable reduction to support increases in the initial alloca tions of states whose initial allocations are less than ½ of total funding approximate ly 39 states had their estimated fy2006 grants determined based on this strategyexample 3 alaska based on population and pci factors alaska would receive an initial allocation of 28 million 024 of total funding as this is below minimum grant of ½ 58 million minimum grant of ½ is calcu lated and the special rule is used to determine alaskas final aw ard under the special rule alaska would receive 63 million based on 150 of its prior year gr ant and 40 million when state population is multiplied by 150 of the na ppp the smaller of these two payments is the latter this is then compared with the minimum grant amount of ½ the grant amount based on state population and 150 of the nappp is less than the amount that would be provided by minimum grant of ½ the former is then compared with the grant amount received by alas ka in fy1998 which was 42 million since the fy1998 hold harmless amount is greater th an the amount that would be provided through the formula alaska receives the hold harmless amount6 this is referred to as the fy1998 grant strategy in column d of table 1 example 4 california based on population and pci fact ors california would recei ve an initial allocation of 1309 million 1132 of total funding since this grant amount is higher than the states adjusted ½ minimum grant californias initial allocation is ratably reduced by 162 or 21 million to support grants to states whose initial allocation did not provide them with state grant that ex ceeded the ½ minimum grant this is referred to as the ratably reduced strategy in column d of table 1 for states whose initial allocation is subject to ratable reduction the ratably reduced amount is compared with the states fy1998 grant amount and its adjusted ½ minimum grant the largest amount is awarded for example since californias ratably reduced amount is greater than its fy1998 grant and its adjusted ½ minimum grant california receives its initial allocation minus 1627 estimated fy2006 grants columns f g and h in table 1 provide each states estimated fy2006 final grant amount the change in the grant amount from initial allocation to fina l allocation the percentage change in funding between the initial and final allocati on and the states final per centage of total funding respectively using the special rule to determine state grants and the fy1998 hold harmless rather than populati on and pci factors only results in an increase in funding for 13 states and the virgin islands and 162 decrease in funding for all other states table 1 for example the use of th provisions results in wyoming receiving more than twice as much funding as it would have received under the initial allocation in addition under current law the eight states receiving less than the minimum grant of 05 receive between 24 montana and 186 district ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33419crs11 8 the allotment ratio was not included in this calculation as the focus was on determining the weighted count of individuals wit hout adjusting for per capita income 9 the vocational education act of 1963 was also amended by the vocational education amendments of 1968 pl 90576 but these am endments did not modify the state grant formulacolumbia more than they would have received if grants were based solely on population and pci perperson funding state grants can also be analyzed based on how much funding the state receives for each pers on included in the population count as previously discussed the population count is based on the population in each of three age groups and total population across the three age groups in determining per person funding each of these populations wa s weighted by the factors assigned to each population group for the calculation of st ate grants eg 05 for individuals aged 15 to 19 dividing estimated fy2006 state grants by this weighted population count produces the amount of funding state received for each person8 as depicted in table 1 there is substantial variab ility in perperson funding by state more specifically among states receiving less than the minimum grant of 05 in fy2006 including the virgin islands perperson funding ranges from 2484 south dakota to 3483 wyoming exceeding the level of perperson funding provided to all other states which ra nges from 1240 massachusetts to 2315 rhode island minimum state grant amounts under prior laws this section examines minimum grant provisions in federal vocational education laws beginning with the voca tional education act of 1963 pl 88210 while this act did not mark the beginning of federal involve ment in vocational education the state grant formula included in the act provided framework for subsequent legislation under the vocational education act of 1963 state grants were calculated using only population and pci factors all stat were guaranteed minimum grant of 10000 the vocational education act of 1963 wa s amended in 1984 by the carl d perkins vocational education ac t perkins i pl 985249 perkins i replaced the 10000 minimum grant with minimum grant of ½ of total funds not to exceed 150 of states prior year grant it also included provision that held states harmless at their fy1984 grant amounts unde r perkins i states that were receiving less than the minimum grant of ½ gradually received increases in their grant amounts but these increases were limited by the 150 cap on yeartoyear increases by fy1989 all states reached the minimum grant amount of ½ and continued to receive the minimum grant amount in fy1990 the carl d perkins vocational nd applied technology education act amendments of 1990 perkins ii pl 101392 further amended the state granthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33419crs12 10 states that were not subject to the second t of calculations were held harmless at their fy1985 grant amount this resulted for example in massachusetts receiving its fy1985 grant amount until fy2002 with the exception of fy1992 when massachusetts received slightly higher allotment 11 for example delaware montana and sout h dakota have exceeded their fy1991 grant amounts but have not reached the minimum grant amount of ½ of total funding 12 for additional information about other change s that would be made to current law by s 250 see crs report

nappp the special rule also included provision that held states harmless at their fy1991 grant amounts10 this effectively left states that received less than the minimum grant of ½ in fy1991 at the same amount they received in fy1990 42 million as amounts for these states we re identical in fy1991 and fy1990 over time handful of these states eventually exceeded their fy1991 grant amounts11 the carl d perkins vocational and t echnical education act of 1998 perkins iii pl 105332 retained the state grant formula used in perkins ii but modified the hold harmless provision to hold all states harmless at their fy1998 grant amounts regardless of whether they were subject to second set of calculations this effectively left alaska district of co lumbia north dakota vermont and wyoming at their fy1990 grant amounts as their grant amounts did not change from fy1990 through fy1998 s 250 changes to curre nt state grant formula the senate bill would alter the current formula in several ways12 first it would eliminate the use of the special rule that is state grants would be based on population and pci factors onl while retaining the min imum grant of ½ provision as result the senate formul would provide the eight states13 that receive less than ½ of the total grant with increases in their state grants until they reached the minimum grant of ½ provided appropriations in succeeding year were higher than they were in fy2006 hereafter referred to as new funding more specifically any new funding available to support state grants would be provided to these eight states based on an inverse proportion of how far the state is from receiving the minimum grant of ½ ie states furthest below ½ of total funding would receive higher amounts than states cl osest to ½ of total funding

least ½ while also providing most other states with small increase in funding the eight states that receive estimated st ate grants below the minimum grant of ½ in fy2006 would receive increases ra

amount of ½ most other states would receive increases of 003 ranging from 2000 to 40000 any subsequent increases in funding would also require funds to be used to ensure ll states receive the minimum grant amount of ½ or as close to it as possible prior to providing funding increases to any other states it should be noted that these calculations use the sa popula tion and pci factors used to calculated estimated fy2006 gr ants changes in these factors would result in additional changes in the amount nd percentage of funds received by states with grant amounts over ½ of total funding for example states with growing populations would receive more funding th an those with constant or declining populations s 250 also includes hold harmless provision from fy2007 through fy2009 states would be held harmless at thei r fy2006 grant level provided appropriations are sufficient to provide this level of funding14 from fy2010 through fy2012 the hold harmless provision would change to at least 95 of the prior year grant amount assuming constant ppropriations this would allow states with growing populations to receive increased grant amounts from stat that are not experiencing population growth or have below average rate of increase15 it would also allow states that were not receiving the minimum grant of ½ to move closer to or reach this level of funding increased funding to states receiving less than the minimum grant amount of ½ and states with growing popul ations would be f unded by reducing the grant amounts for all other states unde r the provisions of s 250

providing states with minimum grants as previously discussed based on fy 2006 current timates of state grants eight states would receive less than ½ of total funding determining the amount of funding required to provide these st ates with minimum grant of ½ without changing any of the current formula provi sions is complicated because any increases in funding to provide these minimum grants results in an increase in overall funding and related increase in the value of minimum grant while it was not possible to estimate th exact amount of funding required to provide the ½ minimum grants under the current law formula with its 150 of nappp cap it appears that overall funding would have to more than quadruple this would be significant increase in funding to accomplish the goal of providing eight states with minimum grant of ½ u nder the formula proposed by s 250 overall funding would also have to increase to meet this goal but only by about 112 million as any funding in excess of the fy2006 appropriated amount would be directed to the eight states until they reached the minimum grant amount of ½ one additional strategy for providing the eight states with ½ minimum grant without significantly increasing overall f unding would be to determine how much additional funding would be needed in give n fiscal year to increase their grants to the desired level and provide that amount of funding as separate line item for example for fy2006 minimum grant of ½ would be 5780000 based on the estimated state grants these ei ght states would receive table 1 an additional 105 million would be needed to provide them with minimum grants of ½ additional funding may need to be provided in subse quent years if appropriations increase and congress wants to continue providing th states with minimum grant of ½ this strategy requires providing funding out side of the current law formula or the formula proposed in s 250 if the 105 milli on was provided to the eight states via either the current law or s 250 formul the additional 105 million would increase the minimum grant from 5780000 to 5832000 this in turn would require additional funding to provi minimum grants of ½ resulting in the need to increase overall funding and so forth alternative strategies this section discusses alte rnatives to those proposed in s 250 the first set of strategies addresses the hol d harmless provisions containe d in s 250 specifically if appropriations are held consta nt at their fy2006 level th other strategies focus on providing the aforementioned eight states with minimum grant of ½ or at least providing them with increases over their fy2006 estimated grant levels both strategies would result in increased funding for the eight states over time but rely on increased appropriations rather than re ductions in fy2006 current estimated state grants to support the increases and neither strategy would result in other states receiving less than their estimated fy2006 grant hold harmless provisions if appropriations for state grants remain constant at their fy2006 level there are several possible altern atives to the hold harmless provisions included in s 250 for example states could be held harmless at their fy2006 grant amounts through fy2012 while this does not accommodatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33419crs21 population increases or provide states r eceiving less than the minimum grant of ½ with additional funding it does guarantee that all states would continue to receive at least what they received in fy2006 assumin g appropriations are constant second alternative would be to modify the hold harmless provision to hold states harmless at 95 of their fy2006 grant amount rather than their prior year grant amount in fy2010 through fy2012 this would prevent states from continually losing money each year while continuing to provide add itional funding to states with increasing populations and states receiving less than the minimum grant of ½ third alternative would be to set the hold rmless percentage for fy2010 through fy2012 at higher amount such as 97½ and either apply that higher percentage to states fy2006 grant amount or to their prior year grant amount this would reduce the amount by which states could fall below their fy2006 grant amount while still providing funding increases to states ex periencing population growth and to provide states receiving less than the minimum gr ant of ½ with additional funding fourth alternative would be to continue to apply the current law hold harmless provision and hold states harmless at 100 of the fy1998 grant amount finally another alternative that coul d be applied to veral of the aforementioned alternatives would be to only use the hold harmless provi sion to provide additional funds to states with growing populations rather than also providing add itional f unding to states receiving less than the minimum grant amount of ½ this would prevent other states from having their fy2006 grant amount s reduced to provide states receiving less than the minimum grant of ½ with additional funding increased funding based on overall increases in funding under this strategy states that received less than minimum grant of ½ in fy2006 would be guaranteed the same percentage increas in funding as the percentage increase in total funding for state grants for example if total funding for state grants increased by 1 all states that received grants of less than ½ during the prior year would receive guaranteed 1 increase in funding the remaining funds could be distributed using the current formula the formula propos ed under s 250 or another formula agreed to by congress for example in fy2006 alaska north dakota vermont wyoming and the district of co lumbia would receive estimated grants of 4215000 1 increase in total appr opriations to 1167461000 and subsequent 1 increase in their grants would provide them with grants of 4257000 while this is still below the 5915000 that would be required for minimum grant of ½ assuming 1 increase in appropriations it would provide these states with their first increase in funding since fy1990 guaranteed percentage of new funding this strategy is similar to the formula proposed under s 250 but instead of providing the states that received estimated state grants of less than ½ in fy2006 with as much available new funding as is required to provide these states with minimum grant of ½ these states would receive guaranteed percen tage of any new funding such as 30 or 75 depending on the agreed upon percen tage and amount of new funding these states may reach minimum grant of ½ in year over several years or not at all but they would receive additional funding at the same time other states would also benefit from new funding immediately as opposed to having to wait for the eight states to reach minimum grant of ½ they would not however benefit as much as they would if funds were setaside for these eight stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33419crs22 conclusion while changes have been made over time to limit the amount of additional funding states may receive above their in itial allocations the current state grant formula provides substantial increases in funding to states that would otherwise receive smaller grant amounts if only popula tion and pci factors were considered in making grants s 250 would alter the cu rrent formula to provide additional funding specifically to the eight states that receive less than the minimum grant of ½ while also eliminating the provisions included in the current formula that hold grant amounts for these states below the minimu m grant of ½ the senate formula would use any new funding available fo r state grants that exceed the fy2006 appropriation to provide these eight states with minimum grant of ½ or to move them closer to the minimum grant amount depending on the amount of new funding available if new funding becomes av ailable the s 250 proposed formula would rely on hold harmless provisions that ultimately decline to increase the grant amounts to these eight states and provide add itional funding to states with growing populations by decreasing grant amounts to ot her states these reductions in funding could be mitigated for example by establishing higher hold harmless provision for fy2010 through fy2012 andor by only allowi ng funds to shift from one state to another to accommodate changes in popula tion if new money becomes available funding could be increased for the eight stat while also providing other states with increased funding rather than having thei r funding levels rema in constant until the eight states reach the minimum grant amount of ½ this could be accomplished for example by providing th eight states with an in crease in funding proportional to the overall increase in total funding or by providing them with dedicated percentage of new funding rather than as much funding as needed to provide them with minimum grant of ½
