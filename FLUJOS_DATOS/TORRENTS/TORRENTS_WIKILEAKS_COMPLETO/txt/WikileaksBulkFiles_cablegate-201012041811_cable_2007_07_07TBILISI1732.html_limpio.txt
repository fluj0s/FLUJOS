leaders statements the russian economic embargo the separatist conflicts and number of other public ways but they also play out on level that is at least slightly below the surface russian active measures or covert actions aimed at georgia this cable summarizes some of the suspected russian active measures undertaken in recent years ranging from missile attacks and murder plots to host of smallerscale actions it is long list and it is very much on the minds of georgian leaders as they make decisions about how to deal with moscow for many of the suspected russian activities such as blowing up georgian police car or plotting to kill an opposition figure or even the missile attack in kodori in march it is difficult to understand what the russians hoped to gain that would be worth the risk of exposure georgian officials often tell us that russia has set out on policy of regime change in georgia doubt the russians would like to see saakashvili removed but the variety and extent of the active measures suggests the deeper goal is turning georgia from its euroatlantic orientation back into the russian fold even the smaller of the active measures serve this purpose by promoting sense of instability which the perpetrators may hope will scare off georgias wouldbe european partners andor provoke the georgian leadership into rash reaction that separates georgia further from the west as high russian fsb official reportedly told georgian counterpart recently russias goal is not abkhazia or south ossetia but all of georgia ref c while the russians typically make some efforts to reduce their fingerprints on actions making it hard to say with 100 certainty that they are responsible for many of them the cumulative weight of the evidence of the last few years suggests that the russians are aggressively playing highstakes covert game and they consider few if any holds barred end introduction and comment direct military attack 2 c probably the most notorious recent incident was the missile attack on georgian positions in the upper kodori gorge on the night of may 1112 2007 as documented by unled joint investigation the attack included one or more helicopters that apparently fired missile into the headquarters of the georgianbacked governmentinexile of abkhazia as well as groundfired missiles that struck near other targets in the area investigators have told us privately that they agree with the georgians that only russia could have launched the attack noting that while the final written report does not directly assign blame any reasonable person would conclude from it that russia was responsible ref b russia did not make any serious effort to cooperate with the investigation claiming its caucasus radar systems were turned off at the time of the attack leaving it with records to share georgian officials strongly suspect that subsequent violation of their airspace may 20 was russian attempt to plant false evidence regarding the groundbased firings although in the end investigators did not visit the area in question 3 c march 11 was not the first time the russians were believed to have conducted bombing raid on georgian territory russian planes were widely believed to be responsible for bombing of the kodori in october 2001 and for bombings of the pankisi gorge georgian area that borders chechnya in 2001 and 2002 drawing criticism from the usg and elsewhere in the international community despite russian denials of responsibility murders and attempted murders tbilisi 00001732 002 of 004 4 u on february 1 2005 bomb exploded in car at the police station in gori the largest georgian city close to south ossetia killing three georgian police officers following an investigation georgian minister of internal affairs merabishvili said publicly that the bombing was masterminded by russian military intelligence gru officer anatoly sinitsyn ref leader of the gru team that was subsequently broken up in the september 2006 spy arrests see paragraph 8 5 sbu on june 8 2006 neighbors approached suspicious man loitering around the home of koba davitashvili leading opposition politician the man fired two shots from gun equipped with silencer slightly wounding one of the neighbors and fled he left behind small bag that included newspaper photo of davitashvili and russian cell phone company sim cards following georgian investigation minister of internal affairs merabishvili publicly identified the suspect as giorgi kurtaev russian citizen who had been monitoring davitashvili for several weeks with one interruption for travel back to russia following the june 8 incident kurtaev fled again to russia from where georgian officials unsuccessfully sought to extradite him georgian officials have stated publicly that the incident was provocation perpetrated by foreign intelligence service and an attempt to discredit the saakashvili government ref h sabotage 6 c on january 22 2006 nearsimultaneous explosions in the russian region of north ossetia ripped into natural gas pipelines running from russia into georgia later that day an explosion in the karacheyevocherkessia republic in russia knocked out highvoltage line supplying georgia with electricity ref m the attacks immediately plunged georgia into major energy crisis with virtually ability to heat homes in the coldest part of winter the russian government claimed these were terrorist attacks but saakashvili repeatedly suggested the russian government was responsible for the wellcoordinated attacks in heavily monitored part of the north caucasus ref n this impression was further reinforced in georgian minds by the fact that the gas magically resumed just as armenia which receives its gas through georgia was about to exhaust its reserves 7 c in september 2006 the georgian government arrested 29 activists of igor giorgadzes justice party on charges of planning an explosion outside the headquarters of the ruling national movement intended to be the prelude to coup evidence included seized bombmaking equipment recorded conversations and the testimony of ten witnesses giorgadze himself is former georgian minister of security believed to be living in russia to avoid georgian warrant for his arrest in connection with 1995 assassination attempt against thenpresident shevardnadze his justice party has never been popular in georgia and it was widely believed that the party was funded almost exclusively from russia refs f and g it is interesting that one of the defendants maia topuria has hired two usbased lawyers and washington law firm to lobby nato and nato capitals over alleged rule of law abuses with regard to the case espionage 8 sbu georgian authorities arrested four russian military officers and eleven georgians for espionage on september 27 2006 the georgian government subsequently released evidence collected over long investigation including video footage showing money being exchanged for documents as well as audio tapes and transcripts of incriminating conversations between the russian officers and their georgian agents ref d according to the georgian government this russian operation was conducted by the same gru team responsible for the deadly gori bombing in 2005 georgia released the officers october 2 after which russia cut air links to georgia and began campaign of deportation and harassment of georgians living in russia reportedly resulting in four deaths of georgian citizens 9 sbu in april 2006 prokremlin television journalist in moscow aired recorded cellphone conversations between givi targamadze chair of the georgian parliaments defense committee and contacts in the lithuanian mfa and in washington in which targamadze is critical of belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkevich in one recording targamadze appears to speak of having milinkevich killed it is widely believed in georgian political circles that russian electronic eavesdropping is everpresent this case appears to confirm that suspicion with the eavesdroppers apparently deciding that the conversations perhaps doctored or tbilisi 00001732 003 of 004 selectively edited were so embarrassing to targamadze and milinkevich that it was worth it to make them public support for separatists 10 c the russian government has provided direct if at times thinly veiled support to the separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia without informing or obtaining the consent of the georgian government in south ossetia many facto cabinet ministers and advisors to kokoity are russian officials in most cases believed to be fsb serving rotation in south ossetia before returning to work in russia it is widely understood that russia is paying in full or in part the salaries of police and other civil servants in south ossetia and that russia recently increased these payments as disincentive for south ossetian officials to defect to the georgianbacked temporary administrative unit of dmitry sanakoyev the south ossetians have reportedly received arms and equipment from russia including grad missiles on various occasions including during recent tensions ref the russians undertook number of unilateral construction projects in south ossetia in 2006 that they later claimed were in fulfillment of russias pledge to the osce donors economic rehabilitation program but in fact took place outside the donors program as well as in violation of 2000 agreement on georgianrussian economic cooperation that calls for economic projects in coordination with all sides russia is widely reported to be working on projects to connect south ossetia to russian gas and telephone networks russia has distributed passports widely to residents of south ossetia and abkhazia to such an extent that kokoity has claimed to usg officials that 95 percent of the population of south ossetia is made up of dual russian citizens refs i and 11 c the facto government of abkhazia appears to have somewhat greater degree of independence from moscow than does its counterpart in south ossetia russia is considered more aligned with the abkhaz opposition led by facto vicepresident khajimba who despite russian backing lost the 2004 presidential contest to current facto president bagapsh nevertheless it is clear russia has great leverage over bagapsh who frequently travels to moscow for consultations not to mention trip to moscow for emergency medical treatment in april getting there the georgians tell us on an fsb plane several sources have also told us that senior fsb officer actually lives in separate residence on bagapshs presidential compound an abkhaz representative told the ambassador in the fall of 2006 that russia was at the time putting strong pressure on bagapsh to attack the georgians in response to their successful operation in july in the upper kodori gorge georgian officials do not believe that the abkhaz were aware of the march kodori missile attacks in advance but that the abkhaz are required to accept the russians use of their territory for such incidents russian peacekeepers in abkhazia have committed or permitted the abkhaz to commit repeated violations of existing agreements ref l support for minority extremists 12 c georgian officials in tbilisi and akhalkalaki as well as local community leaders and political activists have confirmed that the russian government has funded radical ethnicarmenian nationalists in samtskhejavakheti in bid to destabilize this mutliethnic politically fragile region tensions peaked during spring 2006 when scattered violent demonstrations occurred in akhalkalaki in march ref k following the murder of an ethnic armenian in the city of tsalka and on may 2 ref j when protesters briefly halted sipdis the first stage of russian base withdrawal as the withdrawal moved ahead disturbances in akhalkalaki dropped off precipitously lending credence to georgian allegations that the tensions were being stoked by elements operating from within the russian base disinformation 13 c it is especially difficult to nail down the origin of any of the multitude of rumors conspiracy theories and political speculation in georgia but georgian officials are convinced that russian services are making an active effort to spread false information designed to undercut the saakashvili government and to deflect responsibility for provocative actions away from russia onto other alleged culprits one particularly tangible example of disinformation serving russian interests was psychological study of saakashvili widely disseminated by email in january 2007 from an address purporting to be the georgian association for strategic and international studies the study makes number of highly prejudicial judgments about tbilisi 00001732 004 of 004 saakashvili and diagnoses him as suffering from an expansive type of paranoid dysfunctioncombined with narcissist type of hysteroid personality post had never heard of the organization that distributed the study many recipients likely confused it with the respected georgian foundation for strategic and international studies which receives support from the us embassy and check of the tbilisi street where it was supposedly located revealed that its address did not exist tefft
