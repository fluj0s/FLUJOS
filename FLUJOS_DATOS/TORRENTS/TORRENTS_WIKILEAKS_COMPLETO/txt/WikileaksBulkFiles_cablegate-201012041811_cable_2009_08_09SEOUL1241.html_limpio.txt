the alliance between the us and the republic of korea rok is strong enduring and strategically important your visit follows the successful june 16 usrok presidential summit and adoption of the joint vision statement the joint vision statement was wellreceived here both for its recommitment to continued strengthening of our security relationship including its affirmation of the us nuclear umbrella and extended deterrence to the rok and for outlining what 21st century usrok relationship entails to realize this vision we will need to continue to expand our cooperation both regionally and globally security in the region particularly in view of north koreas continued belligerent posture and kim jongils declining health is important to korean officials like us the rok supports the six party talks and remains adamant that we should not recognize north korea as nuclear state your south korean interlocutors are very interested in how you view the proposed north korean contingency plan and prospects for denuclearizing north korea 2 c president lee has faced criticism from his opponents for his inability to generate momentum for the koreaus korus fta in washington ratification of the fta is seen as sign of americas strategic commitment in northeast asia president obamas statement at the april g20 meeting with lee that the us wanted to find way forward on the korus fta allayed some of the anxiety in seoul and enabled lee to push the fta through the committee of jurisdiction in koreas national assembly in late april full plenary vote in the national assembly has not been scheduled while opponents are vocal the korus fta continues to receive about 60 percent approval korean public opinion polls is strongly supported by the majority gnp party and is expected to pass once there is some sign of movement in washington the obama administration is conducting thorough review of the korus fta and consulting closely with all stakeholders to understand the exact nature of their concerns and to develop recommendations for addressing them to assist with this review and to ensure that all who may have an interest in this free trade agreement are able to fully express their views we issued federal register notice on july 27 2009 requesting comments on the korus fta end summary background 3 c the rok with its vibrant democracy free market hightech economy highly educated population free press and everdeepening peopletopeople ties with the united states is striking success story including for us foreign policy our intensive engagement with the rok since its founding in 1948 exemplifies the importance of all three pillars secretary clinton has outlined describing us foreign policy defense diplomacy and development south koreas success is based on shared commitment to defense as shown by the 28500 us troops still on the peninsula the substantial development assistance the us provided after the korean war and our close diplomatic cooperation to achieve denuclearized north korea and more secure and prosperous future for the region 4 c now developed country with tested democratic system south korea increasingly has the capability as well as the political will to assume larger regional and global roles your visit will encourage your interlocutors to become even more active partners with us on issues ranging from human rights promotion to climate change to sea piracy to counterterrorism we share values and strategic goals with this highly capable ally we need to give substance to our shared aspiration to upgrade our bilateral relationship making it global partnership the domestic situation 5 c president lee of the centerright grand national party gnp began his single fiveyear term in february 2008 ending ten years of centerleft control of the presidency in april 2008 the gnp won solid majority over the main opposition democratic party dp in the unicameral national assembly the gnps success at the polls however belied the lack of consensus among the south korean public on domestic political issues like media law reform labor relations tax policy and education president lee has struggled with low approval ratings about 30 percent since taking office especially following his decision to reopen the korean market to us beef last year in the national assembly the gnp and dp have even lower approval ratings than president lee resulting in virtually deadlocked domestic agenda 6 c president lee has remained publicly disengaged from the squabbling in the national assembly and is focusing instead on foreign policy resource diplomacy and international cooperative efforts on green growth climate change and overcoming the economic crisis he campaigned on pledge to strengthen the usrok alliance and is widely seen as having been successful with china and russia he has substantially expanded the roks economic and political ties he has attempted to overcome historical animosities with japan to advance koreajapan ties based on koreas pragmatic interests but sensitivities to japans colonization of korea run deep looking wider president lee is actively cultivating new ties with southeast asia central asia and europe 7 c former president kim daejungs health has been failing and he is currently hospitalized in seoul in intensive care the prognosis for president kim who was in office 19982003 and who is 84 is not good the alliance 8 c for over half century the usrok alliance has provided the foundation for peace and prosperity in northeast asia the rok has benefitted greatly neither the economic miracle on the han nor koreas democratic flowering would have been possible absent us defense shield and economic assistance and support the us too has benefited usfk us forces in korea is our only troop presence in mainland east asia and south korea contributes billions of dollars to usfk operating expenses 9 c the summit joint vision statement offers compelling vision of expanding the role of the usrok alliance regionally and globally on the korean peninsula we are also working to strengthen further broaden and appropriately evolve the security relationship by implementing three key bilateral transformation agreements known as yrp lpp and stp yrp the yongsan relocation plan will relocate the headquarters of us forces usfk from the middle of seoul to new purposebuilt warfighting headquarters south of the city thereby giving back to the koreans large tract of land historically associated with japanese occupation which they plan to turn into central park progress on the implementation of yrp continues but construction to prepare us army garrison humphreys the hub for the relocation continues on schedule but faces obstacles that require president lees and his administrations support if we are to meet the agreed 2014 completion date lpp the land partnership plan will consolidate over 100 us military bases spread all across korea into two key strategic hubs south of the han river replacing an outdated military footprint from the end of the korean war with modern and betterpositioned force posture the rok ministry of national defense mnd seeks to complete the lpp by the end of 2015 stp the strategic transition plan is the process under which we are transferring wartime operational control opcon of south korean forces from the us military to the rok military by april 17 2012 president lee has emphasized the need to keep the spotlight off of wartime opcon transition due to increased scrutiny by rok domestic opposition groups regarding the april 17 2012 transition date in the wake of north koreas recent claimed nuclear test we are continuing to emphasize the process for close cooperation in reviewing opcon transition progress through the scm and management of messaging and public perceptions to highlight the value of the restructuring 10 c we must continue to emphasize the importance of completing the two relocation elements of usfk transformation yrp and lpp those agreements signed in 2004 did not come with appropriated funds the master plan finished in 2007 lays out the cost and timeline but the rokg has yet to request funding from the national assembly other us and rok private sector initiatives are failing to fill the funding gap as result alliance transformation which was originally scheduled for completion in 2008 is facing delay of many more years to avoid further delays the rokg must make implementation of these moves priority for our part we must be clear and consistent in identifying our own top priorities 11 c the time is right to expand the areas in which the us and the rok cooperate on global security issues you may want to raise the following areas where the rok may be ready to increase its global security role afghanistan the rokg is planning to provide more assistance and training in afghanistan including building new hospital and training center in bagram and contributing ambulances motorcycles and police trainers however we need lot more from the rok especially financial support for the afghan army for which we have requested usd 100 million year for five years which is the usg primary request of the rok the rokg also is considering sending provincial reconstruction team prt to afghanistan which we would welcome but we also have insisted that any such prt include military unit to provide for its own security such deployment the prt as well as any other military assets such as an isr unit intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance will need national assembly approval which will pose difficult but not insurmountable political problems for president lee peacekeeping operations the national assembly is deliberating on bill that will allow the rok military to be deployed for peacekeeping missions without prior legislative approval in the meantime the national assembly in july approved extending the roks pko deployment in lebanon until the end of december 2010 the rok has contributed 367 soldiers for peacekeeping in lebanon since 2007 and is participating in eight other pko operations around the world as of january 1 2008 the rok was the 10th largest provider of assessed contributions to the pko budget combating piracy off somalia the rok is member of the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia additionally the rokg deployed 4500 ton class destroyer equipped with lynx helicopter and rigid inflatable craft to the gulf of aden to be part of the maritime security operations of the combined maritime forces the destroyer carries up to 310 personnel proliferation security initiative in response to the dprks may rocket launch and nuclear test the rok on may 26 joined the usinitiated proliferation security initiative psi in june the rok participated in psi meeting in poland and held workshop in seoul in july the rokg plans to attend the next workshop in sydney in september and has expressed interest in attending the interdiction exercises in singapore in october psi is an international interagency effort aimed at preventing or interdicting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction using existing domestic laws and established international agreements the rokg currently is formulating an interagency strategy for its effective psi participation usrok global partnership 12 c the rok also wants to play bigger role on other global issues and the following are good areas for increased cooperation democracy and human rights the rok has demonstrated new readiness to address human rights concerns in the dprk cosponsoring the annual unga north korea human rights resolution in 2008 for the first time in october 2008 the rok agreed to chair the first senior officials meeting of the asiapacific democracy partnership ussupported regional subset of the community of democracies climate change korea the 13th largest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases and the worlds 15th largest economy in terms of gdp is playing constructive role in discussions on global climate change the rokg shares the us view that that investment in new and renewable energy sources not only can reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also can create jobs spur economic growth and enhance energy security the us department of energy is engaged in variety of collaborative rd activities with korea including in nuclear energy fusion gas hydrates smart grids and other new and renewable energy technologies but there is room to expand and strengthen our cooperation development assistance koreas overseas development assistance program currently includes nearly usd 500 million in official development assistance oda as well as roughly similar figure for north korea suspended the rokg target is to triple oda as percentage of gdp by 2015 with limited functional and regional capacity korea should be receptive to policy discussions on oda coordination counterproliferation the rokg has told iranian counterparts at every opportunity that tehrans uranium enrichment activities are unacceptable and has supported the p5plus1 incentives package fta and economic issues 13 c president lee has faced criticism from his opponents for his inability to generate momentum for the koreaus korus fta in washington president obamas statement at the april g20 meeting with lee that the us wanted to find way forward on the korus fta allayed some of the anxiety in seoul and enabled lee to push the fta through the committee of jurisdiction in koreas national assembly in late april full plenary vote in the national assembly has not been scheduled while opponents are vocal the korus fta continues to receive about 60 percent approval korean public opinion polls is strongly supported by the majority gnp party and is expected to pass once there is some sign of movement in washington the obama administration is conducting thorough review of the korus fta and consulting closely with all stakeholders to understand the exact nature of their concerns to develop recommendations for addressing them to assist with this review and to ensure that all who may have an interest in this free trade agreement are able to fully express their views we issued federal register notice on july 27 2009 requesting comments on the korus fta 14 c korea is our seventh largest trading partner with total merchandise trade in 2008 of over usd 82 billion and more than usd 100 billion if services are included the us international trade commission estimated in september 2007 that us merchandise exports to korea would expand by usd 1012 billion on an annual basis as result of the fta and that services exports would also expand the united states has traditionally been the roks biggest trading partner in the postwwii era one tangible sign of chinas growing importance in asia and in korea however is that china displaced the united states as koreas top trading partner in 2004 by 2008 chinarok merchandise trade reached usd 168 billion doubling the usrok total with respect to north korea china accounts for nearly 50 percent of that countrys total trade the growing economic and political role of china on the korean peninsula is one of the most important motivations for korea to enter into fta negotiations with the united states successive rok governments have seen the ratification and implementation of the korus fta as symbolic of the us will to remain fully engaged in northeast asia in the face of increasing chinese influence 15 c korea also wants to conclude an fta with the united states because korean economic reformers recognize that the korean economy needs to liberalize and open in order to promote greater competitiveness visvis china and japan south korea has concluded number of ftas and launched negotiations on others since the signing of the korus fta negotiations on june 30 2007 the rok has implemented ftas with chile singapore efta and asean except investment the rok has concluded negotiations with india and signing is reportedly imminent negotiations are underway with canada mexico the gulf cooperation council australia new zealand and peru in july the rokg announced that negotiations on the eukorea fta were concluded but the agreement is not yet signed rok media have been filled with stories of the increasing economic weight of europe in korea as result of the fta the board of governors of the american chamber of commerce has expressed concern that the eukorea fta will disadvantage the competitiveness of us firms visvis their european competitors in korea 16 c the reopening of the beef market was accomplished in an april 2008 agreement separate from the fta under this agreement the united states and korea agreed to reopen koreas market to us beef and beef products in manner fully consistent with international standards and science in june 2008 following massive street protests in seoul us beef exporters and korean beef importers reached temporary commercial agreement to only export beef and beef products from cattle under 30 months of age as transitional measure until korean consumer confidence improves while beef sales have not yet returned to past levels due to koreas currency exchange fluctuations increased competition from australian beef and lingering public concerns about the safety of us beef the market is open and we expect increased sales over the medium term korea is also watching closely our ongoing negotiations with other countries that have stricter restrictions on us beef 17 c on the global financial reform discussions korea is strong ally in the g20 process which it will chair in 2010 korea is enthusiastic about the g20 as the global forum for action on the global financial system the rokg is concerned that european countries are advocating other formulas for such discussions that would exclude korea within the g20 president lee has called for strong fiscal response and refraining from protectionism as well as necessary regulatory improvements president lee myungbak has strongly argued that it would be premature to withdraw the national fiscal stimulus packages at this juncture korea sees itself as lining up on the us side on almost all g20 debates 18 c the korean economy is looking better and is increasingly forecast to be one of the first major economies to emerge from recession the benchmark kospi stock index in early august reached the highest level since midaugust 2008 and the won the korean currency closed at 1218 per dollar on august 4 the strongest level since october 14 2008 most analysts foresee further strengthening of the won in the months ahead the picture looked far different last fall when the financial crisis hit korea hard usd 30 billion swap line extended by the us federal reserve in october as the korean won was plummeting and korea looked to be on the brink of financial panic helped korea weather the worst of the storm and gained tremendous gratitude the later japanese and chinese swap mechanisms did not have the same impact in the closing months of 2008 korea experienced dramatic contraction of demand for its exports the rokgs stabilization and stimulus packages mitigated the impact and the weakened currency has generated significant current account surplus in recent months sectors of the korean economy facing restructuring challenges include construction shipbuilding shipping and automotive gm daewoo gms korean subsidiary is negotiating with the korea development bank for sizeable loanto restructure its operations north korea 19 c presidents obama and lee agreed to send clear message to north korea that its provocations come at price they also agreed on principles to deal with north koreas nuclear and missile threats including commitments to achieving the complete and verifiable elimination of north koreas nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs as well as the ballistic missile program korean officials continue to seek assurances that the united states will consult closely with the rok on its north korea policy and that the united states will not recognize north korea as nuclear state 20 c north korea policy is almost always the most sensitive issue on the south korean agenda fiftyfive years of alliance notwithstanding the rokg still fears being left out or surprised by washingtons initiatives or policy changes on north korea simply put the rokg must be seen by south koreans as being informed and consulted on all usg moves on north korea korean officials see washington and seoul as partners in forming and implementing policies toward the north and consistently seek affirmation that washington will not allow pyongyang to drive wedge between us 21 c there is virtually chance of early improvement in southnorth relations president lee is determined to stick to principle and to insist on more reciprocal relationship with the north and kim jongil will not give in for his own domestic reasons importantly south koreans appear tired of but not particularly bothered by the continuing threatening rhetoric from the north and therefore seem largely comfortable with their governments stance heightening tensions in the west sea and missile launches have created less public anxiety than might be expected the rokg will welcome the opportunity to present with you united front of calm and determination toward the north combined with call to return to the six party talks 22 sbu the kaesong industrial complex kic is the only remaining joint economic project between north and south korea the other joint venture mt kumkang tours was closed on july 11 2008 after north korean security forces shot south korean tourist to death located in north korea six miles north of the dmz the kic opened in december 2004 and is home to 106 rokowned factories employing approximately 40000 north korean workers 84 percent are women age 2039 since late 2008 northsouth tensions regarding the kic have increased the dprk closed the border temporarily on multiple occasions and has placed limits on the number of south korean employees allowed in the kic the dprk is demanding drastically higher wages for employees up from usd 55 to usd 300 per month construction of additional dormitories and an additional fee of usd 500 million for land usage 23 sbu north koreans detained south korean hyundai asan employee working at kic on march 30 accusing him of defaming north korea and attempting to suborn north korean female worker in addition to securing the release of the rok citizen south koreas priorities at the kic include guaranteeing employee safety freedom of access and bordercrossing and increasing the number of north korean workers brought in from outside the kaesong area although the south korean firms at kic are concerned about the current tension and complain of financial losses only one company has withdrawn from kic to date 24 sbu the dprk and the rok have held four rounds of negotiations between april and july 2009 without any breakthrough with the most recent session taking place on july 2 both sides appear to be committed to continuing kic operations the united states has consistently supported northsouth dialogue and expressed hope that the two sides will resolve their disputes over the kic vwpwest 25 u the rok was included in the the visa waiver program vwp in october 2008 this step has been success in facilitating travel and improving peopletopeople ties between nations as of the beginning of july approximately 200000 koreans had applied for vwp approval using the electronic approval for travel authorization more than 99 percent of the applications have been approved and we continue to see an upward trend in usage 26 u the west work english study and travel program inaugurated in march 2009 allows qualifying college students and recent graduates to enter the us for up to 18 months on j1 exchange visitor visas that allow them to study english participate in professionallevel internships and travel independently group of 185 korean students have already travelled to the us on the west program and second wave of 159 is preparing to depart as of december 2008 there were 110000 south koreans studying in the us at all levels from elementary to graduate school according to korean ministry of education data for 2007 27 of all postgraduate students choosing to study abroad chose to study in the us the bottom line 27 c south korea is likeminded energetic partner that is ready prepared and wants to have broader and deeper alliance with the united states koreans would like the alliance to be lot more than security arrangement yes they want more say even more equal relationship but this is only part of their motivation rather they see that their ties with the us are deeper now than ever witness for example the two millionstrong korean american community and the enormous numbers of koreans studying in the united states above all however very large majority of south koreans are convinced that the rok and the united states have shared values and shared strategic interests its time to take the relationship to new level of global partnership even as we deepen our cooperation on the korean peninsula your meetings 28 c you are scheduled to meet with president lee myungbak national security advisor kim sunghwan foreign minister yu myunghwan trade minister kim jonghoon speaker of the
