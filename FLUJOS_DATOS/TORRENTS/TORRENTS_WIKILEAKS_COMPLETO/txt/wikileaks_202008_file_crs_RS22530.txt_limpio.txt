nonproliferation of any us material or equipment transferred if recipient state assists encourages or induces nonnuclear weapon state to engage in nuclearweapons related activities exports must cease indias nonproliferation record continues to be scrutinized as india continues to take steps to strengthen its own export controls additional measures of indian support could include diplomatic support for negotiations with iran support for bush administration efforts to restrict enrichment and reprocessing support for multilateral fuel cycle initiatives and for the proliferation security initiative

the threat iran poses and appropriate responses differ from us views on september 24 2005 india voted with 21 other states on international atomic energy agency iaea resolution gov200577 which found iran in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement however the resolution did not refer the matter immediately to the security council and india apparently was one of several states pressuring the eu3 to keep the issue at the iaea according to indian foreign secretary shyam saran india voted for the resolution and against the majority of nam states which abstained because it felt obligated to do so after having pressured the eu3 to omit reference to immediate referral to the security council2 moreover the official explanation of indias vote seemed designed to highlight indias differences with the united states in our explanation of vote we have clearly expressed our opposition to iran being declared as noncompliant with its safeguards agreements nor do we agree that the current situation could constitute threat to international peace and security httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22530 nevertheless the resolution does not refer the matter to the security council and has agreed that outstanding issues be dealt with under the aegis of the iaea itself this is in line with our position and therefore we have extended our support3 nonetheless india again voted with the united states on february 4 2006 when the iaea board of governors voted to refer irans noncompliance to the security council4 the ministry of external affairs responded to questions about its vote in this manner while there will be report to the security council the iran nuclear issue remains within the purview of the iaea it has been our consistent position that confrontation should be avoided and any outstanding issue ought to be resolved through dialogueour vote in favour of the resolution should not be interpreted as in any way detracting from the traditionally close and friendly relations we enjoy with iran it is our conviction that our active role along with other friendly countries enabled the tabling of resolution that recognizes the right of iran to peaceful uses of nuclear energy for its development consistent with its international commitments and obligations while keeping the door open for further dialogue aimed at resolving the outstanding issues within the purview of the iaea5 indias prime minister told the indian parliament on february 17 2006 that as signatory to the npt iran has the legal right to develop peaceful uses of nuclear energy consistent with its international commitments and obligations nonetheless pm singh 2 press briefing by foreign secretary on the events in and iaea new delhi sept 26 2005 available at httpwwwindianembassyorgpress_release2005sept29htm 3

program recent developments by sharon squassoni 5 see httpwwwindianembassyorgnewsitepress_release2006feb2asp crs3 also noted that it is incumbent upon iran to exercise these rights in the context of safeguards that it has voluntarily accepted upon its nuclear programme under the iaea6 india has supported the eu3 negotiations despite their ostensible objective of halting irans pursuit of sensitive nuclear technology that is enrichment reprocessing and heavy water in part this may be because the talks offered second avenue of negotiation that did not necessarily lead to security council sanctions or because they have offered viable discussion forum india welcomed the us decision to join the talks stating india has all along advocated that issues relating to irans nuclear programme ought to be resolved through dialogue and that confrontation should be avoided against this background the readiness of the us to join in the dialogue between eu3 and iran which india has all along supported is to be welcomed7 in september 2006 however india joined other nam states in statement issued at the havana nam summit on irans nuclear program the statement reaffirmed the basic inalienable right of all states to develop research production and use of atomic httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22530 energy for peaceful purposes without any discrimination and in conformity with their respective legal obligations therefore nothing should be interpreted in way as inhibiting or restricting this right of states to develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes they furthermore reaffirmed that states choices and decisions in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear technology and its fuel cycle policies must be respected8 two other us nonproliferation policies that may help underpin solution to the iran crisis are related to restrictions on the nuclear fuel cycle ban on transferring enrichment and reprocessing technologies to states that are not already technology holders and steps toward multilateralizing the nuclear fuel cycle so that sensitive technologies are not as widespread key new us initiative in this area is the global nuclear energy partnership or gnep india under the july 18 2005 joint statement with the united states committed to refrain from transferring enrichment and reprocessing technologies to states that do not have them as well as to support international efforts to limit their spread indias future support for those policies however may be predicated on india being considered one of those technology holders recent statement from president bush on gnep did not recognize india as such technology holder my administration has announced new proposal called the global nuclear energy partnership under this partnership america will work with nations that have advanced civilian nuclear energy programs such as great britain france japan and russia to share nuclear fuel with nations like india that are developing civilian nuclear energy programsthe strategy will allow countries like india to produce more electricity from nuclear power it will enable countries like india to rely less on fossil 6 prime ministers suo motu statement on

proliferation9 another tool that may be utilized by those desiring to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons is the proliferation security initiative on november 2 2005 under secretary of state r nicholas burns told the senate foreign relations committee that indian support for the multinational proliferation security initiative psi would be boon to the participating nations goal of tracking and interdicting dangerous terrorist and weapons of mass destruction wmd cargoes worldwide we hope india will choose to join psi10 in april 2006 secretary of state rice told the house international relations committee that the united states was pressing india to announce its intention to participate in the proliferation security initiative both the house hr 5682 and senate s 3709 bills to create an exception for india from relevant provisions of the atomic energy act refer to the desirability of getting india to join psi but do not make it prerequisite for cooperation prime minister singh told the parliament in august 2006 that the proliferation security initiative is an extraneous issuetherefore we cannot accept it as condition for implementing the july statement separately the government has examined the psi we have certain concerns regarding its legal implications and its httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22530 linkages with the npt finally efforts to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons rely on coordinated export controls and strong national export control systems india has agreed to harmonize its export controls with the guidelines of the nuclear suppliers group under the july 18 2005 joint statement india also passed new law in may 2005 the weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems prohibition of unlawful activities bill according to indian officials the act prohibits the possession manufacture transportation acquisition development of nuclear weapons chemical weapons or biological weapons by nonstate actors11 it would prohibit the export of any good or technology from india if the exporter knows it is intended to be used in wmd program the us commerce and state departments have not yet assessed indias export control law and regulations12 which were promulgated in response to security council resolution 1540 requiring all states to take actions to criminalize proliferation particularly to nonstate actors some observers have stated that india does not have the necessary regulations in place to implement the law and that indias resources for implementation are remarkably limited13 third issue is whether india will follow through in imposing penalties on violators of export control laws and regulations 9 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200602200602222html 10 r nicholas burns under secretary of state for

committee april 5 2006 13 conversation with david albright institute for science and international security crs5 indias nonproliferation record in its semiannual unclassified report in 2000 to congress on the acquisition of technology relating to weapons of mass destruction the cia identified india along with iran and pakistan as traditional recipient of wmd and missile technology that could emerge as new supplier of technology and expertise14 the unclassified report also noted that private companies scientists and engineers in russia china and india may be increasing their involvement in wmd and missilerelated assistance taking advantage of weak or unenforceable national export controls and the growing availability of technology in 2001 the unclassified cia report noted that we are increasingly concerned about the growth of secondary proliferation from maturing statesponsored programs such as those in india iran north korea and pakistan reported transfers to iran entities in india and iran appear to have engaged in very limited nuclear chemical and missilerelated transfers over the years there are publicly available indications of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22530 activities related to biological weapons in the early 1990s when iran actively sought nuclear related assistance and technology from many foreign sources india appears to have played only minor role in contrast to other states india signed an agreement in november 1991 to provide 10megawatt research reactor to tehran but cancelled under pressure from the united states nonetheless india reportedly trained iranian nuclear scientists in the 1990s15 more recently indias foreign minister jaswant singh stated in december 2003 that india has and would continue to help iran in its controversial bid to generate nuclear energy16 from 1998 to 2003 the united states has imposed nonproliferation sanctions on several different indian entities for chemical and biologicalweapons related transfers to iraq17 in 2004 the united states imposed sanctions on two indian scientists for nuclear related transfers to iran dr c surendar sanctions on dr surendar were lifted in december 2005 and dr ysr prasad both scientists were highranking officials in the nuclear power corporation of india limited npcil indian officials protested stating that cooperation had taken place under the auspices of the iaea technical cooperation program other reports suggest that the scientists who had served as chairman and managing director of the npcil which runs indias power reactors passed information to iran on tritium extraction from heavy water reactors18 in december 2005 sanctions were imposed on sabero organic chemicals gujarat ltd and sandhya organic chemicals pvt

solomon as ties between india and iran rise us grows edgy wall street journal march 24 2005 crs6 sanctions were imposed on two more chemical manufacturers in india for transfers to iran balaji amines and prachi poly products in the chemical area there is one confirmed transfer of 60 tons of thionyl chloride chemical that can be used in the production of mustard gas from india to iran in march 198919 other shipments in that timeframe reportedly were halted under us pressure india does not appear in the cias unclassified nonproliferation report to congress as supplier of chemicalweaponsrelated exports to iran since the report began publication in 1997 india signed the chemical weapons convention in 1993 and deposited its instrument of ratification until 1996 other considerations one consideration in assessing countrys nonproliferation record is the extent to which its export control and procurement system helps limit or eliminate illicit transfers david albright president of the institute for science and international security has argued that three factors contribute to flawed nonproliferation record for india in the nuclear area poorly implemented national export control system an illicit procurement httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22530 system for its own nuclear weapons program and procurement system that may unwittingly transfer sensitive information about uranium enrichment20 when asked formally to respond to albrights allegations the administration stated it would be happy to discuss the allegations in classified session with members of congress21 albright has suggested that the illicit procurement system in india has led entities to mislead suppliers about the ultimate destination of their goods such system could be used to mask onward proliferation from february 2003 to april 2006 the department of commerce opened 63 cases of possible export administration regulations violations by us firms exporting to india 33 of those cases are still open22 in response to senator lugars question for the record on investigations since 1998 into potential violations of us export laws the state department reported that in one case us firm exported technical information to an entity in india associated with its missile program in another case us firm with subsidiary in singapore committed 36 violations of the export administration regulations by exporting various life sciences research products to entities in the indian department of atomic energy and indian department of defense in another case us firm attempted the unlicensed export of biotoxins to north korea via firm in new delhi 19 thionyl chloride is schedule 3 chemical under the chemical weapons convention it has military and civilian uses and is widely used in the laboratory and in industry 20 david albright and susan basu neither determined proliferation nor responsible state indias record needs scrutiny institute for science and international security april 5
