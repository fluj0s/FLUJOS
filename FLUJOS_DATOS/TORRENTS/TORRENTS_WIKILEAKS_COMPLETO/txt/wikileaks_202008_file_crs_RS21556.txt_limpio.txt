dispute panels ruling the dispute panel found that the eu had maintained moratorium on approvals of genetically engineered crops between june 1999 and the beginning of panel deliberations in august 2003 the eu had claimed that there were measures imposing moratorium the panel agreed with the united states and the cocomplainants that marketing or import prohibitions on ge products in six eu countries austria france germany greece italy and luxembourg violated the wtos agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures which requires such measures to be based on science and risk assessment the crs2 panel upheld the complainants charge that the eu also violated the sps agreement by not ensuring that approvals for 24 of 27 genetically modified gm products in the approval pipeline were carried out without undue delay the dispute panels ruling dismissed several other us and cocomplainant claims including claims that eu approval procedures were not based on appropriate risk assessment that the eu unfairly applied different risk assessment standards for ge processing agents and that the eu had unjustifiably discriminated between wto members the panel made recommendations as to how the eu should bring its practices in line with wto rules nor did the ruling require the eu to change its regulatory framework for approving ge products the eu announced on december 19 2006 that it would not appeal the panels ruling in the case the united states and eu agreed that reasonable period of time would be until november 21 2007 deadline subsequently extended by mutual agreement until january 11 2008 time would likely be required to reach intraeu agreement to lift the prohibitions on already approved ge products or to launch court challenges to require member countries to lift their prohibitions on ge products1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21556 background in may 2003 the united states canada and argentina requested consultations the first step in wto dispute settlement with the eu concerning the latters facto moratorium since 1998 on approving new ge products us agricultural interests contended that these policies not only blocked their exports to the eu but also fueled unwarranted concerns about the safety of agricultural biotechnology throughout the world although the eu recommenced approvals in may 2004 with the approval of ge corn variety for human consumption number of eu member states continue to block dissemination of approved biotech varieties the eu restarted its approval process following adoption of new labeling and traceability rules for ge crops and foods in 20032 the united states accounted for 54 of the 252 million acres 102 million hectares planted globally with ge crops in 20063 in 2005 85 of all us soybean 76 of us cotton and 45 of us corn acres were planted with ge varieties designed mainly to control pests weeds and insects4 ge production is not segregated from production from traditional varieties because the us regulatory system recognizes ge crops once approved for commercialization as substantially equivalent to nonge varieties gaining market acceptance of ge crops within the united states has been easier than overseas 1 see eu council rejects proposals to lift bans on gmo products in inside us trade december 22 2006 at httpwwwinsidetradecomsecuredsply_nl_txtaspfwto2002askdh 70507021qgmo 2 the

consumers and their governments have been more wary of biotechnology with minor exceptions the eu and its member states approved ge products between 1998 and 2004 as of january 2004 22 ge products or crops were awaiting approval bloc of eu states had effectively halted the release of any new ge crops into the environment saying that they would not implement the euwide legislation for approvals until new stricter regulations for labeling and tracing gecontaining products discussed below took effect5 in the three years before the facto ban us corn exports to the eu averaged about 300 million annually according to usda data spain and portugal were the largest eu importers during the ban they declined to less than onetenth of that value annually the result according to analysts of the eus moratorium on the approval of new corn varieties already approved in the united states although one variety of biotech corn was approved by the eu prior to the moratorium the united states grew other varieties thus us export of any corn to the eu was impractical because of the difficulty of segregating approved from unapproved varieties httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21556 the wto case the united states and cocomplainants argued that the eu moratorium violated the wto agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures the sps agreement permits countries to regulate crops and food products to protect health and the environment but their rules must be scientifically justified and approval procedures must occur without undue delay us interests contend that there is scientific evidence that ge food and feed crops are substantially different from or any less safe than conventional varieties conclusion they say even european scientific authorities have reached the united states contends that eu biotechnology measures also are inconsistent with provisions of other wto agreements namely the technical barriers to trade agreement tbt the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and the agreement on agriculture eu officials counter that their cautious approach to regulating biotechnology is necessary to cultivate trust among european consumers at the same time they also assert that they have shown good faith in moving quickly to restart the approval process in may 2004 the eu effectively ended the moratorium by approving ge corn variety syngenta bt11 for human consumption since then the eu has approved ge corn varieties monsantos nk603 for both human and animal consumption pioneers 1570 corn for feed use and 17 strains of ge corn seed all derived from the mon 810 strain approved in 1998 for commercial use 5 before the moratorium the eu had approved the commercial release of 18 genetically modified organisms gmos including mon810 and roundupready soybeans crs4 differing regulatory approaches the united states has embraced the concept of substantial equivalence with regard to ge products if ge product is substantially the same as its conventional counterpart it should be regulated differently than the conventional product the eu on the other hand takes precautionary approach which means that if scientific evidence is insufficient or inconclusive regarding practices or products potential dangers to human or environmental health it should be more vigorously regulated or even prohibited if there are reasonable grounds for concern thus providing safeguard against future unforeseen problems under this approach the products of biotechnology are deemed to be inherently different from their conventional counterparts and to require separate regulatory regime united states the basic federal guidance for regulating biotechnology products is the coordinated framework for regulation of biotechnology 51 fed reg 23302 one of its key principles is that ge products should be regulated according to their characteristics and unique features not according to their method of production once approved food products do not have to be labeled as to whether or not they contain any httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21556 genetically modified organisms except to the extent that ge food is substantially different eg contains an allergen or has changed nutritional content because they are deemed substantially equivalent ge products are regulated under existing federal statutory authorities6 european union the eu has established separate structures specifically for approving ge products and for labeling products derived from them currently the key measure is council directive 200118 as amended in july 20037 which spells out steps for assessing human health and environmental risks before any ge product can be released into the environment or marketed prior to the 2003 amendments the competent authority in the eu member state where the product was to be released was responsible for assessing its safety and if approved notifying other member states opening the way for marketing throughout the eu with eulevel intervention if one member state disagreed with anothers decision the amended directive provides for onedoorone key approach whereby the european food safety authority efsa conducts all scientific risk assessments and communicates risks to the public then the eu council of ministers decides whether or not to approve ge product for the eu market eu regulations empower the european commission to approve applications by default if the council of ministers fails to act on them within three months labeling and traceability the wto case does not involve new stricter eu labeling and traceability regulations which us agricultural interests argue continued to discriminate against us exports even after the ge product approval moratorium was lifted the labeling and traceability regulations adopted in july 2003 require that most foods ingredients and for the first time animal feeds from ge products be labeled even if they longer 6 see httpheinonlineorgholpagehandleheinfedreg051123id96collectionfedreg 7 httpeuropaeuinteurlexprienojdat2001l_106l_10620010417en00010038pdf crs5 contain detectable traces the regulations 18302003 on the traceability and labeling of gmos and 18292003 on genetically modified gm food and feed were implemented in april 2004 under the regulations tolerance level for nonge foods feeds and processed products of 09 is set for allowable adventitious presence ap that is unintended lowlevel presence of an euapproved ge substance all products with more than 09 must be labeled as containing ge products products like meat milk and eggs from animals fed or treated with ge materials will not have to be labeled however traceability provisions now require all firms that produce store move or process ge products to track and keep records on them from farm to consumer compliance with the eu labeling rule requires segregation of ge crops and foods derived from them from the time they are planted all the way through the processing and marketing chain this entails prevention of pollen drift from ge to nonge fields and difficult and costly handling procedures such as using separate equipment storage and shipping containers or at least painstakingly cleaning them us interests argue that food companies forced to label accurately all ge products face huge risks and liabilities all of these problems discriminate against us shipments even though they are as safe as conventional httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21556 shipments they contend in practice many us manufacturers have opted not to market ge products in the eu in part due to the eus stricter ge regulations8 differing public attitudes differing us and eu perspectives may reflect the fact that us consumers apparently have been not only less fearful of ge foods than their european counterparts but also more confident in their food safety regulators according to usdas economic research service ers surveys of consumer attitudes toward ge products conducted both here and overseas have yielded mixed results still us consumers have voiced little objection to genetically modified foods while eu consumers have been vocal in their disapproval ers observed9 europeans may be much more wary of changes in how their food is produced due to series of recent food safety crises during the 1990s bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease emerged in the united kingdom and spread to other parts of europe uk food safety authorities first insisted that the disease could not be transmitted to humans eating meat from bseinfected animals by 1996 scientific evidence indicated there was link between some cases of similar human disease and consumption of bsecontaminated beef in 1999 high levels of dioxin were found in meat products and eggs originating in belgium also footandmouth disease fmd outbreaks in europe added to consumer concerns and to their waning faith in regulatory agencies according to the pew charitable trusts initiative on food and biotechnology 8 personal communication with economic research service january 21 2005 9 details on these surveys can be found at ers economic issues in agricultural biotechnology information bulletin 762 february 2001 pp 2830 in december 2006 the pew initiative on food and biotechnology released new survey of us attitudes on gm foods which pew said determined that americans knowledge of them remains low that their opposition to such foods has softened somewhat since 2001 from 58 to 48 and support remains stable at 27 survey results can be found at httppewagbiotechorgresearch2006update2php crs6 pew is careful to point out that these crises have not been caused by ge food but that ge food has been caught up in the general suspicion about food safety environmental groups in the eu such as greenpeace and friends of the earth also have raised concerns about environmental impacts recently concerns have been voiced by european grain and feedstuffs traders and compound feed manufacturers about eu regulations and attitudes about ge corn and soybeans10 they point to short supplies and high prices for feedstuffs and call for changes in the eu regulations that impose strict limits on adventitious presence and that have helped create shortage of feed supplies in the eu coceral the association of eu feedstuffs traders has pointed out that neither argentina nor brazil who along with the united states supply the bulk of annual eu feed supplies could guarantee that its corn and soybean shipments contain only euapproved gmos congressional interest in the 110th congress members representing agricultural interests have urged the united states to take an aggressive stance with respect to eu biotechnology regulations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21556 senator grassley the ranking member of the senate finance committee has expressed hope that the eu would soon come into compliance with the wto ruling in the biotechnology case he noted that although he would have preferred the us trade representative to take harder line in the case he recognized that hard approach of seeking retaliation might not be successful11 at the same time many lawmakers are well aware of the risks involved in escalating useu trade tensions to new heights pending house and senate versions of new farm bill hr 2419 to replace the expiring 2002 farm statute contain provisions relating to agricultural biotechnology the house bill authorizes the appropriation of funds for us representation in the codex alimentarius commission and other international standardsetting entities codex of which the united states is member and whose role is to formulate and recommend nonbinding food safety standards to its member countries is in the process of developing guidelines for handling trace amounts of nonapproved ge products that have been approved in other countries both the house and senate farm bills also reauthorize program of competitive grants to develop agricultural biotechnology for developing countries the senate version of the
