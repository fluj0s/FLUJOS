alternatives to the rule that would accomplish the statutory objectives while minimizing the impact on small entities this analysis is not required however if the head of the agency certiﬁes that the rule will not have signiﬁcant economic impact on substantial number of small entities the rfa does not deﬁne signiﬁcant economic impact or substantial number of small entities thereby giving federal agencies substantial discretion regarding when the acts requirements are triggered other requirements in the rfa and elsewhere eg that agencies reexamine their existing rules develop compliance guides

agencies reexamine their existing rules develop compliance guides and convene advocacy re view panels also depend on the whether the agencies determine that their rules ve significant impact on substantial number of small entities gao has examined the implementation of the rfa many times during the past 20 years and has consistently concluded that the lack of clear definitions for key terms like significant economic impact and substantial number of small entities have hindered the acts effectiveness therefore gao has repeatedly recommended that congress define those terms or give the small business administration or some other federal agency the author ity and responsibility to do so hr 4458 the small business regulato ry improvement act was introduced on december 12 2007 and was reported by the house committee on small business the next day among other things hr 4458 would define economic impact as including indirect effects that are reasonably foreseeable and would clarify that agencies reviews of existing rules s hould not be limited to rules for which regulatory flexibility analysis had been conducted the bill would also require agencies to develop plan for the review of all existing rules within 10 years require more details in agencies analyses and notifications and requi re annual reports to congress on certain agency determinations as part of their reviews although some of these provisions address longsta nding issues some provisions seem unclear and some may add time and co sts to the rulemaking process most notably though hr 4458 does not address gaos

gaoggd98126 aug 31 1998 p 31the regulatory flexibility act implementation issues and proposed reforms regulatory flexibility act requirements the regulatory flexibility act rfa of 1980 5 usc 601612 requires federal agencies to assess the impact of their forthcoming rules on small entities which the act defines as including small businesses small governmental jurisdictions and certain small notforprof it organizations under the rfa virtually all federal agencies ie cabinet depar tments and independent agencies as well as independent regulatory agencies must prepare regulatory flexibility analysis at the time that proposed and certain fi nal rules are published in the federal register the analysis for proposed rule is referred to as an initial regulatory flexibility analysis irfa and the analysis for final rule is referred to as final regulatory flexibility analysis frfa the act requires the analyses to describe among other things 1 why the regulatory action is being considered and its objectives 2 the small entities to which the rule will apply and where feas ible an estimate of their number 3 the projected reporting recordkeeping and ot her compliance requirements of the rule and for final rules 4 steps the agency has taken to minimize the impact of the rule on small entities including the alternatives considered and why the selected alternative was chosen however these analytical requirements are not triggered if the head of the issuing agency certifies that the rule would not have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities hereafter referred to as seisnse the rfa does not define significant ec onomic impact or substantial number of small entities thereby giving federal agencies substantial discretion regarding when the acts analytical requirements are initiated also the rfas analytical requirements do not apply to final rules for which the agency does not publish proposed rule1 the rfa also contains several other not able provisions for example section 602 requires each federal agency to publish regulatory flexibility agenda in the federal register each april and october listing regulations that the agency expectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34355crs2 2 this requirement as well as similar requirement in executive order 12866 is generally met via entries in the unified agenda of federal regul atory and deregulatory actions the unified agenda is published twice each year in the federal register by the regulatory information service center and provides uniform reporting of data on regulatory

be in place for more than seven years in response to previous gao recommendation on jan 11 1995 the sba chief counsel for advocacy and the oira administrator exchanged letters committing the two offices to work together more closely specifically sba said it would develop new guidance for agencies to follow in complyin g with the act and would prov ide oira with copy of any comments it files with an agency concerning co mpliance with the rfa oira said it would consider rfa compliance as part of its reviews under executive order 12866 and would include sba in the process when appropria see

requires the chief counsel of the small business adminis trations sbas office of advocacy to monitor and report at least annually on agencies compliance with the act the statute also specifically authorizes the chief counsel to appear as amicus curiae ie friend of the court in any court action to review rule the rfa initially did not permit judicial review of agencies actions under the act however amendments to the act in 1996 as part of the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act s brefa 110 stat 857 5 usc 601 note permitted judicial review regarding among other things agencies regulatory flexibility analyses for final rules and any certifications that their rules will not have seisnse as result for example small entity that is adversely affected or aggrieved by an agencys determination that its final rule would not have significant impact on small entities could seek judicial review of that determination within one year of the date of the final agency acti on in granting relief court may remand the rule to the agency or defer enforcement against small entities the addition of judicial review in 1996 is generally viewed as si gnificant strengthening of the rfa and is believed to have improved agen cies compliance with the act3 in august 2002 president george w bush issued executive order 13272 which was intended to promote compliance with the rfa4 the executive order requires agencies to issue written procedures and policies to ensure that the potential impacts of their draft rules on small entities are properly considered and requires them to notify the office of advocacy of any draft rules with seisnse also the order requires the sba chief counsel for advocacy to notify agency heads from time to time of the requirements of the rfa and to provide training to agencies on rfa compliance it also permits the chief counsel to provide comments on draft rules to the issuing agency and to the office of information and regulatory affairs oira

conducted section 610 reviews only for rules that it concluded had seisnse at the time the fina l rules were promulgated the department of transportation on the other hand interpreted th statute to require review of all rules see us general accounting office regulatory flexibility act agencies interpretations of review requirements vary gaoggd9955 apr 2 1999 pp 1112 7 section 212 was amended by subtitle c of the us troop readiness veterans care katrina recovery and iraq accountability appropriations act 2007 pl 11028 may 25 2007 this description includes those amendments guidance on the rfa in 2003 and reported training more than 20 agencies on compliance with the act in fy20055 other requirements are linked to rfa determinations in addition to triggering an initial or final regulatory flexibility analysis an agencys determination that rule has seisnse can initiate other actions for example when enacted in 1980 section 610 of the rfa required agencies to publish plan in the federal register within 180 days that would provide for the review of all of their thenexisting rules within 10 ears and for the review of all subsequent rules within 10 years of their publication as final rule the section 610 requirement applies to those rules that the agencies determined have or will have seisnse and the purpose of the review is to deter mine whether the rule should be continued without change or should be amended or rescinded to minimize its impact on small entities one way some agencies have deci ded which rules should be reviewed is by focusing only on those rules for which final regulatory flexibility analysis was conducted at the time the fina l rule was issued however other agencies view section 610 as requiring them to review all of their rule s to determine whether they have currently seisnse regardless of their previous determinations6 either way agencies have considerable discretion in deciding what constitutes significant impact and substantial number of small entities and therefore what rules if any are covered by this requirement sbrefa established two new requirements that are also triggered by agencies determinations under the rfa eg compliance guides and advo cacy review panels compliance guides section 212 of sbrefa requires agencies to develop one or more compliance guides for each fina l rule or group of re lated final rules for which the agency is required to prepare an frfa7 specifically section 212 requires the guides to be posted in an easily identifiable location on the agencys website and distributed to known industry contact s be entitled small entity compliance guides and explain the actions small entity is required to take to comply with an associated final rule the statute also requi res the guide to be published not

agency does not have to prepare the compliance guides at all if it determines that the rule or group of rules does not have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities advocacy review panels section 244 of sbrefa amended section 609 of the rfa to require the environmen tal protection agency epa and the occupational safety and health administration osha to convene advocacy review panels before publishing an ir fa for proposed rule specifically the agency issuing the regulation either osha or epa must notify the sba chief counsel for advocacy and provide informa tion on the draft rules potential impacts on small entities and the type of small entities that might be affected the chief counsel then must identify representatives of affected small entities within 15 days of the notification the review panel must consist of fulltime federal employees from the rulemaking agency the office of management and budget and sbas chief counsel for advocacy during the panel process the panel must collect the advice and recommendations of representatives of affect ed small entities about the potential impact of the draft rule the panel must report on the comments received and on its recommendations later than 60 da ys after the panel is convened and the panels report must be made public as part of the rulemaking record8 however epa and osha do not have to hold an advocacy review panel at all if the issuing agency certifies that the subject rule will not have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities gao assessments of the rfas implementation gao has commented on the implementati on of the rfa numerous times within the past 15 to 20 years and recurring them in gaos reports is lack of clarity in the act regarding key terms and resulting variability in the acts implementation for example in 1991 gao reported that each of the four federal agencies that it reviewed had different in terpretation of key rfa provi sions most notably what constitutes significant economic impact or substantial number of small entities9 in 1994 gao again reported that ag encies compliance with the rfa varied widely from one agency to another and that agencies were interpreting the statute differently10 in 1999 report on the impleme ntation of section 610 of the rfa and in 2000 report on the implementation of the rfa at epa gao concluded that agencies had broad discretion to determine what the statute required11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34355crs5 11 continued office regulatory flexibility act implementa tion in epa program offices and

clarify elements of the act to improve its effectiveness gao06998 july 20 2006in the 2000 report gao determined that epa had certified virtually all of its rules after 1996 as not having seisnse and th at the rate of certifications increased substantially after the passage of sbrefa in all of these reports gao suggested that congress consider clarifying the acts requirements give sba or some other entity the responsib ility to develop criteria for whether and how agencies s hould conduct rfa analyses or both in 2001 gao stified that the promise of the rfa may never be realized until congress or some other entity defines what significant economic impact and substantial number of small entities mean in rulemaking setting 12 in 2002 gao agai n testified that the implementation of the rfa was still problematic and raised more questions about how the st atute should be interpreted13 for example gao said in determining wh ether rule has significant impact on small entities should agencies take into account the cumulative impact of similar rules in the same area should agencies c onsider the rfa triggered when rule has significant positive impact on small entities gao went on to say the following these questions are not simply matters of administrative conjecture within the agencies they lie at the heart of the rfa and sbrefa and the answers to the questions can have substantive effect on the amount of regulatory relief provided through those statutes because congre ss did not answer these questions when the statutes were enacte d agencies have had to develop their own answers and those an swers differ if congress does not like the answers that the agencies have developed it need s to either amend the underlying statutes and provide what it believes are the correct answers or give some other entity the authority to issue guidance on these issues14 in 2006 gao again testified that the full promise of rfa may never be realized until congress clarifies key terms and definitions in the act such as substantial number of small entities or provides an agency or office with the clear authority and responsibility to do so15 in addition to the areas raised previously gao said that numerous other issues regarding the rfa remain unresolved including how congress believes that the ec onomic impact of rule should be measured eg in terms of compliance costs as percentage ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34355crs6 16 us small business administration office of advocacy the regulatory flexibility act an implementation guide for federal agencies washington 1998 p 16 17 ibid p 18businesses annual revenues the percentage of work hours available to the firms or some other metric whether agencies should count the impact of the underlying statutes when determining whether their rules have significant impact what should be considered rul for purposes of the requirement that agencies review their rules within 10 years of their promulgation and whether agencies should review all rules that had seisnse at the time they were originally published as final rules or only those rules that currently have that effect therefore gao said congress might wish to review the procedures definitions exemptions and other provisions of rfa to determine whether changes are needed to better achieve the purposes congress in tended also gao sa id attention should be paid to the domino effect that an ag encys initial determin ation of whether rfa is applicable to rulemaking has on other statutory requirements such as preparing compliance guides for small entities and periodically reviewing existing regulations although gao has consiste ntly called for greater clarity in the rfas requirements other observers have indicated that the definitions of key terms like significant economic impact and substa ntial number of small entities should remain flexible because of significant differences in each agencys operating environment notably the sba office of advocacy said that definition could or arguably should be devised to apply to all rules given the dynamics of the economy and changes that are constantly ccurring in the structure of smallentity sectors16 in its guidance on the rfa sba said the lack of clear definitions in the act does not mean that congress left th terms completely ambiguous or open to unreasonable interpretations17 quoting the legislative history of the act in 1980 sba said the diversity of both the community of small entities and of rules themselves makes precise definition of the term significant economic impact virtually impossible and possibly counter productive illustrative examples of significant economic impacts cited in the guidance range widely from 500 in compliance costs to 2 reduction in re venues if an industry s profits are 3 of revenues similarly the guidance suggests that determinations of whether substantial number of sma ll entities are affected should begin with what it called the more than just few standard but ultimately does not require agencies to find that more than half of small entities would be affected proposed changes to the rfa by hr 4458 on december 12 2007 hr 4458 the small

committee unanimously reported the bill action on hr 4458 has been scheduled by the house committee on the judiciary and comparable legislation has been introduced in the senate s imilar legislation was introduced in the 109th congress hr 682 and s 1388 but was not acted upon hr 4458 would make number of chan ges to the rfa all of which are supported by the sba office of advocacy and small busine ss representatives18 for example section 3 of the bill would amend section 601 of the rfa and define economic impact to include direct economic effects of rule on small entities as well as any indirect effect which is r easonably foreseeable and results from such rule section 4 of the bill would make several changes to the rfas requirements for irfas frfas and certifications adding new analytical or reporting requirements and adding to the level of detail in existing requirements most of those changes are discussed later in this report section 5 of hr 4458 would amend sec tion 610 of the rfa and establish new requirements for the periodic review of rule s specifically within 180 days after enactment the bill would require agencies to publish in the federal register and on their websites plan for reviewing all existing rules that the agency heads determine have seisnse regardless of whet her the agency published frfa under section 604 of the rfa at the time the rule was promulgated the plan must provide for the review of all existing rules within 10 years after the enactment of the legislation although the agency head may extend that deadline by two years if completion of the reviews is not feasible and for the review of rules issued after enactment within 10 years of their publication in the federal register also each agency must publish list of the rules to be reviewed pursuant to the plan including why the agency determined each rule has seisnse and must request comments from the public the sba chief counsel for advocacy and the regulatory enforcement ombudsman on the enforcement of the rule finally the bill would require agencies to submit reports annually to congress and for agencies other than independent regulatory agencies the oira administrator the annual report is to include 1 the identification of any rule for which the agency head had made determination regarding whether the rule overlaps or conflicts with other rules and the length of time since the rule had previously been evaluated and 2 detailed explanation of the reasons for such determinationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34355crs8 19 see for example midtex electric cooperative inc v ferc 773 f2d 327 343 dc cir 1985 20 for example when epa published final rule establishing national ambient air quality standards naaqs fo r particulate matter in october 2006 the agency certified the rule as not having seisnse becau naaqs themselv impose regulations on small entities in its costbenefit analysis for th rule epa estimated the cost of installing controls to meet

case american trucking associations inc v us vironmental protection agency 175 f3d 1027 dc cir 1999 affirmed in part and reversed in part whitman v american trucking associations 532 us 457 2001 the us court of appeals fo r the district of columbia ruled that epa had complied with the rfa because the states not epa had the direct authority to impose requirements to control ozone and particulate matter consistent with epa health standards 21 this example of 2002 rule issued by the immigration and naturalization service was cited in testimony by the sba chief counsel for advocacy in support of hr 682 in the 109th congress testimony of sba chief counsel for advocacy thomas m sullivan in us congress house committee on the judiciary subcommittee on commercial and administrative law regulatory flexibility improvements act hr 682 hearings 109th cong 2nd sess july 20 2006 22 for example in 1991 rule epa acknowledged that the rule in question may have trickle down effects on other epa progra ms under the clean air act caa superfund or the resource conservation and recovery act rcra but went on to say that the purpose of todays action is solely to establish drinking water standards that public water systems must comply with consequently epa does not consider the cost of secondary continuedanalysis of hr 4458 some of the provisions in hr 4458 appear to address certain longstanding issues of concern regarding the implementa tion of the rfa other provisions appear to add to the number or depth of the analytical and notification requirements placed on rulemaking agencies and some other provisions seem unclear but hr 4458 may be most notable for what it does not do it does not clarify what constitutes significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities therefore agencies will still be able to determine when regulatory flexibility analysis is needed and consequently wh related requireme nts are triggered longstanding issues for more than 20 years courts have ruled that agencies need not prepare regulatory flexibility analyses if the effects of rule on an industry are indirect19 therefore for example if federal agency is issuing final rule establishing health standard that is implemented by states or other entities the federal agency issuing the rule need not prepare regulatory flexibility analysis even if it is clear that the implementation ultimately will have significant effect on substantial number of small entities20 likewise if federal agency issues rule directly regulating how long nonimmigrant aliens can re main in the united states but indirectly affecting sma ll businesses in the travel industry the agency can certify that the rule does not have seisnse21 agencies have also indicated that they do not consider the secondary effects that rule may have on the cost of compliance with other programs22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34355crs9 22 continued impacts which may occur under the caa superfund or rcra us environmental protection agency drinkin g water national primary drinking water regulations monitoring for volatile organic chemicals 56 federal register 30266 july 1 1991 23 the sba chief counsel for advocacy said hi s offices biggest concern with the rfa is that it does not require agencies to analyze indirect impacts see httpwwwsbagov advopress0738html by clarifying that the term economic impact includes indirect effects that are reasonably foreseeable and result from th rule hr 4458 might result in more agency rules being viewed as requi ring an irfa an frfa or both23 nevertheless agencies appear to have substantial discreti on in determining what indirect effects are reasonably foreseeable becau the proposed legislation does not define that term also even when the indirect effects of rule are foreseeable in some cases the agencies may not be able to provide much detail regarding those effects in their irfas and frfas eg when the implementation details are left to states or local governments hr 4458 would also clarify how agen cies reviews under section 610 of the rfa should be conducted as result agen cies would be required to review all of their rules to determine if they currently have seisne and could not simply rely on their previous determinations when the final rule was published in the federal register enactment of this change could result in substantially more section 610 reviews but with concomitant increase in time and effort required by federal agencies still unclear however is what constitutes rule under this requirement eg only the provision published in the federal register or the entire code of federal regulations part that the provision amended additional requirements other elements of hr 4458 appear to add to the number or depth of the analytical nd notification requirements that the rfa currently places on agencies for example whereas the rfa currently requires an irfa to contain description of the reasons why the agency action is being considered and succinct statement of the objectives of and legal basis for the proposed rule hr 4458 would require detailed statement describing those elements whereas the rfa currently requires that the irfa contain description of and where feasible an estimate of the number of small entities to which the propos ed rule will pply hr 4458 would require detailed description of the type of small entities affected and would require an estimate of the number of small entities affected or an explanation of why such an estimate is not available if an agency certifies rule as not requiring an irfa or frfa hr 4458 would require that the statement providing the factual basis for the certification be detailedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34355crs10 24 ralph lindeman house panel approves meas ure to require more agency review of regulatory burdens bna daily report for executives dec 14 2007 p a2 regarding frfas the bill would eliminate the current requirement that the statement of the need for and objectives of the rule be succinct and would require th at any explanation of why the number of small entities affected is not available be detailed the bill would also require that the frfa contain the agencys response to any comments from the sba chief counsel for advocacy in response to the proposed rule and detailed statement of changes made to the rule as result of those comments some public interest groups have expressed concerns th at these and other provisions in hr 4458 would add additional layers of analysis to regulatory process already thick with prescriptive requirements and would further tilt the regulatory playing field in favor of regulated interests24 to the extent that agencies strictly adhere to the precise wording of these requirements eg developing detailed statement describing rule instead of succinct statement agencies could experience substantially increased ruledevelopment time and compliance costs however some of the bills requirements appear to codify requirements that are currently in executive order 13272 eg the requirement that each agency notify the chief counsel for advocacy when th agency concludes that rule may have seisnse therefore if agencies are already pe rforming these executive orderrequired tasks their codification via hr 4458 would not app ear to add to the time or agency effort required to issue rules on the other hand some other parts of hr 4458 appear to place substantial new requirements on rulemaking agencies perhaps most notably the requirement that agencies implement new 10year plan for the review of all of their existing rules for agencies like epa that have taken narrow view of section 610 and only reviewed rules for which they had publis hed an frfa this requirement would greatly expand the scope of their section 610 reviews to all rules as result some agency rules issued decades earlier that d never before been reviewed would under hr 4458 be required to be reviewed howe ver this requirement would also affect agencies that have broadly interpreted section 610 therefore for example even though the department of tr ansportation is expected to complete comprehensive 10year process of reviewing all of its rules in 2008 hr 4458 would require the department to review ll of those rules again some requirements appear unclear some elements of this new section 610 process seem unclear for example hr 4458 states that each agency is to submit report annually that in cludes the identification of any rule with respect to which the head of the agency made deter mination described in paragraph 5 or 6 of subsection d and detailed explanati on of the reasons for such determination subsection d lists the factors that agencies are to consider in reviewing rules with paragraph 5 being the extent to which the rule overlaps duplicates conflicts with other federal rules and unless the head of the agency determines it to be infeasible state and local rules paragraph 6 of subsection d indicates that agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34355crs11 25 us government accountability office reexamining regulations opportunities exist to improve effectiveness and transpar ency of retrospective reviews gao07791 july 16 2007reviews of their rules should consider the length of time since the rule has been evaluated or the degree to which technolog economic conditions or other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule if an agency determines during its review that rule does not conflict with any other rule and that the relevant technology and economic conditions have not changed since the rule was issued is the agency to include this determination and detailed explanation of how it reached this conclusion in its nnual report or is the agency only to include such determinations and explanations for rules that do conflict with other rules or where the technology economic conditions or other factors have changed if agencies are expected to provide detailed explanations for decisions in either direction for all the rules they review each year the agencies annual reports to congress and oira could be time c onsuming and voluminous on the other hand if agencies are only to provi information regarding rules that they consider in conflict with other rules or ru for which relevant factors have changed then agencies will have strong incentives to reduce their reporting burden and conclude that those conditions are not present also the bill indicates that the annual reports as well as agency certifications that the 10year review process needs to be extended are to be sent to the congress but the precise recipient is unclear eg the parliamentarians or particular committee it also seems unclear what the congress is to do with the reports nd certifications once they arrive value of mandatory reviews more generally recent work by gao indicates that statutorily required regulatory reviews are less frequent and may be less effective than reviews undertaken at the agencies discretion thereby raising questions about the overall value of statut ory review requirements such as section 610 of the rfa in july 2007 report gao said most retrospective reviews of agency rules between 2001 and 2006 were c onducted at the agencies discretion not as result of mandatory requi rements such as section 61025 gao also said that discretionary reviews were more likely to involve the public in the process than mandatory reviews and were more likely to result in changes to the rules on the other hand statutorily require d reviews were more likely to have review standards and were more likely to be docum ented gao recommended that agencies incorporate various elements into their policies and procedur to improve the effectiveness and transparency of retrospective regulatory reviews and that they identify opportunities for congress to revi and consolidate existing review requirements bill does not clarify key rfa terms most notably however hr 4458 does not appear to address the central cr iticism that gao has raised regarding the rfa during the past 20 years ie the l ack of clarity and inconsistency in how agencies determine what constitutes significant economic impact or substantial number of sm all entities as gao has pointed out numerous times in the past unless congress defines those ke terms or requires sba or some other entity to do so agencies will be allowe d to develop their own definitions andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34355crs12 26 for example epa concluded that one proposed rule issued in 1999 would affect more than 5000 small businesses and impose more th an 100 million in compliance costs in the first year but epa still certified the rule as not having seisnse see us general accounting office regulatory flexibility act implementation in epa program offices and proposed lead rule gaoggd00193 sept 20 2000 in 1989 epa certified rule as not having seisne even though epa timated it would impose compliance costs on about 11000 small public water systems of between 333 million and 439 million per year see us environmental protection agency drinking water national primary drinking water regulations 54 federal register 27486 june 29 1989 27 us general accounting office regulatory flexibility act implementation in epa program offices and proposed lead rule gaoggd00193 sept 20 2000 p 16 28 sba size standards may be viewed at httpwwwsbagovservices contractingopportunitiessizest andardstopicsindexhtml therefore can determine when regulatory flexibility analysis is required in some cases agencies have concluded that ru imposing direct compliance costs of thousands of dollars per year on thousands of small entities did not represent significant economic effect on substantial number of small entities26 with the addition of new requirements that irfas and frfas be detailed agencies will have even greater incentives to certify th eir rules and avoid conducting the analyses altogether although this may be somewhat counterbalanced by the requirement that the factual basis of any certification also be detailed similar phenomenon occurred in 1996 when sbrefa required that agencies prepare compliance guides and that epa and osha conduct advocacy re view panels for any rule that the agencies did not certify at epa the percentage of rules that were certified as not having seisnse increased from 78 in the 30month period before sbrefa to 96 in the 30month period after sbrefa27 as the previous discussion suggests when agencies certify their rules as not having seisnse they not only exempt themselves from the requirements that they conduct an irfa and an frfa the agencies will also be able to avoid the related requirements to produce compliance guides and hold advocacy review panels the domino effect that gao mentioned als agencies will continue to have broad discretion in deciding which rules curren tly have seisnse and therefore require review under section 610 of the rfa th erefore the issue of what constitutes significant economic impact and substa ntial number of sm all entities affects number of rulemaki ng requirements as gao has pointed out in the past if congress wanted to address this issue it could define what seisnse is itself or it could require that sbas office of advocacy or some other entity define the term combination of both approaches is also possible for example even if congress were to establish broadly applicable bright line for when an irfa or an frfa must be prepared eg any rule that is expected to have at l east 5000 annual economic impact on at least 5000 small entities cannot be cer tified more industrysp ecific standards could be developed below that thres hold similar to the way that industryspecific standards have been developed for what constitutes small entity28
