cia analysis from march outlines possible prstrategies to shore up public support in germany and france for continued war in afghanistan after the dutch government fell on the issue of dutch troops in afghanistan last month the cia became worried that similar events could happen in the countries that post the third and fourth largest troop contingents to the isafmission the proposed pr strategies focus on pressure points that have been identiﬁed within these countries for france it is the sympathy of the public for afghan refugees and women for germany it is the fear of the consequences of defeat drugs more refugees terrorism as well as for germanys standing in the nato the memo is an recipe for the targeted manipulation of public opinion in two nato ally countries written by the cia it

sustaining west eur opean support for the natoled missionwhy counting on apathy might not be enough cnf the fall of the dutch government over its troop commitment to afghanistan demonstrates the fragility of european support for the natoled isaf mission some nato states notably france and germany have counted on public apathy about afghanistan to increase their contributions to the mission but indifference might turn into active hostility if spring and summer fighting results in an upsurge in military or afghan civilian casualties and if dutch style debate spills over into other states contributing troops the red cell invited cia expert on strategic communication and analysts following public opinion at the state departments bureau of intelligence and research inr to consider information approaches that might better link the afghan mission to the priorities of french german and other western european publics cnf public apathy enables leaders to ignore voters cnf the afghanistan missions low public salience has allowed french and german leaders to disregard popular opposition and steadily increase their troop contributions to the international security assistance force isaf berlin and pari s currently maintain the third and fourth highest isaf troop levels despite the opposition of 80 percent of german and french respondents to increased isaf deployme nts according to inr polling in fall 2009 only fraction 0113 percent of fr ench and german respondents identified afghanistan as the most urgent issue facing their nation in an openended question according to th same polling these pu blics ranked stabilizing afghanistan as among the lowest priorities for us and european leaders according to polls by the german marshall fund gmf over the past two years according to inr polling in the fall of 2009 the view that the afghanistan mission is waste of resources and not our pr oblem was cited as the most common reason for opposing isaf by german respondents and was the second most common reason by french respondents bu t the not our problem sentiment also suggests that so for sending troops to afghanistan is not yet on most voters radar cnf but casualties could precipitate backlash cnf if some forecasts of bloody summer in af ghanistan come to pass passive french and german dislike of their troop presence could turn into active and politic ally potent hostility the tone of previous debate suggests that spike in french or german casualties or in afghan civilian casualties could become tippi ng point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal cnf french and german commitments to nato are safeguard against precipitous departure but leaders fearing backlash ahea d of spring regional elections might become unwilling to pay political price for increasing troop levels or extending deployments if this memo was prepared by the cia red cell which has been charged by the director of intelligence with taking pronounced utofthebox approach that will provoke thought and offer an alternative viewpoint on the full range of analytic issue s comments and queries are welcome and may be

confidentialnoforn20350303 domestic politics forces the dutch to depart po liticians elsewhere might cite precedent for listening to the voters french and german leaders have over the past two years taken steps to preempt an upsurge of opposition but their vulnerability may be higher now to strengthen support president sarkozy called on the national assemblywhose approval is not required for isafto affirm the french mission after the combat deaths of 10 soldiers in august 2008 the government won the vote handily defusing potential crisis and giving sa rkozy cover to deploy approximately 3000 additional troops sarkozy however may now be more vulnerable to an upsurge in casualties because his party faces key regional elections this march and the already low support for isaf has fallen by oneth ird since march 2009 according to inr polling in the fall of 2009 political fallout from the germanordered kunduz airstrike in september 2009 which killed dozens of afghan civilians demo nstrated the potential pressure on the german government when afghanistan is sues come up on the public radar concern about the potential effects of afghan istan issues on the statelevel election in north rhinewestphalia in may 2010 could make chancellor merkelwho has shown an unwillingness to expend political capital on afghanistanmore hesitant about increasing or even sustaining germanys isaf contributions cnf tailoring messaging could forestall or at least contain backlash cnf western european publics might be better prep ared to tolerate spring and summer of greater military and civilian casualties if they perceive clear connect ions between outcomes in afghanistan and their own priorities co nsistent and iterative strategic communication program across nato troop contributors that taps into the key concerns of specific western european audiences could provide buffer if todays apathy becomes tomorrows opposition to isaf giving politicians greater scope to support deployments to afghanistan cnf french focused on civilians and refugees focusing on message that isaf benefits afghan civilians and citing exam ples of concrete gains could limit and perhaps even reverse opposition to the mission such tailored messag could tap into acute french concern for civilians and refugees those who support isaf in inr surveys from fall 2009 most frequently cited their percepti on that the mission helps afgh an civilians while opponents most commonly argued that the mission hurts civilians contradicting the isaf does more harm than good perception is cl early important particularly fo r frances muslim minority highlighting afghans broad support fo r isaf could underscore the missions positive impact on civilians about twothirds of afghans support the presence of isaf forces in afghanistan according to reliable abcbbcadr poll conducted in december 2009 according to inr polling in fall 2009 those french and german respondents who believed that the afghan people oppose isaf48 percent and 52 percent respectivelywere more likely than others to oppose participation in the mission conversely messaging that dramatizes the potential adverse consequences of an isaf defeat for afghan civilians could leverage french and other european guilt for abandoning them the prospect of the taliban rolling back hardwon progress on girls education could provoke french indignation become rallying point for frances largely secular public and give voters reason to support good and necessary cause despite casualties httpwikileaksorgﬁleciaafgthanistanpdfconfidentialnoforn confidentialnoforn the media controversy generated by pariss decision to expel 12 afghan refugees in late 2009 suggests that stories about the plight of afghan refugees are likely to resonate with french audiences the french government has already made combating afghan human trafficking netw orks priority and would probably support an information campaign that nato defeat in afghanistan could precipitate refugee crisis cnf germans worried about price and principle of isaf mission german opponents of isaf worry that war in afghanistan is waste of resources not german problem and objectionable in principle judging from an inr poll in the fall of 2009 some german opposition to isaf might be muted by proof of progress on the ground warnings about the potential consequences for germany of defeat and reassurances that germany is valued partner in necessary natoled mission underscoring the contradiction between ge rman pessimism about isaf and afghan optimism about the missions progress could challenge skeptics assertions that the mission is waste of resources the sa abcbbcadr poll revealed that 70 percent of afghans thought their country was heading in the right direction and would improve in 2010 while 2009 gmf poll showed that about the same proportion of german respondents were pessimistic about ever stabilizing afghanistan messages that dramatize the consequences of nato defeat for specific german interests could counter the widely held perception that afghanistan is not germanys problem for example messa ges that illustrate how defeat in afghanistan could heighten germanys exposure to terrorism opium and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics emphasis on the missions multilateral and humanitarian aspects could help ease germans concerns about waging any kind of war while appealing to their desire to support multilateral efforts despite their allergy to ar med conflict germans were willing to break precedent an d use force in the balkan s in the 1990s to show commitment to their nato llies german respondents ci ted helping their allies as one of the most compelling reasons for supp orting isaf according to an inr poll in the fall of 2009 cnf appeals by president obama and afghan women might gain traction cnf the confidence of the french and german pu blics in president obamas ability to handle foreign affairs in general and afghanistan in pa rticular suggest that they would be receptive to his direct affirmation of their importance to the isaf missionand sensitive to direct expressions of disappointment in allies who do not help 1 according to gmf poll conducted in june 2009 about 90 percent of french and german respondents were confident in th presidents ability to handle foreign policies the same poll revealed that 82 percent of french and 74 percent of german respondents were confident in the presidents ability to stabilize afghanistan although the subsequent wait for the us surge strategy may have eroded some of this confidence 1 european hand wringing about the presidents lack of attendance at eu summit and commentary that his absence showed that europe counted for less suggests that worry about european standing with washington might provide at least some leverage for sustaining contributions to isaf cnf httpwikileaksorgﬁleciaafgthanistanpdfconfidentialnoforn confidentialnoforn the same poll also found that when respondents were reminded that president obama himself had asked for increased depl oyments to afghanistan their support for granting this request increased dramatically from 4 to 15 percent among french respondents and from 7 to 13 percent among germans the total percentages may be small but they suggest significant sensitivity to disappointing president seen as broadly in sync with european concerns cnf afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing the isaf role in combating the taliban because of womens ability to sp eak personally and credibly about their experiences under the taliban their aspirations for the future and their fears of taliban victory outreach initiatives that create dia opportunities for afghan women to share their stories with french german and other european women could help to overcome pervasive skepticism among women in western europe toward the isaf mission according to inr polling in the fall of 2009 french women are 8 percentage points less likely to support the mission than are men and german women are 22 percentage points less likely to support the war than are men media events that feature testimonials by afghan women would probably be most effective if broadcast on programs that have large and dispro portionately female audiences cnf wikileaks the sunshine press
