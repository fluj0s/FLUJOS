convention was agreed to in 1982 but the united st ates never became signatory nati on the current administration s reiterated support for us accession to the convention and the senate committee on foreign relations reported the convention on december 19 2007 the nate may choose to address the ambiguities of the convention with its power to make declarations and statements as provided for in article 310 of the convention such declarations and statements can be useful in promulgating us policy and putting other nations on notice of us interpreta tion of the convention possible benefit of us ratification would be the international communitys anticipated positive response to such us ac tion in addition early us participation in the development of policie s and practices of the intern ational tribunal for the law of the sea the commission on the limits of the continental shelf and the international seabed authority could help to forestall future problems related to living marine resources on the othe r hand some us interests view us ratification as potentially complicating enforcement of domestic marine regulations and remain concerned that the conve ntions language concerning arbitrary refusal of access to surplus unallocated living resources might be potential source of conflict in addition to c oncerns about other provisions of the convention these uncertainties reflect the absence of any co mprehensive assessment of the social and economic impacts of implementation by the united states this report describes pr ovisions of the convention

into force but not for the united states the convention was the culmination of more than 10 years of intense negotiation however the united states chose not to participate in the convention in the early 1980s without changes to parts dea ling with deep seabed mineral resources beyond national jurisdiction after 1994 agreement amended parts of the convention dealing with deep seabed mineral resources the convention annexes and agreement package was formally submitted to the us senate on october 7 1994 for advice and consent to accession and ratification senate treaty doc 10339 more recently the george w bush administra tion has reiterated its support for us accession to the convention in the 110th congress the convention was reported on decembe r 19 2007 by the senate committee on foreign relations s execrept 1109 the convention and subsequent 1994 agreement on deep seabed mining are extensive complex documents touching on wide range of policy issues and us interests from the perspective of the united states some of the most significant areas addressed by the convention deal with naval power nd maritime commerce coastal state interests marine environment protection marine scie ntific research and international dispute settlement1 number of issues ma arise during any senate consideration of the convention in cluding the question of whether the 1994 agreement adequately addresses the deep seabed portions of the convention that were at the core of us opposition to th original convention policy issues relating to areas beyond living resources that are likely to draw senate attention are discussed more fully in crs report rs21890 and include the dispute settlement process set fort h in the convention and the us declarations on dispute settlement the

resources ie fish shellfish sea turtles and marine mammals provisions of the convention recogniz international interdependence on these resources and provide framework fo r their cooperative and sustainable management these provisions comprising articles 61 through 73 deal specifically with conservation article 61 exploitation article 62 transboundary and straddlin g stocks article 63 highly migratory st ocks article 64 marine mammals article 65 anadromous stocks article 66 catadromous stocks article 67 sedentary species article 68 rights of landlocked nations article 69 rights of geographically disadva ntaged nations article 70 nonapplicability of article s 69 and 70 article 71 restrictions on transfer of rights article 72 and enforcement by coastal nations article 73 in addition sedentary contin ental shelf species are more specifically addressed in article 774 living resources on the high seas are considered in articles 116120 and marine habitat prot ection is provided by ar ticles 192196 as presently understood and interpreted these provisions generally reflect current us policy with respect to living marine resource mana gement conservation and exploitation as reflected primarily in the magnusonstev ens fishery conserva tion and management act2 however increasingly complex ocean policy is being formulated within the regime without strong us par ticipation to addre ss us concerns in support of current us maritime policy the us g overnment particularly the us coast guard currently expends cons iderable resources enforcing us and international fishing and living resources laws in the us exclusive economic zone eez off both the atlantic and pacific coasts as well as hawaii howlandbaker guam northern marianas islands puerto ri co and other remote us eez areas andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32185crs3 3the coast guards fy2009 budget request in cludes 7191 million for domestic fisheries enforcement in the us eez and 1176 million fo r foreign fisheries enforcement protecting the us eez boundary and enforcing international fishery agreements 4however coastal nation sovereign rights over sedentary species see sedentary species below may extend beyond 200 miles to the extent of the continental shelf 5with view to this broad interpretation some nations have used the maximum sustainable yield and optimum utilization language to justify commercial whaling 6the approach taken in article 65 of the s convention explicitly recognizes the rights of coastal nations to prohibit the exploitation of marine mammalsin the high seas drift net area of the western pacific3 recognizing the existing level of us commitment and based on current us interpretation the living resource provisions of the convention are genera lly not seen as imposing significant new us obligations commitments or encumbrances involving living resources and their management the convention could pr ovide several new pr ivileges primarily related to participation in commissions deve loping international ocean policy some measure of increased stability in international living marine resource policy can be inferred as beneficial aspect of us participation in the regime it appears that new domestic legislation would be re quired to implement the living resources provisions of the convention conservation and exploitation the convention recognizes the broa d authority of coastal nation over living resources within its territorial sea and exclusive economic zone eez to maximum of 200 miles seaward from the base lines used to measure the territorial sea4 in managing living resources coastal nations are to determine allowable catches and promote optimal resource use to this end drafters of the convention were intentionally ambiguous in their attempt to make the convention acceptable to broad range of constituents thus the terms maximum sustainable yield article 61 and optimum utilization article 62 are open to broad interpretation and may require further definition to pr ovide additional guidance on how sustainable management of living ma rine resources is to be attained5 except for article 65 the conventi on shows some bias toward optimal exploitation of the resource with little explicit recognition of nonconsumptive management objectives which might reduce harvests to substantially less than optimal or maximum sustainable yield levels6 articles 612 and 613 do provide mandatory obligation to ensure that liv ing resources are not endangered by over exploitation and that threatened species are restored to levels which can produce their maximum sustainable yield in additi on the phrase as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors appear ing in article 613 provides basis for harvesting at rates both above or below the maximum sustainable yield however the subsequent examples of how this qualif ication is to be interpreted focus on ways to protect against overharvesting or possible justification for exceeding the maximum sustainable yield rather than providing any explicit acknowledgment that valid reasons may exist for refraining alto gether from harvesting to achieve non consumptive goals eg tourism in reef environments or biodi versity conservationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32185crs4 7initial work on the convention began in 1958 so the essence of many provisions had been agreed to by 1976 when the magnusonstevens act was enacted 8however the central bering sea conventi on does not provide for compulsory dispute settlement the senate agreed to resolution of advice and consent to ratification of this convention on october 7 1994 this agreement entered into force on december 8 1995or to respond to moralethical concerns eg large sharks dolphins and whales should not be killed regard less determination of allowable catch within coastal nations eez is not subject to compulsory procedures leading to binding dispute settlement under the convention if coastal nation is unable to harvest the entire allowable catch other nations must be given access to these resources subject to appropriate terms and conditions resource populations are to be managed such that they can produce harvests at maximum sustainable yield levels the us fishery conservation and management act of 1976 16 usc 1801 et seq now known as the magnusonstevens act was crafted to parallel closely most of the draft conventions provisions for living resources7 the convention in article 61 4 encourages attention to associated or dependent species if interpreted narrowly this might encompass incidental bycatch concerns by calling for consideration of these associated or dependent species so that their reproduction is not seriously threaten ed more broadly however attention to ocean ecosystems would reflect the highly complex web of biological relationships where food chain and commensal associati ons create intricate interdependencies some marine conservation regimes such as those under the convention on the conservation of antarctic marine living resources are sensitive to these concerns and attempt to manage living marine resources from an ecosystem approach straddling and transboundary fish stocks straddling fish stocks ranging between national eezs and international waters and transboundary stocks are to be ma naged cooperatively through bilateral or multilateral international agreements i nvolving coastal nations through whose waters these fish stocks range as well as any nations fishing these stocks in international waters the united states acted in concert with these provisions by negotiating the convention on the conservati on and management of po llock resources in the central bering sea senate treaty doc 10327 to gove rn harvest and management of fish stocks migrating betw een international waters in the bering sea the donut hole and adjacent waters under national jurisdiction8 an example of an effective bilateral agreement on transboundary fi sh stock is the 1953 convention for the preservation of the halibut fishery of the northern pacific ocean and bering sea between the united states and canada concerns remain over attempts to cooperatively manage anchovy fisheries along the unite d statesmexico pacific boundary the 1995 agreement for the impl ementation of the provisions of the united nations convention of the

with the convention10 highly migratory species prior to 1990 the us position on certain highly migratory species was contrary to that of the convention in that the united states did not claim national jurisdiction over tunas however the fishery conservation amendments of 1990 pl 101627 modified us policy to be consistent with the convention by amending the magnusonstevens act to exte nd national jurisdiction to include tunas article 64 of the conve ntion calls for cooperative management of highly migratory species to ensure their conservation and promote their optimum harvest within and beyond the eez the united stat is party to agreements in both the atlantic and pacific consistent with the provisions of article 64 in the pacific the 1950 convention between the united states of america and the republic of costa rica for the establishment of an interamerican tropical tuna commission serves this purpose by involving six nations the 1966 intern ational convention for the conservation of atlantic tunas involves 22 nations the 1995 straddling stocks agreement more specifically addresses cerns for highly migratory stocks in manner consistent with the conventi on and involves 36 nations more recently the convention on the conservation and ma nagement of highly migratory fish stocks in the western and central pacific ocean was signed by 19 nations but has not yet entered into force annex i to the convention provides list of species designated as highly migratory the united states is signatory to these four agreements marine mammals article 65 of the conve ntion provides that coasta l nations may manage and regulate marine mammals more strictly than otherwise provided by the convention international cooperation for conservation is mandated with specific direction that cetaceans ie whales and dolphins be conserved managed and studied internationally ar ticle 120 extends this unders tanding to marine mammals on the high seas whales and dolphins are identified in the list of highly migratory species provided in annex i to the convention article 65 calls for coopera tion with view to conservation in the case of cetaceans nations are to work through appropriate international organizations for their conservation protection for most cetaceans is provided currently through moratorium on commercial whaling imposed by the international whaling

lives in the ocean but enter freshwater to spawn salmon sturgeon and striped ba ss are some of the anadromous species of interest to the united states the convention assigns prima ry interest in and responsibility for anadromous fish stocks to the nations in whose rivers the stocks originate fishing for anadromous stocks is prohibited on the high seas except in cases where economic dislocation might re sult coastal nations through whose waters anadromous fish migrate are require d to cooperate with the nations wherein the anadromous stocks originated enforcement of regulations concerning anadromous fish stocks beyond the eez is to be accomplished through negotiated agreement the united states actively par ticipates in coopera tive bilateral salmon agreement with canada as well as

of the cana dian continental shelf outside canadas 200 mile jurisdiction us officials conceded in november 1994 that the canadian interpretation that icelandic scall ops were sedentary was correctunited states the convention gives the coastal nations where these species spend most of their lives the respons ibility for managing them and prohibits harvesting them on the high seas intern ational cooperation is required where these species migrate through more than one eez sedentary species sedentary species are addressed in article 774 of the convention coastal nation jurisdiction over sedentary species ma extend beyond 200 miles to the extent of the continental shelf as fined in article 76 although the meaning of sedentary is defined listing of exac tly which species are to be considered sedentary is provided in the conven tion thus c ontroversy may arise over access to certain species15 and dispute resolution provided by the convention may become necessary given the current differences of opinion and limited data additional scientific research may be required to better understand the sedentary nature of certain shellf ish such as scallops protection for sedentary species is furt her promoted by article 136 which states that the seabed ocean floor and subsoil beyond the limits of nati onal jurisdiction are the common heritage of humankind this implies an obligation to protect the seamounts and hydrothermal vents that support unique ecosystems this view receives additional support fro m article 145 on protecting the marine environment of the seabed ocean floor and subsoil be yond the limits of national jurisdiction and conserving the natural resources of the s eabed and ocean floor to prevent damage to flora and fauna other concerns may arise where the c ontinental shelf beyond 200 miles is shared between nations for example how might potential competing russian and us interests in developing snail fishery in the bering seas enclosed international waters the donut hole be handled under the regime high seas the convention preserves the freedom to fish on the high seas subject to other treaty obligations the rights duties and interests of coastal nations and an obligation to cooperate in c onserving and managing high seas living resources the conventions obligation to cooperate in the cons ervation and management of high seas living resources would represent new commitment for the united states and is subject to compulsory dispute settlement should conf lict arise the 1995 straddling stocks agreement addresses specific concerns for the conservation and management of high seas stocks in manner consistent with the convention in addition the senate agreed to resoluti on of advice and consen t to ratification

academic publishers 200410324 on october 6 1994 this agreement developed under the leadership of the food and agriculture organization re flects the intent of the convention and extends its reach by limiting the reflagging of vessels in high seas fisheries this agreement entered into force on apr il 24 2003 with 27 nations as parties access by disadvantaged nations although the convention provides special access rights to surplus living marine resources within coastal nation eezs for nearby developing nations that are landlocked or geographically disadvantaged nations meeting these criteria are believed to exist within the same region as the united states regional subregional or bilateral agreements would be negotiate d to guide the provision of an equitable allocation to any such disadvantaged nation regardless it is the coastal nation alone that determines whether any harvestable surplus exists within its eez and such decision may not be challenged through dispute settlement procedures marine habitat protection article 192 states general obligation of parties to the convention to protect and preserve the mari ne environment while artic 193 states that resource exploitation is to be conducte d within this obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment this becomes mo re specific in artic 1945 which calls attention to measures necessary to protect and preserve rare or fragile ecosystems as well as the habitat of depleted threaten ed or endangered species and other forms of marine life additional protection is provided by ar ticle 614 which encourages attention to bycatch and incidental catch by calling for commercial fishermen to consider associated or depe ndent species so that thei r reproduction not be seriously threatened preventing intentional or accidental introduction of harmful alien or exotic species by all measures necessary is directed by article 196 in addition article 206 requires an envi ronmental impact assessment

compulsory dispute settlement proceedings leading to binding decisions under the convention the coastal state shall not be obliged to accept the submission to such settlement compulsory procedures leadin g to binding decisions of any dispute relating to its sovereign rights with respect to the living resources in the exclusive economic zone or their exercise including its discretionary powers for determining the allowable catch its harvesting capacity the allocation of surpluses to other states and the terms and conditions established in its conservation and management laws and regulations article 2973b does provide that disputes can be submitted to conciliation when 1 coastal nation has faile d to properly conserve and manage eez living resources such that they become seriously endangered 2 coastal nation has arbitrarily refused to determine allowable catches and capacity to harvest species desired by foreign nation or 3 coastal nation has arbitrarily refused to allocate

based on these interpretations the living resource provisions of the convention are genera lly not seen as imposing significant new us obligations commitments or encumbrances involving living resources and their management one possible be nefit of us ratification would be the international communitys anticipated positive response to such us action in addition us accession to the convention would pr ovide the united states the opportunity to nominate representative to the commission on the limits of the continental shelf and to seek clarification of us continental shelf boundaries thus addressing concerns related to shared continental shelf areas such as the bering seas donut hole and in the chukchi sea20 furthermore accession could benefit the united states by allowing us participati on in the international seab ed authority and appointment of us representatives to its various subsidiary bodies21 as the status of the international whaling commission iwc is currently in dispute some suggest that the united st ates if ratifying the convention might offer declaration recognizing the iw c as the appropriate international organization to regulate cetaceans as means to marginalize any competing organizations that might seek to offer an alternative model of cetacean management such us action might empower and energize the iwc an organization that the united states has worked hard to develop as key marine conservation body moreover us accession to the conve ntion would provide the united states with the opportunity to nominate national re presentatives as judges on the itlos and to fully participate in developing the practices of this important global body on the other hand some us intere sts view us ratification as potentially complicating enforcement of domestic marine regulations these uncertainties reflect the absence of any comprehensive assessment of the social and economic impacts of implementation by the united states22 although early itlos cases do not indicate problem some in the unite d states remain concerned that the conventions language concerni ng arbitrary refusal of access to surplus unallocated living resources might be potential s ource of conflict additional concerns surround whether and to what extent the ited states could regu late ballast water discharges to combat invasive species23 supplemental to and in

aboveinternational action taken by the international maritime organization imo24 if the convention is interpreted such that invasive species are covered under the conventions broad definiti on of pollution the united states and other coastal nations could be constrained as to what preventive measures could be imposed on ships operating outside our territorial sea25 proponents of the convention maintain that us participation in the development of policie s and practices of the internati onal tribunal for the law of the sea the commission on the limits of the continental shelf and the international seabed authority could help to forestall future problems related to living marine resources in addition they indicate that the senate could choos to address some of the intentional ambiguities of convention drafters with its power to make declarations and statements as provided for in article 31026 such declarations and statements can be useful in promulgating us policy and putting other nations on notice of us interpretation of the convention range of issues where us interpretive statements might be helpful was discussed at senate committee on foreign relations hearing
