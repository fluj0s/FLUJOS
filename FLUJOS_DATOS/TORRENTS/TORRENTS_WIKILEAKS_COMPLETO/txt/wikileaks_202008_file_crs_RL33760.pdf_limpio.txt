confronting the new congress is what to do in iraq the bakerhamiltonled iraq study group re commended pursuing new diplomatic initiative including negotiations with iran and syria and making the training of iraqi security forces the primary us milita ry mission the commission concluded that the united states could aim to withdraw all us combat brigades not necessary for force protection by the first quarter of 2008 congress faces an evaluation of these recommendations and decision as to what its role should be in implementing these or other new policies suppl emental appropriations for

security dynamics in asia and around the globe the ongoing fi ght against terrorism particularly in the afghanistanpakistan border re gion and efforts to dissuade or restrain iran and north korea from pursuing nuclear weapons progra ms are key issues for consideration as is the israelpalestinian conflict defense spending and pa rticularly budgeting for operations in iraq and afghanistan will also be one of the major issues facing the 110th congress congress may be asked to consider large increases in funding for the army and it faces potentially difficult tradeoff between increases in the size of the army and funding for major weapons programs other defens issues include the implementation of recent base closure plans the status of intelligence reform pay and benefits of military personnel and the role and structur of national guard and reserve forces trade issues have become increasingly controversial in recent years and may well remain so as many members grapple with the real and

daggett specialist in national defense 77642 stuart d goldman specialist in russian and eurasian affairs 77685 number of challenging issues in fore ign defense and trade policy are likely to confront the 110th congress starting with what the bakerhamiltonled iraq study group isg calls the grave nd deteriorating situation in iraq in early 2007 the administration is expected to ask fo r supplemental appropriations for military operations in iraq and afghanistan and to enhance social and political stability democratization and reconstruction in those countri after iraq other high priorities will be the continuing fight against terrorism and efforts to dissuade or restrain iran and north korea from pursu ing nuclear weapons programs congress will also consider number of free trade agreements ftas and whether to extend presidential trade promotion authority tpa with both chambers set to pass from republican to democratic control the 110th congress is likely to intensify its oversight over these and other administration policies and activities as the 110th congress convenes the issue that overshadows all others is what to do in iraq although not all memb ers agree entirely with the isgs grim assessment of the situation in iraq the predominant issue in congress longer seems to be whether to stay the course but what to do differently key corollary question for congress is what its ro should be in redirecting policy key recommendation of the isg calls for major us diplomatic initiative throughout the region to help stabilize the teriorating situation in iraq the groups report proposes us diplomatic engagement with iran and syria among others and intensified us efforts to help resolve the israelpalestinian conflict and the crisis in lebanon the 110th congress may want to consider to what extent it supports this recommendation and what if any legislative measures might be called for to promote it among the central recommendations of the isg are to make training of iraqi security forces the primary us military mission and to aim to withdraw all us combat brigades not necessary for for ce protection by the first quarter of 2008 congress faces an evaluation of these recommendations and decision as to what if any legislative measures might be he lpful to promote these or other policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33760crs2 following that central issue may be whether congress should insert any specific enforceable policy prescriptions into upcoming legislation to provide supplemental f unding for the war in early february the defense department is expected to request supplemental appropria tions to cover cost s of military operations in iraq and afghanistan for the remainde r of fy2007 during the war in vietnam congress frequently debated amendments to defense spending bills to reduce troop strength or to cut off funding for us military operations cong ress finally approved funding cutoff in 1973 though congress may not be inclined to go so far in iraq there may well be support for linking funding to achievement of political benchmarks such as those that the isg laid out some may propose specific timetable for withdrawing forces alternatively there has been some s upport in congress for adding troops in iraq congressional action on the fy2007 supplem ental appropriati ons bill may also be the first round of what may be an ongoing debate in the 110th congress over the preparedness of us military forces and the sufficiency of planned funding for military personnel training nd equipment in recent ears congress has provided progressively larger amounts of money fo r warrelated costs in annual supplemental appropriations bills as we ll substantial and growing amounts in regular defense budget requests in fy2006 congress pr ovided over 530 billion for the department of defense of which about 120 billion were additional funds for the war the 109th congress also approved down payment of 70 billion for war costs in fy2007 of which almost 25 billion was to repa ir and replace army and marine corps equipment lost or worn down by the war now it appears that the army in particular has toted up much larger bill than had earlier been expected as the cost of equipping and reorganizing its forces to prepare not only for operations in iraq nd afghanistan but also for possible future operations abroad initial reports are that the army and the other services have requested an additional 125130 billion in warrelated expenses which would bring the total for fy2007 to almost 200 billion although it is not yet known how much of that the white house will request from congress for congress central issue is how to ensure adequate readiness while also maintaining some degree of fiscal discipline key aspect of that issue is how to manage budgetary tradeoffs between pressures to add to the size of the ar my and marine corps and also preserve sufficient funds to modernize military forces in the longer term in addition to iraq and afghanistan other central foreign policy issues facing the administration and 110th congress are how best to deal with the challenges posed by the nuclear activities of north korea and ir an in 2007 there is likely to be good deal of political and diplomatic activity regarding both countries nuclear programs the 110th congress may exercise oversight of administration conduct in this area and may address aspects of the issue more directly through legislative action european issues that the 110th congre ss may address incl ude natos role in afghanistan the status of kosovo and re lations with russia natos expanding engagement in afghanistan is the alliances largest and most problematic military operation to date there is controversy over restrictions some allies have placed on the role of their forces there the disputed status of kosovo is set to be resolved in early 2007 possibly in some form of indepe ndence russia presents complex sethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33760crs3 of challenges and opportunities for the united states partic ularly with regard to its policies toward neighboring states and the implications of its growing influence as an energy supplier for europe security issues in asia that may dr aw the attention of the 110th congress include flashpoints along the taiwan strait on the korean peninsula between india and pakistan and along the pakistani bord er with afghanistan as well as terrorist activity in indonesia the philippines indi and pakistan two other longterm trends in asia that may warrant congressional attention are the rise of china and its increasing influence in the region and globally and increasingly negative attitudes toward the united states particularly among southeast asian nations with large muslim populations and in south korea legislative and oversight attention to latin america and the caribbean in the 110th congress will likely focus on continued counternarcotics effo rts especially in the andean region potential immigration reform efforts as well as efforts to increase cooperation on border security wh ich have been key issues in relations with mexico efforts to deal with threats to democracy in such nations as venezuela as well as the rise of leftist populism in veral latin american countri and debate over the best means to foster political change in cuba key us policy issues pertaining to africa are likely to center on efforts to promote peace and security in the region counterterrorism initiatives bilateral military cooperation and traini ng in support of international peacekeeping the programmatic focus funding vels and objectives of dive rse us assistance efforts with particular emphasis on fighting the hivaids pandemic and promoting democracy human rights trade nd marketdriven economic growth in january 2006 secretary of state rice announced major foreign policy initiative that she called tran sformational diplomacy bold diplomacy to match the presidents bold mission of supporting democracy around the world with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world pursuant to this goal state department personnel are to be shifted largely from europe and washington dc to designated critical locations in africa south asia east asia and the middle east they are to be trained in public diplomacy skills and encouraged not merely to report on the country in which they are posted but to promote democratic principles there this initiative will likely require increased funding for the foreign operations budget the 110th congress may seek to exercise oversight on how the money is spent whether transformational diplomacy is ffective and how foreign governments respond to this us promotion of democracy in their countries trade issues have become increasingly controversial in congress during the last few years this is likely to continue to be the case during the 110th congress as many members grapple with the real and perceived effects of globalization and how to balance the benefits and costs of trade liberalization many members of congress have raised concerns over lost jobs and lower wages over the growing income gap in the united states over the burgeoning us trade deficits with trading partners especially china and the undervaluing of chinas currency while mainstream economists generally assert that trade policy has very limited role in these areas forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33760crs4 many members the trends serve as backdr op to debate on the shape and conduct of us trade policy that debate could be unched early in the 110th c

us troop levels others maintain that sectarian violence is placing us forces in the middle of an all out civil war in iraq and that setting timetable for withdrawal might force compromise among iraqi factions others believe that us move to withdraw might undercut popular support for the insurgency some members ma intain that the us approach should focus not on counterinsurgent combat but on

opinions va ry widely on how and when this can be achieved some argue that given the relativ ely poor isf performance to date at least substantial shortterm increase in us troop levels and intensified counterinsurgency operations are nece ssary to establish secure political environment critics of this approach believe that the isf must be strongly encouraged to operate more effectively on their own and that this will be best achieved by phased drawdown of us troops over the next year or more with us forces serving primarily in advisory and rapid reinforcement roles if needed as the united states

in the political process new constitution was adopted in january 2004 successful presidential elections were held on october 9 2004 and pa rliamentary elections took place on september 18 2005 the

that were forbidden under the taliban women are pa rticipating in econo mic and political life including as ministers provinc ial governors and senior levels of the new parliament clouding the prior optimism has been the unexpected escalation of the insurgency led by remnants of the former taliban regime in 2006 after several years in which it appeared the taliban were mostly defeated taliban fighters have conducted several increasingly larger scale attacks on coalition and afghan security forces in several southern provinces setting back reconstruction and thwarting efforts to extend afghan government authority in addition narco tics trafficking is resisting countermeasures and independent militia s remain throughout the country although many have been disa rmed observers attribute the increased violence to number of different factors including popular disappointment at the slow pace of reconstruction official afghan corruption ample funding from narcotics trafficking the continuing writ of regional faction leaders the ability of taliban fighters to find safe haven in neighboring pakistan and possible in spiration from and cross fertilization between taliban insurgents and qaeda or other fighters coming from the insurgency in iraq the 110th congress is likely to actively monitor us civilian and military assistance to afghanistan amid calls by us and nato

presence in number of afghan provinceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33760crs9 many nato countries have placed na tional caveats on how their troops may be used in afghanistan which limits their utility and

that these modifications do little to ease the burden on us british canadian and dutch forces us and nato forces play limited supporting role in combating afghanistans illegal opium trade the profits

108 pl 9352 87 stat 130 congress will also be faced with asse ssing the administrations war requests task that has been difficult because of piecemeal information about annual costs and limited information about ke factors such as past and current troop levels that affect costs the iraq study group called funding requests for iraq confusing and criticized the fact that it is difficult to identify the amount requested for the iraq operations dod has not provided congress with an allocation of all previously appropriated funds by operation ie for iraq afghan istan or other counterterror operations war funds are also currently mixed with regular funds during execution which limits visibility on how funds are ultima tely spent and means that the effect of war costs on the deficit can only be estimated congressional leaders have promised increased scrutiny of dod war costs congress may also choose to consider exte nding the scope of the special inspector general from reconstruction to dods military activities rath er than relying solely on dods inspector general or the servi ces audit agencies echoing frequently expressed congressional concerns the ir aq study group calls on dod to include full year of war costs in dods regular fy 2008 budget so as not to circumvent the normal budget process or put pressure on congress to review requests quickly to ensure monies to support the troops it is not clear whether dod will provide congress with the detailed budget justif ication called for in the fy2007 national defense authorization act and initially required of the services recent press reports peg service reque sts for the fy2007 supplemental at 100 billion to 160 billion in addition to the 70 billion already enacted according to the reports the president is likely to re quest an additional 100 billion or total of 170 billion for fy2007 which would be 45 higher than the previous year if troop levels remain at roughly curre nt levels it is not clear why the fy2007 supplemental should be larger than fundi ng in fy2006 in th at case the fy2007 supplemental would be 50 billion in additi on to the 70 billion already appropriated if some combat troops are withdrawn from iraq in fy2007 as proposed by the iraq survey report war costs would be expe cted to decrease in response to congressional request cbo estimated that war costs would decrease by 11 billion if 25000 troops were withdrawn and by 17 billion if 60000 troops were withdrawn on the other hand if troop leve ls were temporarily increas ed as some have proposed war costs could increase by several billion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33760crs11 some might argue that funding should increase in order to intensify training of iraqi security forces congress has thus far appropriated 154 b illion to train iraqi security forces including 39 billion that is available for fy2007 three to four fold expansion of us military personnel embedded with iraqi forces as proposed by the iraq study group would be cove red primarily by cu rrent military personnel costs though some increase in traini ng monies could also be needed on october 25 2006 deputy secretary of defense england issued new guidance on war costs to the services requiring them to submit requests based on the longer war against terror rather than st rictly oif and oef operations in response the services apparently greatly increased their original requests since the long war on terror is dods key mission it may not be clear why such costs be considered emergency war supplemental spending rath er than part of dods regular budget two issues that may be cited as reas ons that war costs could be higher in fy2007 are current readiness problems and the cost of reset the repair and replacement of warworn equipment according to various reports current army readiness rates have declined to the lowest levels since the end of the vietnam war with roughly half of all army units both active and reserve at the lowest readiness ratings for currently available units primarily because of equipment shortages which may affect units ability to train fully for combat and limit the ability of the united states to respond to other contingencies equipment shortfalls reflect backlogs at maintenance depots as well as possibly ongoing equipment upgrades designed to modularize or standardize and restructure army and marine corps units as of fy 2007 the army and marine corps are fully funded for their reset require ments and maintenance back logs may fall by up to one half according to recent dod reports together the two services have already received 486 billion for reset including 237 billion for fy2007 if troop levels fall in fy2008 the army has estimated that its reset requirements would drop from the 171 billion provided in fy2007 to 105 in the next year with further declines in later years dods fy2008 re set requirements will presum ably reflect assumptions about troop levels readiness problems for reserves refl ect primarily pers onnel shortages as individuals are transferred to fill holes in deploying units and as some reservists bump up against the 24month overall limit for mobilization in dod policy some have also raised concerns about wh ether the military can continue to meet recruitment and retention go als because some activeduty forces are also deploying with less than one year at home to rest and retrain it is not clear whether the administration will submit full year of war costs with detailed justifica tion as is required by the fy2007 national defense authorization act although th newlyconfirmed secretar of defense bob gates stated his willingness to do so the fy 2008 request for war costs will reflect the administrations assumptions about troop vels if troop levels decline so may operational and reset costs though the am ount would vary depending on the pace of withdrawals and whether combat troops rema in in the region or are redeployed to the united states the iraq study

country than iran3 that perception was initially fed by reported advances in irans nuclear program and by several comments by ir anian president mahmoud ahmadinejad elected in june 2005 that israel should be eliminated us concerns about iran were intensified following the military confrontation between iranianarmed and assisted lebanese hezbollah and israel in julyaugust 2006 and subsequent purported efforts by hezbollah to topple lebanons antisyrian governing coalition to date the bush administration has pursued several avenues to attempt to contain the potential threat posed by iran but the administrations focus on preventing an iranian nuclear weapons breakthrough has brought diplomatic strategy to the forefront of us policy as part of that effort the bush ad ministration announced may 31 2006 that it would negotiate with iran in multilateral framework consisting of the permanent members of the security council plus germany socalled p5 1 if iran first suspends uranium enrichment in past years the bush administration has had only limited dialogue with iran on specific regional issues multilateral talks with iran have remained stalled for over one year in september 2005 the internati onal atomic energy agencys board of governors resolved that iran was in noncompliance with its safeguards obligations under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt this followed infla mmatory remarks about israel by ahmadinejad at the general assembly that september as well as indications that iran appeared poised to abandon its uranium enrichment suspension brokered initially in late 2003 although many incl uding russia and china hoped to keep irans dossier in vienna at the iaea irans complete abandonment of its unilateral suspension as well as its decisi on to

council but russia and china have remained stumbling blocks to imposing significant sanctions despite what appeared to be agreement in the fall of 2006 for such an approach proposals and counterp roposals have been ma to little effect while iran continues to improve its uranium enrichment capabilities irans nuclear program is not the only major us concern on iran successive administrations have pointed to the threat to the united states and its allies posed by irans policy in the near east region partic ularly material support to groups that use violence to prevent israeliarab peace

rian assistance is assumed to consist of urgent food shelter and medical needs the very nature of humanitarian disasters the need to respond quickly in order to save lives and pr ovide relief often demands an unrestricted definition on both policy and operational level congress has consistently supported humanitarian efforts as means of responding to crises in the short term taki ng the lead and promoting us presence decision by the united states to respond in crisis results in varying amounts of relief and recovery assistance factors that may impact decision making include the type of humanitarian assistance required the impact of conflict and refugee flows on stability in the region in question and the role of neighboring countries and the broader international community in contributing to the relief effort the president can provide emergency humanitarian assi stance through several sources whose funding is authorized and ppropriated by congress in ddition to competing aid and budget priorities reimbursing us governme nt agencies for their expenditures either to replenish the emergency accounts or othe r accounts that have been used to provide assistance will remain

been granted access to conduct an official full assessment of the unfolding situation although number of foreign private ngos have been tacitly accepted timates of the number of refugees range from

situations at differing leve ls of recovery relief and r econstruction assistance operate on parallel tracks within close proximity to the military the evolution of the civil military relationship has received mixed re views from the aid community in part because of concerns about compromising neutrality and impartia lity and increasing the possibility of targeted attack in some cases violence has led to the suspension of activities or withdrawal of aid agenci from certain areas altogether many in congress hold that disaster assistance s hould be provided whenever possible with foreign

about the fate of iraq s minority sunni population whether as part of unified democratic government or in the event of continuing sectarian conflict common longer term concerns focus on the eventual

in iraq by kenneth katzmanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33760crs52 defense and security overview defense strategy and military force planning pat towell specialist in the us defense budget 72122 one way for congress to assess current u s defense strategy and force planning would be to review the congressionally mandated quadrennial defense review qdr published in february 2006 which wa s the first formal public reassessment of us military requirements since the ttacks of september 2001 and the subsequent us combat operations in afghanistan and iraq the review asserted that where and when us forces would be deployed in the future was uncerta in and unpredictable but that they could confront four types of threats in addition to what the qdr called traditional threats the type of largescale combat against mechanized forces in which us forces generally are held to be without peer the review identified three other types of threats that the defens department hereto fore has largely discounted unconventional threats relying on terrorism and guerrilla operations catastrophic attacks on operationally critical or highvalue targets using weapons of mass destruction and disruptive attacks that could nullify key elements of us power that may be vulnerable to attack by cyberwarfare biotechnology or other novel technologies after evaluating the documents analysis of the range of military threats currently confronting the country congress can judge how well the bush administrations plans for organizing and quipping us forces as reflected in its fiscal 2008 budget request address c ontemporary security challenges in the first decade after the end of the cold war from 1989 to1999 the end strength of the activeduty force dr opped steadily from 21 million to 14 million while force structure dropped by roughly the same magnitude with the number of activeduty army divisions dropping from 18 to 10 for example but that downsized force was largely scaleddown version of the force designed to fight the soviet union force which in 1991 had easily dominated iraqi forces organized and equipped along soviet lines the september 2001 version of the qdr which was substa ntially drafted before the attacks of september 11 alt hough published after th at date mandated that forces be prepared to defend the homeland to deter thr eats in four widely separated regions and swiftly defeat two major attacks on allies or c ountries of interest defeating one of t hose attackers decisively enough to change its regime while this socalled 1421 construct was not tightly coupled to wideranging changes in force structure the document appeared after the office of the secretary of defense had begun promoting the transfo rmation of us fo rces particularly those oriented toward ground combat into smaller more agile units that could be deployed more readily than existing formations the february 2006 qdr is seen by some as the most significant effort to reconceptualize the national security threat environment since the end of the cold war more than 15 years ago it revised some assumptions that had undergirded strategy and force planning for instance it stipulated that forces should place ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33760crs53 high priority on being able to stabilize country after conflic t as on being able to win the fight in the first place it also ndorsed some ongoing organizational changes such as the armys modularity plan and the navys fleet response plan intended to increase the agility and respons iveness of the force in addition the review called for some program initiatives keyed to threats other than traditional largescale combat including 15 increase in the number of special operations forces to better deal with guerrillas rrorists and other unconventional threats 15 billion fiveyear program to develop defenses against synthetically tailored bio weapons and an acceleration by nearly 20 ears to 2018 of the target date for fielding new longrange strike w eapon that could supplant aging bombers however this qdr raises some cha llenging questions about whether the administration is budgeting ad equately for the very diverse capabilities that would be needed to carry out its ambitious repertory of tasks the review stipulates that us forces should be able to remove countrys hostile regime and then set conditions for the restoration of civil society but it eschews any call for enlarging the force despite the indications that us forces particularly the activeduty and reserve components of the army are severely strained by the effort to pacify iraq moreover although it acknowledges that us forces clearly would dominate any adversary in conventi onal warfare the qdr also calls for continuing the acquisition of some very expensive weapons programs including the armys future combat systems the navys ddx and the triservice f35 joint strike fighter all of which are viewed by many analysts as chiefly relevant to conventional warfare given the severe budget constraints the fense department ma face congress may want to consider whether this investment portfolio should be altered both to meet overall budget limits and to meet the more novel threats that the qdr outlines crs report rs21754 military forces what is the appropriate size for the united states by edward bruner defense budget trends and issues for congress stephen daggett specialist in national defense 77642 defense spending and par ticularly spending for the wars in iraq and afghanistan will be one of the first major issues on the agenda in the opening weeks of the 110th congress and may be among the most difficult beginning the first week of february congress will be faced with three very large requests for funding for defense programs including 1 the regu lar fy2008 defens budget request expected to total490 billion or more 2 request fo r some or all of the projected additional costs of operations in iraq afghanistan nd elsewhere in fy2008 and 3 request for additional emergency supplemental appr opriations to cover costs of operations in iraq and afghanistan through the remainder of fy2007 congress approved down payment of 70 billion last fall but it appears that much more will be requested for the rest of the year two issues in particular may be matters of immediate controversy one issue is whether the administration will comply with the mccain amendment to the fy2007 national defense authorization act that requires thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33760crs54 president to submit an estimate of full yearlong fy2008 costs of operations in iraq and afghanistan when the regular fy 2008 budget request is submitted the amendment received very broa d support last year particul arly in the senate but senior bush administration officials have complained that accurate fullyear projections are not possible now how ever senator mccain and other senior members of the defense committees appear insistent on following the practice during earlier wars including korea and vietnam in which costs of ongoing military operations were considered through the regular defense authorization and appropriations process in the absen ce of full year funding estimates from the defense department congre ss may undertake to provide fullyear funding anyway the second issue is how congress will r eact to what reportedly will be very large request for additional emergency f unding in fy2007 and perhaps also in fy2008 not only to cover directly rela ted costs of operations in iraq and afghanistan but also to make up equipment and personnel shortfalls that the services believe are related to carrying on what the bush administration refers to as long war against global terrorism in the pa st emergency funding requests have been approved mainly to cover unplanned costs of overseas military operations the cost of equipping and training the force for l ongterm requirements in turn has been addressed in the regular fense budget now however army leaders say that the iraq war has revealed some very large longterm shortfalls including need for more force protection transport and comm unications equipment for more personnel for specific missions and for much fuller equipping of national guard and reserve units that are integrated into the rotation base the other services have also in turn highlighted their own shortfalls it would be hard to accommodate funding to address these additional requests within the regular defense budget however because the regular budget has to fit within overall congressional caps on total disc retionary spending so it now appears that the defense department will request very large am ounts tens of billions this year and more in years to come in th emergency accounts as means of avoiding constraints on regular spending to some budget analysts this appears to represent fundamental breakdown of budget discipline at the same time there has been very strong support in congress in recent years for adding funds to meet an apparent shortages of equipment for the military services particularly for the war in recent years congress has added large amounts for force protection equipment and last year congress pushed the army and marine corps to identify all the costs of repairing replacing and updating their equipment for iraq and afghanistan many members of congress have also complained about reported shortfalls of training equipment for troops preparing to deploy abroad and for units that are relie d upon as strategic reserve in case of crisis elsewhere some members of c ongress have supported adding substantially to the number of ground forces to ease strains on personnel all of these measures however may cost lot of money at time when congress is also concerned about reining in the budget deficit and meeting pent up demand in some other parts of the government the issue of tradeoffs between guns and butter and taxes may well

evolving operational role of the reserve components and has when seen as appropriate and equitable focused on equalizing military benefits between the active and reserve components one major remain ing issue is the reserve retirement age proposals to lower the age at which retired reservists begin drawing retired pay currently age 60 generated significant interest in both the 108th and 109th congress but were not enacted into law the 110th congress may face this issue again early in the first session as noted in the 2006 quadrennial defe nse review qdr during the cold war the reserve component was us ed appropriately as strategic reservehowever the reserve component must be operationaliz ed so that select reservists and units are more accessible and more readily deployable than today this transition from strategic to operationa l reserve has been vividly demonstrated since september 11 2001 as more than 400000 reserve component personnel have been called to active duty and

military care for the reserve components number of initiatives were c onsidered to enable reservists to obtain medical care prior to and subsequent to rving on active duty they have always had full benefit while on active duty complex threetiered benefit for reservists returning from active duty was enacted in 2005 as part of the fy2006 national defense authorization act but the 109th congress replaced it with significantly expanded medical benefit available to all drilling reservists and national guardsmen by the end of september 2007 all reserv component members in drilling status will have access to tricare if they agree to pay 28 percent of the costs of the benefit congress may choos to oversee the introduction of this new benefit as it will affect reservists throughout the country key concern for defense department po licymakers has been the growth in the costs of defense health care estimated to reach 64 billion by 2015 the increasing medical budget in large measure derives from changes enacted in 2000 to establish tricare for life which supplements medicare coverage and provides pharmaceutical benefit for retirees nd dependents 65 and over in 2006 dod officials

the contracting process congress has also questioned the laws governing contractor integrity in the face of allegations of questi onable contractor behavior large part of the problem is the l ack of an adequate dod accounting reporting system to manage the many contracts th at have been awarded especially under emergency and complex circumstances for example the armys problem in collecting and

and military departments increasing the size and skill levels of the defense acquisition workforce improving procedures and performance requirements in dods acquisition of services and pr eventing cost and schedule problems in dods acquisition of equipment however other issues were largely left out and might be examined more fully such as the impact of frequent senior program leadership turnover proper manageme nt of incentives for better industry performance and increasing the level of transparency of information integral to dod acquisition decisions further compli cating the defense acquisition landscape is the number of reports dod is preparing in response to statutory initiatives and the outcomes of variety of pilot programs dod is executing to seek additional ways to improve its acquisiti on policies and programs the magnitude breadth and volume of recent analysis findings and recommendations on defense acquisition re form appear to have one thing in common none suggests major systemic re organization similar to that which created the current defense acquisition system the landmark goldwa ternichols defense reorganization act of 1986 while defense acquisition

difference between the goods and services the country exports and imports annually is to surpass the record 717 billion deficit recorded in 2005 the cumulative amount of successive deficits is raising concerns about the longterm impact on the economy as result of financing the current account deficit through inflows of foreign capital given current macro economic conditions however these capital inflows are bridging the gap between dom estic supplies of nd demand for capital including the federal govern ments budget deficit foreign investors are now major invest ors in us corporate stocks and bonds and hold more than 50 of the publiclyt raded us treasury securities at some point foreign investors may become uncom fortable with the large share of ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33760crs72 assets in their holdings and reduce their pur chases of us assets such reduction would place added strains on the us ec onomy and likely increase pressures on the 110th congress to address difficult budget and spending issues international capital flows now far surpa ss flows of goods and services in the global economy and are the driving force be hind the international exchange value of the dollar demand for us assets such as financial securities translates into demand for the dollar since us securities are denominated in dollars as demand for the dollar rises or falls according to overall demand for dollardenominated assets the value of the dollar changes over the past three years the average exchange value of the dollar has fallen by more than 10 percent against the euro and other currencies that float freely sustained change in capital inflows would affect the value of the dollar which in turn would have direct imp act on the us current account balance by altering the level and compos ition of us exports and impor ts of goods and services although foreign trade is still relativel small part of the overall us economy changes in the trade accounts alters the composition of jobs in the economy and can affect the overall level of economic activity as result actions or events that cause sustained change in capital inflows would also affect the value of the dollar the changing value of the dollar would then have direct impact on the us current account balance by altering the level of us exports and imports of goods and services in turn such change could affect broad range of sectors in the us economy such events could increase pre ssure on congress to pursue policies which promote us exports and to confront more aggressively those c ountries that attempt to deflect economic adjustments by s upporting their currencies through official purchases of us securities thereby s upporting the exchange rate of the dollar relative to their own currencies crs report

specialist in int ernational trade and finance 77751 the united states stands distinct in the world as the leading source of direct foreign investment and as the leading destin ation for such inves tment generally the public and congress view such investme nt favorably although some groups are concerned about foreign inve stment in critical industrie s and sectors they believe could impair the economic security of th country and about job losses associated with us investment abroad these cerns sparked nationa l debate about the merits of such investment and the course of us economic policies and led some members to introduce more than two dozen measures to address such concerns during the 109th congress many of these i ssues remain unresolved and may resurface in the 110th congress on the whole most us communities welcome foreign direct investment for the taxes nd potential employment that it can bring but these gains are being weighed against national security concerns and the potential forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33760crs73 job losses as us companies seek out foreign locations and foreign workers to perform work that traditionally has been done in the united states other observers are concerned by the large inflows of capital that foreign investors are bringing into the us econom foreign investors now hold more than 50 of the publicly traded us treasury securities this large and growing foreign accumulation of us securities has spurred some observers to argue that the large foreign presence in us financial markets increases the risk of financial crisis adds uncertainty to the value of the dollar and is affecting the us trade balance at the same time the capital inflows are accommoda ting the current mix of us economic policies and are keeping us interest rates below the level they otherwise might reach without the capital inflows while the risk of financial crisis associated directly with the capital inflows seems slight congress likely would find itself embroiled in any such financial crisis through its direct role in conducting fiscal policy and in its indirect role in th conduct of monetary policy through its supervisory responsibility ove r the federal reserve some observers are also concerned by the seemingly unlimited access foreign investors have to invest in or to acquire us firms esp ecially firms that are involved in economic activities that some view as cr itical to us economic security placing restrictions on foreign investment however is potentially at odds with provisions of us law and with us efforts within the wto and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to prom ote international sta ndards that relax national rules concerning foreign investment including granting foreign firms national treatment in an earlier response to similar c oncerns congress passed the exonflorio provision which gives the pres ident the authority to block foreign investments that are deemed to threaten us national security efforts begun in the 109th congress to amend this pro cess may continue in the 110th congress with some members moving to strengthen cong ressional
