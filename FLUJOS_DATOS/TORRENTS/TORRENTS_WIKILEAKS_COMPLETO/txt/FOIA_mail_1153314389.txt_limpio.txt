on this and thanks for helping us get it right i agree we need assurance from chap 2 david can you make sure weve got it that the deleted issues are indeed covered in chap 2 in particular i am not sure that chap 2 covers the solanki et issue thanks again peck hi what we agreed was actually to keep line 25 to line 34 on p 635 and not just until line 30 as well line 50 p36 line 27 the sentence on line 3233 that there is general agreement in the evolution of the different proxies is important as there is in general much confusion about this and this is chapter 6 statement covering the whole millennium the sentence also links nicely to the next sentence on line 50 yes as agreed in bergen delete the other parts if chapter 2 indeed is going to cover it i have not done so in my revision as i wanted to hear what chap 2 is doing before deleting peck in total we will delete 22 line note that i have also squezzed out few line in the sulfur section making progress regards fortunat david rind wrote jonathan keith and i discussed this at the meeting basically what we need to keep is p 625 lines 2530 first sentence on line 50 and p 626 the first paragraph lines 27 all the rest is discussed in one form or another in chapter 2 pp 5556 concerning the volcanic forcing there isnt nearly as much overlap and chapter 6 did not have very much anyway i think it would be useful to keep whats there adding just reference to chapter 2 add see also chapter 2 at the end of line 26 im assuming that fig 613a still includes the solar and volcanic forcing david at 1140 am 0600 71806 jonathan overpeck wrote hi david its good to know you can get to work before someone even if they live in europe your plan sounds good and is it safe to assume that you will be making sure chap 2 gets the right material from chap 6 and that we can thus pare our discussion of past solar and volcanic forcing down to minimum can you give us an update of what they will not cover that we should ie looking at section 66 many thanks peck hi all its sad state of affairs if im the one who gets to work sooner regardless of the time difference what is discussed below is basically what we thought in response to gavins comment that we would basically crossreference chap 2 where the primary discussion would occur its consistent with chapter 2s general discussion of how forcings have changed over time and would seem odd if chapter 2 left out past solar and volcanic forcing chapter 2 should feel free to utilize anything that existed in chapter 6 on these issues to complement their discussion if the need arises once that is finalized chapter 6 can then make the proper crossreferences david at 1026 am 0600 71806 jonathan overpeck wrote hi ricardo good points we did discuss this in bergen and david rind as chap 2 ca was going to help make sure we kept things covered in chap 2 while cutting our solar and volcanic discussions in chap 6 the key will be crossreferencing chap 2 carefully so keith ricardo and david please interact to figure out how to work this efficiently perhaps david could comment first since hes at work sooner thanks best peck hi all in comment 6811 gavin schmidt points out that our sections 6631 solar forcing 6632 volcanic forcing largely replicate the discussion in chap 2 on the same topics i checked chap 2 and they provide large almost 8 pages in the sod discussion mainly on solar and but also on volcanic forcings gavin suggests that only the implementation issues should be discussed in our chapter and leave the most general information in chapter 2 we can substantially short our section following his advice please find below the outline of the sections in chap 2 dealing with solar and volcanic forcings cheers ricardo 27 natural forcings 271 solar variability 2711 direct observations of solar irradiance 27111 satellite measurements of total solar irradiance 27112 observed decadal trends and variability 27113 measurements of solar spectral irradiance 2712 estimating past solar radiative forcing 27121 reconstructions of past variations in solar irradiance 27122 implications for solar radiative forcing 2713 indirect effects of solar variability 272 explosive volcanic activity 2721 radiative effects of volcanic aerosols 2722 thermal dynamic and chemistry perturbations forced by volcanic aerosols original message from tim osborn

17 2006 1225 pm subject re special instructionstiming adjustment hi all im halfway through these changes and will get the revised figures out to you probably tomorrow except maybe the sh one because im not sure if the van ommen pers comm data shown by jones mann and suggested by riccardo are the data to use or not is it published properly ive seen the last 700 years of the law dome 18o record published so perhaps we should show just the period since 1300 ad that period appears in mayewski pa maasch ka white jwc et 700 year record of southern hemisphere extratropical climate variability annals of glaciology 39 127132 2004 and goodwin id van ommen td curran maj et mid latitude winter climate variability in the south indian and southwest pacific regions since 1300 ad climate dynamics 22 8 783794 jul 2004 see below for some more comments in respect to individual figures at 2136 30062006 jonathan overpeck wrote figure 610 1 shade the connection between the top and middle panels yes 2 remove the dotted long instrumental curve from the middle panel yes 3 replace the red shaded region in the bottom panel with the greyscale one used in fig 613 yes 4 label only every increment of 10 in the greyscale bar formally color in the bottom panel yes 5 increase font sizes for axis numbering and axis labeling all are too small you can figure out the best size by reducing figs to likely page size minus margins we guess the captions need to be bigger by couple increments at least yes figure 611 1 this one is in pretty good shape except that ricardo has to determine if s african boreholes need to be removed i think henry said they were published and could stay figure 612 1 again please delete s african borehole if ricardo indicates its still not published i think henry said they could stay 2 consider adding law dome temperature record ricardo is investigating but perhaps keithtim can help figure out if its valid to include feel free to check with valerie on this too as she seems to know these data at least little already discussed above 3 also please increase font sizes and make sure they match 610 probably better to use bold fonts you are right that ive mixed bold and nonbold when reduced to small size the nonbold actually read more clearly than the bold i think so ill standardise on nonbold its not possible to completely standardise on the size because each figure i provide might be scaled by different amounts i dont know final figure size so will make good guess should be ok figure 613 1 we are going to split the existing 613 into two figure the first is 100 tims fig and is just an upgrade of the existing 613 ad with the only changes being 1a delete the old echog red dashed line curve in panel d and keith says this was discussed and rejected so i should keep old echog in 1b please also increase font sizes and make sure they match 610 and 12 please use bold fonts ok as discussed above 2 the existing 613e is going to become new 614 with the addition of new forcings panel on top of the existing panel which becomes 614b to make this happen tim and fortunat have to coordinate as tim has the forcing data and knows what we what and tim has the existing figure we suspect it will be easier for fortunat to give tim data and layout advice and for tim to make figure that matches the other figs hes doing please note that this fig cant be as large as the existing 613ad but needs to be more compact to permit its inclusion done cheers tim dr timothy j osborn academic fellow climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university
