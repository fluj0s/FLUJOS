as lenders nd borrowers work to resolve indebtedness issues some transactions are resulting in cancellation of debt mortgage debt cancellation can occur when lenders restructure loans reduc ing principal balan ces or sell properties either in advance or as result of foreclosure proceedings historically if lender forgives or cancels such debt tax law has treated it as cancellation of debt cod income subject to tax exceptions have been available for taxpayers who are insolvent or in bankruptcy among others these taxpayers may exclude canceled mortgage debt income under existing law the mortgage forgiveness debt relie f act of 2007 pl 110142 signed into law on december 20 2007 temporarily exclude s qualified cod income thus the act allows taxpayers who do not qualify for the existing exceptions to exclude cod income the provision is effective for bt discharged before january 1 2010 the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 extends the exclusion of cod income to debt disc harged before january 1 2013 rationale for excluding canceled mo rtgage debt income has focused on minimizing hardship for households in di stress policymaker s have expressed concern that households experiencing hardship and that are in danger of losing their home presumably as result of financia l distress should not incur an additional hardship by being taxed on canceled debt income some analysts have also drawn connection between minimizing hardship for individuals and consumer spe nding reductions in consumer spending if significant can lead to recession additionally legisl ators have been pursuing federal housing authority fha and governmentsponsored terprise gse reform efforts in part to alleviate the current mortgage crisis the most recent changes were enacted by the housing and economic recove ry act of 2008 pl 110289 as efforts to minimize the rate of foreclosure are being made lenders are in some cases renegotiating loans with borrowers to keep them in the home for some policymakers the exclusion of canceled mortgage debt income may be necessary step to ensure that homeowner retenti on efforts are not thwarted by tax policy opponents of an exclusion for canceled mo rtgage debt income might argue that the provision would make debt forgivene ss more attractive for homeowners and could encourage homeowners to be less res ponsible about fulfillin g debt

the property in lieu of foreclosure proceedings the benef it of either option is that the homeowner does not suffer the adverse credit impacts and possibl stigma of foreclosure and the lender can

september 26 2007analysis of the tax exclusion for canceled mortgage debt income mortgage debt cancellation occurs when lenders engage in lossmitigation solutions that either 1 restructure the loan and reduce the principal balance or 2 sell the property either in advance or as result of foreclosure proceedings1 under current law the canceled debt sometimes referred to as discharge of indebtedness may be income subject to taxation recently enacted law allows canceled mortgage debt income to be excluded from taxation the rationales for this chan ge are to minimize hardship for households in distress and to ensure that nontaxre lated homeowner retention efforts are not thwarted by tax policy critics argue that the exclusion could encourage homeowners to be less responsible about fulfilling debt obligations2 critics may also argue that owneroccupied housing is sufficiently subsidized even without cod income exclusion this report begins with an overview and analysis of the historical tax treatment of canceled debt income next the changes enacted by pl 110142 and pl 110 343 are discussed discussion of policy options concludes overview for federal income tax purposes

canceled debt is ordinarily included in the taxpayers gross income3 this income is typically referred to as cancellation of debt cod income the borrower will realize ordinary income to the extent the canceled debt exceeds the value of any cash or property given to the lender in exchange for cancelling the debt lenders report canceled debt to the internal revenue service irs using form 1099c and borrowers must generally include the amount in gross income in the year of discharge exceptions historically there have been several exceptions to the general rule that canceled debt is included in the gross income of the borrower section 108 of the internal revenue c ode irc contains two excep tions that are particularly relevant in the case of canceled home mortgage debt borrower may exclude canceled debt from gross income if 1 the debt is discharged in title 11 bankruptcy or 2 the borrower is insolvent that is has liabilities that exceed the fair market value of his or her assets determined immediately prior to discharge4 in the case of the bankruptcy exception the debt must be discharged by the court overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings or pursuant to plan approved by that court5 involvement by court is necessary for taxpayer to claim an insolvency exception the taxpayer calculates his or her assets and liabilities to determine whether he or she is insolvent for an insolvent taxpayer the amount of cod income that may be excluded is limited to the amount by which the taxpayer is insolvent6 for both the bankruptcy and insolvency exceptions taxpayer who excludes canceled debt must essentially give back some of the benefit of the exclusion specifically the taxpayer must reduce certain beneficial tax attributes including basis in property that would otherwise decrease the taxpayers income or tax liability in future years7 the attributes are reduced until the reductions generally account for the excluded amount as result of the attribute reduction the taxpayer may be subject to tax on the excluded cod income in years following the year of discharge in other words the tax on the cod income is deferred in addition to the irc 108 exclusions there are

previously if taxpayers are insolvent or bankrupt they are fully or partially exempt from taxation on the canceled debt selected proposals ma prior to the 109th congress provision enacted in the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 405 allows farmers who are solvent to treat certain cod income as if the farmer were insolvent essentially discharge d qualified farm debt is excl uded from taxation if canceled by qualified person this debt re lief is not exclusively mortga ge related but has to have been incurred directly from the operation of farming business in the past congress has provided tax re lief when mortgage debt is forgiven in august 1993 the omnibus budget reconciliation act pl 10366 13150 enacted provision for permanent tax relief to owners of commercial real estate when some portion of the debt on commercia l and investment property was forgiven at that time the conference committee stated the following the committee understands that real property has declined in value in some areas of the nation in some cases to such degree that the property can longer support the debt with which it is encumbered the committee believes that where an individual has discharge of indebtedness that results from decline in value of business real property securing that i ndebtedness it is appropriate to provide for deferral rather than current inclus ion of the resulting income generally that deferral should not extend beyond the period that the taxpayer owns the property19 in 1999 and 2000 the h ouse and senate respectively each passed tax bill hr 3081 in the 106th congress that provided tax relief for mortgage cancellation but neither bill was enacted during that time period several regional markets had experienced severe housing slumps and fallin g property values in subsequent years that legislation was reintroduced hr 666 in the 108th congress hr 3458 in the 109th congress analysis in order to evaluate the policy of incl uding discharged debt as income it is helpful to understand how it works acco rding to economic theory one way of defining income is as the change over th period in question in persons net worth that is the change in the value of the persons assets minus the change in their liabilities by this definition forgiven an is income canceled debt reduces taxpayers liabilities and thus increases net worth in the past tax law has generally adhered to this concept by providing that if the obligation to repay the lender is forgiven the amount of loan proceeds that is forgiven is reportable income subject to tax20 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34212crs6 this portion of the report provides analysis of the issues associated with the tax treatment of canceled mortgage debt income homeownership retention or loss in some instances lenders may restructur or rearrange debt cancel some debt and allow the homeowner to retain owners hip of the home then all other things being equal the borrowers net worth has increased as liabilities have declined and assets have remain ed unchanged alternatively homeowners may experience debt cancellation while losing their home throug h foreclosure or as result of voluntarily deeding the property back to the lender the homeowner longer has the asset and to the extent the asset value exceeded liabilities may be worse off as result of declining net worth additionally he or she may realize gains or losses which may make the taxpayer better or worse off as well if the taxpayer is not able to exclude the cod income then the tax consequences of the cod income assumin g equal amounts of canceled debt are the same regardless of whether the home is retained or lost an illustration is shown in table 1 assuming residen tial debt of 200000 loan restructuring could occur afte r which the homeowner owes 180000 and the lender has agreed to cancel the remain ing amount the discharged debt 20000 is income subject to tax if exclusion applies eg the taxpayer is not insolvent if rate of 28 is assume d the tax liability is 5600 lternatively the home could have been sold as result of foreclosur with sales price of 180000 along with lender agreement to cancel the remainin g debt the 20000 discharge is income and assuming exclusion applies and the same tax rate gene rates the same tax liability this is in addition to any taxes the taxpayer may owe on the gain from the sale of the house table 1 tax treatment of canceled debt income assuming exclusions apply qualified residential debt 200000 loan is renegotiated or property disposed of 180000remaining balance of debt which is forgiven 20000 tax liability assume 28 rate on canceled debt of 200005600 source crs on the other hand if the taxpayer is able to exclude the cod income as is temporarily allowed in certain circum stances then the 20000 discharge is not included in gross income and the taxp ayer does not owe the 5600 tax liability as previously mentioned current law stipul ates that the excluded cod income be accounted for through reducing the basis in the residence the impact of such basis adjustment could differ depending on whether the home is retained or lost in the event that the taxpayer owes taxes when the house is disposed taxpayer who retains the house and sells it in later year whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34212crs7 21 the time value of money asserts that the present value of certain amount of money is greater than the future value of that same amount thus the cost of tax payment of 5600 today is more than the same amount paid in the future 22 cod income may cause taxpayer to move to higher tax bracketaccounting for the excluded cod income through basis adjustment is able to defer taxes owed on the disposition until the year of sale in contrast the tax consequences would depend on the timing of the basis adjustment for taxpayer that loses home if basis was required to be reduced in the year following discharge as unde r irc 1017 then the excluded cod income could not be accounted for because the taxp ayer had already disposed of the home if basis was required to be reduced earlier eg at the time of discharge then the excluded cod income would be accounted for through basis adjustment and the taxpayer would be worse off than similarly situated taxpayer who had retained the house and was able to defer ta xes until the year of sale21 equity among homeowners an exclusion of income can result in individuals with identical incomes paying different amounts of tax standard of fairness frequently invoke d by public finance analysts in evaluating tax policy is horizontal equity standard that is met when persons with identical incomes pay the same amount of tax like other exclusions an exclusion for debt forgiveness violat the standard of horizontal equity specifically person who has forgiven bt might pay more taxes than person who has the same amount of income pa rt of which constitutes canceled debt an exclusion of income can also reduce the tax systems progressivity in other words likely favor upperincome indi viduals this is likely to occur because an exclusion of given amount is more valu able to persons with higher marginal tax rates this effect is ma gnified if homeownership is more concentrated among upper income individuals at this point an example may be useful for illustrating the effect income tax exclusions can potentially have on the ta x systems progressivity consider two individual homeowners both of whom incur 20000 in cod income the tax benefit to the two differs if they are in different tax brackets22 the value of the exclusion for homeowner with lower income who may be in the 15 income tax bracket is 3000 while the value to another homeowner with higher income in the 28 bracket is 5600 thus the higher inco taxpayer with presumably greater ability to pay taxes receives greater tax benefit than the lower income taxpayer past enactments over the past quarter century congress has enacted tax relief for canceled debt in several instances including assistin g hurricane katrina victims in 2005 and commercial property owners and farmer s during economic downturns in 1986 and 1993 the 2005 legislation was temporary wh ile the others were permanent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34212crs8 23 us congress house committee on the budget omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 hrept 103111 may 25 1993 24 us senate committee on the budget tax expenditures compendium of background material on indivi dual provisions s prt 109072 109th cong 2nd sess p 220it could be argued that the market conditions that led to the 1986 and 1993 congressional enactments also exist today specifically property values may be declining such that the property longer supports the debt with which it is encumbered currently the policy issue is posed by residential housing in 1986 the problem was the business property of farm ers and in 1993 the issue was business real property in providing the 1993 exclusion congress acknowledged it was essentially allowing the taxpayer to defer the income subject to tax because an adjustment to basis was required23 the 1986 exclusion of cod income for fa rmers may provide the most relevant reference for analysis of the current issues at the enactment of the exclusion congress was concerned that pending gislation providing federal guarantees for lenders participating in farmloan writedowns would cause some farmers to recognize large amounts of income when farm loans were canceled as result these farmers might be forced to sell their farmland to pay the taxes on the canceled debt this tax provision wa s adopted to mitigate that problem24 consistent with the 1986 enactment one rationale expresse d in 2008 during the consideration of the current proposed exclus ion of canceled residential debt income was the prevention of unintended adverse consequences resulting from foreclosure prevention efforts specifically as lenders are being encouraged to writedown or work out loans with distressed borrowers these efforts could be diminished by the income taxation of canceled debt data lenders report canceled debt income on irs form 1099c the data reported include all types of debt not ju st residential as shown in table 2 the number of forms 1099c filed rose by 112 from 2003 through 2007 the amount of canceled debt also increased from 2003 to 2004 alt hough data for subsequent years are not available while specific conclusions about mortgage debt cancellation cannot be drawn from these data to the extent that debt cancellation represents financial distress the data suggest that the number of financially dist ressed taxpayers might be increasing alternatively the rise in debt cancellations may be associated with increases in the number of debt transac tions in this case the number of debt cancellations as portion of debt may be proporti onally the same httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34212crs9 25 hr 3506 and hr 1876s 1394 also propose permanent

extended by pl 110343 are temporary and set to expire on january 1 2013 congress may c hoose to let the changes expire thus returning the treatment of canceled mortgage debt income to its original status canceled debt income w ould then be subject to taxation unless the taxpayer meets qualified exception eg the taxpayer is insolvent if the exclusion on canceled debt inco is allowed to expire improving awareness about the existing exclusions that apply when there is canceled debt such as for insolvency or bankruptcy may be an option to pursue also it may be important to ensure that taxpayers know wh at to do if lenders misreport information on the form 1099c which coul d make it appear that the taxpayer has canceled debt income that has not actually occurred congress may choose to extend the ex clusion of canceled debt income additionally modifications to the exclus ion could be made there are number of choices with respect to possible modifica tions which modifications if any are enacted will depend on the goal of policy makers what kind of exclusion one consideration for congress is wh ether an exclusion provision should be temporary or permanent early versions of hr 3648 the bill that later became pl 110142 proposed permanent exclusion whereas the administration had suggested the provision should be temporary25 some argue that current housing market conditions where there are large number of homeowners that are upside down the debt owed on the property exceeds the value of the property warrant temporary solution for crisis that is not expected to last

residenceconsistent with policy of minimizing adverse consequence associated with loan renegotiations in the shortterm it could also be argued that the tem porary exclusion of residential cod income is preferable because owneroccupied hous ing is already heavily subsidized even without cod exclusion three principal tax provisions for owneroccupied housing currently exist in the tax code the deduction for mortgage interest is the most costly provision with an estimate of 799 b illion in revenue loss for fy 200826 the exclusion of gain on the sales of homes is the second largest tax provision for homeowners with an estimate of 29 billion in tax revenue loss for fy200827 the deduction of state and local real estate ta xes is the third provision with an estimate of 143 billion in tax revenue loss for fy200828 some economists feel that this preferential tax treatment courages households to ove rinvest in housing and less in business investments that might contribute more to increasing the nations productivity and output29 on the other hand some analysts mig ht argue that the provision should be permanent case could be made that temporary provision is unfair because there is difference between an individual ex periencing canceled debt income in 2008 when foreclosure rates may be high rela tive to three or four years from now when foreclosure rates may be lower if the policy purpose is to minimize hardship when taxpayers experience distress then ma king the provision permanent would seem consistent with that purpose what types of canceled debt several options are possible in determini ng what type of canceled mortgage debt income may be excluded from taxation the broadest modification would allow all canceled residential debt to be excluded from income currently only debt associated with the primary or principal residence of taxpayer may be excluded rather than for instance vacation hom or investment property30 some policy analysts have suggested disallowing second liens as qualified residential debt sec ond liens are not directly inelig ible for the exclusion although currently qualified debt is restricted to include debt incurred in acquiring constructing or substan tially improving the taxpayers principal residence httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34212crs11 31 hr 3506 pr oposes limit of 100000 for the household income of eligible taxpayers 200000 for married taxpayers filing jointlyfor some individuals second liens may be home equity lines of credit for others second liens may be bt incurred as part of the purchase of the home to the extent that home equity lines of credit are used to enhance the home and make capital improvements it may be consistent with stated policy goals to include this debt as eligible for the exclusion yet home equity lin of credit can also be used to finance consumption such as vacations or paying off other debt it may not be consistent with policy goals some might argue to in clude this type of debt in the exclusion congress may also wish to consider changing the limit on the amount of canceled debt that can be excluded from income pl 110142 imposed limit of 2 million 1 million if married filing separate returns increasing the limit would likely increase revenue loss associated w ith the exclusion while decreasing the limit would have the opposite effect decreasing the exclusion limit might also reduce the benefit to upper income taxpayers which homeowners should be eligible policy makers could limit the ability of homeowners to exclude canceled debt income according to certain eligibility requirements ownership tenure the exclusion for canceled debt income could be limited to homeowners who meet ceratin ownershi p andor use tests for example homeowner must meet both an ownership and use test in order to claim the exclusion for gain on owneroccupied housing that is available under irc 121 the ownership test requires the taxpayer to ve owned the house for two of the last five years while the use test requires the owner to have lived in the house for at least two years out of the last five years limiting the exclusion of capital gains in this manner was designed to minimize the possibility that investors rather than owneroccupants would be able to exclude capital gains from taxation alternatively it could be argued that tenure is not relevant to the stated policy goals of mortgage debt cancellation if an ownership andor use test were applied to an exclusion of cod income the number of tax filers eligible to claim the exclusion might be reduced this reduction in filers may result in lower revenue loss this policy option would also add complexity to the reporting and filing processes and thus the tax code household income some policy makers have suggested that foreclosure assistance be provided only to househol ds with low and moderate incomes31 as with other housing tax incentives such as th mortgage revenue bond program and the firsttime homebuyer tax credit for district of columbia residents income levels could be capped and the exclusion made unavailable to those households with income above the ceiling set by the legisla tion it would seem that income would be highly correlated with foreclosure in that those with lower income are experiencing hardship regardless of whether this is bor ne out by the data it could be argued that household income is not relevant to the stated policy goals for the legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34212crs12 this option could reduce the revenue loss associated with the provision but would add complexity to the administrati on and tax filing process relative to an exclusion without such restriction should basis be adjusted as discussed above current law requi res that taxpayers who exclude cod income must essentially give back some of benefit by reducing tax attributes such as basis in property several policy issues arise from this rule the first is which tax attributes if any should be adjusted to account for excluded canceled mortgage debt income one option is that there be ttribute reduction require ment alternatively homeowners could be required to reduce specifi ed tax attributes that include but are not limited to basis in the residence eg taxpayers would be able to reduce basis in property other than the home subject to th discharged mortgage third option would be to require basis re duction in the taxpayers residence all taxpayers would benefit from the first option by not having to account for the excluded cod income whether taxpayer would prefer the s econd option over the th ird one would depend on his or her circumstances eg whether th taxpayer has basis in other property that would have to be reduced in the event of insufficient basis in the residence the temporary exclusion of cod income enact ed by pl 110142 uses the third option homeowners are required to reduce basis in the principal residence to account for the excluded cod income another issue is when tax attributes shoul d be adjusted if basis is adjusted one option could be to make the proposal consistent with cu rrent law under which basis adjustment occurs in the year following di scharge of the debt alternatively basis adjustment could occur earlier eg at the time of discharge or exclusion if basis adjustment occurred in the year after discharge homeowners losing their home at the time of debt cancellation would have already disposed of the property the requirement that basis adjus tment in the amount of cancelled debt suggests desire by policymakers for homeo wners to have to account for the benefit of the cancelled debt basis adjustment results in the taxation of cancelled debt income to the extent that gain from the disposition of the home is taxable however the timing of the basis adjustment may result in different tax consequences for taxpayers who lose their home the exclusion of cod income may result in differential treatment of taxpayers depending on basis adjustment timing eligibility for exclusion of gain from the disposition of the residence and homeown ership retention policymakers may wish to account for that differen tial treatment although doing so may add complexity and administrative cost to the proposal relative to its current state
