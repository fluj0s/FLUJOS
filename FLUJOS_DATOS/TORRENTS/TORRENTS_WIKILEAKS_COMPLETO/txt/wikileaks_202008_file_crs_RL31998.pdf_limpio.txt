copyright infringement metrogoldwynmayer studios inc v grokster ltd background when the supreme court held th at distributors of peertopeer p2p file sharing could be secondarily liable for copyright infringement it marked milestone in long line of cases addressing p2p technology filesharing software programs that create p2p network connections between computers enable the transmission of data and communications over the internet variety of p2p programs such as those offered by groks ter ltd streamcast networks inc and kazaa bv are typically available for fr ee download from the distributors websites after installing p2p program called client application onto the computer the user runs the application to connect to the computers of other users of that particular p2p software who are currently online the client application allows users to share files located on their computer harddrives once users make files available for sharing with each other anyone who uses the same companys software to connect to the respective p2p network ma locate and download desired files easily and at cost for example user of the grokster software can directly access files saved on another grokster users computer rddrive or user can search for particular file name such as an mp3 song title acro ss all users computers connected to the grokster network and then download copy of that file onto his or her computer the motion picture and music recording industries brought veral legal actions alleging copyright infringement against companies that distribute filesharing software prior to the lower courts decisions in grokster nearly all of the cases found in their favor including m records inc v napster inc1 and in re aimster copyright litigation 2 however in metrogoldwynmayer studios inc mgm v grokster ltd3 the ninth circuit court of appeals held that the defendant software distributors were not li able for copyright infringement grokster was the first p2p filesharing case involving allegations of music piracy where court shielded p2p software companies from liab ility in decisive 90 opinion the us supreme court reversed the ninth circuit importing new theory of inducement as

napster and aimster in the napster and aimster cases the courts of appeals found that the plain tiff record companies would likely prevail on their contributory and vicarious infringement claims and granted preliminary injunctions against the defendant companies5 the distinction in the lower courts analyses in grokster was based in large part on the technological differences in the design of the filesharing networks in question and to some extent judicial uncertainty over the reach of the standards articulated by the us supreme court in sony corp of america v universal city studios inc discussed below6 p2p network architecture unlike napster and aimster grokster and morpheus software users conn ect to filesharing networ ks with central database server instead grokster provides for dy namic root supernodes which are group of randomly chosen computers which are connected to the p2p network at particular time the grokster software selfselects its s upernode status for the day

actively assisted their endusers in locating specific files and facilitating the download transac tions grokster did not aimster provided an illustrated tutorial on its website which methodically demonstrated how to transfer and copy copyrighted works over the aimster system13 the court of appeals in aimster referred to this tutorial as an invitation to infringement overtly encouraging aimster users to infringe copyrights14 aimster also offered its users 495 monthly subscription service called c lub aimster which presented list of the top forty most frequently downloade d songs by aimster users this list included play button next to each song that allowed users to click on it to download the music file from wherever it was located in the aimster network to the requesting members computer15 napster similarly provided substantial assistance to its users through its server maintained as collective directory of shared mp3 files available on each connected users computer any napster user could r search on this centralized index for desired song title in order to transfer copy of the file from the host user the individual sharing the file to th requesting users harddrive16 therefore when the napster network wa s terminated its demise prevented any further p2p filesharing among its users but because grokster and streamcast operate decentralized netw orks if either company closed their doors and deactivated all computers within their cont rol users of their products could continue sharing files with little or interruption17 according to the district court in grokster this is seminal distinction between groksterstreamcast and napster which formed the basis for its judgment that the defendant s did not materially contribute to infringing activity18 substantial noninfringing use in sony corp of america v universal city studios inc the us supreme court found that despite the fact that video cassette recorders vcrs could be used by consum ers to infringe copyrights the manufacturer was not liable for contributory copyrigh t infringement because the vcr was also capable of substantial noninfringing uses19 the court identified private noncommercial times hifting of broadcast television as noninfringing fair use ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31998crs4 20timeshifting refers to the practice of record ing broadcast television program to view it at later time and then erasing it afterwards see sony 464 us at 423 21ibid at 444 22ibid at 442 23 259 fsupp2d at 1031 24this summary judgment only applies to software offered by defendants

at 1046the technology20 it emphasized that the primary use of the vcr was fair and in addition it had the potential to be used for timeshifting sports ducational religious and other programming that was authorized for copying or was copied wit hout objection from the copyright holder21 as result of sony substantial noninfringin g uses became judicially recognized defense to claims of contributory infringement the defense arises from the courts statement that the sale of copying equipment like the sale of other articles of commerce does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate unobjectionable purposes it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses22 mgm studios inc v grokster ltd in us district court plaintiffs twentyeight organizations in the motion pi cture and music recording industries sued several p2p companies for c ontributory and vicarious copy right infringement the plaintiffs and defendant companies grokste r and streamcast ne tworks filed cross motions for summary judgment because the only question before the court as to liability is legal one whet her defendants materially undisputed conduct gives rise to copyright liability23 the court granted summary judgment determining that defendant companies grokster and streamcast were not seconda rily liable for copyright infringement committed by users of their p2p software called grokster and morpheus respectively24 finding evidence that the defe ndants had any mate rial involvement in their users infringing conduct the court held that grokster nd streamcast were not liable for contributory infringement25 summary judgment was also warranted on the vicarious infringement claim the court reasoned because there was evidence showing that the p2p companies had the ri ght or ability to supervise the conduct of endusers of their products26 grokster in the ninth circuit court of appeals at the outset the court noted that the question of di rect infringement although undisputed was not before it rather the issue was one of secondary ie contributory andor vicarious copyright infringement liability and it fully concurred in the district courts well reasoned analysis that defendants were not liable under either theoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31998crs5 27grokster 380 f3d at 1160 28ibid citations omitted 29ibid at 1164contributory infringement the three elements required to prove contributory copyright infringement are 1 direct infringement by primary infringer 2 knowledge of the infringement and 3 mate rial contribution to it the court of appeals generally tracked the reasoning of the lower court and concluded that the architecture of the p2p systems preclude d the defendants from having requisite knowledge of and making material c ontribution to copyright infringement the court invoked the staple article of commerce doctrine from patent law cited by the supreme court in sony for the proposition that it would be sufficient to defeat claim of contributory copyright infringemen t if the defendant showed that the product was capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses27 with respect to the knowledgeelement as in terpreted by the ninth circuit in its napster decision this means if defendant could show that its product was capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses then constructive knowledge of the infringement could not be imputed rather if substantial noninfringing use was shown the copyright owner would be requi red to show that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files28 because the court found it undiputed that p2p software is capable of substantial noninfringing uses it would not impute constructive knowledge of infringement by others to the defendants they must have reasonable knowledge of specific infringement to satisfy the knowledge requi rement and the copyright owners needed to establish that the software distributor s had specific knowledge of the infringement at time in which they contributed to it and failed to act upon their knowledge this knowledge standard was not met by the plaintiffs afterthefact notices of infringement by the time they arrived the software distributors could not prevent it in the courts view the software distri butors did not indeed could not materially contribute to infringing activity as conse quence of the p2p program structure the distributors do not provide site and facility for the infringement the infringing material does not reside on the defendants computers nor do they have the ability to suspend user accounts vicarious infringement in order to establish vicarious infringement copyright owner must demonstrate 1 direct infringement by primary party 2 direct financial benefit to the defendant and 3 the right and ability to supervise the infringers29 concurring with the district cour t the court of appeals found it to be undisputed that there was both direct in fringement and the fendants benefitted financially from the software via advertising revenue but the right and ability to supervise infringers was missing the cour t reiterated the lower courts finding that the communication between the defendants nd their users does not provide point of access for filtering or searching for infringin g files since infringing material and index information do not pass throug h the defendants computershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31998crs6 30ibid at 1166 31ibid at 1167 32metrogoldmayer studios inc v grokster ltd 125 sct 2764 2780 3335 usc 271the court of appeals considered and rejected the argument that right to supervise could be interpreted to mean that the distributors had responsibility to alter the software to prevent users from sharing copyrighted files only where one has already been determined to be liable for vicarious infringement does duty to exercise police powers arise it also rejected wh at it characterized as blind eye theory of liability for vicarious infringement copyright owners argued that turning blind eye to detectable acts of infringement for the sa ke of profit should gi ve rise to liability30 but the court found that there is separate blind eye theo ry or element of vicarious liability that exists independently of the traditional elements of liability in closing the court of appeals echoed the district court in declining to interpret copyright liability law to achieve public policy goals that might protect copyright owners economic interests but alter general copyrigh t law in profound ways with unknown ultimate consequences that function is prerog ative best left to the congress31 the united states supreme court decision in grokster in decisive 90 opinion written by justice souter the c ourt reversed the ninth circuit court of appeals at the outset the court noted that the subject of the case is the tension between the competing values of supporting creativity through copyright protection and promoting technological innovation by limiting infringement liability32 to resolve the conflicting interests it articulated new standard for the imposition of secondary liability for copyright infringement although the general principle of indu cement as basis for secondary liability has its roots in the common law it had not heretofore been statutorily or judicially applied in copyright context hence the court mirrored its previous adoption of patent laws staple article of commerce doctrine in sony as model for copyright infringement safeharbor rule by adopting an inducement rule also codified in patent law33 as basis for imposing secondary liability for infringement for the same reasons that sony took the st aplearticle doctrine of patent law as model for its copyright safeharbor rule the inducement rule too is sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster in fringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties we are of course mindful of the need to keep from trenching on regular commerce or discouraging the development of technologies with lawful and unlawfu l potential accordingly just as sony did not find intentional inducement despite the knowledge of the vcr manufacturer that its device could be used to infringe mere knowledge of infringing potential or of actual infringing uses would not be enough he re to subject distributor to liability nor would ordinary acts incident to product distribution such as offering customers technical support or product updates support liab ility in themselves thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31998crs7 34ibid at 2780 citations omitted emphasis added 35ibid at 2772 36ibid at 2777inducement rule instead premises liability on purposeful culpable expression and conduct and thus does nothing to compro mise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having lawful promise34 the courts analysis of the doctrinal re lationship between the two is discussed below the court reviewed the evidence adduced in the trial court record supporting groksters successful motion for summary judgment although grokster challenged petitioner mgms assertion that nearly 90 of the files available for download were copyrighted works the court nonetheless c oncluded that the evidence gave reason to think that the vast majority of users downl oads were acts of infringement and that the probable scope of copyright infringement is staggering35 indeed the p2p services conceded infringement in most downloads and actual knowledge of such from time to time from their users email questions but there the court parted dramatically from the court of appeals conclusion that actual knowledge was legally insufficient to support finding of liability since it did not rrive in time or ma nner that allowed the p2p service to stop the infringing activity the ninth circuit had misapplied sony which it read as limiting secondary liability quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied the court explained sony bars secondary liability based on presuming or imputing intent to cause infringement solely from the design or dist ribution of product cap able of substantial lawful use which the distributor knows is in fact used for infringem ent but the ninth circuit read sonys limitation to mean that whenever product is capable of substantial lawful use the producer can never be he ld contributorily liable for third parties infringing use the rule of sony however is not that broad inducement of copyright infringement may be demonstrated when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown by evidence independent of sign and distribution of the product at trial on the merits in sony evidence showed that the principal use of the vcr was for time shifting which the court found to be fair use there was evidence that sony had expressed an object of bringi ng about taping in violation of copyright or had taken active steps to increas its profits from unlawful taping36 once sold the distributor had control over the device in other words the fact that the vcr promoted copying much like photocopy m achine did not suffice to impute to the distributor an intent that th device be used for copyright infringement the majority of television content is in fact copyrighted content but because the primary use of the device was for permissible copying meant that the fact that sony knew that it could or would be used for unauthorized copying as well was not sufficient to establish secondary liability for infringement solely from the sale of the product the sony doctrine absolves the equivocal conduct of selling an item with s ubstantial lawful as well as unlawful uses and limits liability to instances of more acute fault than the merehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31998crs8 37ibid at 2778 38ibid at 2781 39ibid at fn 12understanding that some of one s products will be misused it leaves breathing room for innovation and vigorous commerce37 conversely in grokster the evidence of culpable intent to induce infringement by the p2p filesharing services was great the record indicated that grokster used advertising classic means of indu cement to s timula others to commit copyright infringement the court reviewed at length the efforts of streamcast and grokster to market to napster users wh that service was under attack for facilitating massive infringement it cited internal communications at streamcast discussing ways to market to napster user s that demonstrated unequivocal indications of unlawful purpose38 whether the internal communications were communicated outside of the company was immaterial b ecause they functioned under an inducement theory to prove by defendants ow n statements that his unlawful purpose disqualifies him from claiming protection the court re viewed three features of inculpatory evidence each company showed itself to be designed to satisfy known source of demand for copyright infringement the ma rket for former napster users this evidenced principal intent to bring about infringement neither company attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software and both companies used business model premised on increased advertising revenues commensurate with increased use of their software hence their profits depended upon high volume use of their software to infringe the court was careful to note that neither factor alone would necessarily prove inducement for example in footnote it noted that there is absolute duty of manufacturer to provide filtering tools of course in the absence of other eviden ce of intent court would be unable to find contributory infringement liability merely based on failure to take affirmative steps to prevent infringement if the device otherwise was capable of substantial noninfringing uses such holding would tread too close to the sony safe harbor39 it made comparable observation with respect to the business model evidence in reversing the ninth circuit and re manding for action consistent with its opinion the court reiterated the continuing sound precedent of sony in sum this case is significantly different from sony and reliance on that case to rule in favor of streamcast and grokster was error sony dealt with claim of liability based solely on distributing produc t with alternative lawful and unlawfulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31998crs9 40ibid at 2782 41ibid at 2783 42ibid at 2784 footnote omitteduses with knowledge that some users would follow the unlawful course the case struck balance between the interests of protection and innova tion by holding that the products capability of substantial lawful employment should bar the imputation of fault and consequent sec ondary liability for th unlawful acts of others mgms evidence in this case most obviously addresses different basis of liability for distributing product open to alternative uses here evidence of the distributors words and deeds going bey ond distribution as such shows purpose to cause and profit from thirdparty acts of copyright infringement if liability for inducing infringement is ultimately found it will not be on the basis of presuming or imputing fault but from inferring patently illegal objective from statements and actions showing what that objective was40 concurring opinions both justice ginsburg and justice breyer wrote separate concurring opinion each joined by two other justices their opinions might be characterized as colloquy ove r the met hodology contem plated by sony to determine whether product is capable of substantial or comme rcially significant noninfringing uses both subscribed to the inducement theory of secondary liability adopted by the court but they differed in their views of how sony should be applied to determine whether the product the so ftware in this case was capable of substantial noninfringing use since it appears highly unlikely that grokster and streamcast will avoid secondary liability under the newly articulated inducement theory the theories advanced in concurring opinions respecting sonys applicability to them may ultimately be dicta justice ginsburgs opinion with whic h chief justice rehnquist and justice kennedy concurred focused on and took issue with the evidence of substantial noninfringing use utilized by the lower courts to support and uphold the grant of summary judgment justice ginsburg noted that in sony the court came to conclusion about the vcr s respective use enlightened by full trial record41 to do so it considered whether significant number of potential uses of the vcr were noninfringing finding that the recorders we re used primarily for timeshifting or for permissive copying t here was need in sony to give precise content to the question of how much actual or potential use is commercially significant further development was left fo r later days and cases42 in grokster however the lower courts found it undisputed that there were substantial noninfringing uses for the soft ware justice ginsburgs review of the record however indicated that there had been finding of any fair use and only anecdotal evidence of noninfri nging uses all of which wa s almost exclusively based on evidence introduced by the defendants she noted that in sony the plaintiffs owned less than 10 percent of the copy righted television programing and that testimony indicated that owne rs of at least another 10 pe rcent of programing expressly consented to its home recording but in grokster evidence suggested that between 75httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31998crs10 43ibid at 2786 emphasis added 44ibid at 2787 45ibid at 2788and 90 of the files traded were owned or controlled by the plaintiffs that left approximately 10 of files exchanged as presumptivel noninfringing there was evidence about the softwares use for c opying authorized by copyright holders anecdotal evidence about public domain mate rial or promotional music that was available for file sharing by permission wa s not in her view sufficient to support motion for summary judgment and in addr essing the issue of use she focused narrowly distinguishing between the softwa re at issue and p2p technology in general even if the absolute number of noninfring ing files copied using the grokster and streamcast software is large it does not follow that the products are therefore put to substantial noninfringing uses and are thus immune from liability the number of noninfringing copies may be reflective of and dwarfed by the huge total volume of files shared further the district court and the court of appeals did not sharply distinguish between uses of groksters and streamcasts software products which this case is about and us of peertopeer technology generally which this case is not about43 she concluded that if on remand summary judgment wa s not granted in favor of mgm based on finding of inducement then fuller record of the softwares use would be necessary to determine whether the sony product distributi ons safe harbor would or could be met justice breyer in an opinion concurred in by justices steven and oconnor agreed with the majority that the distribut or of dualuse technology may be liable for infringing activities of third pa rties where they actively seek to advance or induce the infringement he took issue however w ith justice ginsburgs conclusion that the lower court record was insufficient to s upport motion for summary judgment finding that the defendants software had substantial noninfringing uses he preferred not to revisit sony and rejected what he characterized as justice ginsburgs stricter interpretation of the case44 he read the evidence in sony as establishing that of all the taping actually done by sonys customers only around 9 was of the sort the court referred to as authorized45 hence by analogy he contends that the showing in grokster that as little as 10 percent of files sh ared were noninfringing was adequate to support motion for summary judgment on the issue of monstrating that the companys product is capable of substantial noninfringing use importantly sony also used the word capable asking whether the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses its language and analysis suggest that figure like 10 if fixed for all time ght well prove insufficient but that such figure serves as an adequate foundati on where there is reasonable prospect of expanded legitimate uses over time and its language also indicates thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31998crs11 46ibid at 2789 47ibid at 2791 citations omitted 48ibid at 2779appropriateness of looking to potential futu re uses of the product to determine its capability46 the opinion goes on to suggest the existence of significant future market for noninfringing uses of grokstertype p2p software he acknowledged other now unforseen noninfringing uses that may deve lop for p2p software just as the home video rental industry develope d for the vcr to the end of protecting the legal climate for developing technologies justice breyer argues against any perceived modification of sony that could have the effect of chilling new technology development as i have said sony itself sought to strike balance between copyright holders legitimate demand for effective not merely symbolic protection of the statutory monopoly and the rights of ot hers freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce thus to determine whether modification or strict interpretation of sony is needed i w ould ask whether mgm has shown that sony incorrectly balanced copyright and newtec hnology interests in particular 1 has sony as i interpret it worked to protect new technology 2 if so would modification or strict interpretation signifi cantly weaken that protection 3 if so would new or necessary copyrightrelated benefits outweigh any such weakening47 justice breyer concludes that sony as he interprets the case has provided entrepreneurs with needed assurance that they will be shielded from copyright liability as they bring valuable new technologies to market he fears that modified rule one which requires defendant to produce concrete evidence of use to avoid liability or relies on casebycase balancin g approach would undercut sony s protection it would increase the legal uncertainty that surrounds the creation of new technology capable of being put to infringing use and assert chilling effect on technology development in general the majority opinion however does not specifically modify sony it leaves further consideration of sony for day when that may be required48 instead it imports into copyright law new theory of secondary liability independent of sonys substantial noninfringing use that is th inducement of copyright infringement as shown by clear expression or other affirma tive steps taken to foster infringement by third parties such cause of action is tailored to the claims of the plaintiffs in mgm v grokster thus despite conflic ting interpretations of sony expressed in the opinions of justices ginsburg and breyer grokster can only signal views regarding any future revisions of the sony doctrine implications of grokster during the 108th congress some members of congress reacted to the court of appeals grokster decision by introduction of s 2560 the inducing infringement of copyrights act of 2004 108th cong 2d sess 2004 this bill would have codified cr iteria to establish secondary liability for copyright infringement in view of the courts express adoption of an inducementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31998crs12 49justice breyers concurring opinion states quite specifically that sony s rule shelters vcrs typewriters tape recorders photocopiers computers cassette players compact disc burners digital video recorders mp3 players internet search engines and peertopeer software but sonys rule does not shelter descramblers even if one could theoretically use descrambler in noninfringing way ibid at 2791 2792 emphasis in originalstandard as basis for secondary liability for copyright infringement the need and legislative momentum for such legislation are doubtful the majority opinion clearly affirm s the technologyprotective standard established by sony distributors of dualuse technology capable of both infringing and noninfringing uses continue to have high level of protection from secondary copyright infringement liability this is pa rticularly so for durable goods such as digital music recording devices that work in conjunction with authorized music sources even if they may be used with an unauthorized source as well49 never overtly discu ssed but implicit in grokster is an emergent legal treatment of divergent functional attr ibutes of durable consumer goods versus software nowhere in the three opinions do any justices express the view that software is to be treated differently from other fungible goods for liability purposes arguably however the inducement theory has of necessity been adopted to address business models using more flexible software platform design ed to promote willful blindness to the infringing activities of its users so fo r example compression technologies as such may not be thwarted but services designed to promote unauthorized digital transfer of motion pictures over the internet will most certainly be affected by grokster supporters of the ninth ci rcuits interpretation of sony may bemoan the loss of what many believe was bright line test to determine whether distributor is guilty of secondary liability for copyright infringement inducement is intent specific hence manufacturers advertising
