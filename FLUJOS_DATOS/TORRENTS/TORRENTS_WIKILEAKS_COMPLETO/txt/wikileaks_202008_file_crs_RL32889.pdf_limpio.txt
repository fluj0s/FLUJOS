current regime distorts investment decisions and undermines efficient competition by providing artificial advantagesdisadvant ages to those service providers that happen to be subject to favorableunfav orable intercarrier compensation rules fails to provide innovators certainty bout the intercarrier compensation regime to which their services will be subject encourages uneconomic arbitrage that is providers making business decisions based on the artificial rates set for intercarrier compensation rather than on true underlying costs creates an artificial cost structure based on minutes of use which appears to be inconsistent with actual cost causa tion in networks and which renders it difficult for carriers to meet the prefer ences of many consumers for offerings consisting of large baskets of minutes or unlimited calling at fixed price requires carriers to expend millions of dollars and scarce information technology resources developing systems to identify measure monitor bill reconcile audit and dispute the classification of traffic and undermines the stability of universal service subsidy funds at the same time in some quarters there is resistance to comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform because of concerns that some carriers and some consumers may be harmed by the changes reform is likely to result in an incr ease in enduser subscriber line charges which consumer groups argue would unf airly burden low usage and low income customers reform is likely to reduce the interca rrier compensation revenues of rural local exchange carriers and increase their need for universal service funding at time when rural wireless carriers also are seeking access to potentially limited amount of total universal service funds reform is likely to require modification of intrastate intercarrier compensation rates but since these have been with in the jurisdiction of state regulatory commissions some observers have questioned whether the federal

telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 110 stat 56 1996 actintercarrier compensation one component of telecom reform overview over the past 30 years telecommunications policy in the united states slowly has evolved from government sa nctioned monopoly provision of all telecommunications services to competitive provision of most telecommunications services congress explicitly mandated this competitive market approach in the telecommunications act of 19961 these competing providers have had to interconnect their networks and today most telephone calls and electronic communications travel over more than one carriers network to get from the calling party to the called party since the calling party only pays the carrier to which it subscribes for service system of inte rcarrier compensation has been needed to compensate any other carrier whose network facilities are used to complete the call the telecommunications sector today is ch aracterized by the deployment of new digital technologies that are driving the c onvergence of previously distinct markets these new technologies are being deployed in and carried over wireline wireless and cable networks that are becoming increasingly capable of providing voice data and video services over sing broadband platform with these new technologies costs are longer driven by distance and traffic longer stays within national boundaries less state or local bounda ries there is consensus that the current framework of telecommunications st atutes and regulatory rules based on outdated classifications that do not conform to marketplace realities longer fosters such fundamental public po licy objectives as competition universal service and rapid innovation perhaps the most significant such set of legacy rules involves intercarrier compensation which affects telecomm unications competition innovation and efficiency as well as the universal availability of telecommunications services nondiscriminatory interc onnection is prerequisite for competitive telecommunications markets and nondiscriminat ory intercarrier compensation is the linchpin of competitively neutral regulatory regime the current system of intercarrier compensation was implemented on piecemeal basis as specific existing telecommunications services were opened to competitive provision or providers offering entirely new services such as

thus the long distance carriers lose money on each long distance call into or out of those rural exchanges as result long distance carriers are reluctant to make available to customers in those areas

calls than they make so an isps lec will terminate far more calls from the isps subscribers than it originates from the isp 3 for many of t hose terminated calls the isps lec can charge the carriers serving the isps end user cust omers abovecost access charges and 4 the isps lec can choose single point of interc onnection with the carriers serving the isps end user customers in way that requires t hose carriers to bear most of the costs of transporting the traffic to the isp the specif ics of this are discussed in the section below on where should networks be allowed or re quired to interconnect with one anothercaller uses wireless telephone the callers wireless carrier is subject to cost based reciprocal compensation charge for the termination of that call but if the caller made an identical call from the same location to the same called party using wireline telephone and hence wireline long distance carrie r that carrier would be subject to an above cost access charge for the termination of the call as another example when long distance call is made to called party s wireline telephone that partys wireline local exchange carrier can charge the calling partys long distance carrier an above cost access charge for terminating the call but if an identical long distance call were made to the same called party from and to the same physical location but to the called partys wireless telephone the called partys wireless carrier is not allowed to charge the calling part ys long distance carrier any access charge for terminating the call the current regime fails to provide innovators certainty about the intercarrier compensation regime to which their services will be subject for example since voice ove r internet protocol voip service is on one hand an applicati on of an information service and on the other hand functionally equivalent to trad itional voice telephone call it arguably fits into two different classifications for the purposes of intercarrier compen sation information services are not subject to access charges long distance telephone calls are the business plans of voip providers will be strongly affected by the ultimate decision about how they are classified for intercarrier compensation purposes the current regime encour ages uneconomic arbitrage that is providers making business decisions based on the artificial rates set for intercarrier compensation rath er than on true underlying costs for example because of the traffic patterns of isps and some anomalies in the rules11 some clecs have pursued the market strategy of targeting isps as cu stomers they have offered isps service at what may have been belowcost rates because they could more than recoup any losses by ch arging abovecost rates to the carriers of the isps subscribers for terminating the large volume ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs6 12 in its 2001 isp report and order the fcc found that under the current carriertocarrier recovery mechanism it is conceivable that carrier could serve an isp free of charge and recover all of its costs from originating carriers the ilecs were somewhat constrained in their ability to compete with the clecs for these isp customers because in certain situations they are not allowed to negotiate individual contracts with customers but rather are limited to offering services through tariffs that are generally available to all customers 13 more detailed discussion of switching costs in presented below in the section entitled what is the underlying cost structure of the transport and switching functions 14 the long distance carriers assert that the bell operating companies which are now allowed to offer long distance service and typically do so as part of package of local and long distance service do not face the same pr oblem the long distan ce carriers claim that even if the bell companies long distance arms must pay the same usagebased access charges to their local operating companies as the long distance carriers pay the underlying costs to the bells are not usagesensitive th at is any losses that the bells long distance arms might suffer when serving high usage customer by having to pay minuteofuse access charges while offering large baskets of minutes or unlimited calling at fixed price are matched by the additional profits that th bells local operating companies generate from those minuteofuse access charges since th eir underlying costs are not increasing with usagesubscriber calls to those isps12 regulators also may seek to exploit uneconomic arbitrage for example state regulators as well as rural lecs may have the incentive to limit the scope of rural local calling areas since calls that are classified as long distance will generate more revenues through toll charges or access charges than they would if classified as local and also will tend to move the burden of cost recovery from local rural customers to urban long distance customers since long distance rates are averaged and thus urban customers who can be served at low cost face higher averaged rates that contribute to the recovery of higher rural costs the current regime creates an artificial cost structure based on minutes of use which appears to be inconsistent with actual cost causation in networks and which renders it difficult for carriers to meet the preferences of many c onsumers for offerings consisting of large baskets of minutes or unlimited calling at fixed price for example under the current access charge regime interexchange carriers are charged on perminuteofuse basis for the switching used to originate and terminate their customers calls making the interexchange carriers underlying cost structure usagesensitive even though the preponderance of those switching costs appear not to be usagesensitive13 but by facing these artificially imposed usagebased costs long distance carriers are discouraged from offering large baskets of minutes or unlimited calling at fixed price since they would lose money when serving high usage customers who are the customers most likely to select such packages14 the current regime requires carriers to expend millions of dollars and scarce information technology resources developing systems to identify measure monitor bill reconcile audit and dispute thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs7 15 the intercarrier compensation rules are different for intramta wireless calls that originate and terminate within an mta and intermta wireless calls that originate and terminate in different mtas 16 see for example jessica zufolo emerging voip policy is driving investment telecom policy report september 29 2004classification of traffic as local or toll intrastate or interstate intramta or intermta15 information service or telecommunications service etc in order to determine which intercarrier compensation rules apply it also encourages wasteful litigation as carriers fight among them selves about that classification of traffic these costly nonpr oductive activities will continue to grow as providers respond to consumer demand for bundled offerings of services that fit into different classifications the current regime undermines th stability of uni versal service subsidy funds where ilecs rely at least in part on the profits from above cost access charges to defray the cost of providing universal service this funding source is in jeopardy because the number of minutes subject to access charges is declining as carriers with more favorable intercarrier compensation treatment for example wireless and voip carriers are gaining market share and traditional long distance carriers have an incentive to manipulate the complex packages of services that they offer to minimize their exposure to access charges at the same time in some quarters there is resistance to comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform because of concerns that some carriers and some consumers may be harmed by the changes in this view if the access charges currently imposed by local exchange carriers on interexchange carriers to originate and terminate long distance calls were reformed to more accurate ly reflect the low proportion of switching costs that appear to be usagesensitive and the high proportion that appear to be fixed perminute access charges imposed on the long distance carrier s would fall but the fixed costs of switching would likely be recove red by raising the subscriber line charge imposed on end users for connecting to the network consumer groups have consistently opposed line charges of any sort arguing that such charges unfairly burden low usage and low income customers16 the access charges that long distance carriers must pay to small rural local exchange carriers for originating or terminating the long distance calls of the rural carriers customers tend to be higher than the access charges paid to urban carriers this is in part because the small rural carriers underlying cost s are higher than those of urban carriers due to the lack of popula tion density and lack of scale economies and in part due to efforts by regulators to keep rural endhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs8 17 the icc fnprm at paragraph 107 stat according to ntca the national telecommunications cooperative association rural lecs receive on average 10 percent of their revenue from interstate access charge s and 16 percent from intrastate access charges in comparison it asserts that the bocs b ell operating companies receive only four percent of their revenue from interstate access charges and six percent from intrastate access charges 18 the 1996 act states at 254e any such support should be explicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of this sectionusers local rates low also the rural carriers local calling areas tend to be narrowly defined and to serve only small number of households many of their cust omers incoming and outgoing calls therefore are classified as toll long distance calls for which the rural lecs receive abovecost minuteofuse access charges from long distance carriers rather than the fixed enduser charge typical of local service as result the small rural lecs historically have generated much larger portion of their total revenues from access charges than have urban lecs17 since the access charges of rural lecs exceed costs by more than those of urban lecs and since rural lecs have depended on access charges more than urban lecs reforming access charges to bring them down to cost would place greater revenue burden on rural cs than on urban lecs absent another revenue source enduser line charges would have to be raised more in rural areas than in urban areas to keep line charges from growing to the point where local service becomes unaffordable or noncomparable with urban rate s new universal service funding mechanism would be needed to replace the implicit universal service funding currently in the rural carri ers access charges although all the proposals for intercarrier co mpensation reform have included new universal service funding m echanisms the rural lecs prefer not to have to rely so heavily on an explicit universal service funding mechanism they generally prefer to have three revenue sources line charges universal service funds and abovecost access charges rather than just the first two in part this is because they prefer to recover larger portion of their costs from long distance carriers whose averaged rates subsidize rural customers than from their own enduser customers in subscriber line charges and in part it is because they are concerned about relying too heavily on universal service funds which they consid er potentially unstable source of revenue especially now that rural wireless carriers are seeking these same universal service funds although section 254e of the 1996 act requires universal service support to be explicit and sufficient18 many state regulators continue to set intrastate access charges and especially the intrastate access charges of rural carriers at bovecost rates that exceed interstate access charges in order to creat revenue source ultimately borne primarily by customers of long distance carriers that do not live in rural areas that will help keep local rates low some parties question whether the fcc has the authority to modify intrastatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs9 19 more than 90 of wireless telephone calls travel over wireline facilities during some portion of their route even most calls th at originate and terminate on wireless networks travel over wireline facilities at some point in their routeaccess charges as part of comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform without the formal involvement of the states given the many affected interests with conflicting views and the impact of intercarrier compensation on so many public policy objectives congress could consider oversight or legislation to provide the fcc with guidance as that proceeding evolves the purpose of this report is to provide primer on intercarrier compensation historical background in network industry such as telecommunications customers benefit the more people or companies or websites or databa ses they can reach over the network to which they subscribe thus if there is more than one networ k consumer benefit is maximized when those networks are interconnected for most of the 20th century telephone service was provide d by government sanctioned monopoly when public policy changed and competitive provision of service was permitted the incumbent providers were required to allow the new entrants to interconnect with their networks in nondiscriminatory fashion to complete calls made to the incumbents customers otherwise the incumbents could have used their dominant position to refuse to interconnect with the smaller networks of the new entrants or to impose onerous interconnection terms and cond itions on the entrants and the latter would have been impeded in their ability to attract and serve customers today most electronic communications require the use of more than one carriers network to be completed for example local wireline telephone calls origin ate on the network of the calling partys local exchange carrier and terminate on the network of the called partys local exchange carrier which may be competing local exchange carrier or an adj acent local exchange carrier rather than the callers local exchange carrier or the called partys cellular carrier long distance calls originate on the network of the calling partys local exchange carrier pass to the network of the calling partys long distance carrier and then terminate on the network of the called partys local exchange carrier wireless telephone calls originate on the network of the calling partys wireless carrier are tran sported over wirelines typically leased by the wireless carrier from wireline carrier19 and then terminate on the network of the called partys local exchange carrier or wireless carrierhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs10 20 when the isp receives the communica tion from subscriber it routes that communication over its owned or leased distri bution facilities internet transport networks or over larger isps transport network to network access point where the communication is routed to another internet network and may travel over various internet backbone networks and regional or midlevel networks which are connected by network access points and local area networks to reach the appropriate destination host 21 mci brought several suits against att and also challenged in the courts several fcc decisions see for example mci telecommunications corporation v federal communication commission 561 f 2d 365 ddcir 1977 22 modification of final judgment united states v american telephone and telegraph company 552 f supp 131 ddc 1982enduser connections dialup or broadband to info rmation service providers originate on the network of the subscribers calling partys local exchange carrier or broadband provider wireline wireless or cable may be transported over an intermediate carriers transit network and rminate on the network of the carrier serving the isp the called party20 while sometimes the calling party and called party have the same local or wireless carrier or sometimes the calling party purchases its local and long distance service from the same carrier in most cases completion of call requires the use of more than one carriers network the calling party only pays the local long distance or wireless carrier to which it subscribes it makes payments to the called partys carrier and today only in the case of wireless service does the called party pay anything to its carrier for calls received as result system is needed to compensate the other carriers whose networks are used to complete the call prior to mcis successful legal challenge to the old bell systems government sanctioned lephone monopoly21 and the consent decree settlement of the federal governments antitrust suit that resulted in the divestiture of att into separate and independent local and long distance companies22 there was very limited need for intercarrier compensation since there we re very few carriers only monopoly bell local operating companies monopoly inde pendent telephone co mpanies and att the monopoly bell long distance company that served both bell and nonbell customers local service rates were kept low to foster the goal of universal service by setting long distance rates far above cost sometimes when an independent telephone company bordered bell compan service area extended area local service eas was offered in which local calling area extended beyond the boundary of the independent telephone company into the bell service area eas service was intended to lower rates to subscribers by allowing calls that otherwise would have been high priced long distance calls to be treated as local calls when the bell operating companies terminated eas calls originating on the independent telephone companies networ ks and vice versa the companies did not charge one another for such termination even if the traffic between the two carriers was not in balance rather intercarrier compen sation followed system known as billandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs11 23 the 1996 act states at 254e any such support should be explicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of this section 24 see for example access charge reform price cap performance review for local exchange carriers cc docket 96262 and 941 sixth report and order low volume long distance users cc docket 99249 report and order federalstate joint board on universal service cc docket 9645 eleventh report and order 15 fcc rcd 12962 1299193 paras 7679 2000keep in which payments were made from one carrier to the other as if traffic were in balance with respect to co mpensation from the long distance division of att to the independent telephone compan ies for originating and terminating long distance calls these charges were set based on complex system of cost separations and settlements that resulted in the att long distance carrier paying intercarrier compensation rates that far exceeded cost in order to subsidize local service in the internal accounts of the bell system too payments were made from the long distance division to the various local bell operating companies that resulted in the att long distance carrier paying origination and termination rates that far exceeded cost as competitive provision of telecommunications services has been allowed in piecemeal fashion over the past 30 years st ate and federal regulators have regulated the newly necessary intercarrier compensation rates also on piecemeal basis allowing or requiring very high or very low rates in order to foster specific public policy objectives rather than requiring intercarrier compensation rates to be set consistently for all calls as shown in figure 1 the resulting rates for performing the same termination functions transport and switching vary significantly simply because particular call is interstate vs intrastate or because service provider has been treated as an end user rather than carrier or because call terminates on wireless network rather than wireline network for example in order to maintain low rates for basic local service to help meet the goal of universal service state regulatory commissions and the fcc have allowed local exchange carriers to charge long distance carriers significantly above cost access charges for originating and terminating intrastate and interstate long distance calls although the 1996 act requires the creation of explicit universal service funding mechanisms23 and the fcc has established transition process that has lowered interstate access charges closer to cost24 some implicit universal service subsidies remain in certainintercarrier compensation charges especially in rural lecs intrastate access charges that as shown in figure 1 average more than five cents per minute in order to promote enhanced services the fcc has treated enhanced service providers including isps as end users rather than carriers this allows isps to purchase lines out of the local carriers tariffs for business customers which do not include usagebased charges rather than out of the tariffs fo r interexchange carriers which have usagebased charges for both orig inating and terminating callshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs12 25 47 cfr 51701 26 1996 act 251b5 252d1a and 252d2asince isp customers often stay online for long periods of time if isps had to pay minuteofuse access rates it would have made it prohibitively expensive to offer flat rated retail service the fcc adopted rules25 to implement statutory language in the 1996 act requiring reciprocal comp ensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications between competing local exchange carriers at rates approximating the additional costs of performing those functions26 these rules covered the local calls of local exchange carriers and the intramta calls of cmrs wireless carriers since wireless service in the past was seen as niche service whose customers made lot of calls but received very few and not as substitute for long distance wireline service wireless providers are required to pay wireline local exchange carriers access charges for the termination of intermta calls originating on their networks and terminating on wireline networks but are not allowed to charge other carriers access charges for the termination of intermta calls received by their subscribers these and other inconsistencies in in tercarrier compensation requirements are incompatible with competitive telecommunications markets comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform key issues the current intercarrier compensation rules developed in piecemeal basis as alternative providers some using new t echnologies were gr anted permission to compete with existing providers and interconnect with the incumbents networks in each case explicit or implicit decisions were made about among other things where and how the interconnections could occur what the terms conditions and rates were for the interconn ection and who should bear the transport and switching costs associated with terminating and in the case of long distance service originating the traffic decision to modify one of these parameters is likely to affect the others for exam ple changing the requireme nts about where carriers may or must interconnect for the exchange of traffic may affect the portion of the cost burden that each carrier should bear andor the most efficient pricing mechanism for intercarrier compensation in the debate over alternativ intercarrier compensation reform proposals number of important and contentious issues are likely to be raised should the called party share the cost burden with the calling partyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs13 27 however as explained in the historical background section prior to the breakup of the bell system extended area local service traffi c flowing between the bell local companies and independent telephone companies was exchanged on billandkeep basis in which the carriers were not compensated for completing calls for one another some bell operating companies and independent lecs still employ billandkeep the carriers recovered the costs of terminating these local calls from th eir own customers that is the called party shared the cost 28 icc fnprm at p 10 17 29 see footnotes 5 and 6 abovewhy this matters most telephone calls and electronic co mmunications benefit both the calling party and the called party so there could be justification for the calling party and the called party sharing in the cost of the call but in the united states traditionally only the calling party and the carrier to which that party subscribes has paid27 the fcc refers to this as the callingpartynetworkpays approach to intercarrier compensation28 this approach has been justified on several grounds called parties should not have to pay for unwanted and unsolicited calls such as those from commercial or noncommercial telemarketers and spammers customers should be able to c ontrol their monthly local telephone bill which is more difficult to achieve if they must pay for incoming calls that unlike outgoing calls are beyond their control the administrative costs may be higher if the carrier of the calling party and the carrier of the called party each have to bill an enduser customer rather than just the carrier of the calling party billing its enduser customer and in turn th carrier of the called party billing the carrier of the calling party but the primary reason why policy makers have preferred callingpartynetwork pays regime is that it allows them to set intercarrier compensation rules that foster such public policy objectives as universal services and the protection of nascent services such as internet services for example under system of callin gpartynetworkpays the costs of terminating call are borne by the calling partys carrier and as will be discussed below it is possible to set terminating rates that exceed those costs in particular above cost terminati on rates can be imposed on long distance carriers and the extra revenues from those above cost termination rates can be used to keep end users local rates low the long distance carriers in turn will impose most of the burden of those above cost termination rate s on low cost urban customers since long distance carriers are required to set nationally averaged retail long distance rates29 the low cost urban customers will be subsidizing the higher cost rural customers these abovecost rates for termina ting calls however create mark et distortions that may give some providers artificial competitive advantages over other providers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs14 in contrast if the costs of terminating calls are borne by the called party that is the end user pays its local carrier for the terminating costs associated with received calls there is potential intercarrier source of subsidies the called partys local service rate would recover those terminating costs either through an additional line item on the bill or an increase in an existing line item if the resulting line items are determined by regulatory body to be ffordable or noncompar able to urban rates and thus set at price below costs the called partys lec might receive explicit universal service funding or implicit subsidie s from above cost busin ess rates or rates averaged across high cost and low cost customers but would longer be able to receive subsidies from other carriers analysis and discussion in normal market if provider sets pr ice well above cost th at creates market incentive for its customers to seek an lternate provider and for other providers to enter the market but under callingparty networkpays there are built in market forces constraining the price carrier could charge another carrier for terminating calls consider the simple example shown in figure 2 of end user who subscribes to lec for local service making local call to end user b who subscribes to lec z for local service completion of the ca ll requires use of both ys network and zs network but only gets paid by the calling party the call goes over the line from end user as residence to the end office in lec ys network that serves it is routed through the switch in that end office to the transport line that goes to the point of interconnection poi or meet point between lec ys network and lec zs network the call is then transported over lec zs network to the end office in zs network that serves end user b in that end office it is switched to the residential line that goes to bs house since z is pr oviding necessary transport and switching functions that its own subscriber b does not pay for in callingpartynetworkpays regime it will demand compensation from for terminating the call but if z sets the price it charges for terminating the ca ll well above cost this does not raise the cost for the called party b who is not char ged for termination it simply adds to the cost of the latter is captive custom er since it cannot affect bs choice of local exchange carrier once b has chosen z to be its lec has actual or potential alternative to z for terminating that ca ll absent regulatory intervention the terminating carrier in this case z has the ability to exercise its market power to raise the rates it charges other carriers such as for terminating calls made by their subscribershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs15 30 balanced traffic need not result in balan ced costs if for example one of the carriers faced higher underlying cost stru cture due for example to low p opulation density or unique terrain problems 31 carriers however could have an incentive to raise termination rates even if they would be matched by an equal increase in rmination costs if wall street values revenue growth rather than or in addition to in come growth this condition holds whenever growth companies are in ascendancy in the cap ital markets as they were in the late 1990s figure 2 simple telephone call over two carriers networks source simplified version of diagram pres ented in the icf plan at appendix c p 5 even if there are many competing local exchange carriers offering service to and b once b has chosen its local exchange carrier all calls to b must be terminated over the network of that chosen carrier b has incentive to choose its local exchange carrier based on which carrier charges the lowest rates to other carriers for terminating calls to customer b in f act b might have the incentive to choose the local exchange carrier that strategically charges very high rates to carriers for terminating calls since these customers are captive and uses the extra revenue to set lower rates for enduser customers under callingpartynetworkpays there is one situation in which market forces might constrain how much the called partys carrier will charge to terminate the call if all carriers traffic tended to be in balance in the sense that the number of calls made by their customers calling parties to the customers of other carriers was approximately the same as the number of calls received by their customers called parties from the customers of other carri ers then the potential revenues and costs from the function of terminating one anot hers calls would tend to be wash30 the incentive to raise the price for terminating calls would likely be constrained because all carriers would face the same market nvironment in which higher revenues from high termination charges imposed on othe r carriers would simply be matched by higher costs for high termination charges imposed by other carriers31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs16 32 see in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of 1996 and interca rrier compensation for ispbound traffic cc docket 9698 and 9968 order on rema nd and report and order 2001 isp order adopted april 18 2001 and released april 27 2001 at paragraph 5 which states for example comments in the record indicate that competitive local exchange carriers clecs on average terminate eighteen times more tra ffic than they originate resulting in annual clec reciprocal compensation billings of appr oximately two billion dollars ninety percent of which is for ispbound traffic moreover the traffic imbalances for some competitive carriers are in fact much greater with seve ral carriers terminating more than forty times more traffic than they originate footnotes omitted in some situations clecs enjoyed an advantage over ilecs when competing for these customers because they had complete flexibility in the pricing they c ould offer while ilecs were subject to regulatory constraints limiting them to sales out of their published tariffs and prohibiting the use of customer specific contracts 33 this is especially so if clec can iden tify just single point of interconnection in large geographic area and the ilec must bear ll the costs of transporting traffic originating on its network to that single poi wh ich is allowed under the current rule 34 see 2001 isp order at 5 where the fcc found that under the current carrierto carrier recovery mechanism it is conceivable th at carrier could serve an isp free of charge and recover all of its costs from originating carriers 35 long distance carriers are in somewh at less captive position with respect to the originating portion of calls than the termina tion portion of calls when long distance carrier has very large customer that origin ates many calls if that customers local exchange carrier sets the charges for origina ting long distance calls far above cost it may continuedbut the traffic between carriers is rarely in balance and as result there are market forces under callingpartynetwor kpays pricing reg ime to constrain termination charges indeed local exchange carriers have the incentive to strategically pursue those customers who receive more calls than they make for example isps because then they can take advantage of the fact that the calling partys carrier is captive customer for terminating service to set rates for termination far above cost with ri sk of losing that captive customer32 local exchange carrier whose cust omers receive more calls than they make will profit because it will generate more revenues from terminating ca lls to its customers that originate on other carriers networks than it will generate costs to terminate the calls originated by its customers to called parties that subscribe to other carriers33 several small competitive local exchange carriers pursued this strategy to the point where they allegedly provided local service to isps at little or charge obtaining most or all of their revenues from the charges they made to other carriers for terminating calls34 the isps do not pay for and will not care about the charges for terminating service and might even encourage their local carriers to charge carriers higher termination price if they can use that to negotiate lower price for themselves similarly long distance carriers must make payments to local exchange carriers both to connect to their customers and to complete the calls made by their customers but do not receive compensation from other carriers long distance customers will not care about the rates that their local carriers charge long distance carriers to complete calls to them long distance carriers have way to reward those customers who call parties that choose local ca rriers with low termination charges35 i n ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs17 35 continued induce the long distance carrier or compe titive access provider to put in dedicated line between the customers premise and the long distance carriers network to carry those calls thereby avoiding the local exchange carriers originating access charges and even for smaller customers if there are competing loca l exchange carriers and one of those carriers seeks to charge long distance carriers very high price for originating access long distance companies could charge their customers high er price if they chose the local exchange carrier with high origination access charges this might entice some customers to switch to local carrier that has lower rates for originating access and thus would place market pressure on the local carrier with high orig inating access rates to lower those rates in practice however this ability of the market to impose price discipline is limited for two reasons 1 the fcc rules implementing the re quirement in section 254g of the 1996 act that long distance carriers set rates in rural areas that are higher than rates in urban areas and that rates not vary across states effectively requires long distance carriers to set nationwide averaged rates and 2 the administ rative costs of varying end user long distance rates based on the individual customers choice of local exchange carrier may exceed the combination of higher revenues from the higher charges and the costs savings from those end users that actually switch to lec that has lower originating access chargescallingpartynetworkpays regime there are market forces constraining the price of terminating long distance calls as result even as competition s developed in many telecommunications markets allowing regulators to reduce or eliminate their regulation of prices there is general agreement that under callingpart ynetworkpays regime regulation is still needed for intercarrier compensation rates charged for terminating communications on the local telephone network but that regulation typically has not take n the form of requiring carriers to pay costbased termination rates rather it has given regulators the latitude to set intercarrier compensation rates that foster certain public policy goals as discussed earlier both interstate and intrastate access ch arges historically have been set to far exceed cost especially for rural carriers and intrastate calls as means of maintaining low basic local service rates similarly isps have been deemed end users specifically to allow them to avoid intercarrier compensation charges but this market failure rationale for government intervention in the market to set intercarrier compensati on rates may disappear under regime of calledparty shares if the called party rather than the calling party or the carrier to which the calling party subscribes were responsible for compensating its local exchange carrier for terminating the call then that called party would have the incentive to choose local exchange carrier whose termination charges are low if carrier set termination rates that far exceeded cost its subscribers would have the incentive to seek out an alternative carrier of course this market correction could only occur where end users had real competitive alternatives to turn to if their current local carriers raised rates it is likely however that regulation of enduser termination charges will continue until such effective competition develops several of the proposals for comprehens ive intercarrier compensation reform as well as the fcc staff proposal question whether the advantages of callingparty networkpays still hold and argue that it introduces ine fficiencies and distortions thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs18 36 47 usc 254e 37 these issues are addressed in the sections that followare inconsistent with competitive markets first they argue that under callingparty networkpays it is necessary for regulators to set rates for intercarrier compensation which will always be contentious and ex pensive process second they claim that today there are ways for customers to manage their incoming calls screening services such as caller id ipenabled serv ices that enable customers to determine how and when they will receive calls do not call registries to minimize the receipt of calls from which they do not benefit third they claim that most costs associated with terminating calls are not usagesens itive and therefore termination costs should be recovered through fixed line charge not perminuteofuse charge thus although the line charge an end user pa ys would initially increase under called partyshares plan that line charge woul d not fluctuate with the number of calls received and end users coul d control their monthly telephone bill fourth administrative costs would not increase if the charge were simply line charge the subscriber line charge on each customers bill might change but all customers already receive bills with monthly line ch arges fifth in the 1996 act congress instructed the fcc to remove implicit universal service subsidies from rates and place them in an explicit funding mechanism36 calledpartyshares approach would facilitate that but there are several counterarguments first the available means for customers to manage their incoming calls have associated costs which especially when added to higher subscriber line charge may be burdensome for low income customers second if all th termination costs are placed on the called party there is market disincentive for high volume callers such as telemarketers and spammers to increase their usage as will be discussed later increased calling volume will increase switching costs during peak periods the advantages and disadvantages of callingpartynetworkpays approach vs calledpartyshares approach will depend on number of factors including where interconnection is allowed or required the underlying cost structure for interconnection and ter mination the extent to which termination costs vary across networks and how easy it is to identify th underlying network cost structure and measure actual costs37 to the extent these parameters vary with the specific interconnecting networks for example do some networks have more usagesensitive costs than others is it more efficient for some networks than for others to have multiple interconnection points it may be op timal to implement hybrid intercarrier compensation system but if hybrid system is implemented it will be necessary to ensure that it does not artificia lly favor one set of providers over another in competitive market where should networks be allowed or required to interconnect with one another why this mattershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs19 38 as explained earlier as united states telecommunications policy has evolved from government sanctioned monopoly provision to compe titive provision of telecommunications services incumbent providers have been require d to allow new entrants to interconnect with their networks in nondiscriminatory fashion otherwise the incumbents could use their dominant position to refuse to interconnect with the smaller networks or the new entrants or to impose onerous interconnection terms and conditions on the entrants 39 there also has been lot of disagreemen t between rural lecs and wireless carriers about where and how to interconnect to exchange tra ffic but since this disagreement typically involves interconnection through an intermedia transit network of third carrier it is discussed in later section on rules for transit networkswhether the cost burden of completing calls is borne entirely by the calling partys carrier or shared with the called party the cost of the terminating or originating portion of the call will depend on where the carriers are allowed or required to interconnect where two carriers networks are alike using similar technologies and configured to serve similar customer ba ses such similarities might allow them to identify an agreed upon sing interconnection point or set of points that does not place either carrier at relative advantagedisadvantage but the network architectures of the various ca rriers vary dramatically for number of reasons historical the ilecs were requir ed to build out ubiquitous networks that others need not replicate technological some tec hnologies maximize efficiency with greater deployment of switches and smaller connecting transport pipes while others are optimized with the use of fewer larger switches connected by higher capacity transport pipes geographic optimal network architecture will differ in urban and rural areas or for carriers serv ing wide areas vs those serving narrowly defined areas as result the optima l points of interc onnection may be very different for different types of networks each carrier will want to set points of interconnection that favor its particular network configuration if left entirely to market negotiation the incumbent lecs who during the transition from monopoly to competitive markets retain some market power might be able to impose interconnection terms and conditions that would undermine the efficiencies of the entrants network archit ectures and technologies38 the principal situation where distinct network architectures have made it difficult for carriers to r each agreement about where to interconnect and how to structure intercarrier compensation invol ves the interconnection of ilec and clec networks39 analysis and discussion figure 2 shows very simplified networ k architecture the large ilecs who serve the vast majority of us househol ds and businesses have extensive and ubiquitous hierarchical networks with number of tandem switc hes that aggregate and route traffic to much larger numbe r of end office switches serving particular neighborhoods all of which are connected by very large web of transport facilities when such an ilec terminates call that originates on another carriers network the call typically will be routed through one or more of its tandem switches before reaching the end office switch serving the called party other carriers in particular the competitive local exchange carriers use newer technologies and have lesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs20 40 47 usc 251c2b 41 15 fcc rcd 18354 18390 78 n 174 2000 latas were created in the 1982 modified final judgment court order breaki ng up the old bell system

lata boundary such interlata services were offered by interexchange carriers latas can cover very large geographic areas even entire states today these lata restrictions longer hold all the regional bell operating companies are allowed to offer interlata service but the interconnection rules continue to be based on the lata boundaries the fcc rule allowing clec to interconnect with an ilec at single poi per lata does not apply to interexchang long distance carriers interconnecting with ilecsextensive nonhierarchical networks ofte n with only single switch serving much larger area with that switch in effect pr oviding the functions of both an end office switch and tandem switch requiring the clecs to build out their ow n networks to interconnect at or near every ilec end office switch in every local calling area or even to interconnect at or near every ilec tandem switch wo uld in effect impose the ilec network architecture on the clecs even though the latter use different technologies and have different business plans what might be an efficient architecture for the ilecs might not be so for the clecs moreover even successful clec entrant is unlikely to attain the penetration levels of the ilecs for many years and thus will not be able to exploit the scale economies enjoyed by the ilecs it is not feasible for them to replicate the ilecs ubiquitous networks on the other hand if the clecs are onl required to interconnect with the ilecs at single poi in large geographic region then ilecs would have to transport traffic well beyond local ca lling area boundaries to be exchanged this could be very costly if ilecs bore the co st of transporting traffic originating on its network to the single poi also with single poi traffic exchange will occur on average further from both the calling partys location and the called partys location when either the calling party or the called party is an ilec subscriber communicating with clec subscriber that will result in greater congestion on the ilecs ubiquitous networks than with multiple po is in addition if calledpartyshares regime were implemented in conjunction with single poi more substantial charges for termination might be imposed on the called party than would be the case if there were many mandated poi nts of interconnection the 1996 act requires an ilec to allo w requesting local telecommunications carrier to interconnect at any technically feasible point40 the fcc has interpreted this provision to mean that clecs have the option to interconnect at single poi per local access and transport area lata41 in general latas are broader than local calling areas so an ilec bringing tr affic that originates on its network to single poi often would be required to transport that

the 1996 act all lecs have the dut to establish costbased reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of local telecommunications43 the fcc rules implementing that provision permit terminating carrier to recover from the originating carrier the cost of certain facilities from an interconnecting point to the called party44 in both its 2001 notice of proposed rulemaking and its 2005 further notice of proposed rulemaking the fcc sought comment on whether an ilec should be obligated to bear its own costs of delivering traffic to single poi when that poi is located outside the local calling area45 the commission has asked whether carrier should be required to interconnect in ever local calling area or pay the incumbent transport andor access charges if the loca tion of the single poi requires transport beyond the local calling area not surprisingly in their comments most clecs and wireless carriers favor maintaining single poi per lata rule46 and the ilecs support requirement that competitive carriers establish poi in each calling area or pay the transport costs to reach poi outside the local calling area47 the current rules may encourage traffic imbalance because terminating networks not only collect reciprocal compensation they also avoid financial responsibility fo r the transport facilities needed to bring traffic from the originating ilecs ne twork all the way to the single poi48 when traffic is out of balance the cost of interconnection is borne primarily by the originating carrier and the terminating carrier may lack the incentive to minimize the transport costs associated with connecting the two networks as providers from different segments of the industry have come together to attempt to develop consensus positions on intercarrier compensation compromise positions have been proposed that take in to account differences between the network architectures of different ca rriers for example althoug h the icf plan proposes ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs22 49 see the icf plan proposed by the intercarrier compensation forum submitted in in the matter of developing unified intercarrier compensation regime docket 0192 on october 5 2004 50 icc fnprm at 96 51 icf plan at appendix pp 4 1012 the icf calls this edge to edge interconnection transporttransition to unified intercarrier compensation rates it explicitly identifies three types of networks hierarchical ne tworks of the type deployed by the large ilecs rural networks operated by certain rural carriers and nonhierarch ical networks of the sort deployed by some clecs and proposes different requirement s and responsibilities for the exchange of traffic for each49 the various reform proposals submitted monstrate creative approaches to this complex issue for example in the icc fnprm the fcc raised an issue about the interrelationship between network interconnection and intercarrier compensation pricing if the commission we re to adopt billandkeep approach and competitors had to pay the same rate zero to terminate calls wherever they connect to the ilec network would there be any incentives for clecs or wireless carriers to interconnect at more than one point of interconnection per lata since to do so would increase their network costs but not result in any savings in intercarrier compensation costs50 but as demonstrated by the icf plan that concern could be addressed by allowing each carrier to identify at least one point per lata in its network where it will receive traffic for routing within its network and if the originating carrier seeks to interconnect at point different from the one chosen by the terminating carrier require the originating carrier to bear the cost burden for transport between those points51 what is the underlying cost structure of the transport and switching functions why this matters the rates for intercarrier compensation that carriers must pay become part of their costs of providing service and the rate structure of that compensation will affect the carriers underlying cost st ructure if those charges are usagesensitive then the carriers underlying costs become usage sensitive and will ma ke it more difficult for those carriers to offer end users large baskets of minutes or unlimited calling at fixed price that will be efficient if indeed the underlying transport and switching costs associated with terminating or originating call are in fact usagesensitive in that situation unlimited calling packages at fixed price would encourage inefficient overuse of the network facilities on the other hand if the underlying costs of transporting and switching calls are not usagesensitive but the intercarrier compensation charges are usagebased then carriers could be artificially discouraged from offering fixed price rvice that consumers seek and indeed could be punished in the marketplace for providing fixed price service offering that would make efficient use of the public switched telephone network moreover if not all carriers are subject to the same intercarrier compensation regime those that face intercarrierhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs23 52 when long distance carriers make inte rcarrier compensation payments to their subscribers local exchange carriers for use of those carriers networks to originate long distance calls there may be some usagesensitive costs associated with the trunk ports at the lecs switch these are sometimes classified as transport costs and sometimes as switching costs 53 more exactly the debate has focused on end ffice switching it is generally agreed that the underlying cost structure of tandem switches is not usagesensitive tandem switches are usually viewed as part of the transpor t function rather than part of the switching function 54 for example mci has argued that vendor contracts for switching establish perline prices rather than perminute prices and thus local exchange carriers do not incur switching costs on perminute basis and digital sw itches are being produced with such large processor capacity that their costs may longer vary with minutes of use see icc fnprm at paras 23 68 55 in

between the poi and tandem or end office switch or between tandem and an end office switch or between an end office switch and an end users pre mises has been put in place its costs will not vary with usage economists and regulators have long recognized that it is not efficient to recover usageinsensitive costs through minuteofuse charges b ecause such charges will discourage usage which is not the cost causer as result today the costs associated with transport are almost always recovered through recurring fixed monthly charges52 there has been much more debate on the extent to which switching costs are usagesensitive53 number of carriers argue that substantial majority of switching costs do not vary with minutes of use54 the fcc became involved in this debate when it was petitioned to

costs are usage sensitive and that those usagesensitive costs only applied to usage during peak periods59 but the parties disagreed on how t hose shared peak period costs should be recovered all the parties agreed that it would not be feasible to impose peak period usage charges verizon and att argued these costs should be recovered through minuteofuse charges across all time periods mci argued that these costs should be recovered throug h flat perport charge60 the fcc concluded that while neither approach is ideal the flat perport charge is better because it would not place any provider at competitive disadvantage61 based on these conclusions most of veri zons switching costs were deemed not usagesensitive and an even larger proporti on of its switching co sts were recovered through port or line charges rather than minuteofuse charges however this fcc conclusion may not fully resolve how switching costs should be treated for intercarrier compen sation there is specific statutory or regulatory guideline for the costing met hodology to use for determining intercarrier compensation in its virginia arbitrati on decision the fcc used the total element long run incremental cost telric met hodology that it had adopted to determine the costs and rates for unbundled networ k elements telric calculates the average incremental cost of providing the entire demanded quantity of network element by contrast the statutory cost standard for reciprocal compensation the intercarrier compensation associated with completion of local calls is additional cost62 which only looks at the additional incremental quantity of the element needed for terminating or originating traffic it is possible that some costs that are not usage sensitive when viewed from the perspective of the entire quantity of switching demanded would be usagesensitive from the perspective of smaller increment of switching usage however the fcc has c oncluded that the reciprocal compensation requirements and hence add itional cost methodology in the 1996 act only apply to local telecommunications traffic and not to access charges63httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs25 63 continued telecommunications act of 1996 first report and order cc docket 9698 and 95 185 11 fcc rcd 15499 16013 1996 it appears then that significant pr oportion of the switching costs associated with terminating call are not usagesensitive but there is consensus on exactly what that proportion is properly identifying the underlying co st structure for switching has four important policy consequences first if the preponderance of switching costs are not usagesensitive then the current recovery of most switching costs in perminuteofuse access charges and reciprocal compensation charges is creating market signals that do not reflect underlying costs it would be more effici ent to recover those switching costs through fixed line charge that sends market signal reflecting that it is the additional switching capacity needed to serve additional lines rather than the additional switching capacity needed to serve increased usage that is driving switching costs if this is correct any perminuteofuse charge to recover usagesensitive costs should be quite small second if the underlying cost structur for transporting and terminating calls is indeed overwhelmingly linedriven rather than usagedriven so that the bulk of the costs are caused by the called party hooking up to the network rather than by usage of the terminating carriers switch to terminate calls then this might argue for employing calledpartyshares approach to intercarrier compensation rather than perminuteofuse charge on the calling partys carrier such charge would likely take the form of an increase in the enduser subscriber line charge third if the proportion of rmination costs that are usagesensitive costs is very small then even if the interconnecting carriers traffic and costs are not in exact balance the distortion from employing billandkeep that is setting zero per minuteofuse charge for termination nd recovering all co sts through enduser subscriber line charges would be minuscule in contrast if significant proportion of the switching costs associated with transporting and terminating traffic is usage sensitive so that significant minuteofuse charges would most closely reflect underlying costs then billandk eep system which effectively sets zero price for termination would create distorting market si gnal that the switch usage for termination is costless providers might have the incentive to aggressively pursue customers that make more calls than they receive for example telemarketers because if their traffic were imbalanced toward origination they could generate revenues from subscribers without incurring th costs associated with terminating the large volume of calls made by their subscribers fourth setting intercarrier compensation rates and rate structure in fashion that does not reflect underlying costs can ve significant competitive impact for example under the current access charge re gime interexchange carriers are charged on perminuteofuse basis for the switching used to originate and terminate theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs26 64 much of the discussion in this section co mes from the detailed presentation in the fccs icc fnprm at paras 120133customers calls making the interexchange carriers underlying co st structure usage sensitive even t hough the preponderance of those sw itching costs appear not to be usagesensitive but by facing these artificially imposed usagebased costs long distance carriers are discouraged from offering large baskets of minutes or unlimited calling at fixed price since they would lose money when serving high usage customers who are the customers most likely to select such packages the long distance carriers assert that the bell operating companies which are now allowed to offer long distance service and typically do so as part of package of local and long distance service do not face the same problem the long distance carriers claim that even if the bell companies long distance arms must pay the same usagebased access charges to their local operating companies as the long distance carriers pay the underlying costs to the bells are not usagesensitive that is any losses that the bells long distance arms might suffer when serving high usage customer by having to pay minuteofuse access charges while offering large baskets of minutes or unlimited calling at fixed price are ma tched by the additional profits that the bells local operating companies generate from those minuteofuse access charges since their underlying costs ar not increasing with usage what system is needed for tting intercarrier compensation rates for intermedia transit networks why this matters more and more networks need to interconnect with one another to complete calls but in many cases the volume of traffic exchanged between two carriers is not sufficient to justify deployment of dedicated facilities for that exchange other carriers especially ilecs may already ve facilities that interconnect with each of the carriers and that can carry the traffic between the carriers presently there are rules pertaining to intercarrier compensation of those intermediate transit networks analysis and discussion transiting occurs when two carriers that are not directly interconnected exchange traffic by routing the traffic through an intermediary carriers network64 transiting can involve local traffic or long distance traffic neither the calling party nor the called party subscribes to the transit carrier and thus in either callingparty carrierpays system or calledpartyshares system there must be mechanism for compensating any transiting carrier used to complete call frequently clec or wireless carrier in local market will not interconnect with all other clecs or wireless carriers in that market because it does not exchange sufficient traffic with many of the carriers to justify the investment in facilities rather it will route traffic bound to another clec or wire less carrier through its own poi with the ilec over the ilecs tandem switch and transport ne twork to the other clecs or wireless carriers poi with the ilec this is feasible because all clecs and wireless carriers will be interconnected to the ilecs network httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs27 65 icc fnprm at 122 66 id at 123 67 see 47 usc 251a1 68 icc fnprm at 125also almost all wireless calls are carried on intermediate wireline facilities before reaching their final destination the wireless carriers often lease these lines from long distance carriers but especially in rural areas where the volume of traffic does not justify leasing line the wireless traffic sometimes will be routed directly over the long distance carriers network r over the network of large ilec located adjacent to the rural lec to reach the end users local exchange in each of these situations the intermed iary carrier charges fee for use of its facilities but the current rules concerning traffic transiting over an intermediate network differ when the traffic is local or long distance transiting of long distance traffic is g overned by the interstate and intrastate access rules under which access ra tes are set in tariffs in contrast although many ilecs currently provide transit of local traffic pursuant to interconnection agreements the fcc has not determined wh ether carriers have duty to provide such transit service the reciprocal compensation provisions of the act address the exchange of traffic between an originating carrier and terminating carrier but the fccs reciprocal compensation rules do not directly addre ss how intercarrier compensation should be paid to the transit service provider ilecs argue that they are not required to provide transit service under the 1996 act and that transit service fferings should remain voluntary65 they explain that they limit the availability of such services in order to prevent traffic congestion and exhaust of tandem switch cap acity and to encourage carriers to establish direct interconnection when traffic volumes warrant it ilecs state that transiting should be treated as an unregulated service offere d at marketbased prices or alternatively at tariffed special access rates that are not costbased clecs and wireless carriers on the othe r hand argue that ilecs are required to provide transit service under the act66 they explain that indirect interconnection via transit service provider is the most efficient means of interconnection and that the availability of transiting is critical to the development of competition wireless carriers in particular argue that the low volume of traffic exchanged with smaller local exchange carriers does not warrant direct interconnection and that transit service is necessary for i ndirect interconnection clec s and wireless carriers state the fcc should set costbased comp ensation rates for transit service the fcc has determined that the availability of local transit service is increasingly critical to establishing indirect interconnection form of interconnection explicitly recogn ized and supported by the act67 and may provide the only efficient means by which to rout traffic between the networks of clecs wireless carriers and rural lecs68 it also has determined that indirect interconnection via transit service provider is an efficient way to interconnect whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs28 69 id at 126 70 id at 129 71 see footnote 10 above 72 icc fnprm at 137 73 id at 137carriers do not exchange significant amounts of traffic69 but the fcc seeks comment on its legal authority to impose transiting obligations the fcc also seeks empirical evidence about whether transit service is cu rrently available at reasonable rates terms and conditions to help it determine whether there is need for it to require and regulate the provi sion of transit service contingent on it having authority to do so70 many rural lecs argue that intramta71 traffic between wireless carrier and rural lec must be routed through an in terexchange carrier and therefore should be subject to access charges rather than r eciprocal compensation even though it never crosses an mta boundary72 on the other hand wireless carriers argue that calls that originate and terminate within single mta are subject to reciprocal compensation73 this has become major issue of contention because it often is not economically feasible for wireless carrier to interconnect directly with rural lec without use of an interm ediate carrier network although rural lecs serving areas so metimes cover large geographic areas they tend to serve only relatively small number of customers and often are not located near major population centers wire less carriers may deploy towers to serve those same rural areas but it is not economically feasible to deploy switches in many of those rural areas even many of the traditional wireline long distance companies do not interconnect directly within each ru ral lecs local calling areas as result often rather than direct physical point of interconnection traffic between rural lecs and wireless carriers and long distance carriers is carried over the facilities of an adjacent ilec or large long dist ance carrier that does interconnect directly with the rural lecs there will be point where the traffic is exchanged for billing purposes but it is not physical interconnection point conflict has arisen because under cu rrent rules the interconnection and intercarrier compensation rules differ for local and long distance traffic and the rural lecs and wireless carriers have the incentive to define and route traffic differently consider the example of subscriber to rural lec making telephone call to neighbors wireless telephone where the wire less carriers switch is in an adjacent ilecs serving area and where both the adjacent ilec and major long distance carrier directly interconnect with the rural ilecs network in that case the call must be routed from the rural lecs switch to the wireless carriers switch outside the rural lecs calling area and then back to the called party in the rural lecs calling area the wireless carrier will want that traffic to be treated as local intramta traffic and routed from the rural lecs switch to the point of interconnection meethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs29 74 icc nprm at 71 and icc fnprm at 121point with the adjacent ilec where it would then be routed over the adjacent ilecs facilities until it reached the wirele ss carriers switch the call then would be routed over whatever facilities the wi reless carrier had in place to reach its wireless tower in the rural lec service area and then to the called partys wireless telephone in this situation for the origina tion segment of the call the rural lec and ilec would be exchanging the local traffic using either billandkeep which incurs charge or costbased reciprocal compensation in contrast the rural lec will want that traffic to be treated as long distance and routed from the rural lecs switch to the point of interconnection with the long distance carriers network which would then either route the traffic directly to the wireless carriers switch if there was sufficient traffic with that wireless carrier to justify dedicated line to the wireless switch or route the traffic to the adjacent ilecs network from where it would be rout ed to the wireless carriers switch as in the previous case the call then would be routed over whatever facilities the wireless carrier had in place to reach its wireless tower in the rural lec service area and then to the called party s wireless telephone in this situation the rural lec will claim that use of the long distance carriers facilities renders the call long distance call even if it began and ended in the same mta and may never have left that mta and therefore it is entitled to recei ve abovecost origin ating access charges from the long distance carrier who would pass those costs along to the wireless carrier as part of its negotiated agr eement to provide transit service if comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform were implemented and intramtaintermta distinctions were eliminated this would longer be an issue but if the unique requirements of rural areas justify maintenance of some of the current intercarrier compensation rules for rural lecs this issue of the appropriate intercarrier compensation payments to and by interexchange carriers when they are acting as transiting carriers will remain the fcc has sought comment on how to compensate transiting carriers under billandkeep system74 since end users will not have any relationship with the transiting carrier the issue becomes how to identify whether the payment responsibility falls on the carrier to which the calling party subscribes or the carrier to which the called party subscribes how can intercarrier compensation reform take into account the special needs of rural carriers and uni versal service funding why this matters it has been longstanding us lecommunication policy to keep rates affordable for subscribers located in high cost rural areas by allowing rural lecs to charge long distance carriers abovecost access charges and by requiring long distance companies to offer services at nationa lly averaged rates if the first of these implicit universal service subsidies is eliminated as part of intercarrier compensationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs30 75 icc fnprm at 107 76 the intercarrier compensation reform pl an of the

western wireless intercarrier compensation plan submitted on december 1 2004 79 the intercarrier compensation forum would replace the current system with billand keep system but would explicitly take into account the unique needs of rural carriers and subscribers by setting different interconnec tion and compensation requirements when one of the interconnecting carriers is rural ca rrier for example rural lecs would have obligation to deliver originating traffic be yond the boundaries of their serving areas by setting lower limit on the level to which enduser subscriber line charges slcs could be increased by creating two new universal rvice funding mechanisms to replace the lost revenues from abovecost access charges and by setting longer transition period for rural carriers the cbicc proposal developed by group of clec s which would immediately reduce interstate access charges to total econom ic long run incremental cost would let joint statefederal board determine how to transition intrastate access charges to telric and would ensure that any reduction in access charge revenues be fully offset by increases in enduser charges and in universal service supportreform rural carriers may need stable and sustainable alternative source of universal service support that is competitiv ely neutral and not likely to be eroded by future market developments analysis and discussion according to the national telecommuni cations cooperative association rural lecs receive on average 10 of their revenue from interstate access charges and 16 from intrastate access charges in comparison the bell operating companies receive only 4 of their revenue from interstate access charges and 6 from intrastate access charges75 with rural ilecs far mo re dependent on abovecost intercarrier compensation charges than urban lecs it is not surprising that three sets of rural carriers have submitted to the f cc proposals for intercarrier compensation that specifically address the needs of rural carriers76 in addition western wireless wireless carrier that has been designated as an eligible telecommunication carrier etc77 in 14 states where it offers service in rural high cost areas has submitted proposal78 the proposals made by nonrural pa rties also specifica lly address rural issues79 the proposals by rural carriers vary widely the expanded portland group epg proposal presente d as an alternative to the billandkeep proposal in the icf plan s three stages in the first stage the current access charge exemption for isps rminating traffic to the public switchedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs31 telephone network would be liminated in the second st age all perminute rates would be set at the level of interstate access charges and new access restructure charge arc would be implemented the arc would be capacitybased charge for all carriers based on work ing telephone numbers but the revenues generated would be distributed only to t hose carriers that lose access charge revenue that is wireline carriers but not wireless carriers in the final stage of the epg plan the perminute access charges would be converted to capacity based port and link structure that would be set to rec over the average equivalent interstate per minute rate the port and link charges woul d not be costbased and would not apply to local traffic including eas and isp bound traffic thus although the separate arc would replace some of the implicit subsidies currently in usagebased rural lec access charges it appears that the port and link charges imposed on interconnecting carriers woul d continue to include some subsidy level unless interstate access charges had already fa llen to cost during the second stage the alliance for rational intercarrier compensation pr oposal for fair affordable comprehensive telecom solu tion facts plan proposes unified perminute rate for all types of traffic th at would be capped at level based on carriers interoffice embedded costs the unified rate would be charged to the retail service provider the originating lec on local call or the interexchange carrier for both origination and termin ation of long distance calls the facts plan also includes proposal for extending this comp ensation regime to ipenabled services in addition it proposes local retail rate re balancing which w ould allow rural lecs to raise local rates to partially c ounter the reductions in access revenues under the home telephone compan and pbt telecom homepbt proposal all carriers offering service to customers who make telecommunications calls including voip would be required to connect to the public switched telephone network and obtain numbers fo r assignment to customers the plan would replace existing perminute access charges and reci procal compensation with connection based intercarrier compensation charges every carrier would develop tariffed charge to be assessed on ll interconnected carriers based on ds0 voicegrade level of connection the connection charge is intended to cover the switching and transport costs for use of the local calling network if the carrier has an access tandem it would develop an alternative access tandem connection fee that would include the additional costs of the tandem service network interconnection between carriers would be accomplished through one poi per lata but where rural lec is involved the poi must be within the ru ral lecs serving area that is the rural lec would have responsibility to trans port traffic beyond its serving area border to help offset revenues lost from elimination of the current intercarrier compensation charges the homepbt proposal permits carriers to increase the subscriber line charge the current enduser charge intended to recover trafficinsensitive costs up to the current federal cap any remainin g revenue shortfall ma be recovered from new intercarrier cost recovery fund calle d the high co st connection fund hccf the hccf would be funded through monthly assessment based on activated telephone numbers and that ssessment could be passed thr ough to subscribers the consequence of this plan appears to be that access charges currently imposed on carriers would be placed on the number whic h allows connectivity to the networkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs32 western wireless proposes uni fied billandkeep system for all types of traffic it would reduce perminute compensation rates to billandkeep in equal steps using targeted reductions over fouryear period with longer transition period for small rural ilecs over those four years ilecs would be permitted to increase subscriber line charges as proposed in the icf plan except that there would be difference between the slc caps for rural and nonrural ilecs at the end of the four years the slc would be deregulated for an ilec that could demonstrate that it is subject to competition the western wireless plan also would replace all existing universal service mechanisms with unified high cost mechan ism based on forwardlooking costs this new support would be fully portable to all designated etcs and additional portable funds coul d be disbursed in states with forwardlooking costs higher than the national average the universal service reform also would be phased in over four years and over six years for the smallest rural ilecs and etcs these proposals show that neither rural carriers nor nonrural carriers are of single mind about how to implement rura l lec intercarrier compensation reform they also demonstrate that even among the parties that prefer costbased intercarrier compensation rates to zeroprice billandkeep system there is consensus on the costing methodology that should be employed to set intercarrier compensation rates moreover they highlight veral contentious issues although all parties recognize th need to create new explicit universal service funding mechanisms to help replace the current implicit subsidies in rural lec access charges consensus exists on 1 whether the rural carriers should be guaranteed universal service funds sufficient to repl ace all lost revenues sometimes called revenue neutral intercarrier compensa tion reform 2 what specific structure the new universal servi ce funding mechanisms should take or 3 whether rura l ilecs should have preferential access to those funds over new entrants such as rural wireless carriers although all parties agree that the trans ition period for implementing comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform will have to be longer for rural lecs than for ot her carriers there is consensus on how long that transition should be and the specific steps within the transition although all parties agree that enduser charges will have to increase there is consensus on whether rural subscriber line charges should be lower than urban subscriber line charges because rural local calling areas reach fe wer households than urban ones can intrastate intercarrier compensation rates and rate structure be modified by federal action the current intercarrier compensation rates that most exceed cost are intrastate access charges imposed on long distance carriers and wireless carriers for the termination of certain calls in addition to providing inaccurate market signals andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs33 80 47 usc 254b5 81 47 usc 254ediscouraging usage these high intrasta access charges distort competition for example since mta boundaries are far broader than local calling areas in many cases when telephone call is made between two points in state those points are in different local calling areas but the same mta if the calling party and called party are both using wireline telephone th calling partys long distance carrier would have to pay the called partys carrier abovecost intr astate access charges but if the calling party were to use wireless telephone which is subj ect to federal rather than state jurisdiction the calling partys wi reless carrier would onl have to pay the called partys carrier costbased reciprocal compensation rates this gives the wireless carrier competitive cost advantage over the wireline long distance carrier some state regulators are likely to prefer to maintain abovec ost intrastate access charges especially for small rural lecs in order to help keep local rates down intrastate access charges which are imposed on intrastate telecommunications services historically have been within the sole jurisdiction of state regulatory commissions but section 254b5 of the 1996 act80 states as principle that there should be specific predictable and suffi cient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance univers service and section 254e81 states that any universal service support s hould be explicit and sufficient implicit universal service subsidies in access charges do not meet these requirements in reviewing each of the intercarrier reform proposals already submitted and the potential compromises or alternatives that may be proposed by pa rties or by the fcc it will be necessary to determine 1 wh ether the fcc would have the statutory authority to implement the specific proposed changes in the rates and rate structure for intrastate services on its own 2 if involvement of joint federalstate board in the process would provide sufficient st ate input to meet st atutory requirements and 3 if there are any aspects of intrastate intercarrier compensation reform that are beyond the authority of the fcc why is intercarrier compensation regulat ion not needed for the networks that co mprise the internet today there are specific regulatory intercarrier compensation rules for interconnection arrangements between all types of carriers interconnecting with the local telephone network and fo r all types of traffic pa ssing over the local telephone network but there are analogous rules fo r the networks that make up the internet which are not regulated and for which intercarrier compensation is left to market negotiations why is it possible to rely on the market to set intercarrier compensation rates within the internet but not to set intercarrier compensation rates for interconnecting with the local telephone network in part this is the result of historical accident the internet from its inception has been network of interconnecting networks whereas the public switched telephone network was for lmost century monopoly network with little need forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs34 interconnection there has never been si ngle internet bac kbone network provider that was so large relative to other inte rnet backbone providers that it 1 would benefit from refusing to in terconnect with the other in ternet backbone networks or 2 could offer its customers beneficial interconnection rates terms or quality of service to the detriment of customers of other internet backbone networks when there was concern among the antitrust authorities in the united states and europe that the merger of worldcom and sprint might result in single internet backbone network large enough to tip the market the merger was blocked similarly it is likely that the department of justice and fcc reviews of the proposed sbcatt and verizon or qwestmci mergers will explicitly address wh ether the resulting entities would have market power in the internet backbone ma rket thus the backbone internet networks are in effect transiting networks for which there are competitive alternatives available also unlike the situation with the cal public switched telephone network in which called party will not care if its carrier charges high rates to the calling partys carrier to terminate communications the internet equivalent to the called party the party providing the database or video stream or other internet application will not want internet backbone providers to ch arge isps high interconnection charges because these would ultimately have to be passed on to enduser customers and thus could dampen demand for their own offerings overarching issue how can the complexities of intercarrier compensation be most effectively addressed in statutes and in fcc regulations intercarrier compensation affects all aspects of the telecommunications market investment decisions competition innovation responsiveness to consumer demands given the large number and va riety of entities that already interconnect with one another and the currently unknow able directions that technology and creativity may take in the future most observers agree that it is impossible to project predict or devise regulatory rules for all future intercarrier relationships at the same time however in network industry the ru of the game for interconnection will either foster or stifle efficient comp etition and innovation if in the absence of regulation firms with market power are ab to dictate the terms and conditions of interconnection consumers may not be well served policy makers face choices ranging betw een the extremes of setting complex detailed rules that prove too inflexible to effectively address all the interconnection permutations that arise in the future and setting overly broad guidelines that fail to provide sufficient marketplace certainty nd thus perpetuate the current litigious environment fortunately there are some factors that will affect the relative efficacy of the various approaches to intercarrier compensation where underlying costs are difficult to measure and thus it is difficult to set regulated prices that provide accurate market signals intercarrier compensation systems that avoid prices such as billand keep may be advantageous on th other hand if zero price maskshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32889crs35 serious usagedriven costs billandkeep approach may be harmful where effective competition already exists for example in the internet backbone the risk from erring on the side of little or regulation may be low on the other hand where competition is ephemeral that risk becomes much greater marketnegotiated intercarrier compensation terms conditions and rates avoid the inevitable distortions associated with regulatory fiat but market driven results could be even more distorted if one party can negotiate interconnection terms conditions and rates from position of market power broad principles and tailed rules need not be mutually exclusive the intercarrier compensation forum has constructed an extremely detailed proposal that begins with default rules base d on small set of basic principles and then expands on these rules for specified exceptions such as rural local exchange carriers this type of approach while far t oo detailed for statutor language might prove viable for fcc regulation crucial evaluative criterion for any proposed intercarrier compensation regime would be its susceptibility to or inhibition of extensive litigation one of the few areas in which there is industry consensus is that welldefined intercarrier compensation regime is needed that will reduce the current costs of litigation
