january or february congress begins formulating its budget re solution the house and senate budget committees are responsible for developi ng and reporting the budget resolution within six weeks after the presidents budget submission each house and senate committee is required to submit its views and estimates relating to budget matters under their jurisdiction to thei r respective budget committee sec tion 301d of the budget act these views and estimates often submitted in the form of letter to the chair and ranking member of the budget committee typically include comments on the presidents budget propos als and estimates of the budgetary impact of any legislation likely to be considered during the current session of congress the budget committees are not bound by these recommendations the views and estimates often are printed in the committee report accompanying the resolution in the senate or compiled in separate committee print in the house the budget resolution was designed to provide framework to make budget decisions leaving specific program determinations to the appropriations committees and other committees with spending and revenue jurisdiction in many instances however particular program changes are considered when formulating the budget resolution program assumptions are some times referred to in the reports of the budget committees or may be discusse d during floor action although these program changes are not binding committees may be strongly influenced by these recommendations when formulating appropriations bills reconciliation measures or other budgetary legislation appendix d provides list of the house sena and conference reports to the first budget resolutions adopted by congress each year content of the budget resolution section 301a of the budget act require s that the budget resolution include the following matters for the upcoming fiscal year and at least the ensuing four fiscal years aggregate levels of new budget au thority outlays the budget surplus or deficit and the public debt aggregate levels of federal re venues and the amount if any by which the aggregate levels of fe deral revenues should be increased or

on hconres 466 there has been an ongoing controversy about whether the directive in this budget resolution was reconciliation directive as set forth in section 310 of the c ongressional budget act the senate treated it as such and considered the resultant gislation hr 5559 as reported by the senate finance committee 94th congress under the reconciliation procedures the house did not however consider and adopt its version of the resultant legislation as reconciliation measure and thus it presumably did not consid er the directive as reconciliation directive see floyd m riddick and alan s frumin riddicks senate procedure precedents and practices rev ed sdoc 10128 101st cong 1st sess washington gpo 1992 pp 622623 the legislation subsequently was adopt ed by the senate and house but was

amounts are not included in the budget surplus or deficit totals due to their offbudget status in addition to the content required by the budget act section 301b lists several other matters th at may be included in the budget resolution appendix provides table indicating lected components included in first budget resolutions for fy1976fy2008 the most important of the optional matte rs is the inclusion of reconciliation directives provided by section 310 of the budget act budget reconciliation is an optional twostep process c ongress may use to bring dir ect spending revenue and debtlimit levels into comp liance with those set forth in budget resolutions2 in order to accomplish this congress first include s reconciliation directives in budget resolution directing one or more committees in each chamber to recommend changes in statute to achieve the levels of direct spending revenues debt limit or combination thereof agreed to in the budget resolution the legislative language recommended by committees then is packaged without any substantive revision into one or more reconcilia tion bills as set forth in the budget resolution by the house and senate budget committees in some instances committee may be required to report its legislative recommendations directly to its chamber once the budget co mmittees or individua l committees if so directed report reconciliation legislation to their respective chambers consideration is governed by special procedures3 these special rules serve to limit what may be included in reconciliation legislation to prohibit certain amendm ents and to encourage its completion in timely fashion during the 33year period since th congressional budget process was established congress has included reconciliation directives to house and senate committees in 20 budget resolutions4 the directives resulted in the enactment of 19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30297crs9 4 continued distribution memorandum reconciliation directives to house

measures on four occasions in 1982 1986 1997 and 2006 congress adopted two reconc iliation measures in one ear four reconciliation measures have been vetoed in 1975 1995 1999 and 2000 appendix f lists the budget resolutions that contained rec onciliation directives and the associated reconciliation acts beginning with the fy1981 budget resolution congress also included amounts for federal credit activities the 1985 balan ced budget act permanently required the inclusion of aggregate and f unctional levels of direct loan obligations and primary loan guarantee commitments in budget resolu tions the inclusion of federal credit levels however was made optional by the budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 111 stat 677712 of th 27 first budget resolutions adopted by congress 18 budget resolutions included federal credit amounts another optional component of budget re solutions has been the inclusion of reserve funds the reserve fund provisions generally provide for the revision of budget resolution aggregates functional allocations and committee allocations if certain deficitneutral legislation is enacted or some other condition is met over the last decade congress often has included veral reserve funds in budget resolutions as indicated in appendix for instance the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 110th congress included 23 reserve funds in recent years declaratory statements increasingly have been included in budget resolutions these nonbinding statements express the sens of congress the sense of the house or the sense of the sena on various issues as indicated in appendix congress has included on average 22 decl aratory statements in the last 11 budget resolutions not including budget resolutions for fy1999 fy2003 fy2005 and fy2007 because congress did not complete action on these measures but only on average about two and half declar atory statements in the first 18 budget resolutions the annual budget resolution also may re quire

enrolled until congress has comp leted action on r econciliation measure or prior to fy1 987 rec onciliation measure or the second budget resolution budget resolutions for fy1981 fy1982 fy1983 and fy1984 contained deferred enrollment provisions5 lastly congress has incl uded several other proce dural provisions in budget resolutions under section 301b4 of the budget act the socalled elastic clause httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30297crs10 6 for example see omb budget of the us government fiscal year 2007 analytical perspectives washington gpo febr uary 2006 chapter 12 pp 165174 7 for example

assumptions this provision was added by the balanced budget and emergency deficit control reaffirmation act of 1987 t itle i of pl 100119 99 stat 754788congress may set forth such other matte rs and require such other procedures relating to the budget as may be appropr iate to carry out the purposes of the congressional budget act in the budget resolution the number of procedural provisions included in budget resolutions is listed in the last column of appendix some of these procedural provisions include deferred enrollment automatic second budget resolutions special budgetary treatment of certain activities such as the sale of government assets and more recently enforcement of payasyougo requirement in the senate and limits on advance appropriations source of economic assumptions associated with budget levels in the budget resolution the budget levels contained in the budg et resolution are developed using baseline which is projection of reve nues and spending under existing law and assuming policy changes there are two baselines commonly used in the federal budget process 1 the cu rrent services estimates calculated by the office of management and budget omb and 2 the budget baseline projections calculated by the congressional budget office cbo these two projections often differ because they are based upon different sets of economic and technical assumptions reflecting different projections of fu ture economic and program performance the economic assumptions develope d by omb are published in the analytical perspectives volume of the presidents budget submitted to congress6 c b includes its initial economic assumptions in its annual economic and budget outlook report published early in the year7 often cbo revises these economic assumptions to reflect new economic data which become available after the publication of this report in some years cbo will revise its economic assumptions in late winter or early spring and publish them in its analysis of the presidents budget8 in other years revised economic assumptions w ill be included in cbos economic and budget outlook update report published in the summer congress is not required to use the ec onomic assumptions veloped by either omb or cbo in the budget resolution but must identify the economic assumptions upon which the budget levels are based9 the original budget act required that only the house and senate committee reports accompanying the budget resolution include the economic assumptions upon which the spe nding and revenue vels were based the common practice however was to extend this to the conference report on thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30297crs11 10 section 301g2 of the budget act as am ended by the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 99 stat 10381101budget resolution as well in 1985 congre ss amended the budget act to specifically require that the joint explanatory statement accompanying conference report on

budget resolutions for fy1976 to fy2008 of the 29 budget resolutions adopted by congress during this period 17 were ba sed upon economic assu mptions developed by cbo usually these were the ssumptions in cbos economic and budget outlook report published early in the year in four instances however congress used the economic assumptions that were revised by cbo after the publication of this report the budget resolutions for fy1984 fy1985 fy1997 and fy1998 were based upon revised cbo economic assumptions on f our other occasions congress made adjustments to the cbo economic assumptions the budget resolutions for fy1996 fy1997 fy1998 and fy2000 were ba sed upon adjusted cbo economic assumptions in the first three the adjustments were intended to reflect anticipated revisions to the consumer price index in six of the 29 budget resolutions congress used the economic assumptions developed by omb usually these were th assumptions included in the presidents budget submitted to congress early in the ear in two of these budget resolutions however the omb economic assumptions were adjusted to reflect revisions in economic data in 1982 congress base d the budget levels in the fy1983 budget resolution upon economic assumptions agreed to by negotiators from congress and the administration during budget summit finally the joint explanatory statements accompanying the

during the last several years is in marked contrast to the early years of the congressional budget process during the first eight years the house considered on average more than 13 amendments per budget resolution agreeing to on average three of these in contrast during the past 25 years the house has considered very few amendments to budget resolutions averaging almost four per budget resolution and agreeing to even fewer of these of the 89 amendments considered by the house during this time period only four were adopted since 1992 the house s rejected all amendments contributing to this trend the house sp ecial rule typically has allowed for consideration of only amendments in th nature of substitute to the budget resolution for example between 1983 and 2007 for the fy1984fy2008 budget resolutions 84 out of the 89 amendments to the budget resolution made in order by the special rule were amendments in the nature of substitute only one of these 84 amendments in

the house but instead are governed by the procedures set forth in sec tion 305b of the budget act typically larger number of amendments is considered consisting of substitute amendments as well as amendments that address specific issues during the period between 1975 and 2007 the senate considered on average about 42 amendments per budget resolution agreeing to on average 22 of these14 the
