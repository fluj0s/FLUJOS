walter j oleszek senior specialist in the legislative process government and finance division summary on june 20 1995 the house of representatives passed resolution hres 168 by 271 to 146 vote to create an expedited procedure to repeal or correct laws rules and regulations that are as then rules chairman gerald solomon stated obsolete ludicrous duplicative burdensome or costly1 the resolution amended the house rulebook by repealing the consent calendar and replacing it with new corrections calendar background the consent calendar originated in 1909 as way to expedite floor action on noncontroversial measures legislation on that calendar in order on the first and third mondays of the month typically passed quickly without amendment by unanimous consent however the consent calendar fell into disuse as the house increasingly employed other procedures unanimous consent or suspension of the rules to process noncontroversial or relatively noncontroversial legislation measures were called up on consent days during the 102nd and 103rd congresses the idea for the corrections calendar was highlighted early in 1995 by speaker newt gingrich crediting the concept to michigan governor john engler the speaker stated that he wanted to establish corrections day procedure for repealing the dumbest things the federal government is currently doing and just abolish them2 in subsequent weeks the speaker raised the corrections day idea in different forums and provided some additional details as to how the concept might be implemented 1 congressional record june 20 1995 p h6104 2 the

speaker announced the formation of corrections day steering group chaired by representative barbara vucanovich rnev with representatives bill zeliff rnh and david mcintosh rind serving as cochairs for years the speaker said businesses of all sizes have voiced concerns and objections to the high cost and abundance of regulations they are subjected to which makes little sense but are required by law3 the basic mission of the corrections day steering group was to assess how the speakers plan might be implemented so that wasteful and unnecessary regulations or laws could be considered for termination by the house in an expedited manner subsequently public hearings were held on the corrections day concept on may 2 1995 appropriate subcommittees of the committees on government reform and rules held joint hearing with speaker gingrich as the leadoff witness the speaker stressed the importance of returning to common sense in crafting regulations and noted that corrections day would allow citizens to have an effective way to address legal but stupidly legal rules and regulations and that the procedure would enhance congressional oversight of federal agencies other witnesses provided examples of what in their judgment constituted especially onerous and arbitrary laws and regulations identified procedural options including corrections day calendar for implementing the corrections concept and highlighted the value of having rapid response and bipartisan procedure for considering what seemed to be plainly ridiculous and wasteful laws and regulations concern was also expressed at the hearing that any corrections day procedure not be employed by special interests that may want to repeal rules they say are mistakes or silly when in fact the regulations serve beneficial public purpose some witnesses also stressed the complexity of issues treated by regulations and emphasized the need for committee review of any proposed corrections bill still others highlighted the need to allow for minority party participation in the process some witnesses also wondered why existing procedures such as suspension of the rules could not be employed for corrections legislation consideration by the house rules committee on june 6 1995 representative vucanovich introduced hres 161 which proposed to abolish the consent calendar and establish in its place corrections calendar the product of her task forces work the resolution laid out procedural blueprint for implementing the speakers goal of having corrections day in addition the corrections day steering group suggested during its deliberations that an advisory panel of republicans and democrats be established to assist the speaker in formulating criteria as to what constituted corrections bill and in establishing guidelines for screening and scheduling such measures on june 13 1995 the rules committee received testimony on the proposal to establish corrections calendar from members and other witnesses three days later the committee favorably reported privileged resolution hres 168 to abolish the 3 the speakers press room speaker gingrich announces corrections day steering group march 23 1995 crs3 consent calendar and to establish new corrections calendar for the house subsequently as noted earlier the house established the corrections calendar hres 168 did not include definition of statutory or regulatory measures that might be candidates for consideration on corrections day informally the corrections day advisory group developed criteria for making their recommendations to the speaker as one member of the advisory group said the guidelines we developed for the corrections day advisory committee say that corrections bill should address laws and regulations that are ambiguous arbitrary or ludicrous the bill should be noncontroversial and have broad bipartisan support4 the first corrections bill to be signed into law by the president was the edible oil regulatory reform act pl 10455 when the house adopted its rules on the opening day january 7 1997 of the 105th congress three changes were made in the corrections calendar procedure first house rule i rule xx under the 1999 recodification of house rules was amended to permit the speaker to postpone until later in the day or for up to two legislative days roll call voteson amendments on ordering the previous question or on the motion to recommit involving corrections calendar legislation second house rule xiii now rule xv was amended to allow the speaker to call the corrections calendar at any time during corrections day rather than as previously required immediately after recitation of the pledge of allegiance third house rule xiii now rule xv was further amended to grant discretionary authority to the speaker to call up measures on the corrections calendar in any order provided they had been on the calendar for three legislative days formerly corrections measures were taken up based on their numerical placement on the corrections calendar the general purpose of these changes especially the latter two was to permit the leadership in working with committee chairmen to have the maximum flexibility possible in scheduling both corrections bills and suspension bills on tuesday5 the 105th congress house made another change involving business on the corrections calendar it adopted resolution hres 7 on the opening day that created new corrections calendar office under the terms of the authorizing resolution the office shall have the responsibility of

adopted h res 5 amending its standing rules two modifications were made to corrections calendar procedure first the house amended rule xv by deleting the requirement that bills must be on the
