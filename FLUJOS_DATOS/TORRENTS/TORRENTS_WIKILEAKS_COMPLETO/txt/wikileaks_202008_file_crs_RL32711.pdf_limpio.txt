security reported to the house rules committee septem ber 30 2004 its recommendations on the operation and implement ation of the rules of the house including rule x with respect to the issue of homeland security the select committee recommended the creation of permanent standing committee on homeland security with specified jurisdiction number of house committees currently have important roles in homeland security policymaking the appropriations committees role related to discretionary spending is clear cut and the committee reorganized its subcommittees at the start of the 108th congress to create homeland security subcommittee aligned with the component parts of the department of homeland security dhs legislative authority over policy areas and federal agencies included in dhs are principally within the jurisdiction of several standing house committees agriculture armed services energy and commerce fi nancial services g overnment reform international relations judiciary scien ce transportation and infrastructure and ways and means and the permanent select committee on intelligence some of these committees also have jurisdiction over federal agencies and components of federal programs included in the departme nt that have nonhomel andsecurityrelated purposes in the 108th congress the select committee on homeland security also had jurisdiction over legi slation affecting dhs in addition some committees have key ro to play in overseeing homeland securityrelated policy areas and federal agencies not incorporated in the department these committees are armed services energy and commerce financial services international relations and judiciary committees and the permanent select committee on intelligence httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs2 2 among the purposes spelled out in the law creating the commission the commission was to make full and complete accounting of the circumstances surrounding the attacks of september 11 2001 the source of the commissi ons popular name the commissions official name was the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states 3 national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the

10 2004on july 22 2004 the 911 commission2 became the latest of number of commissions think tanks and other entities to weigh in on congressional oversight of the issue of homeland security some of these entities issued reports before the creation of dhs some before the terrori st attacks of september 11 2001 and some more recently in addition witnesses at house committee hearings in the 108th congress held by subcommittees of the select committee on homeland security and the committee on rules provided additional ideas related to house oversight of homeland security these entities and witnesses recommendations varied but their variety offers the house wealth of persp ectives to draw on re lated to congressional executive relations building knowledge of homeland security policy issues among members and other aspects of congressi onal handling of the issue of homeland security specific recommendation of the 9 11 commission and other entities was creation of homeland security committee in each chamber in addition number of witnesses at the house subcommittee hearings recommended homeland security committee in the house and made recommendations related to jurisdiction membership and other factors it is complex question however to take the recommendations of the 911 commission and other entities and of witnesses at the house subcommittee hearings and determine the potentia l meaning and scope of homeland security in considering committee jurisdictions one difficulty lies in trying to narrow the term to focus solely on the homeland within the united states as reflected in this statement from the 911 commission report america in the postcold war world stood out as an object for admiration envy and blame this created kind of cultural asymmetry to us afghanistan seemed very far away to members of qaeda america seemed very close in sense they were more globalized than we were3 homeland security begins w ith counterterrorism and ot her initiatives overseas and it includes intelligence activities at home and abroad that can help prevent terrorist attacks in the 911 commission recommendations those of other entities and those of some hearings witnesses homeland security is continuum of international and domestic initiatives and activities all of which are essential to reducing the likelihood and potential impact of terrorist attacks against the united states another difficulty lies is the connectedne ss of homeland security to other policy areas for transportation policy agricultural policy public health policy trade policy and

subcommittee28 chairman mica explained the congressional environment the problem has never been lack of focus or interest by the standing committees rather the missing ingredient was national consensus that terrorism should be top priority congress as whole reflected the national will and has been unable to make the tough choices terrorism required and that we know is part of our history unfortunately today 911 changed that and within days or few weeks the standing committees had legislation ready29 future development of the department of homeland security witnesses testified on the

quite simple it means that you will not be helping this new department to become more unified on the mission of hom eland security that the agencies that go into that department will continue mo re than is necessary to focus on their historic function and it will tend to preserve the existing cultures of those agencies and on the other hand all of us have responsibility for homeland security any failure on the part of the united states to bring these agencies into an effective whole is going to be noticed and xploited by those who wish the country harm30 secretary schlesinger31 and congressional scholar norm an ornstein testified that fragmentation of committee jurisdiction over homeland security harmed development of the department dr ornstein suggested cause and effect relationship the problem with fragmentation otherwise is once again just exactly what we had before we ended up with departme nt of homeland security which is all these other committees have longtime in terest in their own cultures built around the old functions of these agencies and th ey are going to use their resources and their pressure to push those functions which are appropriate functions but if we dont have counterweight to make sure that the homeland security culture takes over then they are going to have even greater problems inside the department making things work32 government reform committee chairman tom davis testified on the importance of congresss work related to dhs because the success of the department is vital to the continuing economic recovery and winning the war on terrorism we all want it to succeed congress must provide the department with the proper resources while at the same time maintaining aggressive oversight to ensu re that this massive reorganization and commitment of resources succeeds33 conduct of oversight public witnesses regula rly mentioned the number of committees and subcommittees with legislative and oversight jurisdiction over dhs and the policy area of homeland security as challenge to the development of coherent homeland security policy the chairs and ranking members drew on their experience in congress to speak

that agencies report to more than one committee and function effectively39 like representative dingell ranking member waxman of the government reform committee expressed the view that oversight by

hearings and requests from the numerous committees and subcommittees with jurisdiction over the department and the policy area of homeland security some committee chairs and ranking members addr essed this concern in different ways former secretary schlesinger reported spending half of his time as secretary of energy on capitol hill dealing with one problem or another he indicated the number of

make significantcontribution to the implementation of the department of homeland security simply by simplifying these overlapping committee structures 43 representative dingell drew on his experience as member during the energy shortages of the 1970s to pr esent another perspective i went through the energy crisis in th 1970s and i have gone through number of other problems of similar character and i never found that there was anything other than benefit to be achieved by having large number of committees viewing these questions from the sta ndpoint of their own experience and expertise and i would say that this happened very much during the time of the 1970s when the energy administrator or the chairmen of the regulatory bodies or later the head of the department of energy would come up to report to different committees about how they were conducting their business44 executivelegislative balance several public w itnesses discussed standing homeland security committee in terms of congress being able to perform its legislative and oversight role effectively following the reorganization of the executive branch to create dhs for example congressional scholar david king testified now it is fact that we have dhs and it is fact that there is now tremendous imbalance between the executiv branch and the legislative branch and the congress must catch up i am afraid that some of the people who will oppose the single standing committee of jurisdiction here are still in their minds back in the days before there was department of homeland security trying to keep those clientalistic relationships that existed before th fragmentation is tr emendously debilitating and congress as an institution must step up to the plate and far too many members of congress and certainly people in the executive branch forget that article i is about c ongress the most important branch as far as i am concerned in the government and it needs to be on equal footing with the department of homeland security through single permanent committee45httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs13 46 homeland security jurisdiction the perspectives of committee leaders march 24 2004 p 54 47 hearing on perspectives

committee chairs and ranking members health and human services whose cabine t secretary has already testified before my committee on budget priorities and policy issues also is subject to the budget committee the ways and means committee obviously the appropriations committee the government reform comm ittee so they are going to multiple committees the environmental protecti on agency which is one of the major agencies that we have jurisdiction over they also have to report to the transportation committee again the appropriations committee agriculture committee the government reform committee and the science committee the department of energy in addition to being responsible to the energy and commerce committee has issues for armed services government reform science appropriations resources so most of the cabinet agencies do report to multiple congressional committees and i dont see why homeland security should be any different especia lly if we are doing our job46 committee overlap vs committee expertise in indicating his support for new homeland security committee former speaker foley expressed view that was made by the public witnesses i think there is the problem that otherwise than having new committee with this diverse universe of subcommittees and committees 13 committees 88 subcommittees majority of the committees of the house majority of the subcommittees of the house i am told almost rather clear the majority of the members of the house have some connection with one of these subcommittees or committees that would otherwise have jurisdiction so there is not only need to bring some focus and scope to the oversight function but there is critical need to avoid the distraction of members of this new department from having to respond day by day to dozens and dozens of different requests for testimony and that is predictable47 former representative walker provided an example from his experience as member and chair of the science committee where jurisdiction over the energy policy area was shared with the energy and commerce committee he stated those jurisdictional arguments often nded up with nonaction in that area48

concerned with both intentional and unintentional threats to us agriculture and provided an example of oversight in working with dhs to overturn decision to eliminate agricultural inspectors and assign their duties to customs and bord er protection officers who would lack needed expertise to protect against agricultural threats50 aviation subcommittee chairman mica and transportation and infrastructure committee ranking member oberstar discussed the importance of the expertise resident in their committee in policymaking for example representative mica stated it should be surprise that thoroug h understanding of the aviation system is required to produce effective aviation security legislation the aviation system is based on careful balance of highly complex regulations procedures infrastructure engineering and this system in fact has produced the worlds safest aviation industry preserving that balance is impossible without the expertise that comes from working on these issues for years51 competing interests congressional scholar norman ornstein52 and former representative hamilton supported their r ecommendations for homeland security committee by pointing out the need for congressional leadership in helping culture of homeland security to take root in th new department representative hamiltons prepared statement explained dhs was created so that 22 agencies of the federal government would reorient their purpose and organization towards the mission of protecting the homeland dhs is intended to embody common mission and culture indeed the vital goal of

the hill of these different standing committees that have their traditions and their powers nd unless we effectively deal with that the components of the department will not be able to focus on the newer problems of homeland security those components will continue to respond to the older standing committees and their interests54 in their testimony committee chairs and ranking members identified their concerns with changes to the committee system that might sever components of existing jurisdiction for example j udiciary committee chairman sensenbrenner discussed law enforcement and civil liberties as related policy concerns in his committee there is more to law enforcement and training than just security there is an important balancing to be done between security and civil liberties it is dangerous to put that balancing task in committee the primary focus of which is security i fear that civil liberties interest will be sacrificed55 with regard to the committees jurisdiction over immigration chairman sensenbrenner pointed out that immigration is within the jurisdiction of four departments and stated although countering the terrorist threat is of significant importance in implementing our immigration laws it is certainly not the only issue rather immigration involves much more than homeland security reuniting families providing needed workers for american businesses offering havens to refugees and deporting those aliens who have broken our laws56 ways and means committee chairman bill thomas discussed the conflict between security and commerce what has occurred in terms of the coordination of activities at the border i think was overdue and it probably took crisis such as this to require the rethinking and the integration of those border

threat to say port or an airport woul d require it to be shut down oftentimes is on the teetertotter between public secur ity and freedom those people who have security in their title hastily move to make sure that the place is secure57 the committees records several committee chairs and ranking members discussed the records of their committees in holding hearings and reporting legislation related to homeland security for example energy and commerce committee chairman barton submitted list of homeland security accomplishments with his prepar ed statement in oral testimony he gave examples of the committees work for example the energy and commerce committee has jurisdiction for security at commercial nuclear power plants everybody regardless of where your committee is agrees that securing these facilities from terrorist attack or any kind of attack is very good idea the conference report on hr 6 the comprehensive energy bill contains very strong new requirements in that respect these requirements were developed in our committee on bipartisan basis58 representative mica chairman of the aviation subcommittee provided the rules subcommittee with statement by transportation and infrastructure committee chairman young which listed that committees counterterrorism and homeland security legislation beginning in 1989 representative mica testified back in 1990 we mandated background checks for aviation personnel began deploying bomb detection devices at our airports we built fema which helped new york and washington respond to 911 and much of the rest of the country we created tsa fortified cockpit doors armed pilots put marshals back in the sky developed whole hos t of comprehensive approaches not only to aviation but also to transportation security we established the aviation industry passed the maritime security act and created port security grants59 government reform committee chairman davis stated his committee maintained an aggressive posture when it comes

or broadly of the policy area former secretary schles inger responded as follows to question about mission for the department that might be selected from continuum of possibilities well i think the department has in the presidents message on national strategy indicated that what we must do is to anticipate through intelligence possible attacks on the united states to re spond to such attacks as quickly as we can and to mitigate the consequences of those attacks and that is why we have responded it is at the one pole of the continuum that you mentioned at the outset which was you know to inform local governments those local governments will need help and only the united states the federal government can provide that help if we have nuclear detonation in some place in the united states the local authorities will be overwhelmed and we must have an entity that has thought through that problem and will bring to bear the resources of the federal government to help those local gove rnments it is not just warning63 in later hearing former speaker gi ngrich responded to question about the role of the department it is first intelligence and prevention i think you put your finger on the key part can we block something bad from happening defensively inside our own country second ensuring that the capability exists for response recovery and rehabilitation setting the standards and

as an ex officio member of the rules subcommittee select committee on homeland security chairman cox ex pressed his concern over keeping dhs focused on its mission which he summarized as follows first to protect second to prevent and third to respond those three must it seems to define the department and thus the jurisdiction of any committee that oversees it to the exclusion of all else66 options suggested witnesses suggested number of options for new committee on homeland security some witnesses opposed some possible jurisdictional arrangements for such committee homeland security committee built incrementally congressional scholars ornstein and thomas mann test ified jointly they suggested moving gradually or incre mentally and strategically in creating permanent standing committee with several areas of jurisdic tion they warned that new committee with substantial jurisdiction that take s away from other committees at once would fail in addition there would need to be coordination and shar ed jurisdiction since there were nonhomeland security functions included in dhs and functions that were closely related to homeland security outsi of the department they suggested creative

consolidating committee jurisdiction over dhs as helpful to the new department comme nting favorably on creating standing committee69 he also called it useful to give the committee both oversight and legislative authority70 homeland security committee in response to question regarding possible benefits to not having homeland security committee dr mann responded i think there are arguments one of them is that the house since 1974 has figured out way to live with and cope with jurisdictional sprawl that the leadership working through the parliame ntarians office has developed strategies of joint and sequential referral of special rules of scheduling in ways that allow them the leadership to pull the expertise from various committees and subcommittees together in coherent pieces of legislation in doing so you dont disrupt existing patterns of expertise of historical memory of staffing that you retain some capacity for alternative pe rspectives on similar problems that you set up some competition between teams of members who might see things differently all those are advantages in letting the current system go forward as it is71 transfer jurisdiction over dhs to homeland security committee dr thurber was specific in his recommendation to create permanent standing committee on homeland security in house rule x with jurisdiction directly related to the agencies of dhs and generally to the mission of reducing the threat to homeland security he noted that there are agencies outside of dhs that deal with homeland security that the new committee needed an oversight and coordination relationship with those activities and that coordination would be needed with other committees in order to develop comprehensive policy making approach to homeland security dr thurber favored shared committee jurisdiction with primary and secondary res ponsibilities for the functions of the entities in dhs that are not related to homeland security he recommended the jurisdictions of other committees over dhs agencies be transfe rred to the new committee finally dr thurber recommended that the membership of the new committee include members from committees losing jurisdiction

vividly we must be able to handle wide variety of threats130 in each of its reports the gilmore commission among several commissions and other entities addressed two additional major topics enmeshed in homeland security the topics were protecting civil liberties and empowering state and local government with regard to civil liberties the commissions report stated rather than the traditional portrayal of security and civil liberties as competing values that must be weighed on opposite ends of balance these values should be recognized as mutually reinforcing under this framework counterterrorism initiatives would be evaluated in terms of how well they preserve all of the unalienable rights that are essential to the strength and security of our nation life liberty and the pursuit of happiness while these fundamental rights are cited in our declaration of independence and imbedded in our constitution they should not be confused with privilege s which may be imposed upon to protect national security however even privileges should not be imposed upon lightly they are fundamental to our quality of lif for example the opportunity to fly may be viewed as privilege rather than right but overly stringent and arbitrary security measures not only ve an economic impact but could also increase public skepticism about security measures generally131 regarding the states and localities the commission stated to achieve truly national strategy the federal government must empower states and local governments by providin g clear definition of preparedness and strategic plan and process to implemen t the objectives of longerterm vision across the entire spectrum from awareness through recovery officials at the federal level should lead the development of an enterprise architecture to institutionalize intelligence and informati on sharing risk assessments better integrated planning and training and ffective requirements generation in close coordination with state

earlier in the commissions second annual report as part of that process the joint or each separate committee should develop consolidated legislative plan including authorizin g language and

the constr uction of world balanced between the expansion of freedom and the ma intenance of underlying stability137 finally the commission recommended extensive changes in institutional arrangements and policies in the executive and legislative branch it found the problem is that the current structures and processes of us national security policymaking are incapable of such management of the opportun ities and dangers in implementing the recommended strategy138 the hartrudman commission summarized its proposal for us national security strategy as follows we believe that american strategy must compose balance between two key aims the first is to reap the benefits of more integrated world in order to expand freedom security and prosperity for americans and for others but second american strategy must also strive to dampen the forces of global instability so that those benefits can endure and spread139 the commission stated six objectives that underlie this strategy first to defend the united states and ensure that it is safe from the dangers of new era second to maintain americas social cohesion economiccompetitiveness technological ingenuity and military strength third to

the other steps taken after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001148 the 2003 preface concluded with summary of the unmet homeland security needs that suggested the scope of homeland security as the brookings scholars perceived it the first priority relates to resources congress and the president enacted an inadequate level of funding in 2003 for homeland security in addition to rectifying that problem they need to turn promptly to the 2004 budget and redress vulnerabilities not yet given suffici ent priority these include the use of information technology where federal funding to date

organizational and ma nagerial abilities particularly in areas such as infrastructure protection where whole new capacities need to be created and where little has been accomplished to da despite the

department were ge nerally contained in an ergy and water appropriations bill which through 1978 had been called public works appropria tions bill and in an interior appropriations bill other committees retained other energyrelated jurisdiction166 this arrangement was in part due to the retention of energy programs in other departments after the crea tion of the department of energy conclusion the house has tended to continue its committee organization following congressional creation of new department or ma jor reorganization in the executive branch in action after creation of the department of energy the house established the energy and commerce committee as the lead energy policy committee but it also continued jurisdictional structure that gave other committees role in

other commi ssions and think tanks define homeland security to be continuum of international and domestic initiatives and activities all of which have role reduc ing the likelihood and potential impact of terrorist attack against the united states the themes behind these initiatives and activities include disabling terrorists overseas winning friends in isla mic and other countries counterterrorism and homeland secur ity as the principle and purpose of american diplomatic and military strategy good intelligence abroad and at hom shared appropriately within the federal government and between the federal government and state and local governments and the private sector commitment abroad and at home to freedom and civil liberties maintaining national strategy for homeland

security recommended the creation of permanent homeland security committee that would have jurisdiction over domestic components of homeland security re porting to the house rules committee on september 30 2004 as required by hres 5168 that jurisdiction in itself is wide ranging and requires expertise in large number of policy areas including intelligence analysis public health border control transportation security first responders information technology prot ection of critical infrastructure and homeland securityrelated re search among other policy areas the recommendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs47 jurisdiction includes dhs and presumably the national strategy issued by the president in 2002 and any changes to that strategy among many policy areas the select committees recommendation would leave jurisdiction over the intelligence community principally in the jurisdiction of the permanent select co mmittee on in telligence the federal bureau of investigation fbi in the jurisdiction of the judici ary committee the armed forces in the jurisdiction of the armed services committee relations with foreign nations in the jurisdiction of the intern ational relations committee and money laundering and other financial arrangements in the jurisdiction of the financial services committee in addition the policyarea ju risdiction of the proposed co mmittee could overlap with the policyarea jurisdictions of other committees so for example legislation dealing with information technology or public health might be within the jurisdiction of the homeland security committee the energy and commerce committee and possibly other committees overlaps in some areas such as with the agriculture committee on border issues and with the science committee on research and development were not addressed in the select committees recommendations under the select committees recommendations activities within dhs that are not homelandsecurityrelate d would remain within the jurisdiction of standing committees already having jurisdiction for example the nonhomelandsecurity missions of the coast guard and natural disaster preparedne ss and response would remain under the jurisdiction of the tran sportation and infrastructure committee the revenue functions of the cu stoms service would remain under the jurisdiction of the ways and means committee and immigration and naturalization policy that is not related to homeland security would remain under the jurisdiction of the judiciary committee the select committees recommendations would also leave jurisdiction over appropriations in the appropriations committee as men tioned above the appropriations committees in each chamber realigned their subcommittees to create one subcommittee that parallels the programs and entities of dhs which leaves funding decisions for other homeland securityrelated prog rams and agencies in the jurisdiction of other appropriations subcommittees however discussion of subcommittee jurisdiction over intelligence appropriations could lead to further realignment concentration or dispersal of homeland security jurisdiction the 911 commission and the other commissi ons and think tanks recommended alternative committee arrangements joint committee an authorizing committee in each chamber of congress or combin ed authorizationa ppropriation committee in each chamber that would have jurisdic tion over homeland security as the 911 commission explained its recommendation in or der to achieve unity of effort the recommendations for

security21st century p 26 the department would have the best chance of developing with clear lines of authority in congress as the 911 commission stated through not more than one authorizing committee and one appropriating subcommittee in each house congress should be able to ask the secretary of homeland security whether he or she has the resources to provide reasonable security against major terrorist acts w ithin the united states and to hold the secretary accountable for the departments performance169 or as the select committee stated in its recommendations the current diffused and unfocused congressional jurisdiction over the department of homeland security and hom eland security in general not only imposes extraordinary burdens on the department but makes it far more difficult for the congress to guide the departments activities in consistent and focused way that promotes integration and eliminates programmatic redundancies and advances implementation of coherent national homeland security strategy170 the commissions that made recommendations prior to the presidents proposal to create dhs recommended consolidation of committee jurisdictions so that the house and senate could oversee national strategy rather th an have separate committees pursue separate interests some of the commissions and think tanks were explicit in their desire to ensure that the executive was accountable to c ongress for its management of homeland security as the hartrudman commission stated solving the homeland security challenge is not just an executive branch problem congress should be an active participant in the development of homeland security programs as well its hearings can help develop the best ideas and solutions individual members s hould develop expertise in homeland security policy and its implementation so that they can fill in policy gaps and provide needed oversight and advice in times of crisis most important using its power of the purse congress should ensu re that government agencies have sufficient resources and that their prog rams are coordinated efficient and effective171 the select committee took this perspective step further in arguing that it was essential for congress to reorganize its committees in order to exercise its role in homeland security policymaking stating terrorism is now firstorder priority in congress the executive branch and among the american people global terro rism is recognized as fundamental threat to our people territory and way of life for the foreseeable future thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs49 172

reform committees and the executive branch july 10 2003 p 33executive branch has been reconfigured in light of that reality congress however has not the result has been uncoordinated oversight and conflicting legislative guidance effecting tacit enhancement of executive branch authority over homeland security policy programs and activities congress must in short fundamentally reform itself or become largely irrelevant where homeland security matters are concerned172 in testimony before the select committees rules subcommittee several witnesses explained in conc rete terms what they belie ved congress would gain from committee reorganization enabling it in turn to better exercise its policymaking role for example for representative hamilton testified real congressional expertise on homeland security will come about better i think if you have permanent committee my guess is that everybody on the select committee has learned an awful t about homeland security in the last few months lot more than they knew when they began work on that committee that is the strength of the congress developing expertise on difficult subject and this is one of the key reasons why you should have permanent committee there is substitute for expertise focuse d on the task at hand and i think then expertise has to be cultivated it has to be developed you have got so many other things that demand your attention and serving on the committee will make you focus on it and make you do the job of oversight and will develop expertise that the congress badly needs but more important it will develop the expertise that is critical for the operation of the department itself the executive branch173 on this same point congre ssional scholar wolfensberger testified about an obstacle to developing new expertise in the current committee alignment both branches are still wedded to traditional pre911 arrangements and relationships internally and with thei r counterparts in the other branch what some have referred to in the past as the iron triangle of subcommittees agencies and their private and public sector clienteles you need separate committee that is willing to set new course and way of doing things exercise tough oversight employ innovative thinking and exert constant pressure on the new department to set the right priorities and pursue them rigorously174 however the house has made different decisions in different situations regarding the organization of its committees to oversee policy area or even cabinet department if the house were to organize permanent homeland security committee it could do so in way that allowed more committee and member participation in the formulation of homel and security policy or that allowed integration of homeland

consistent with number of past decisions on committee jurisdiction over partment or agency or policy area or components of policy area175 as described in previous secti on the house has tended not to follow reorganization in the executive branch with reorganization of house committees creation of the armed services committee occurred from merger of two committees and preceded reorganization of what became the department of defense by one congress while the armed services committee seems to represent the kind of unity of effort in committee organization sought by the 911 commission the committees creation occurred within the context of the legislative reorganization act of 1946 under which virtually the whol house and senate committee structure was reorganized the new committees jurisdiction was also distinct from the jurisdictions of the other co mmittees organized under the act the houses renaming of the interstate and foreign committee as the energy and commerce committee and the designation of that committee as the houses lead committee on energy occurred three years after the creation of the department of energy following review of committee ju risdiction this review is described further below the designation was accomplished in the same house resolution that enhanced the energy research jurisdiction of what is now the science committee and the jurisdiction of what is now th transportation and infrastructure committee evolved only incrementally over number of years after the creation of the department of transportation the house has also chosen not to concen trate all aspects of policy area in single committee choosing instead openness and differing policy perspectives for example the education and the workforce committee has jurisdiction over education or labor generally176 but jurisdiction over the education of veterans is vested in the veterans affairs committ ee over mining schools in the resources committee over international education in the international relations committee and over agricultural colleges in the agriculture committee177 jurisdiction over the federal civil service is vested in the government reform committee and over transportation labor in the transportation and infrastructure committee178 although the government reform committee has jurisdiction over the federal civil service the armed services committee

house has also tended to choose disper sal of at least components of policy area rather than concentration in one committee with very large exceptions such as appropriations and with regard to ta xation ways and means the house might choose such an arrangement to overcome committees bias in fa vor of department or agency and too much deference to it too close an alignment of committee department or agency and interest groups or too centrated power over policy area due in part to dissatisfaction in the 1970s with the armed services committees and other committees conduct of intelligence oversight the house created what ultimately became the pe rmanent select committee on intelligence180 the house abolished the joint committee on atomic energy in 1977 dispersing its jurisdiction to several committees by th 1970s public health and environmental concerns were part of the policy debate over nuclear ener gys future and the joint committee was criticized for its closen ess to the nuclear power industry181 the house has also chosen to redistribute committees jurisdiction when it has perceived that the jurisdiction is too broad that components of the jurisdiction are closely related to the jurisdiction of another committee or that redistribution of jurisdiction would better distribute house committees workload for example in adopting rules for the 104th congress the house redistri buted specific parts of the energy and commerce committees jurisdiction to three other standing committees182 nonetheless the house cleared up what might have been perceived as duplication of the work of the standing committees by abolishing four select committees in the 103rd congress and what might have been perceived as committees with redundant or too narrow jurisdiction by abolishing three standing committees in the 104th congress183 it also over the course of four congresses transferred jurisdiction over several financial services policy areas to what is now the financial services committee from the energy and commerce committee in recognition ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs52 184 ibid p 3changes in the financial services s ector of the domestic and global economy184 since world war ii however the house has not done what the select committee has recommended with regard to homeland security jurisdiction create new committee and curtail the jurisdiction of existing standing committees if the house were to create permanent homeland security committee considerations in addition to the importan ce of homeland security might affect the design of the committee in its creation or in implementation of the houses decision if selected jurisdictions of existing standing committee were to be curtailed or taken away the house could lose the expertise of members and staff serving or working on those committees and the house might value shared jurisdiction allowing broader range of expertise among its committees rather than expertise largely residing in one committee shared jurisdiction could arguably enhance the integration of homelandsecurityrelated initiatives into the broader policy areas of which they are part such as immigra tion transportation modes and systems federally supported rd or international commerce while possibly creating lead committee on homeland security the house might desire having more than one committee serve as watchdog of the new department and bring different perspectives of committees and the members who serve on them to bear on homeland security policymaking for example even in designating the energy and commerce committee as the houses lead committee on energy policy important components of ergy policy were left or placed in the jurisdiction of other committees while such an arrangement might arguably make it more difficult to legislate in policy area at the committee level the arrangement can provide an incentive for larger num ber of members to become knowledgeable about policymaking related to that area indeed one consequence of number of members having waivers from the house rule limiting members to service on two standing committees is to give many members broader role in policymaking at the committee level more dispersed jurisdiction could so provide additional access to congress for whistleblowers alternative forums that might be more receptive to critical reviews or the conduct of oversight or alternative forums for competing views contributing to more robust policymaking implications of jurisdictional gains and losses despite the houses predilection for multiple perspectives being brought to bear on policy problems and the desire it manifested in the 103rd and 104th congresses to reduce the number of house committees the policy area of homeland security seems to be something new remarkably the legislative reorgani zation act of 1946 perhaps due to the broadness and flexibility of the subject terms employed anticipated many policy problems and the role the federal government would come to play in policy setting and funding through congressional author ization cabinet partments could be created and policy problems acted on nd

security as new policy problem is the energy crises of the 1970s some members then perceived need for jurisdictional changes in house committees following the creation of the department of energy and the house eventually created select committee to study committee jurisdiction and other matters including jurisdiction over energy policy and to develop recommendations in addition subcommittees had proliferated in the 1970s and some 83 house committees and s ubcommittees were be lieved to have jurisdictional claim over energy policy the select committee recommended the creation of an energy committee however the house instead by vote affirmed the interstate and foreign commerce committees lead role in energy policy and then agreed to the changes th at were described above185 are the energy crises analogous to the terrorist attacks of 911 that brought homeland security into focus some have at least tacitly said in distinguishing the houses decision to reduce the numbe r of standing committees in 1994 from his favoring new permanent homeland security committee former speaker gingrich testified as follows this is the only potential standing committee which really has the defensive obligation that could involve millions of lives and for the house to have not some centralized authority monitoring the department of homeland security and creating an effective secure relationship i think would be an enormous mistake and one which literally could over the next decade result in us having tragic loss dramatically greater than september 11 this is an unusual case i dont think you are going to see come up here and testify about new standing committees but this is very unusual moment in our history186 in distinguishing the longterm problem of terrorism from previous challenges the united states has faced former secretary schlesinger testified as follows we now face different kind of crisis it is not question of responding to pearl harbor and four years later accepting the surrender of japan in tokyo bay terrorism is the tool of the weak and the terrorists are likely always to be with us we must lower their capacity to inflict damage if we fail to lower that capacity to inflict damage this society w ill begin to change it is democracy but if you begin to contemplate the ps ychological reaction of the public seeing biological attack in

on house reform committees and the executive branch july 10 2003 p 21 188 ibid p 11 189 ibid p 24and that is what the department of homeland security is about that is the legislation that you passed and now you are called upon to make it effective187 the commissions and think tanks also scribed the gravity of the terrorist threat and its longterm nature and the critical importance of national strategy in response and its implementation former secretary schlesinger also contrasted the department of energy with the department of home land security and the needs of diverse new department stating creating the department of energy was childs play compared to creating this new department simply because the bulk of the resources came from one previously existing agency some of th responsibilities particularly in the area of price controls were shed over th course of the next three years and as result we have compact relatively compact department what we have here is set of agen cies brought together that have long tradition customs service the coast guard and newly formed agencies that have not completely jelled like the transportation security administration these must be helped along so that th disparate cultures of these agencies can be brought together188 later secretary schlesinge r stated his concerns about the impact on dhss future of fragmentation among congressional committees you subcommittee member talked about what essentially was fragmentation if the 88 committees of some jurisdiction in the congress are dealing with the department of home land security they cannot successfully achieve that common mission of protecting the homeland thus it will wind up that some committees some committee mbers some staffs will say to that department of homeland security unl ess you do x unless you give us this response we are going to take it out on the department and you will have fragmentation that will be pulling the depart ment apart it will be responding to the fragmentation that would continue to exist on capitol hill and as consequence i think that if you are going to achieve the results that everybody wants they may disagree in retrospect about what should have been put in the department but the result that everybody wants that this department be successful because it is the umbrella that protects the society then we must have greater degree of unity on the hill as well as in the executive branch the executive branch will continue to fragment if the hill remains fragmented189httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs55 190 ibid p 45 191 homeland security jurisdiction the perspectives of committee leaders march 24 2004 p 117 192 ibid p 45congressional scholar king made similar point the fragmentation is tremendously debilitating to dhs190 the question for many committee leaders and presumably some number of house members is how to reconcile the ne w and perhaps overriding national security purpose of homeland security with existing programs and policie s can the house disambiguate the homeland security com ponents of threats to agriculture nuclear plants transportation modes ports inform ation technology or public health or of management of immigrati on emergency response or the coast guard from the individual policy systems governing animal nd plant health nuclear plant safety and security transportati on regulation and so on ways and means committee chairman bill thomas explained this concern in relation to traditional customs functions and international trade stating i am very concerned about losing the knowledge and the ability in continually growing complicated area of intercourse it is not brightlighted it is not big area but boy is it necessary to function smoothly as the worlds largest importer and the worlds largest exporter the point at which those activities occur have to be allowed to go forward in very smooth and efficient manner with the full understanding of the concerns of security today different than previously that we are more than willing to take into c onsideration on negotiated basis with treasury retraining the structure that it has with the ability to consult and make adjustments that is where we are t oday that arrangement seems reasonable to but if the option of permanent committee on homeland security is to take jurisdiction from other committees and put it together under the rubric of security and expect for example the customs fees and duty collection function to continue would be rather naive they would be submitted to security restrictions which i think would make it virtually impossible for them to do their historic job191 as noted in the section above related to the select committees rules subcommittees hearings other committee leaders also discussed this problem for example energy and commerce committee chairman barton mentioned the nuclear plant safety provisions in the energy bill and asked in his testimony how do you distinguish the need to keep our nuclear pl ants secure from terro rism versus the need to secure them against sabotage or so mething done by former disgruntled employee192 number of committee leaders also pointed to the legislative and oversight accomplishments of their committees related to homeland security some predating 911 and many in response to the terrorist attacks aviation subcommittee chairman mica and transportation and infrastructure committee ranking member oberstarhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs56 193 ibid p 48 194 ibid p 32discussed aviation security list was included in the statement submitted by committee chairman don young ener gy and commerce committee chairman barton listed the committees accomplishments in both his oral and written testimony judiciary committee chairman sensenbrenner and government reform committee chairman tom davis and ranking member waxman also detailed the work of their committees energy and commerce committee ranking member dingell explained this perspective i would note that the standing committees have taken their responsibilities as seriously as have you ladies and gentlemen here members of the select committee and we have moved cooperatively with you and with the others who are concerned with these matters of hom eland security and with each other to see to it that we have accomplished the legislative purposes that were needed193 the committee leaders also noted the expertise of their committee members and staff and expressed the valu of different perspectives being brought to bear on policy problems agriculture committee ch airman goodlatte and ranking member stenholm asked how one committee could gain the expertise to oversee an enterprise as large and diverse as dhs chairman goodlatte stated mr chairman with nearly 170000 employees and countless missions and responsibilities the function of the department of homeland security lends itself to functionally diverse oversight mechan ism i cannot see how single standing committee with normal staff can ever amass the expertise necessary to completely properly oversee this new department the congress has constitutional responsibility to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to review and analyze each of our federal programs single standing committee on homeland security would have great difficulty in fulfilling this responsibility194 transportation and infrastructure committee ranking member oberstar spoke about his committees expertise in aviation and asked that that expertise be used to deal with policy problems and their oversight secretary mineta has said he wants world class security with world class service how to get there i think our committee understands how to do that we have contributed great deal fo time to the deliberation of these issues and while we might start out with differing viewpoi nts we generally come to consensus position on the underlying legislation and then work to ensure that it is well carried out so i urge this committee the select committees rules subcommittee to keep in mind this body of expertise that not only ours but other authorizing committees standing committees have in matters such as the one you are considering and more importantly the in terrelationship with other functions of these departments and agencies that are not security but may have relationship to security and let us conti nue to attend to the needs and craft the legislation and shape the future missions of these agencies in way that will behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs57 195 ibid p 81 196 ibid pp 8991supportive of security but also respectful of the historic functions of say coast guard aviation fema and our maritime system195 at several points during the hearings select committee chairman cox sitting as member of the rules subcommittee provided perspective on the mission of dhs and homeland security committee overseeing it that distinguished the departments homeland security mission and the committees potential jurisdiction from the work and jurisdiction of other standing committees his perspective reflected the definitions of homeland security contained in the homeland security act in an exchange involving jurisdiction over aviation security chairman cox explained you have got department of homeland security that is focused on prevention protection and response and is not going to become the regulator of every aspect of american life it is not going to become the regulator of every aspect of american commerce but as i have said before other panels have testified today i think there is risk the department could morph into those things and that is one of the reasons that we want very very strenuous oversight from the congress that created it so recently because if the department which surely is going to exist indefinitely the new cabinet department history suggests they dont go away is going to gr ow and if it is going to grow and last indefinitely then it needs to stay focused and it needs to stay focused on protecting americans and our security and not get into all these other areas and we will lost our competitiveness in all these indust ries if we regulate them not with view to the big picture which includes competition of global commerce job creation investment in the case of tran sportation safety and all these other things if we have on the blinders of security and that is all and then we become we the department of homeland security in this case become the regulators of all these industries then the regulation w ill suffer the industr ies will suffer the country will suffer and it wont work so i think that dichotomy between the traditional functional responsibilities of the standing committees and the role of dhs in prevention protection and response makes great deal of sense and its is just as important that we circ umscribe the mission of the department of homeland security as it is that we resp ect the traditional jurisdictions of the committees196 former speaker gingrich as cited ear lier responded similarly when asked question about committee organization i think the jurisdiction issue is actually fairly easy in principle the principle ought to be that this is missiondriven jurisdiction that is when there are questions of activities that are uniquely

ring our homeland pres erving our liberty fifth annual report to the president and the congress december 15 2003 p 3recovery rehabilitation this committee ought to have either sole or lead jurisdiction197 and statement of the gilmore commi ssion cited previously could be read as consistent with chairman coxs ex planation the commission emphasized that its strategic vision for homeland security wa s fully consistent with an allhazards approach in other words component of the larger and prevailing emergency management system the commission noted as our experience with sars west nile virus monkeypox the recent fires in california and the current influenza ep idemic have demonstrated vividly we must be able to handle wide variety of threats198 former senior analyst at the congressional research service walter kravitz described the legislative process in congress as procedural obstacle course under the constitution both houses of congre ss and the president must agree to the same legislation under th rules and practices of each chamber leaders support must be garnered and major ities assembled at each stage of the legislative process subcommittee committee floor to advance legislation or prevent its derailment referral of measure in the house to one committee or to more than one committee based on jurisdiction can be looked at from different perspectives if measure is referred to just one committee major ity on that committee can control the committee phase if measure is referred to more than one committee the control of single committee is lost but the suppor t of members from multiple committees is gained if each committee reports the legisl ation whether one committee or several committees report measure majority must still be assembled on the floor the rules and practices of the house and senate and the requirements of the constitution make it difficult to pass measure and enact it into law if the house were to organize permanent homeland security committee would homeland security committee created in way that curtails or takes away jurisdiction from existing standing committees shift intercommittee negotiations from the committee phase to the postreportingprefloor phase might the leadership or the house rules committee or party entities or combination of these groups be called on to negotiate base text or substitute am endments or other changes to any measure reported from the new committee the existing standing committees have expertise and decades of experience with the policy problems of which security is now component and their continue d involvement in the development of legislation that affects their traditional jurisdiction is possibility their leverage lies in the legislative process witnesses at the select committees subcommittee hearings offered variety of options that the house could consider at the time of the creation of homeland security committee or over the course of one or more congresses after its creationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs59 199 hearing on perspectives on house reform committees and the executive branch july 10 2003 p 38 200 hearing on perspectives on house reform former house leaders september 9 2003 p 29 201 see for example the statement of science committee chairman boehlert homeland security jurisdiction the perspectives of committee leaders march 24 2004 pp 118 119 for example several witnesses mentioned the tools at the speakers disposal to facilitate committee processing of homeland security legislation making referrals designating primary committee not designating primary committee making sequential referrals and setting time limits for action under referral are some of these tools these tools can be particularly effective where there is shared jurisdiction or measures provisions trigger the jurisdiction of more than one committee congressional scholars ornste in and mann suggested going slowly in building new committees jurisdiction adding to it over time they as well as others also commented on the use of committee assignments including members from existing standing committees of jurisdiction as way to build support for new committee congressional scholar king noted that committees build jurisdiction through such actions as bill referrals over jurisdicti onally ambiguous issues and that that jurisdiction is later validated in rules changes199 former speaker gingrich discussed the concept of concurrent jurisdiction to allow the new committee to assert jurisdiction when future problems impinge on homeland security200 some witnesses discussed oversight jurisdiction by which committee can be granted under house rules broader or different jurisdiction from the committees legislative jurisdiction even in system of shared jurisdiction jurisdictional changes could be effected that limit the number of committees with jurisdiction over function or directorate of dhs201 would homeland security committee be enough the select committees recommendations related to jurisdiction cover many domestic components of homeland security those sp ecifically part of dhs other domestic components and international components such as combating terrorism overseas are not specifically listed this fact was summari zed at the beginning of this section in recognition of the importance of counterte rrorism and homeland security number of witnesses at the select committees subcommittee hearings made suggestions for coordination among congressi onal committees in additi on common element among all commission and think tank reports was the need for coordination among congressional committees one matter cited in the hearings in the 911 commission report and in the select committees recommendations is perceived need for coordinating or reducing hearings appearances by dhs officials and perhaps other requests to dhs while some witnesses deemphasized this cern many witnesses deplored the number of requests from congressional committees for dhs hearings witnesses and other responses former speaker gingrich suggest ed that the house agree to resolution at the beginning of congress which instructs the executive branch on who has tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs60 202 hearing on perspectives on house reform former house leaders september 9 2003 p 12 203 ibid p 1718 204 hearing on perspectives on house

xxixxxx report where202 he also suggested that the leadership monitor dhs interactions with the house to prevent di version of dhss leadership203 some witnesses called for coordination of requests to dhs by the leadership or by successor to the select committee congressional scholar wolfensberger suggested that with regard to homeland security the oversight agen das adopted by the committees at the beginning of congress should be superi ntended by the bipartisan leadership204 another matter cited in several of th commission and think tank reports and by former speaker gingrich that would bene fit from coordination is review of the budget for counterterrorism and homeland security the reorganization of the appropriations committees subcommittees seemed to answer at least some of the concerns raised by the commissions and th ink tanks however speaker gingrich as noted earlier suggested the creation of homeland security subcommittee of the budget committee to ensure adequate resources for homeland security before considering any other budgetary matters205 finally creation of permanent homeland security committee with jurisdiction over dhs homeland security generally and related enumerated policy areas as the select committee recommended might not alone guarantee the policy coordination in congress over counterterrorism and homeland security that the various commissions think tanks and witnesses recommended the brookings institution scholars explained this concern as follows congress would be wise then to take to heart its message in the department of homeland security act and reorganize its jurisdictions to create authorizing committees for homeland security such reorganization would not produce unified decisionmaking process some fragmentation would remain as result of bicameralism and the twintrack authorization and appropriations process the task of coordinating the authorizers and appropriators on homeland security with those responsible for related activitie s by the intelligence agencies the fbi and the pentagon to name just few would also remain but establishing dedicated homeland security committees to complement the homeland security appropriations subcommittees would likely maximize the efficacy of congressional oversight206 emphasis added congressional scholar thurbe r addressed this concern in concrete manner in his testimony before the select committees subcommittee explaining the jurisdiction of the new committee shoul d also though take into account that most agencies dealing with homeland security are outside the dhs thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs61 207 hearing on perspectives on house reform committees and the executive branch july 10 2003 pp 2728 208 seeking national strategy concert for preserving security and promoting freedom the phase ii report of the us commissi on on national security21st century p 8agencies include the northern command and i am not recommending that they be in your committee homeland secur ity committee that the select committee might ultimately recommend creating but i just want to point out that there should be some relationship with these things the northern command the national guard the federal bureau of investigation the central intelligence agency the nsa national security agency the national imagery and mapping agency the centers for disease control we talked about the nrc nuclear regulatory commission before i have done lot of work with nrc and there is division there that deals with security there should be some relationship to that and the elements of the drug enforcement administration that deal with borders and many parts of the department of energy there should be some kind of oversight and coordination relationship with those activities in my opinion the new committee will need to strength coordination with other committees such as armed services judiciary and the permanent select committee on intelligence in order to develop in my opinion comprehensive policy making approach to homeland security207 one indication of the need for coordina tion arises from various assessments of what is important or critical to homela nd security for example the hartrudman commission stated nonproliferation of w eapons of mass destruction is of the highest priority in us national security policy in the next quarter century208 the armed services and international relations committees would be the forums for work on such an issue but homeland security committee would have policy interest in the issue if the house desired to increase coordi nation over homeland security within the united states or over homeland security and combating terrorism overseas the commissions thinks tanks and hearings w itnesses suggested options an option related to the design of permanent homeland security committee is assignment to the committee of members from other committees w ith related jurisdiction this option is variation on the assignments to the select committee in the 108th congress or the new committee itself could be assigned coordinating role the select committee on homeland security in the 107th congress had and the budget committee has coordinating role these and other coordinating roles could be examined several of the commissions suggested ad hoc committees of chairs and ranking members or other arrangements to bring together the principal members whose committees would have jurisdicti on over components of homeland security policy such an arrangement could be or ganized or led by the leadership and be formally or informally instituted incl uding being formally constituted under the speakers authority in rule xii nd as mentioned above congressional scholar wolfensberger suggested new use and increased management of committee oversight plans relatedly the role of the government reform committee to whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs62 committees submit their oversight plans could be enhanced with regard to plans related to homeland security conclusion if the house were to create permanent homeland security committee in the 109th congress the time after creation of the committee in the 109th congress and beyond would provide an opportunity for adjustments within the houses committee structure would homeland security committee better be able to guide development of the department of home land security hold its offici als accountable and keep it focused on its mission what could other committees contribute to the departments development and how could they contribute would new committee help make congress stronger institutional player in setting homeland security policy experience will help generate answers to these questions and better inform the house whether concentration of jurisdiction over the issue of homeland security is preferable to more dispersed jurisdictional structure particular challenge for new committee the existing standing committees and the house leadership is the relati onship of homeland security policy to non homelandsecurity policy can homeland s ecurity concerns be addressed separately from the existing policies and programs related to sectors of the economy like air transportation types of activ ities like trade or agencies with large nonhomeland security responsibilities like the coast gu ard or fema would the existing standing committees work with new committee in parallel to it or separately from it again experience could help answer stions raised about what homeland security committee could contribute to policymaking and how best to ensure that both homeland security and nonhomela ndsecurity missions and purposes are achieved finally homeland security committee has not been envisioned or proposed that would displace committees with jurisdiction over the intelligence community foreign relations the armed forces or other activities and entities that are important to realizing homeland security how could the legislative committees reduce further the fragmentation that is expected to be reduced with the creation of homeland security committee the period following the creation of homeland security committee would provide an opportunity to try different coordinating mechanismshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs63 209 rules of the house debate in the house congressional record

policy structural and programmatic gaps in americas homeland security caused by the separation of foreign from domestic intelligence the division of national secu rity and law enforcement information and activities nd the stovepiped and uncoordinated nature of our multiagency border and transportation secu rity systems since then congress and the president have collaborated in fundamental refocusi ng of executive branch agencies to close those gaps particularly by creating the partment of homeland security dhs but also through wide variety of other initiatives such as the terrorist threat integration center ttic the terrorist screening center tsc and the proposed national intelligence director nid and na tional counterterrorism center nctc despite this significant executive bran ch reorganization congressional structures remain almost the same as they were before the 911 attacks scores of committees and subcommittees of the congress have some claim to jurisdiction over various elements of the department of homela nd security dhs with six standing committees claiming some jurisdiction over critical border security functions of the department this creates chaos for th department since january 2004 senior officials from the department have had to testify at more than 160 congressional hearings an average of 20 each monthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs73 creating permanent standing committee on homeland security commencing in the 109th congress is necessary if the h ouse of representatives is effectively to meet its legislative and oversight respons ibilities with respect to homeland security programs and activities particularly those of dhs the current diffused and unfocused congressional jurisdiction over the department of homeland security and homeland security in general not onl imposes extraordinary burdens on the department but makes it far more difficult for the congress to guide the departments activities in consistent and focused way that promotes integration and eliminates programmatic redunda ncies and advances imple mentation of coherent national homeland security stra tegy current legislative s ilos foster and if left unchanged will continue to foster fragmentation within dhs as it struggles to build new common culture focused squa rely on the homeland security mission for these reasons not only the 911 commission but virtually every other commission and outside expert has recognized that effective and efficient legislation and oversight with respect to homel and security requires congressional reorganization that vests in single st anding committee in each chamber jurisdiction that parallels the homeland security mission of preventing preparing for and responding to acts of terrorism in the united states select committee while appropriate in certain situa tions would not be conducive to fostering the clear lines of accountability and responsibility that are n ecessary when dealing with the variety and crosscutting nature of homeland security programs and activities situated largely in single department the success of this endeavor requires that the new standing committee have legislative and oversight juri sdiction broad enough to ensure that it can take holistic approach toward homeland security issues and that the unnecessarily heavy burden the department of homeland security now bears in interacting with vast array of committees and subcommittees in both houses of the congress is drastically reduced in carrying out this consolidation it is im portant to craft the right balance between the jurisdiction of the new standing committee on homeland security and that of existing committees the homeland security act of 2002 offers congressionally created road map to jurisdictional reform that focuses on the structure organization capabilities and mission of the department itself the house must reorganize the committee structure so that the new homeland security mission is

for national intelligence and to its component agencies should longer be kept secret congress should pass separate appropriations act for intelligence defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars h ave been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work the specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified as they are today opponents of declassification argu that americas enemies could learn about intelligence capabilities by tracking the topline appropriations figure yet the top line figure by itself provides little insight into us intelligence sources and methods the us government readily provides c opious information about spending on its military forces including military intelligence the intelligence community should not be

effort in the congress strengthen congressional oversight of intelligence and homeland security of all our recommendations strengthenin g congressional overs ight may be among the most difficult and important so long as oversight is governed by current congressional rules and resolutions we believe the american people will not get the security they want and need the united states needs strong stable and capable congressional committee structure to give americas national intelligence agencies oversight support and leadership few things are more difficult to change in washington than congressional committee jurisdiction and prerogatives to member these assignments are almost as important as the map of his or her c ongressional district the american people may have to insist that these changes ccur or they may well not happen having interviewed numerous members of congress from both parties as well as congressional staff members we found that dissatisf action with congressional oversight remains widespread the future challenges of americas intelligence agencies are daunting they include the need to develop leadingedge technol ogies that give our policymakers and warfighters decisive edge in any conflict where the interests of the united states are vital not only does good intelligence win wars but the best intelligence enables us to prevent them from happening altogether under the terms of existing rules and resolutions the house and senate intelligence committees lack the power influence and stained capability to et this challenge while few members of cong ress have the broad knowledg of intelligence activities or the knowhow about the technologies empl oyed all members need to feel assured that good oversight is happenings when their unfamiliarity with the subject is combined with the need to preserve security mandate emerges for substantial change tinkering with the existing structure is not sufficient either congress should create joint committee for intelligence using the joint atomic energy committee as its model or it should create house and sena committees with combined authorizing and appropriations powers whichever of these two forms are chosen the goal should be structure codified by resolution with powers expressly granted and carefully limited allowing relatively small group of memb ers of congress given time and reason to master the subject and the agencies to conduct oversig ht of the intelligence establishment and be clearly accountable for their work the staff of this committee should be nonpartisan and work for the entire co mmittee and not for individual membershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs81 the other reforms we have suggested for national counterte rrorism center and national intelligence director will not work if congressional oversight does not change too unity of effort in executive ma nagement can be lost if it is fractured by divided congressional oversight recommendation congressional oversight for intelligence and counterterrorism is now dysfunctional congress should address this problem we have considered various alternatives joint committee on the old model of the joint committee on atomic energy is one single committee in each house of congress combining auth orizing and appropri ating authorities is another the new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the house and senate we have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the national intelligence director not to the secretary of defense we also recommend that the in telligence committee should have subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget the resolution creating the new in telligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees the majority partys representation on this committee should never exceed the minoritys representation by more than one four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be member who also serves on each of the following additional committees armed services judiciary foreign affairs and the defense appropriations subcommittee in this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committees work members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees without set terms thereby tting them accumulate expertise the committees should be smaller perhaps seven or nine members in each house so th at each member feels greater sense of responsibility and accountability for the quality of the committees work the leaders of the department of ho meland security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of congress one expert witness not member of the administration told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the departments successful development the one attempt to consolidate such committee authority the house select committee on homeland security may be eliminated the senate does not have even thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs82 248 for an analysis of this recommendations implications for senate procedures see crs report rl32551 911 commission recommendations th senate confirmation process for presidential nominees by betsy palmer and crs report rl32588 911 commission recommendations changes to the presidentia l appointment and presidential transition processes by henry b hoguecongress needs to establish for the depa rtment of homeland security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the justice department to deal with crime and the defense department to deal with threats to national security through not more than one authorizing committee and one appropriating subcommittee in each house congress should be able to ask the secretary of homeland security whether he or she has th resources to provide reasonable security against major terrorists acts within the united states and to hold the secretary accountable for the depa rtments performance recommendation congress should create single principal point of oversight and review for homeland security congressional leaders are best able to judge what committee should have jurisdiction over this department and its duties but we believe that congress does not h ave the obligation to choose one in the house and one in the senate and that this committee should be permanent standing committee with nonpartisan staff improve the transitions between administrations in chapter 6 we described the transiti on of 20002001 beyond the policy issues we described the new administration did not have deputy cabinet officers in place until the spring of 2001 and the critical subcabin et officials were not confirmed until the summer if then in other words the new administration like others before it did not have its team on the job until at least six months after it took office recommendation since catastrophic attack could occur with little or notice we should minimize as much as possible the disruption of national security policymaking during the change of administrations by accelerating the process for national security appointments we think the process could be improved significantly so transitions ca n work more effectively and allow new officials to assume their new responsibilities as quickly as possible248 before the election candidates sh ould submit the names of selected members of their prospective transition teams to the fbi so that if necessary those team members can obtain security clearances immediately after the election is over presidentelect should submit lists of possible candidates for national security positions to begin

their various agency appropriations bills occasionally create and fund programs that were not subject to the normal authorization processes the result of such action is often lack of detail and clarity in the structure and execution of programs as well as lack of continuity and sustainability as most such programs ar only funded year by year examples of major programs created and funded in

but is less meritorious committee functions and structure the joint or separate committee of each house should consist of bipartisan representation from members of all relevant authoriza tion oversight budget and appropriations committees and subcommittees that currently have cognizance over federal programs and activities to combat terrorism it should have fulltime staff either detailed from those relevant committees and subcommittees or new employees who have the requisite experience and expertise28 the joint or separate panel should perform seve ral critical functions first it would constitute forum for reviewing all asp ects of national st rategy and supporting implementation plans for combating terrorism developed and submitted by the national office for combating terrorism the office is proposed earlier in the second annual report as part of that process the jo int or each separate committee should develop consolidated legislative plan including authorizing language and corresponding budget and appropriations ben chmarks in response to the national strategy to combat terrorism and acco mpanying program and budget proposals second it would serve as the

2004254httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs94 c executive legislative cooperation solving the homeland security challenge is not just an executive branch problem congress should be an active participant in the development of homeland security programs as well its hearings can he lp develop the best ideas and solutions individual members should develop exper tise in homeland security policy and its implementation so that they can fill in policy gaps and provide needed oversight and advice in times of crisis most important using its power of the purse congress should ensure that government agencies have sufficient resources and that their programs are coordinated efficient and effective congress has already taken important steps bipartisan congressional initiative produced the us effort to deal with the possibility that weapons of mass destruction could leak out of disint egration soviet union it was also congressional initiative that established the domestic preparedness progra m and launched 120 city program to enhance the capability of fe deral state and local first responders to react effectively in wmd emergency members of congress from both parties have pushed the executive branch to identify and manage the problem more effectively congress has also propos ed and funded studies and commissions on various aspects of the homeland secu rity problem but it must do more sound homeland security stra tegy requires the overhaul of much of the legislative framework for preparedness response nd national defense pr ograms congress designed many of the authorities that support national secu rity and emergency preparedness programs principally for cold war environment the new threat environment from biological and terrorist attacks to cyber attacks on critical systems poses vastly different challenges we therefore recommend that congress refurbish the legal foundation for homeland security in response to the new threat environment in particular congress should amend as necessary key legislative authorities such as the defense production act of 1950 nd the communications act of 1934 which facilitate homeland security functions and activities c ongress should also encourage the sharing of threat vulnerability and inci dent data between th public and private sectors including federal agencies st ate governments first responders and industry in addition congress should m onitor and support current efforts to update the international legal framework for communications security issues footnote citations to laws and other reports are not included beyond that congress has some organizati onal work of its own to do as things stand today so many federal agencies ar involved with homeland security that it is exceedingly difficult to present federal programs and their resource requirements to the congress in coherent way it is rgely because the budget is broken up into so many pieces for example that counterte rrorism and information security issues involve nearly two dozen congressional committees and subcommittees the creation of the national security homeland agency will redress this problem to some extent but because of its growing urgency and complexity homeland security will still require stronger working relationship between the executive and legislative branches congress should therefore find wa ys to address homeland security issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs95 that bridge current jurisdictional bounda ries and that create more innovative oversight mechanisms there are several ways of achieving th is the senates arms control observer group and its more recent nato enlargem ent group were two successful examples of more informal executivelegislative cooperation on key multi dimensional issues specifically in the near term this commission recommends the following 7 congress should establish special body to deal with homeland security issues as has been done effectively with intelligence oversight members should be chosen for their expertise in foreign policy defense intelligence law enforcement and ppropriations this body should also include members of all relevant congressional committees as well as exofficio members from the lead ership of the houses of congress this body should develop comprehens ive understanding of the problem of homeland security exchange information and viewpoints with the executive branch on effective policies and plans and work with standing committees to develop integrated legislative responses and guid ance meetings would often be held in closed session so that members could have access to interagency deliberations and diverging viewpoints as well as to classi fied assessments such body would have neither legislative nor an oversight ma ndate and it would not eclipse the authority of any standing committee at the same time congress needs to systematically review and restructure its committee system as will be pr oposed in recommendation 48 single select committee in each house of congress should be given authoriza tion appropriations and oversight responsibility for all homeland security activities when established these committees would replace the functi on of the oversight body described in recommendation 7 √∏√∏√∏ 2 road map for national security imperative for change the phase iii report of the united states commission on national security21st century pp 5859 it follows from reform that integrates many of the nations foreign policy activities under the secretary of state that similar logic should be applied to the state department budget we ther efore recommend the following 22 the president should ask congress to appropriate funds to the state department in single integrated foreign operations budget which would include all foreign assistance programs and activities as well as all expenses for personnel and operations the state departments in ternational affair s function 150 budget request would longer be divided into separate ppropriations by the foreign operations subcommittee on the one hand and by s ubcommittee on the commerce state andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs96 justice departments on the other the cong ressional leadership would need to alter the current jurisdictional lines of the appropriation subcommittees so that the foreign operations subcommittee would ndle the entire state department budget such reform would give the administration the opportunity to allocate all the state departments resources in way to carry out the presidents overall strategic goals ensure that the various assistance programs are integrated rather than simply collection of administrations political commitments and congressional earmarks and replace the existing budget categories with purposeful goals footnote citation to function 150 budget categories is not included √∏√∏√∏ 3 road map for national security imperative for change the phase iii report of the united states commission on national security21st century pp 7273 program turbulence often stemming from lack of funds or from budgetary instability is the primary cause of inefficiencies and cost overruns in dod programs this budgetary instability has several sources one is the current reality of the resource allocation process itself within dod which unfortuna tely often takes all resources into account during budget reduc tions including acquisition programs this normally results in known and deliberate underfunding of previously approved programs another problem is the acquis ition system itself which suffers from cost overruns and program extensions lastly the congress often uses small takes from large programs to reallocate funds to other priorities w ithout realizing or understanding the problems this creates in having to reprogram funds write new contracts and blish new schedules we realize that many commissions and ev er more studies over the past several years have recommended two year budgeting and multiyear procurement as way of limiting program turbulence if these forms of budgeting were introduced the disincentive to disrupt acquisition programs would appropriately be very high we also know that congress had doggedly refu sed to take such proposals seriously congress lacks confidence in dods ability to execute such budget given past weapons cost overruns furthermore ppropriating funds on yearly basis gives congress greater ability to influence the defense departments policies and programs therefore rather than propose twoyear budgeting across the entire department of defense we focus on the single area wher twoyear budgeting makes the most sense and stands to do the most good we recommend the following 31 congress should implement twoyear defense budgeting solely for the modernization element of the dod budget rdprocurement because of its longterm character and it should expand the use of multiyear procurementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs97 such steps would markedly increase the stability of wea pons development programs and result in budgetary savings in the b illions of dollars for this to happen however the secretary of defense must impose discipline in the decisionmaking process it is already difficult to star t new engineering development programs it should be made even more demanding ensu ring that the military requirements are understood and enduring and that the technol ogy concepts and funding are all well in hand once program is approved it should be equally difficult to change it the commission also notes that it is sometimes better to eliminate some programs early than to absorb the costs of constantly extending programs and procuring limited numbers of weapons at high costs to accomplish this congress will need to let decisions to kill programs stand as we ll as support dod budgeting and procurement reforms if the government will not take the measures to improve program stability by introducing twoyear budgeting in mode rnization and rd accounts and more broadly adopt multiyear funding it cannot ex pect private industry to obligate itself to suppliers or to assume risks on its own investments with little prospect of long term returns √∏√∏√∏ 4 road map for national security imperative for change the phase iii report of the united states commission on national security21st century pp 110115 v the role of congress this commission has recommended substantial change in executive branch institutions change that is needed if america is to retain its ability to lead the world and to assure the nations safety num ber of prominent leaders have exhausted themselves and frustrated their careers by too aggressively seeking to reform the house and senate the legislative br anch however must change as well it is one thing to appeal to congress to reform the state department or the defense department quite anot her to call on congress to reform itself over the years since world war ii the legislative branch has been reformed and modernized much less than the executive branch indeed the ve ry nature of power in congress makes it difficult for legislators to re form their collective institu tion yet american national security in the 21st century and the prominent role of daily global involvement that is the nature of american life in our generation mandates rious reappraisal of both the individual and collective fforts of congress and its members such reappraisal must begin with shared understanding of the legislative branchs role in the development and ssessment of postcold war foreign policy divided constitutional respons ibilities require the executive and legislature to work together in order for us foreign policy to have coherence yet the executive branch has at times informed rather than consulted cong ress it has often treated congress as an obstacle rather than as partner seeking congressional input mostly in times of crisis rather than in an ongoi ng way that would yield support when crises occur for its part congress has not ways taken full respons ibility for educating its members on foreign policy issues it is not often receptive to consultation withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs98 the executive branch as well and has sust ained structure that undermines rather than strengthens its ability to fulfill its constitutional obligations in the foreign policy arena several measures are needed to address these shortcomings and they are described below but as an immediate first step we recommend that 46 the congressional leadership should conduct thorough bicameral bipartisan review of the legislative branch relationship to national security and foreign policy the speaker of the house the majority and minority leaders of the house and the majority and minority leaders of the nate should form bipartisan bicameral working group with select staff and outside advisory panels to review the totality of executivelegislative relations in the realtime global information age we are entering only by having the five most powerful members of the congress directly involved is there any hope of real reform they should work methodically for one year and by the beginning of the second session of the congress they should report on proposed reforms to be implemented by the next congress the president the vice president the national security advi sor and senior cabinet officers should work directly with this unique panel to rethink the structure of executivelegislative relations in the national secur ity and foreign policy domains with that as basis reforms can and mu st be undertaken in three crucial areas improving the foreign policy and national security exper tise of individual members of congress undertaking orga nizational and process changes within the legislative branch and achieving sustained and effective executivelegislative dialogue on national security issues despite the range of foreign policy challenges facing the united states many current members of congress are poorly inform ed in this area their main electoral priorities are generally within domestic policy foreign policy concerns are often limited to issues of concern to special intere sts or to prominent ethnic groups in their districts once in office attention to foreign policy issues generally focuses on pending votes and looming crisis to build broad base of informed and involved members on foreign policy issues we recommend the following 47 congressional and executive br anch leaders must build programs to encourage individual members to acquire knowledge and experience in both national security and foreign policy in particular this means that the congressional leadership should ducate its members on foreign policy and national security matte rs beyond the freshman orie ntation provided for new members such education should emphasi ze congress foreign policy roles and responsibilities we must reinforce th principal of minimal partisanship on foreign policy issues that politics stops at the waters edge effective educationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs99 of members will ensure more knowledg eable debate and better partnership with the executive branch on foreign policy issues it also will allow members to become more effective educators of their constituencies about the importance of national security concerns members should be encouraged to trav overseas for serious purposes and each member should get letters from the president or from the head of their body formally asking them to undertak trips in the national interest concerted effort should be made to distinguish between junkets pleasure trips at taxpayer expenses and the serious work that members need to undertake to learn about the world major effort s hould be made to ensure that every new member of congress undertakes at least one serious trip in his or her first term and is involved in one or more tr ips each year from the second term on legislaturetolegislature exchanges and visits should be encouraged and expanded more funding and staffing should be provided to both accommodate foreign legislators visiting the united states and to encourage american legislators and their spouses to visit fore ign legislatures much is to be gained by strengthening the institutions of democracy and by improving understanding among elected offici als this should get much greater emphasis and much more institutional support than it currently does the wargaming center at the nati onal defense university should be expanded so that virtually every member of congress can participate in one or more war games per twoyear cycle by rolemodeling key decisionmakers american and foreign members of congress will acquire better understanding of the limits of american pow er and of the reality that any action the united states taken invariably has multiple permutations abroad giving members of congress reason to learn about region about the procedures and systems of executive branch decision making and about cr isis interactions will lead eventually to more sophisti cated legislative branch on occasion particularly useful or in sightful games should lead to meeting between the participating congressmen and senators and key executive branch officials members increased fluency in national security issues is positive steps but one that must be accompanied by structural reforms that address how congress organizes itself and conducts its business several recommendations concerning congressional structure have already been made in this report to create special congressional body to deal with homeland security issu recommendation 7 to consider all of the state departments appropriations within the foreign operations subcommittee recommendation 22 and to move to twoyear budget cycle for defense modernization programs reco mmendation 31 to meet the challenges of the next quarter century we recommend c ongress take additional steps 48 congress should rationalize its current committee structure so that it best serves us national security objectives specifically it should merge the current authorizing committees with the relevant appropriations subcommitteeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs100 our discussion of homeland security high lights the complexity and overlaps of the current committee structure the congressional leadership must review its structure systematically in light of likely 21st century security challenges and of us national security priorities this is to ensure both that important issu receive sufficient attention and oversight and the unnecessary duplication of effort by multiple committees is minimized such an effort would benefit the executive branch as well which currently bears significant burden in terms of testimony the number of times that key executive branch officials are required to appear on th same topics in front of different panels is minor disgrace at minimum we recommend that public record should be kept of these briefings and published annually if that were done it would become obvious to all observers that great deal of testimony could be give n in front of joint panels and in some cases bicameral joint panels while we emphasize the need for strong consultation with the legislative branch we need better sense of what constitutes reasonable amount of time that any senior executive branch official should spend publicly educating congress specifically in terms of committee structure we believe action must be taken to streamline the budgeting and appropriations processes in 1974 congress developed its present budget process as way of tablishing overall prio rities for the various authorizations and appr opriations committees over time however the budget process has become huge bureaucratic unde rtaking and the authorization process has expanded to cover all spe nding areas in light of this there is longer compelling rationale for separate authorization and appropriations bills this is why we believe that the appr opriations subcommittees should be merged with their respective authorizing committees the aggregate committee for example the senate armed services committee should both authorize and appropriate within the same bill th is will require realigning appropriations subcommittees for example appropriations relating to defense are currently dealt with in three subcommittees defense milita ry construction and energy and water under this proposal all appropriations w ould be made within the senate armed services committee this approach has at least two important merits first it furthers the aim of rationalizing committee jurisdiction because all appropriating and authorizing elements relating to specific topic ar brought within one committee second it brings greater authority to those charged w ith oversight as well as appropriations in the current system power has shifted from the authorizing committees to the appropriating committees with muchnarrowe r budgetary focus by combining the two functions more effort may be paid to examining how foreign policy laws have been implemented what their results ve been and how policy objectives can be better achieved finally this new struct ure may facilitate doption of twoyear budgeting if efforts such as those propos ed for defense modernization programs prove successful the merged committee could authorize in less detail for the two fiscalyear period while appropriating in gr eater detail for the first fiscal year if this important reform were undertak then the budget committees in each house of congress would consist of the chairman and ranking member of each newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs101 combined committee as part of the budget function these two committees would distribute the macroa llocations contained in the budget resolution once congress has gotten its own house in orde r it still remains to ensure that there is ongoing executivelegislative consultati on and coordination efforts to do so are beneficial not only so that both branches can fulfill their constitutional obligations but also because effective consultation can improve the quality of us policy we have acknowledged this for example in our defense partment planning recommendation which defers detailed prog ram and budget deci sions until congress has marked up the previous years submission because congress is the most representative branch of government execu tive branch policy that considers range of congressional views is more likely to gain public support the objections raised by differing congressional opinions can refi ne policy by forcing the administration to respond to previously unconsidered c oncerns finally congress can force the president and his top aides to articulate and explain administration policy so the american people and the world can better understand it given these benefits efforts must be undertaken to improve the consultative process indeed coherent and effective foreign policy requires easy and honest consultation between the branches the bi cameral bipartisan panel put forward in recommendation 46 is good first step in th is process but add itional processes must be established to ensure that such efforts are ongoing therefore we recommend the following 49 the executive branch must ensure sustained focus on foreign policy and national security consultation with congress and devote resources to it for its part congress must make consultation higher priority and form permanent consultative group of congressional leaders as part of this effort sustained effort at consultation must be based on mutual trust respect and partnership and on shared understanding of each branchs role the executive branch must recognize congress role in policy formulation and congress must grant the executive branch flexibility in the daytoday implementation of that policy congress must also ensure that if it is consulted and its criticisms are taken seriously it will act with restraint and allow the executive branch to lead for his part the president must convey to administr ation officials the importance of ongoing bipartisan consultation and dialogue efforts must not be limited to periods of crisis further administration officials should ta ke into consideration the differences in knowledge and perspective among members beyond these general principles speci fic mechanisms can facilitate better consultation congress should create permanent consultative group composed of the congressional leadership and the chairm and ranking member of the main congressional committees involved in fo reign policy other members with special interest or expertise could join the groups work on certain issues the group would meet regularly in in formal and private sessions withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs102 representatives of the executive branch while these may regularly be cabinet officials they may often be at the under secretary level this will make possible regular dialogue with know ledgeable administration officials allowing the congressional group not only to respond to crises but to be part of the development of preventive strategies the agenda for these meetings would not be strictly limited allowing members to raise issues they are concerned about the group would also meet on any emergency basis whenever the president considers military action abroad or deals with foreign policy crisis beyond this interaction between the leadership of both branches the administration must reach out to cons ult with broader congressional group this will involve increasing the numbe r of administration representatives working to consult with congress and assigning highquality people to that task the executive must send midlevel as well as highlevel officials to capitol hill and keep closer track of the foreign policy views and concerns of every member of congress only through such concerted efforts combined with the aforementioned education initiatives will there be critical mass of members knowledgeable of and engaged in foreign policy issues finally in order for congress to be most effective in partnering with the executive branch it must undertake its own consultation with broad group of leaders in science international economics defense intelligence and in the hightechnology venturecapital arena congress is fare more accessible to this expertise than the executive branch and s hould work to bring these insights into consultations to do this however mbers of congress need regular and direct dialogue with experts without the sc reen of their staffs the best experts in these fields are vastly more know ledgeable than any congressional staff member and there needs to be routine system for bringing members of congress in touch with experts in the areas in which they will be making decisions all four parts of the nationa l academies of science should play key roles in bringing the most knowledgeable scientists and engineers in contact with members of the legislative branch policy institutions with deep reservoirs of expertise on defense nd foreign policy too can help build congressional fluency with these issues with measure of detachment and independent perspective similar institutions need to be engaged in other areas footnote citations other parts of the report and to additional reading are not

realign their subcommittee jurisdictions to create new homeland security subcommittees this restructuring both institutionalizes the responsibility for ppropriations oversight of the executive branch increasing the changes that budget ary supervision will occur even if events shift political appeal to other topics and reduce fragmentation increasing the chances that congress can identify major ga ps and sensible tradeoffs in homeland security spending congress has not moved as aggressively to consolidate the badly fragmented authorization process the senate plans changes to its committee structure the government affairs committ ee had responsibility for overseeing the creation of dhs while other authorizing committees have res ponsibility for overseeing individual programs and agencies with in dhs the house has gone somewhat further it has created select homeland security committee composed on thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs105 republican side largely of the chairmen of the committees with stake in homeland security the goal is to establish permanent homeland security committee at the start of the 109th congress 200507 the question of what jurisdictions permanent committee would take from other panels has yet to be answered in the interim the leadership of the select committee sees its task as coordinating the homeland security actions of other committees and reconciling any disagreements rather than establishing claim to primary author ization oversight of homeland security although the houses approach is preferable to the senates neither is sufficient to ensure effective congressional oversight maintaining fragmented authorization process increases the odds that congress w ill drag its feet in considering executive branch proposals bicker internally over th direction of homeland security and issue conflicting directives to dhs streamlined appropriations process ca nnot eliminate these problems even though appropriators normally follow the authorizers in the legislative process and can in theory reconcile any conflicting authorization mandates appropriators approach oversight largely through budgetary and management lenses their instinct is to ask how much is being spend and whether it can be spent efficiently they devote less time to the related but distinct policy issues that the authorization committees specialize in as result the chances remain that broader policy issues either will be the object of turf wars or fall through the cracks of the authorization process bringing committee heads together as the house proposes can mitigate these problems in the short term it is debatable however that select committee will provide adequate oversight in the long term committee chairs have numerous competing demands on their time many of which are more politically salient than homeland security moreover the select committee approach by its nature focuses oversight attention on where committees disagree rather than on the equally pressing question of whether the sum total of committee decisions makes sense congress would be wise then to take to heart its message in the department of homeland security act and reorganize its jurisdictions to create authorizing committees for homeland security such reorganization would not produce unified decisionmaking process some fragmentation would remain as result of bicameralism and the twintrack authoriza tion and appropriations process the task of coordinating the authoriz ers and appropriators on homel and security with those responsible for related activ ities by the intelligence agencies the fbi and the pentagon to name just few would so remain but establishing dedicated homeland security committees to complement the homeland security appropriations subcommittees would likely maximize the efficacy of congressional oversight √∏√∏√∏ 2 protecting the american homeland one year on 2002 pp 122123 congress however the executive branch conducts its work many issues will inevitably engage the legislative branch the presidents ability to make homeland security his top priority will be helped or hindered according to whether and how much congress can revamp its structure and pro cess to the same end two reforms wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32711crs106 be especially useful establishmen t of house and nate appropriations subcommittees for homeland security and creation of joint committee to oversee the national effort the cong ressional role and focus woul d be further strengthened moreover if the homeland security counc il were made stat utory entity and its director subject to senate c onfirmation as recommended above one of tom ridges signal achievement s has been the submission of unified homeland security budget but once on cap ital hill it now must be disaggregated and its components distribut ed among multiple appropria tions subcommittees there they will be weighed not in relation to overall homeland security needs but within such jurisdictions as commerce justice and state defense and labor health and human services and education what th executive branch has laboriously pulled together congress must quickly pull apart the obvious remedy difficult though it may be to implement is to establish new appropriations subcommittees on homeland security in both branches if that proves too large reform to swallow secondbest alternative would be for the appropriations committees as whole to take up and pass the homeland security budget ideally there would also be established authorizing committees with the same jurisdiction in the near term however this would likely prove even harder to accomplish than appropriations reform useful secondbest option therefore would be to enhance congre ssional capacity for analysis and oversight by creating new body on the model of the joint economic committee this would limit the threat to existing jurisdictions as joint committee for homeland security would have legislative authority this would also limit its impact of course but such committee could be useful focal point holding hearings issuing reports calling executive officials to

of authority and ensure efficient and effective oversight of the new homeland security department relinquish responsibility in co mmittees that exercise overly broad and in most cases duplic ative oversight of the agencies that will be folded into the department of homeland defense today far too many congressional committees and subcommittees have been given or have taken oversight re sponsibility for various aspects of homeland security to ensure effective oversight of homeland s ecurity congress must rein in the number of committees and subcommittees that exercise authority over the new department specifically the scope of jurisdiction of the house government reform committee should be narrowed and its f unctions redefined to elimin ate duplicate oversight over the many defense and homeland security functions already under the jurisdiction of other committees the senate government affa irs committee should revise its charter and divest itself of the international security and pro liferation function of the subcommittee on international security proliferation and federal services this oversight role is adequately exercised in other standing senate committees membership of each respective select committee should be made up of chairpersons and ranking members from the committees house and senate and subcommittees house that now exercise oversight over the

that govern chairmanship or ranking member status on other committees term limits on membership ensure fresh perspectives while maintaining more than adequate understanding of the issu because of members other co mmittee assignments each new select committee should have its own separate staff not affiliated with any other committee or subcommittee separate staff will ensure independen ce and

oversight in conjunction with those new subcommittees dissolve oversight responsibilities now resident in standing subcommittees unless separate new subcommittees are created and oversight within
