divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32977dual eligibles review of medicaids role in providing services and assistance summary the term dual eligibles generally re fers to individuals who qualify for both medicare benefits and all dicaid benefits offered in their state although dual eligibles represent about oneeighth of medicaid nd onesixth of medicare beneficiaries the high cost significant needs and considerable challenges in delivering medicaid and medicare services to this group have drawn the attention of both state and federal policymakers in fy2002 about 66 million individuals were considered dual eligibles including those who only received assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing these individuals comprise disproportionate care of medicaid spending representing 13 of medicaid benefici aries and 41 of dicaid spending in 2002 medicaid spent 917 billion on dual eligibles including 865 billion for medicaid services and medicare cost sharing and 52 billion for medicare premiums of the spending for medicai d services and medicare costsharing 69 was for longterm care services follo wed by 17 for prescription drugs this report also provides an overview of dual eligible indivi duals and discusses the specific role of medicaid in serving th is group dual eligibles are more likely to be female in minority gr oup ve less education and have higher levels of functional limitations than the average medicare beneficiary several current issues exist in providing services to dual eligibles such as the challenges in coordinating the delivery of medicaid and medicare services some efforts have been made by states and the federal government to increase the coordination of these services several of these efforts are discussed in the report another significant policy issue is the implications for dual eligibles of the new medicare prescription drug benefit enacted by the 108th congress pl 108173 starting in january 2006 dual ligibles will be required to enroll in the new medicare part d benefit for coverage of their prescription drugs finally states must also cover the medi care premiums andor costsharing for certain groups of lowincome medicare beneficiaries some of whom may also qualify for medicaid states also have the option of covering the medicare premiums of other individuals who are enrolled in the states medicaid program despite the variety of groups covered id entifying and enrolling these lowincome medicare beneficiaries remains challenging to assist congress in reviewing polic alternatives nd understanding the current status of medicaid programs the congressional re search service crs has produced number of reports on various aspects of medicaid including current programs and policies this report will be

for medicare copayments and deductiblesdual eligibles review of medicaids role in providing services and assistance introduction the term dual eligibles generally re fers to individuals who qualify for both medicare benefits and those medicaid benefits offered in their state persons qualify for medicare because they are eith er age 65 or older or under age 65 and have disability and have been receiving social security disability insurance ssdi for two years1 persons qualify for medicaid because they meet one of the categories specified in federal w eg aged blind or disabled and meet the income and asset standard s states use for eligibility under this meanstested program however the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms2 also includes in the definition of dual eligibles certain lowincome medicare beneficiaries for whom medicaid covers only certain medicare premium and cost sharing obligations this latter group als referred to as the medicare savings programs consists of several subcategories of lowincome medicare beneficiaries congress requires state medicaid pr ograms to cover certain medicare premiums copayments andor deductibles for each of these groups and gives states the option of covering pre miums for other groups unless otherwise specified all data on dual ligibles provided in this re port include both those with full medicaid benefits and the lowincome medicare beneficiaries receiving only premium and costsharing assistance from medicaid3 this report describes dicaids coverage of dual eligibles including demographic information on these benefici aries the high cost and intensive service needs of dual eligib individuals and associat ed medicaid spending the delivery and administration of dual eligible services and assistance with medicare cost sharing some features of the medicare program are described to compare the two programs and discuss their inter action but full discussion of medicare expenditures for dual eligibles and medicar program issues is outside the scope of this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32977crs2 4 the medicaid state plan is the document that states submit to the federal government for continuedcurrent issues dual eligibles represent about one in eight medicai d beneficiaries and one in six medicare beneficiaries however the high cost significant needs and considerable challenges in delivering medicaid and medicare services to this group have drawn the attention of both state and federal policymakers this section provides brief intr oduction of three key policy issues for dual eligibles the cost of providing services coordi nating care for dual eligibles and the new medicare drug benefit each of these issues is discussed in more detail later in the report cost of providing services some policymakers have raised c oncerns about the overall expenditure growth in both medicaid and medicare because dual eligible individuals account for disproportionate share of medicai d and medicare expenditures compared to other groups policy alternatives for dual ligibles are often di scussed as ways to address the growing cost of these progra ms some of these discussions include how to provide the services in more co stefficient manner but they also include which unit of government fede ral or state should cover the cost of services for these individuals coordinating care for dual eligibles states and the federal gove rnment have attempted to address costs and at the same time improve the quality of services through efforts to coordinate or integrate services for dual eligibles coordinating services for these individuals is challenge because 1 medicare and medicaid are administered and operated very differently from one another 2 the two programs cover comparable services that differ in the eligibility requirements or scope and 3 incentives exist to shift costs between the two programs which do not necessarily result in the best quality or continuity of care for the beneficiary medicare prescrip tion drug benefit for dual eligibles the 108th congress enacted the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 this legislation made several changes to the medicare pr ogram including offering medicare beneficiaries access to discounted pr escription drugs during 2004 and 2005 and adding voluntary prescription drug benefit under new medicare part d beginning january 2006 these benefits include significant changes for dual eligibles and those who receive assist ance with medicare premiums and cost sharing in 2006 dual

eligibles must enroll in private drug plan authorized to provide the new medicare part d benefit5 who are the dual eligibles definition and eligibility requirements as noted above the term dual eligibles refers to persons qualifying for both medicare and medicaid benefits in fy2002 about 66 million individuals were considered dual eligib including those who only received assistance with medicare premiums and costsharing6 in order to qualify for medicare individuals or their spouses or in some cases their parents must have worked and paid medicare taxes and they are ither elderly or they are under age 65 and have blindness or disability as termined by social security law7 persons qualify for medicaid if they have limited income and resources and meet other eligibility requirements for medicare beneficiary to qualify for all state medicaid benefits he or she must meet the medicaid eligibility criteria in that state common pathway into medicaid for medicare beneficiary is through his or her eligibility for the suppl emental security income ssi program which in most states provides automatic medicaid eligibility8 ssi is cash welfare program providing assistance to lowincome individuals another common medicaid eligibility pathway for medicare beneficiary is through the medically needy option under this op tion the state sets an income standard and allows certain individuals whose income exceeds that standard to spend down to the qualifying level by deducting the amount of incurred medical expenses from the persons income before determining eligibility for medicaidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32977crs4 9 medicare benefits are separated into part nd part b part covers inpatient hospital services up to 100 days of postacute care in skilled

eligible for both medicare benefits9 and all medicaid benefits provided w ithin state guidelines including help with medicare premiums and costsharing charges smaller percentage of medicare beneficiaries are eligible only for medicare premium and costsharing assistance individuals who qualify for such assistance are generally those who have limited income and resources but do not meet the states medicaid eligibility criteria congress requires state medicaid progra ms to cover the medicare premiums andor costsharing for certain groups of lowincome medicare beneficiaries some of whom may also qualify for medi caid states also have the option of covering the medicare premiums of other medicaid beneficiaries these five groups are introduced below to provide context for the remaining discussion but are described in mo re detail later in this report qualified medicare benefici ary qmb program includes individuals who have part dicare benefits and whose income does not exceed 100 of

dually eligible individuals were more likely to be female in minor ity group have less education and have more and higher levels of f unctional limitations than the average medicare beneficiary see table 1 11 some of these demographic differences have implications for the ty pes and amounts of services needed by dual eligibles and the strategies for out reach and beneficiary education compared to other medicare beneficiaries for exam ple lower level of formal education in this group may mean that beneficiary edu cation materials should be targeted to certain reading level table 1 comparison

coordination coordinating medicare and medicaid serv ices for dual eligibles has been significant challenge for state and federal policy makers for three primary reasons 1 the program administration and opera tions of medicare and medicaid are very different from one another 2 medicaid and medicare may cover similar but slightly different services and 3 there are significant incentives to shift beneficiaries care to medicaid or medicar even if this does not result in the highest quality of care or the greatest continuity of care for an individual program administration and operations the medicare and medicaid programs have very different history and purpose which affect the program interaction and the coordination of services the programs are operated by different levels of gove

supportive servi ces particularly in the area of longterm care medicaid is funde d through combination of federal and state funding and states administer th program and set dicaid policy within broad federal guidelines blished by cms in add ition many states have split up the administration of medicaid among different state agencies for example there may be separate state agencies for determining medicaid eligibility administering the general acute care pr ogram and administering medicaid long term care services coverage of similar services as mentioned earlier medicare and medicaid cover several of the same services or related services however these services may differ in the scope of coverage or the eligibility requirements which can be confusing for policymakers provide rs and beneficiaries to navigate for example providers may have difficu lty knowing whether to bill medicaid or medicare for particular service for example to be eligible for medicare home health services beneficiaries must be homebound and re quire intermittent skille d nursing care physical therapy or speechlanguage pathology if beneficiary meets these criteria medicare will also cover occupational therapy and the services of home health aides and medical social workers federal medicare guidelines determine the payment rate for home health providers medicaids home health coverage rules are similar to medicare but do not include the homebound requirement shifting costs there are also incentives and opportunities for providers and states to shift costs from medicaid to medicare and vice versa for example if dual eligible who is residing in nursing facility that medicaid pays for has condition that worsens and he or she n eeds additional care the nursing home may have financial incentive to transfer that individual to hospital even if the nursing home could meet the individuals n eeds if the nursing home transfers the individual to the hospital the nursing hom would not be

social security protection act of 2003 pl 108203 which includes provisions to exclude additional types of income and resources in ssi eligibility determinations such as certain types of infrequent or

could not identify category for 50 or more of the dual eligib these data issues make it difficult to fully understand the role of medicaid in providing services to dual eligibles and create challenges in the implementation of the new medicare drug benefit or other policy changes that may affect this group of individuals conclusion dual eligibles represent small share of medicare and medicaid beneficiaries but these individuals have significant health and longterm care needs that are served by two very different and very complex programs significant challenges remain to ensure that beneficiaries can access coordinated understandable package of dicare and medicaid services and low income assistance and that program administrators and providers can easily navigate the administration and ope rations of these two programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32977crs43 appendix estimated medicaid expenditures for dual eligibles by state and category of service fy2002 in millions
