insurance guards savers accounts up to 250000 providing stability to banks and to the economy congress legislated deposit insurance in the 1930s and modified it dozen times in response mainly to financial crises all banks and savings associations must carry this insurance the in surance does not cover deposits held in foreign offices nor deposits above the legislated ceilings despite their importance to very large banks smaller institutions find deposit insurance including extra coverage for certain special accounts very valuable observers have universally deemed federal backing essential as history has shown that guarantees short of the national level are inadequate to prevent panics runs and severe economic damage when called upon the original state funds insuring bank deposits and most of their descendants collapsed under pressure and while private deposit insurance remains vestigially available it is not significant pursuant to pl 10173 and pl 102242 the independent agency federal deposit insurance corporation fdic had two funds both funds were interestearning accounts maintained with the us treasury the bank insurance fund bif dates from 1934

the comptroller of the currency occ or the federal reserve fed the fdic insures some industrial loan companies not otherwise federally regulated see crs report rl32767 industrial loan companiesbanks and the separat ion of banking and commerce legislative and regulatory perspectives by n eric weiss the savings association insurance fund saif was the successor to failed fund the federal savings and loan insurance corporation covering savings institution deposits the office of thrift supervision supervised saif members predominantly thrift institutions many institutions have deposits that the other fund insured because of mergers institutions do not own either fund bif and saif balances were on budget assets of the federal government except for the specific institutions covered bif and saif were essentially identical federal law requires institutions to pay semiannual assessments reflecting their own risk and other factors and makes premiums reflect the relative sizes of fund reserves both funds had target reserve ratios of 125 125 per 100 of insured deposits that percentage is the statutory designated reserve ratio drr when either fund exceeded that value its members did not have to pay assessments unless capital or managerial deficiencies placed them in risk category below the safest in the other direction should either fund fall below its drr institutions must pay to fill the funds shortfall that would greatly increase the nearzero cost of deposit insurance many prefer to smooth out assessments over time as needed to maintain adequate balances which as table 1 shows have fluctuated markedly since 1990 since 2003 fund ratios have been trending downward in the first quarter of 2007 the funds were combined which resulted in drr of 120 in november 2006 the fdic

reform act of 2005 there was contemporary congressional review of deposit insurance that began around 2000 observers began asking questions that persisted for years as follows what should institutions pay for deposit insurance coverage and associated regulation should premiums be smoothed out over time if the balances in bif and ncusif exceed amounts necessary to provide adequate coverage what should be done with the excess would refunds weaken the fdic is or very lowcost deposit insurance subsidy to banks in their competition with nonbank financial firms or does it offset costs of bankonly regulations are there better avenues to monitor and restrain risktaking before it results in fdic and ncusif payouts are so institutions toobigtofail should rapidly growing banks that have paid little or assessments the so called free riders be assessed premiums to compensate for their increased exposure to payouts and decrease in fund reserve ratios what changes affecting fdic operations might apply to credit unions g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 policymakers must weigh many factors key issue is how to provide the benefits of deposit insurance without lessening the incentives for managers to engage in prudent operating practices owners and managers at covered institutions may take on greater risks in the expectation of greater rewards if they know that customers are unlikely to withdraw their insured deposits observers call such behavior moral hazard the effectiveness of examination and supervision arrangements thus has an important bearing on risk exposure of the insurance funds regulation of banks and savings associations to prevent failure ideally would prevent the fdic from having to make good on its guarantee system is failureproof however in competitive economy bad business decisions resulting in closure guide future capital investment away from practices that failed banks and savings associations are not exempt from this fact tradeoffs exist among proposals for change for example increased account coverage could require greater reserves at bif and ncusif making it less likely that the costs of deposit insurance would remain low alternatively should risk increase in financial markets or the funds coverage of insured deposits become very thin institutions might have to pay larger assessments competitive equality is an important consideration for different institutions large versus small banks and savings associations versus credit unions for example expansion of the federal safety net through the fdic and nucsif would have to be funded paym ent would come from institutions taxpayer funding could appears unlikely

g344g342g342g347g561 in the 109th congress chairman don powell suggested that twotiered safety net might cover differing sizes of banks the largest institutions might enter risk pool appropriate for systemic risk protection community banks could remain in much the current arrangement in addition the administrations budget for fy2006 proposed that the bif and saif be merged with the fdic being allowed to set premiums as user charges for increasing insured deposits or aboveaverage risk in the second session of the 109th congress hr 1185 the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 received approval from the house on may 9 2006 s 1562 the safe and fair deposit insurance act of 2005 more limited measure was approved in banking committee markup in october g344g342g342g348g561 the federal deposit insurance reform and the safe and fair deposit insurance acts became part of the prolonged budget reconciliation process on february 8 2006 the resulting package became pl 109171 120 stat 9 the federal deposit insurance conforming amendments act of 2005 pl 109173 119 stat 3601 was enacted on february 15 2006 collectively these laws are referred to as the reform act th reform act would raise fdic collections from insured institutions according to the congressiona l budget office cbo as it appears in the deficit reduction act of 2005 cbo estimated that it would boost net receipt by 25 billion over the next 10 years table 2 is brief summary of the regulatory environment before the reform act and the key provisions of the reform act since its enactment the fdic has merged bif and saif into the dif and has issued notices of proposed rulemaking npr and requests for comment on several of the acts provisions including establishing riskbased assessment system and the drr g344g342g342g349g561 on september 11 2007 the fdic asked for comments on an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr to establish system for providing rebates to insured financial institutions in the event that the dif reaches the upper limit of the reserve ratio the reform act which allows the fdic to manage dif within the range of 115 and 15 must refund the excess payments in the form of dividends to depository institutions that support dif if the fund reaches 15 all the excess must be refunded one part of the anpr requires that the system take into account banks assessment base at the end of 1996 which is proxy for the assessments paid by institutions to recapitalize the fund following the deposit insurance crisis of the 1980s and the early 1990s the fdic named this the fund balance method which would tend to befit older institutions the second parts payment method would take into account only the premiums paid over prior period that is designated by the board rather than all eligible premiums this second approach tends to put new institutions on an equal basis with older institutions more quickly other regulatory and legislative developments concerning the fdic include the fdic board approving twoyear pilot project to test banks and consumers receptivity to smalldollar

expensive credit terms offered by payday lending organizations legislatively the house of representative reported out hr 3526 that would give the fdic office of the comptroller of the currency the power to write rules to identify and prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in addition the house of representatives approved hr 2547 to ban the misrepresentation of financial products as having the protection of federal deposit insurance if they do not have such coverage g344g342g342g350g561 on march 14 2008 as mandated by the reform act of 2005 the fdic board of directors approved the rule for calculating payment of dividends to insured institutions if and when the dif reserve ratio exceeds 135 the banking industry seems to be less concerned about getting back the additional premiums it paid in preferring the fdic not to allow the reserve ratio to exceed 135 the fdic board argued that the thods it approved are simple transparent and do not require constant fdic intervention and decisionmaking which is similar to what the industry advocated however the increased number of bank failures twenty five so far in 2008 including indymac currently under fdics receivership and the largest depository institution failure in the united states history washington mutual bank wamu with assets totaling 307 billion which was merged with jpmorgan chase bank shifted th fdics focus from paying out premium refunds in the form of dividends to restoring the rapidly disappearing deposit insurance fund in addition the fdic expects higher rate of bank failures in the next few years as mentioned above the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund is mandated in the fdic reform act of 2005 to be between 115 and 150 per 10000 of insured deposits the dif declined from 119 as of march 30 2008 to 101 as of june 30 and 76 cents as of september 30 2008 and fdics staffers project that the ratio would fall to 60 cents in 2009 the reform act requires the fdic to establish and implement restoration plan to restore the reserve ratio to at least the 115 per 10000 within five years the fdic published restoration plan see 73 fr 61598 on october 7 2008 through notice of proposed rulemaking npr the rulemaking proposed that effective january 1 2009 the current assessment rate would increase uniformly by 7 basis points for the first quarter of 2009 effective april 1 2009 the rulemaking proposed to alter the way that the fdic riskbased assessment system differentiates across various risks and sets new deposit insurance premiums assessment rates it also postponed other technical changes to the riskbased assessment system on december 17 2008 the fdic issued its final rule only for the first part of the npr it will raise the current assessment for the first 2009 assessment period by uniform 7 basis points the fdic postponed the final rule on the riskbased assessment until the early part of 2009 to be effective in the second assessment period starting april 1 2009 the banking industry expressed disappointment in the magnitude of the assessments and that the fdic implemented them cross theboard many analysts have argued that the assessments are procyclical because they are being raised at time when the banks are least able to pay them due to declining profits and arguably this further reduce the banks ability to increase lending during recession
