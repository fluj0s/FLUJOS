alan kronstadt specialist in asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary this report provides summary review of issues related to pakistan and terrorism especially in the context of us interests policy goals and relevant assistance1 the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22632 outcomes of us policies toward pakistan since 911 while not devoid of meaningful successes have neither neutralized antiwestern militants and reduced religious extremism in that country nor have they contributed sufficiently to the stabilization of neighboring afghanistan many observers thus urge broad reevaluation of such policies this report will be updated periodically in the wake of the september 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states president george w bush launched major military operations as part of global usled anti terrorism effort operation enduring freedom in afghanistan has realized major successes with the vital assistance of neighboring pakistan yet resurgent taliban today operates in southern and eastern afghanistan with the benefit of apparent sanctuary in parts of western pakistan the united states is increasingly concerned that members of qaeda its taliban supporters and other islamist militants find safe haven in pakistani cities such as quetta and peshawar as well as in the rugged pakistanafghanistan border region this latter area is inhabited by ethnic pashtuns who express solidarity with anti us forces qaeda militants also reportedly have made alliances with indigenous pakistani terrorist groups that have been implicated in both antiwestern attacks in pakistan and terrorism in india these groups seek to oust the islamabad government of president gen pervez musharraf and have been implicated in assassination attempts that were only narrowly survived by the pakistani leader and other top officials in fact pakistans struggle with militant islamist extremism appears for some to have become matter of survival for that country as more evidence arises exposing qaedas deadly new alliance with indigenous pakistani militants and related conflict continues to cause death and disruption in pakistans western regions concern about pakistans fundamental political and social stability has increased in his january 2007 state of the 1 sources for this report include inter alia the us departments of state and defense congressional transcripts intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations regional press reports and major newswires crs2 union address president bush said we didnt drive qaeda out of their safe haven in afghanistan only to let them set up new safe haven in free iraq yet many observers warn that an american preoccupation with iraq has contributed to allowing the emergence of new qaeda safe havens in western pakistan us policy and concerns south asia is viewed as key arena in the fight against militant religious extremism most especially in pakistan and as related to afghan stability in november 2006 the state departments under secretary for political affairs nicholas burns said it is in south asia where our future success in the struggle against global terrorism will likely be decided in afghanistan and pakistan2 the 911 commission report emphasized that mounting largescale international terrorist attacks appears to require sanctuaries in which terrorist groups can plan and operate with impunity it further claimed that pakistans vast unpoliced regions remained attractive to extremist groups the commission identified the government of president musharraf as the best hope for stability in pakistan and afghanistan and recommended that the united states make longterm commitment to provide comprehensive support for islamabad so long as pakistan itself is committed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22632 to combating extremism and to policy of enlightened moderation3 in january 2007 senate testimony assessing global threats the outgoing director of national intelligence john negroponte captured in two sentences the dilemma pakistan now poses for us policy makers pakistan is frontline partner in the war on terror nevertheless it remains major source of islamic extremism and the home for some top terrorist leaders in what were surely wellcalculated remarks he went on to identify qaeda as posing the single greatest terrorist threat to the united states and its interests and warned that the organizations core elements maintain active connections and relationships that radiate outward from their leaders secure hideouts in pakistan4 this latter reference was considered the strongest such statement to date by highranking bush administration official throughout the opening months of 2007 administration officials us military commanders and senior us senators issued further incriminating statements about pakistans assumed status as terrorist base and the allegedly insufficient response of the islamabad government the united states also remains concerned with indigenous extremist groups in pakistan and with the ongoing crossborder infiltration of islamist militants who traverse the kashmiri line of control and other borders to engage in terrorist acts in india and indian kashmir many analysts consider such activities conceptually inseparable from the problem of islamist militancy in western pakistan and in afghanistan domestic terrorism in pakistan much of it associated with islamist sectarianism has become an increasingly serious problem affecting major pakistani cities separatist violence in indias muslimmajority jammu and kashmir state has continued unabated since 1989 2 us policy in south asia nov 27 2006 at httpwwwstategovpusrm200676984htm 3 the 911 commission report at httpwwwgpoaccessgov911 pervez musharraf

some notable relative decline in recent years many experts reject efforts by the pakistani government and others to draw significant distinctions between us and indiandesignated terrorist groups fighting in kashmir and those fighting in western pakistan and afghanistan and in pakistans interior india blames pakistan for the infiltration of islamist militants into indian kashmir charge islamabad denies the united states reportedly has received pledges from islamabad that all crossborder terrorism would cease and that any terrorist facilities in pakistanicontrolled areas would be closed similar pledges have been made to india numerous experts raise questions about the determination sincerity and effectiveness of pakistani government efforts to combat religious extremists doubts are widely held by western experts many of whom express concerns about the implications of maintaining present us policies toward the region and about the efficacy of islamabads latest strategy which appears to seek reconciliation with protaliban militants5 islamabad is adamant in asserting that it serves its own selfinterests through closer relations with the united states since 2001 that there should be doubts about the sincerity of its antiterrorism policies with corollary that any failings in this area are rooted in pakistans capabilities rather than in its intentions and that solely military httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22632 efforts to combat religious militancy are bound to fail instead pakistani officials aver the socalled war on terrorism must emphasize socioeconomic uplift and resolution of outstanding disputes in the muslim world including in kashmir palestine and iraq6 the outcomes of us policies toward pakistan since 911 while not devoid of meaningful successes have neither neutralized antiwestern militants and reduced religious extremism in that country nor have they contributed sufficiently to the stabilization of neighboring afghanistan many observers thus urge broad reevaluation of such policies including questioning of seeming us reliance on the institution of the pakistani military and on the person of president musharraf along with shifting of considerable us assistance funds toward programs that might better engender longterm stability in pakistan7 congressional action in june 2003 president bush hosted president musharraf at camp david maryland where he vowed to work with congress on establishing fiveyear 3 billion aid package for pakistan annual installments of 600 million each split evenly between military and economic aid began in fy2005 in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 the 108th congress broadly endorsed the recommendations of the 911 commission report by calling for us aid to pakistan to be sustained at minimum of fy2005 levels and requiring the president to report to congress description 5 see paul wiseman is pakistan doing its part in the war on terrorism usa today

longterm us strategy to engage with and support pakistan the premiere house resolution of the 110th congress hr 1 the implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 was passed in january 2007 section 1442 of the act contains discussion of us policy toward pakistan including requirement that the president report to congress longterm us strategy for engaging pakistan and making statement of policy that further waivers of couprelated aid sanctions should be informed by the pace of democratic reform extension of the rule of law and the conduct of the parliamentary elections scheduled to take place in late 2007 perhaps most notably the section includes provision that would end us military assistance and arms sales licensing to that country in fy2008 unless the president certifies that the islamabad government is making all possible efforts to end taliban activities on pakistani soil many analysts view section 1442 as signal that democraticcontrolled congress may pressure the bush administration to review its pakistan policy although many also warn that such overt conditionality is counterproductive to the goal of closer us pakistan relations the bush administration explicitly opposes the certification provision on such grounds and it instead urges that the certification be replaced with reporting requirement8 senate version of the house bill s 4 was passed in march but contains httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22632 pakistanspecific language in response to us congressional signals of possible shift in us policy toward islamabad the pakistani national assemblys defense committee unanimously passed resolution threatening to end or reduce islamabads cooperation on counterterrorism if us aid to pakistan were to be made conditional us government assistance and policy options direct us foreign assistance and coalition support funding in the years since september 2001 pakistan has received nearly 15 billion in direct us securityrelated assistance foreign military financing totaling 970 million plus about 516 million for other programs congress also has appropriated billions of dollars to reimburse pakistan for its support of usled counterterrorism operations some 80 of defense department spending for coalition support payments to pakistan jordan and other key cooperating nations has gone to islamabad at 475 billion to date averaging more than 80 million per month the amount is equal to more than onequarter of pakistans total military expenditures the bush administration requested another 1 billion in emergency supplemental coalition support funds for fy2007 however hr 1591 passed by the full house on march 23 2007 called for only 300 million in such funds the administration also has requested another 17 billion in coalition support for fy2008 in justifying these requests the administration claims that coalition support payments to pakistan have led to more stable pakistanafghanistan border area arms transfers major us defense sales and grants in recent years have included advanced aircraft and missiles the pentagon reports foreign military sales fms agreements with pakistan worth 836 million in fy2003fy2005 inprocess sales of f16 combat aircraft raised the fy2006 value to nearly 35 billion in june 2006 the pentagon notified congress of planned fms for pakistan worth up to 51 8 david montero

up to 36 advanced f16s along with related refurbishments munitions and equipment and would represent the largestever weapons sale to pakistan the pentagon has characterized f16 fighters p3c maritime patrol aircraft and antiarmor missiles as having significant antiterrorism applications claim that elicits skepticism from some analysts security assistance securityrelated us assistance programs for pakistan are said to be aimed especially at bolstering islamabads counterterrorism and border security efforts and have included usfunded roadbuilding projects in western pakistan and the provision of nightvision equipment communications gear protective vests and transport helicopters and aircraft the united states also has undertaken to train and equip new pakistan army air assault units that can move quickly to find and target terrorist elements us security assistance to pakistans civilian sector is aimed at strengthening the countrys law enforcement capabilities through basic police training provision of advanced identification systems and establishment of new counterterrorism special investigation group us efforts may be hindered by pakistani shortcomings that include poorly trained and poorly equipped personnel who generally are underpaid by ineffectively coordinated and overburdened government agencies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22632 possible adjustments to us assistance programs many commentators on us assistance programs for pakistan have recommended making adjustments to the proportion of funds devoted to military versus economic aid andor to the objectives of such programs currently funds are split roughly evenly between economic and security related aid programs with the great bulk of the former going to general economic budget support fund and most of the latter financing big ticket defense articles such as airborne early warning aircraft and antiship and antiarmor missiles it may be useful to better target us assistance programs in such way that they more effectively benefit the countrys citizens one former senior senate staffer has called for improving americas image in pakistan by making us aid more visible to ordinary pakistanis9 an idea commonly floated by analysts is the conditioning of aid to pakistan perhaps through the creation of benchmarks for example in 2003 task force of senior american south asia watchers issued report on us policy in the region which included recommendation that the extent of us support for islamabad should be linked to that governments own performance in making pakistan more modern progressive and democratic state as promised by president musharraf in january 2002 specifically the task force urged directing twothirds of us aid to economic programs and onethird to security assistance and conditioning increases in aid amounts to progress in pakistans reform agenda10 more recent perspective is representative of ongoing concerns about the emphases of us aid programs the united states has given musharraf considerable slack in meeting his commitments to deal with domestic extremism or his promises to restore authentic democracy the us partnership with pakistan would probably be on firmer footing 9 lisa curtis denying terrorists safe haven in pakistan heritage foundation backgrounder 1981 oct 26 2006 at httpwwwheritageorgresearchasiaandthepacific uploadbg_1981pdf 10 httpwwwasiasocietyorgpolicy_businessindiasouthasia103003pdf crs6 through conditioned programs more dedicated to building the countrys political and social institutions than rewarding its leadership11 other analysts however including those making policy for the bush administration believe that conditioning us aid to pakistan has past record of failure and likely would be counterproductive some add that putting additional pressure on an already besieged musharraf government might lead to significant political instability in islamabad the bush administration has come under fire from some quarters for overemphasizing its relationship with the person of pervez musharraf an army general who came to power through extraconstitutional means at the expense of democratization processes in pakistan and further for maintaining singleminded focus on antiterrorism that has given pass to musharraf and the pakistani military in the areas of nuclear proliferation rule of law and human rights for several years veteran pakistan watchers have been calling attention to the potential problems inherent in us overreliance on president musharraf as an individual at alleged cost to more positive development of pakistans democratic institutions and civil society12 in 2006 two former senior us diplomats jointly urged the bush administration to move beyond its fairly httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22632 limited focus on the person of pervez musharraf by creating better links with wider array of prodemocracy civil society elements there13 more substantive militarytomilitary relations could be of significant benefit to overall uspakistan relations and the attainment of us goals in south asia related sanctions imposed on pakistan in 1990 were in some respects harmful to subsequent us interests in the region for example the suspension of military training imet programs meant that for more than decade there was exchange between the pakistani and us militaries washingtonbased expert on the pakistani military has insisted that such exchanges are crucial in encouraging liberal secular outlook among pakistans officer corps and provide the united states unique access to that countrys leading institution14 in apparent response to growing concerns about the course of events in pakistan and in uspakistan relations assistant secretary of state for south and central asian affairs richard boucher met with top pakistani leaders in islamabad in midmarch where he lauded pakistans role as vital us ally and announced new fiveyear 750 million aid initiative for development programs in pakistans western tribal regions the administration also will seek pentagon authority to spend 75 million in fy2007 funds to improve the capacity of pakistans paramilitary frontier corps 11 marvin
