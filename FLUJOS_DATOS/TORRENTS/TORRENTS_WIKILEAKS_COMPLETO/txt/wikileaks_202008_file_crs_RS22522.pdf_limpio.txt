wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22522 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rs22522 potential challenges to us farm subsidies in the wto brief overview randy schnepf and jasper womach resources science and industry division june 1 2007 abstract this report examines us commodity subsidy programs against an emerging set of criteria that test their potential vulnerability to challenge in the world trade organization the criteria are whether the subsidies cause adverse eﬀects contributing to serious prejudice under the agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures scm articles 5 and 63 when measured against these criteria available evidence suggests that all major us subsidy program crops particularly crops receiving beneﬁts under both the countercyclical payments program and marketing loan provisions are potentially vulnerable to dispute settlement challenges if such challenges occur and are successful the wto remedy likely would imply either elimination alteration or amendment by congress of the programs in question to remove their adverse eﬀects alternately in light of an adverse ruling the united states could choose to make compensatory payments under agreement with the challenging country to oﬀset the alleged injury in spite of us vulnerability there are reasons why challenges may rarely be ﬁled disputes are economically and diplomatically costly and lost challenge can help to legitimize the disputed programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22522g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

of trading rules including constraints on domestic subsidies and process for challenging violations now the combination of three relatively recent events1 the expiration of the wto peace clause on january 1 2004 2 brazils successful challenge of certain provisions of the us cotton program in wto dispute settlement proceeding upheld on appeal in march 2005 and 3 the indefinite suspension of the doha round of wto trade negotiations in july 2006have raised concerns that us farm programs could be subject to new wave of wto dispute settlement challenges the peace clause had provided protection for actionable subsidies provided they met certain compliance conditions now an agricultural subsidy may be challenged under claims of adverse effects in agricultural marketseven if the subsidy remains within specified spending limits the potential list of actionable subsidies includes export subsidies amber box blue box green box and minimis domestic support measures see crs report rl32916 agriculture in the wto policy commitments made under the agreement on agriculture by randy schnepf for an explanation of these categories in particular the serious prejudice claim of the agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures scm article 5c according to expert opinion is lower threshold for achieving successful challenges than the injury requirement under countervailing duty claim if challenges are successful the wto remedy likely would imply either elimination alteration or amendment by congress of the programs in question to remove their adverse effects since most governing provisions over us farm programs ar statutory new legislation could be required to implement even minor changes to achieve compliance alternately in light of an adverse ruling the united states could choose to make compensatory payments under agreement with the challenging country to offset the alleged injury usda secretary johanns has stated that one of his primary objectives for the 2007 farm bill is to make us farm programs beyond challenge this objective was translated into specifics in the administrations 2007 farm bill proposals nevertheless some trade specialists argue that numerous new wto challenges of us farm support are unlikely they contend that challenges require intense effort the financial costs are high and the broader geopolitical consequences may far outweigh any potential trade gains few developing countries have the needed resources for challenge in addition there is the inherent risk that if the challenge fails the effort could legitimize those very programs targeted for discipline however in january 2007 canada requested consultations with the united states under the auspices of the wto case ds357 to discuss three explicit charges against us farm programs that corn subsidies have caused serious prejudice to canadian producers in the form of market price suppression that the export credit guarantee program operates as an illegal export subsidy and that fixed direct payments are not green box compliant and should be counted as amber box payments putting the united states in violation of its 191 billion amber box spending limit in six of the past eight years g15g142g138g156g158g155g146g151g144g561g24g158g149g151g142g155g138g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 based on precedent from wto past decisions several criteria are important in establishing the existence of adverse effects contributing to serious prejudice 1 the subsidies constitute substantial share of farmer returns or cover substantial share of production costs 2 the subsidized commodity is important to world markets because it forms large share of either world production or world trade and 3 there is causal relationship between the subsidy and adverse effects in the relevant market t

focus on those programs that are production and tradedistorting ie amber box or that have been exempted from the amber box under the blue box minimis or green box criteria but can be shown to cause adverse effects in certain markets to identify commodities that are potentially vulnerable to wto challenges usda data are used to measure the level of subsidy dependence then those commodities identified as depending heavily on government subsidies are evaluated in terms of the potential for the subsidies to be linked to ad verse effects in international commodity markets

only with the subsidies that these commodities cover their total cost and even this was not accomplished for sorghum and wheat in the most extreme case market revenue for rice amounted to 70 of total costs but with the addition of subsidies the total revenue amounted to 146 of total costs

calculated by crs from usda data these comparisons suggest that only with the aid of subsidies is substantial portion of us production made economically sustainable unanswered is the question of whether production would decline without the subsidies some and possibly substantial portion of the lost production from highcost farms that would leave the sector in the absence of subsidies would be offset by increased production from lowcost farms that would likely expand their operations nonetheless the substantial contribution of bsidies toward covering otherwise unmet produc tion costs implies high chance for adverse rulin gs for any of the major covered commodities

direct payments the 2002 farm bill successor to production flexibility contract payments are on average the largest and most constant commodity subsidy payments countercyclical payments and marketing loan program payments as well as milk income loss payments have the greatest variation and are large by design in years when market prices are low the cotton user marketing program commonly called the step 2 program has been terminated by change in the law subsequent to the wto cotton ruling and expenditures will drop to zero in fy2007 there are purchase programs for milk and sugar to remove supplies from the market when prices fall below mandated support levels but federal costs are comparatively low because price support largely is achieved through import restrictions crop insurance is another sizable and growing direct subsidy program benefitting primarily the major crops but other crops as well table 2 provides detailed expenditure data for the major subsidy programs some wto members including the eu have argued that benefits from us marketing loan provisions should be classified as prohibited export subsidies they contend that these subsidies effectively behave like an export subsidy however under scm article 3 an export subsidy must be based specifically on export performa nce or upon use of domestic over imported goods the mere fact that subsidy is granted to enterprises that export shall not for that reason alone be considered to be an export subsidy the united states maintains that all of its farm programs

therefore in compliance furthermore wto member has challenged the benefits obtained by us producers under the marketing loan provisions as prohibited subsidies federal crop insurance costs have grown in recent years because the level of subsidy on each policy has increased and the pool of subsidized commodities and production locations has grown since fy2002 government net outlays including premium subsidies and government losssharing and delivery costs have averaged more than 3 billion annually future growth according to january 2006 report by the food and agriculture policy research institute fapri is expected to raise net outlays to over 4 billion by 2008 and 46 billion by 2015 this higher expenditure level could bring the crop insurance program under greater scrutiny from trade competitors while crop insurance is available widely 68 of the subsidy over the fy2002fy2006 period went to five cropscorn 20 wheat 18 soybeans 16 cotton 9 and sorghum 6and fully 75 of the total crop insurance coverage went to the program crops while the remaining 25 went to the nonprogram crops when total premiums including farmer and federal contributions are compared to indemnity payments the loss ratio was 109 giving the overall appearance of being actuarially sound however if the federal premium subsidy is excluded the loss ratio is 270 indemnities were 27 times higher than farmer

several economic studies have investigated the causality linkage between us agricultural policy support and the adverse market effects identified in scm article 63 ie lost market share quantity displacement and suppression of market prices in general these studies support the idea that us and other developed country agricultural support programs negatively influence international market prices and tend to disadvantage thirdcountry trade of nonsubsidized like products the longer version of this report crs report rl33697 potential challenges to us farm subsidies in the wto by randy schnepf summarizes these studies g25g22g17g561g20g142g150g142g141g146g142g156g561 the remedy to successful wto legal challenge of subsidy program depends on the nature of the subsidyprohibited versus actionableand on the recommendation of the panel hearing the case prohibited subsidies must be withdrawn without delay scm article 47 according to time period specified by the panel in its recommendation if withdrawal is not accomplished within the specified time frame then the dispute settlement body dsb shall grant authorization to the complaining member to take appropriate retaliatory countermeasures scm article 410 with respect to actionable subsidies the remedy is to remove the subsidys adverse effects or withdraw the subsidy scm article 78 the subsid izing party is given some leeway in deciding how to remove the adverse effect options could include eliminating the subsidy program reducing the subsidy amounts reducing the linkage between the subsidy and the adverse effects eg decoupling or making some sort of mutually acceptable compensatory payment furthermore if the recommendation is not follow ed within six months of the adoption of the panel report or the appellate body report on appeal then the dsb shall grant the complaining member authority to take appropriate retaliatory countermeasures commensurate with the degree and nature of the adverse effects determined to exist scm article 79 an arbitrator may be asked to determine whether proposed countermeasures are commensurate

against wto criteria all major us subsidized crops both covered commodities and loan commodities appear potentially vulnerable to wto legal challenges furthermore several commodities may be more vulnerable to challenges because of impacts in specific export markets rather than on global basis or in subproduct domestic and export markets another important concern is the potential for certain us farm programs eg foreign market development programs to be ruled prohibited subsidies when subject to detailed analysis by wto panel review of recent economic analyses suggests that partial us policy reform such as the us doharound proposal to reduce us amber box spending by 60 would provide only modest reduction in adverse effects in international markets this happens because the united states plays such large role in world commodity mark ets as result us subsidy programs would appear vulnerable to wto challenge under scm article 5 and 63 following even such policy reform the most clear method for decreasing exposure to wto legal challenges is through extensive decoupling ie remove the linkage between payments and producer or consumer behavior such decoupling would sever the causality linkage necessary to accomplish successful wto challenge several options for decoupling have been considered or discussed as part of the ongoing 2007 farm bill debate these include fully decoupled direct payments wholefarm revenueinsurancetype programs and conservation or green payments the attraction of these alternatives is their likely qualification as green box programs the costs thus would fall outside the wtos aggregate measures of support ams spending limits g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 randy schnepf
