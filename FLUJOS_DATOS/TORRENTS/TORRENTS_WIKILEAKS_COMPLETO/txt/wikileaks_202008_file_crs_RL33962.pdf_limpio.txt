initiative summary in the absence of federal program requiring greenhouse gas ghg emission reductions growing group of us states are taking action in this arena significant actions have been undertaken in californi and by coalition of states from the northeast and midatlantic regions california has undertaken several initiatives that seek to reduce ghg emissions in 2004 the state issued regulations to reduce ghg emissions from motor vehicles at least 14 other states have indicated that they plan to implement californias new vehicle requirements in 2006 california passed two climate change statutes the first establishes statewide cap on ghg emissions the second once it becomes applicable effectively limits the use of coalgenerated electricity in california the state has also taken action to reduce the carbon intensity in its transportation fuels the regional greenhouse gas initiative r ggi partnership of10 northeast and midatlantic states sets up capandtrade system aimed at limiting carbon dioxide emissions from power plants the cap is scheduled to take effect in january 2009 and cap carbon dioxide emissions at 188 million short tons through the end of 2014 in 2015 the cap would begin to decrease so that by 2018 emissions would be capped at 10 below the initial level because some observers see rggi as possible model for federal capandtrad program several of rggis design elements are generating interest and debate predicting the precise consequences of these stateled climate change actions is difficult the actions may affect energy markets to some degree by encouraging the use of fewer carbonintensive fuels many observers suggest that the range of state actions will catalyze federal activity industr stakeholders are especially concerned that the states will create patchwork of climate change regulations across the nation this prospect is causing some industry leaders to call for federal climate change program if congress seeks to establish federal program the experiences and lessons learned in the states may be instructive the rggi and climate change activities in california are aggressive but the resulting emission reductions ma be offset by increased emissions in states without such requirements this is primary limitation of state climate change programs legal challenges to the state actions particularly those that may affect interstate commerce represent another obstaclehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33962contents introduction 1 climate change actions in california 1 s t t w i d m i s s i n r d u c t i n p r g r m 2 i m p l m n

states to address greenhouse gas emissions by jonathan l ramseurgreenhouse gas reductions california action and the regional greenhouse gas initiative introduction the connection between greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the atmosphere and climate change has motivated effort s to achieve reductions of ghg emissions1 in 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countries to initiate ghg reduction however in early 2001 presiden t george w bush rejected the unfccc 1997 kyoto protocol which called for gally binding commitments by developed countries to reduce their ghg emissions in the absence of federal progra m requiring ghg reductions growing number of us states are taking action in this arena although majority of states have addressed c limate change to some degree g by creating ghg inventories or state action plans2 the most aggressive actions have come from smaller group of states including california and coalition of states from the northeast and mid atlantic regions california recently enacted several ws that seek to reduce ghg emissions the first section of this report discusses the activity in california the second section focuses on the regional greenhous gas initiative rggi cooperative effort of 10 states in the northeast and midatlantic regions to reduce carbon

stateled climate change actions climate change actions in california in the environmental policy domain california is generally on the more proactive side of the regulatory spectrum the states recent climate change actions continue this pattern ca lifornia has enacted several significant pieces of climate change legislation each addressing ghg missions in different ways

gas emissions and sinks 1990 to 2004 final staff report december 22 2006 p 4implementation although ab 32 is farreaching in principle the laws text does not include many crucial details instead the statute grants considerable authority to carb which is charged with establishing the framework and applicability of the program for example the law does not specifically require the use of marketbased system such as capandtrade program to reduce ghg emissions instead ab 32 authorizes carb to develop regulations to achieve the maximum technologically feasible nd costeffective greenhouse gas emission reductions moreover the statute does not include list of regulated emission sources or categories but instructs ca rb to determine which sources should be controlled to meet the statewide target these decisions which will likely affect the entire california economy to some degr ee entrust carb with significant responsibility although the law grants considerable discretion to carb the statute does dictate schedule for various agency d eadlines the following dates highlight significant milestones of the mandatory schedule june 30 2007 carb was to iden tify the early reduction options which can be implemented prior to the mandatory program and for which facility will receive emissions credit on april 20 2007 carb submitted proposed early actions which are to be implemented via regulation and

the emission control regulation and as result emission abatement achieved in one location that is subject to emission control regulation is offset by increased emissions in unregulated locations6 in recognition of emissions leakage th statute requires regulators to account for ghg emissions created by any source of electricity that is consumed in california carb must develop structur that will count emissions connected with electricity that is generated from outside th state without this provision california utilities might have financial incentive to import more electricity from outofstate generators who are not subject to the cap in such scenario california emissions would decrease but the benefit would be negated by increased uncounted emissions or leakage in neighboring states linkage with other emissions trading programs when developing the emission reduction progra m in california ab 32 instructs carb to consider other ghg reduction regimes including the regional greenhouse gas initiative discussed below and the european ions emission trading program this instruction might open the door for future emissions trading between california and other states to catalyze this trad ing relationship ca lifornia governor schwarzenegger issued an executive order7 just few weeks after signing ab 32 calling for carb and other state agencies to create marketbased compliance program with the goal of creating progra m that permits trading with the european union the regional greenhouse gas in itiative and other jurisdictions8 regional emission reduction program

wci is an agreement between the states governors to implement th program the states legislatures would need to enact laws to carry out the initiatives objectives this may present an obstacle if states legislative branch finds fault with th reduction program veloped by states executive branch officials in addition the inclusion of british columbia and manitoba may raise legal issues particularly constitutional concerns article i section 10 clause 3 of the us constitution st ates that state shall without the consent of congress enter into any agr eement or compact with another state or with

fo r the electricity sector that aims to influence investment in longterm power generation although not directly requiring emission reductions or offsets from specific facilities or sources the standard should influence future ghg mission levels by ffecting which energy sources coal oil natural gas etc are used to generate electricity for consumers the ghg performance standard pursuant to legislation enacted in september 2006 sb 1368 forbids electricity producers loadserving entities10 from entering into new longterm financial commitments11 with power plants unless the plants ghg emissions are as low or lowe r than those of new combinedcycle natural gas facility this emissions performance standard will apply to both instate power plants and outofstate facilities that seek to export electricity to california the law directs the california public utilities commission puc to issue standards for investorowned facilities which in 2003 accounted for 68 of the electricity consumed in california12 the puc issued interim performance standards january 25 2007 to address the electricity c onsumption from publicly owned utilities13 the statute directs the california energy

other states in the west although california s electricity imports generally fall between 22 and 32 of the states total electric ity consumption its imports are responsible for 39 to 57 of the total

requested waiver as required by section 209 of the clean air act in d ecember 2005 but the epa has yet to respond although the epa has approved every ca lifornia waiver request since 1975 it displayed reluctance to use the clean air act to control ghg emissions arguing in federal court that the clean air act does not authorize the epa to regulate ghg emissions for the purpose of addressing climate change28 however an april 2 2007 supreme court decision massachusetts v epa 29 provided clarification on this issue th court found doubt that the clean air act gives epa the authority to regulate ghg emissions in this case from new motor vehicles after the decision some obser vers speculated that the clean air act waiver would be the most direct impact of the decision epa administrator johnson

rhode island and vermont to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants rggi has been under development since 2003 when states from the northeast and datlantic regions began to discuss setting up cooperative effort to redu ce carbon dioxide emissions subsequent meetings and workshops culminated in memorandum of understanding mou that was signed in december 2005 prima ry strategy of rggi is to create program with flexibility so that in the future other emission sourcessectors ghgs and states could be included the initiative would set up the nations first mandatory capandtrade program for carbon dioxide starting in january 2009 rggi states have agreed to implement cap of 188 million short tons of carbon diox ide emissions from power plants the cap is intended to stabilize emissions through the end of 2014 in 2015 and each subsequent year the emissions cap would be lowered incrementally so that by 2018 the cap would be 10 below the initial level36httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33962crs11 37 vermont new york maine and massachusetts for example 38 for example in the us sulfur dioxide trading system the epa sets aside 28 of its annual allowances to be sold at auction the european unions emission trading system eu ets allows nation states to withhold 5 of their nations allowances for auction although only 4 of the 27 eu mber states have chosen to auction portion of their allowances the amount available for auction will increase to 10 in 2008in capandtrade system regulators set cap or limit on the overall emissions of given gas from specified group of sources such as power plants the emissions allowed under the new cap are then allocated in the form of credits or permits to individual sources sources that emit more than their allowance must buy credits from those who emit less than their allowance thus creating financial incentive for sources to re duce their own emissions the rggi capandtrade program is to be implemented by the individual states each rggi state will need to establish its own law andor regulation to administer and enforce the emissions reduction progra m however each state will base its lawregulation on detailed model rule that was developed by the participant states to facilitate administration of the trading program the mou calls for the states to create nonprofit regional organization th is organization is to provide technical assistance to the rggi states and help maintain consistent implementation across state lines depending on various design deta ils capandtrade systems can vary significantly the cap level and cap applicability ie when the cap takes effect and which sources are affected are perhaps the primary variables regarding the impact of the program other details such as emission allocation and whether to include safety valve can further alter the character of capandtrade program some observers consider rggi to be model for possible federal capandtrade program and thus several of rggis design elem ents are generating interest and debate these issues are discussed below emission allocation one specific feature of rggi the emission allocation scheme is drawing both praise and criticism in both rggi s memorandum of u nderstanding and its model rule states agreed that at least 25 of emission allowances will be allocated for consumer benefit or strategic ergy purpose this action would require power plants to purchase the setaside allowances most likely through an auction instead of receiving them at charge several states37 have indicated that they intend to allocate 100 of their states allowances through an auction process in other emission trading programs auctions have been used but to much lesser extent38 stakeholders have raised various issu regarding this format for example power companies may not be able to share part of the allowance costs with theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33962crs12 39 dallas burtraw and karen palmer summary of the

contract39 on the other hand if utilities are able to pass along th additional costs consumers worry that their electricity bills may increase policymakers have some flexibility to address these issues because they can decide how best to use the revenues generated from the allowance auction for in stance states could use th auction revenues to provide tax cuts to the affected industries or to assist lowincome fa milies with paying for increases in energy bills largely due to this flexibility the auction approach is considered more costeffective than dist ributing allowances for free based on past or predicted emission rates40 for more discussion regarding these issues see crs report rl33799 climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction program by larry parker safety valve in capandtrade system safety valve allows policymakers to control the costs of complying with the emissions reduction program traditional safety valve would allow affected sources eg power plants to purchase credits at fixed price xton of carbon dioxide instead of reducing missions the price cap could be set high enough above market value so that fac ilities would consider it only during extreme circumstances or unforeseen events thus the incentive to reduce emissions would remain but the price cap or safety valve would assure the industry that it will not have runaway compliance costs41 the main disadvantage of safety valve is that its inclusion may limit the desired emission reductions especially if the safety valve is set too close to market value in add ition price cap may keep costs low enough that this would reduce the economic in centive to invest in new technologies rggi does not have safety valve in this traditional sense however rggi does allow for compliance flexibility if the carbon dioxide allowance price reaches certain level for example if certain price thresholds are breached42 facilities receive an additional year to demonstrate emissions reductions also in these cases companies may cover greater proportion of their emissions by purchasing credits from other facilities or other allowable emission offsets instead of reducing emissions internally if national capandtrade regime were adopted traditional safety valve might become an important bargaining chip re portedly the lack of price cap which could control costs to industry and

program are important considerations fo r policymakers in general carbon dioxide cap level and start date represent balance between the benefits of climate change mitigation and the economic burden imposed on the affected sources44 political feasibility is often factor when setting an emissions cap45 the rggi 2009 cap was not based entirely on past emission levels or expect ed levels but was developed through negotiation among the states46 one emissions cap strategy is to establish cap that would take effect relatively quickly but only require stabilization or modest reduction in emissions the rggi cap resembles this approach an advantage to this strategy is that it allows market forces to affect behavior at an earlier da for example couraging technological development or influencin g investment decisions in less carbonintensive energy sources it is uncertain whether rggis in itial cap 188 million short tons of carbon dioxide will be higher than actual missions when it takes effect in 2009 figure 3 the cap is slightly above about 4 the average emission levels observed between 2000 and 2002 rggi designers antic ipated that emissions would gradually increase so that actual levels would pproximately match the cap in 2009 however figure 3 indicates this may not occur emissions were relativ ely stable between 2001 and 2004 they increased in 2005 but dropped substantially in 200647 figure 3 shows the 2006 emissions are 13 below the 2009 cap if actual emissions are below the cap when it goes into effect the effectiveness of the rggi program may be impacted th allowance price might drop to such low level that facilities would have financial incentive to make reductions beyond their required allocation48 this potential problem may be alleviated by

sources to bank emi ssion reductions for future use when the cap will likely be lower than expected emissions the rggi program allows unlimited banking th ability to bank reductions effectively spreads the costs of emission reduction over time banking emissions would reduce compliance costs in the future but also increase the value of current allowances because they can be sold later the

h ttpcaitwriorg emission cap or states could retain the unsold allowances and sell them in future auctions50 this second option would distribut costs over more years and likely help control price volatility there is some indication that states that employ an auction will use reserve price51 emissions leakage critical design detail electricity imports from nonrggi states remains unresolved rggi faces the same leakage challenge as california for example if an rggi state lowers its emissions by importing more power from nonrggi state the emissions reductions in the r ggi state would likely be negated by an emission increase or leakage in the expor ting state the opportunities for leakage are partially related to the price differe nce between highcarbon fuels and lowcarbon fuels for instance if the price of natural gas rises in comparison to coal there will be more of an incentive to import the cheaper electricity from nonrggi states rggi states have established working group to examine how best to address this issue the group plans to submit report to state agency leaders by december 2007 issues for congress the regional greenhouse gas initiativ rggi and the climate change developments in california raise several issues that may be of interest to congress this section discusses some of the potentia l effects of these actions by states the limitations of these actions and legal challenges that may hinder or halt implementation of the mission reduction programs potential effects of state actions from global perspective many us states emit significant amounts of ghgs if individual us states were classified as sovereign nations 18 us states would rank in the top 50 for nations that nnually emit the primary ghg carbon dioxide52 compared with other nations texas the

maine maryland massachusetts new hampshire new jersey new york and vermont rhode island is expected to soon join and its emissions are included above states as policy laboratories primary argument in support of individual or cooperative stat climate change action is that states can serve as laboratories for policymaking states can test different id eas and policies on smaller scale and help determine which climate change solutions are most appropriate many of the r ggi states and california have acted as pioneers in other environmental policy venues for exampl automobile emissions standards in california and acid rain provi sions in new england states such programs often act as precursors or even models to federal envir onmental regimes most federal legislative proposals that seek to control ghg emissions would employ capandtrade emissions regime53 there has been some debate regarding how capandtrade program might work on national level although the federal acid rain program which involves sulfur dioxide emissions trading is generally considered success some emissions trad ing programs have encountered problemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33962crs17 54 for example the southern californias regional clean air incentives market reclaim which was implemented in 1994 to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides nox and sulfur dioxide so2 saw 50fold increase in nox allowance prices during the 20002001 california energy crisis the european unions ghg trading system has also experienced drastic swings in allowance pric during its startup years making planning and decision making difficult for participatin g entities for additional information on the eu trading system see crs report rl33581 climate change the european unions emissions trading system euets by larry parker 55 the question of whether and in what circ umstances states can regulate interstate commerce may raise legal questions which are discussed belowduring implementation54 state programs such as rggi may offer the opportunity to iron out logistical details that would be crucial in national capandtrade system which sources to regulate how to allocate emissions allowances how high to set the emissions cap when to allow offsets instead of actual reductions whether to include safety valve and if so how high to set it state programs can inform federal policymakers in other ways the political process by which states create climate change policy can be enlightening and perhaps adaptable on the federal level for instance by examining the development and passage of state legislation federa l policymakers may better understand the motivations of different stakeholders nd learn how best to frame the issues possible economic impacts the mandatory emission reduction programs in california and rggi will likely have economic effect s on consumers businesses and manufacturers and possi bly interstate commerce55 the most immediate effects of the emissions programs at least the ones furthest along in development will be on the automotive manufacturing and electricity generation sectors for automotive manufacturers the california motor vehicle regulations which at least 12 states plan to implement will likely have the effect of dividing the market potentially requiring the manufacture of different class of cars to meet the new standards scheduled to apply in 2009 for automotive companies this raises the issues of the technical means of meeting the standard marketing ensuring compliance and pricing depending on how the emission limits are to be met they may also influence fueling infrastructure state governments will need resources to enforce the standards consumers in regulated states may face higher prices for vehicles for the electric generating sector the california and rggi requirements will likely promote generation from low carbon intensive fuels while curtailing generation from high carbonintensive fuel s such as coal californias ghg performance standards will reach into neighbor ing states as well effectively barring electricity imports generated by conventional coalfired pow er plants as coalfired plants tend to produce lowercost electricity the result of these requirements may behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33962crs18 56 this is also central argument against ving federal emission limits without cooperation with other large economies eg china and india 57 capandtrade program with an auction system as discussed above for instance would generate revenues that could be funneled to parties who bear an unfair percentage of the programs costs see for example national commission on energy policy 2007 allocating allowances in greenhouse gas trading system 58 for example the newly created united stat climate action partnership uscap an alliance of major businesses and leading climate and environmental groups calls on the federal government to enact legislation requiring significant reductions of ghg emissions see httpuscaporg 59 robert stavins 2006 utility safety valve for cutting co2 the environmental forum vol 23 2 marchapril 2006 p 14to increase electricity prices within the states that limit emissions and possibly lower prices in states without such emission standards if the ghg limitations on motor vehicles nd electricity increase prices in the regulated states businesses and manufacturers may factor this cost into location decisions there is some concern that re gulated industries w ill have financial incentive to move and thus transfer jobs to states or nations such as mexico or canada that do not limit ghg emissions56 others fear that emission limits will raise the cost of living and doing business w ithin those states although in theory such effects can be at least partially addre ssed through the design of the emissions reduction program57 patchwork of regulations one concern shared by many observers particularly industry stakehol ders is that state climate change programs in the absence of federal program will create patchwork of regulations nationwide it is claimed that patchwork system of standards may hinder companys efficiency and possibly create economic burdens for firms that operate in multiple states the prospect of regulations that vary from state to state is moving some companies to support federal climate chan ge program with comparab requirements across the entire united states58 limitations of state actions climate change has been described as the ultimate global commons problem59 the global warming and clima impacts associated with increased ghg emissions in the atmosphere cannot be linked with specific emission sources unlike localized reductions in other air pollutants eg sulf ur dioxide particulate matter when an emissions source reduces its carbon diox ide emissions it does not generate corresponding local climate change benefit unless there are similar widespread reductions around the world from practical standpoint the actions of one or small group of states cannot by themselves significantly affect the global accumulation of ghg emissions in the atmosphere however as discussed above actions now under way in california and states in the northeast and midatlantic regions may create examples andor modelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33962crs19 60 new york state is expected to be the firs t state to issue its rule implementing

section 8 clause 3 63 for more discussion of thes issues see crs report rl30315 federalism state sovereignty and the constitution basi s and limits of congressional power by kenneth r thomasthat will prove instructive in more widespread applications moreover when business and industry have confronted growing patchwork of state requirements these sectors have historically begun to favor national polic as has begun to happen in the case of statelevel actions on climate change however the lack of national program or trul global approach to ghg missions reductions does limit what individual states can accomplish in actually reducing ghg emissions and accumulations legal challenges to state actions legal challenges may halt or hinder state action the possibility of legal challenges creates considerable uncertainty regarding the future of state climate change actions particularly the more aggre ssive programs there are already several lawsuits against state acti ons that seek to regulate ghg emissions from motor vehicles car dealers and trade associations have filed suits in california vermont and rhode island seeking to halt the regu lations on various grounds for example the plaintiffs contend that californias regulations are preempted by the energy policy and conservation act p l 94163 which directs stat not to regulate fuel economy standards it in uncertain what role the massachusetts decision may play in these proceedings because some of the arguments in these cases eg the relationship between conflicting federal and state policing concerning climate change were not addressed in the massachusetts case further litigation confronting the more r ecent state actions is anticipated many expect legal challenge to the rggi program when the first states rule is officially issued60 in addition some observers questi on whether californias recently enacted ghg performance standards are constitutional61 they argue that the performance standards disproportiona tely affect the neighboring st ates that have historically exported coalgenerated electricity to california consumers raising the question of whether the california standard in effect regulates interstate commerce the degree to which state can influence interstate commerce is central to the debate regarding stateled climate change activities the us constitution grants congress the power to regulate interstate commerce62 us courts interpret this as limitation on the states ability to regulate interstate commerce63httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33962crs20 the legal arguments in these cases nd expected cases are complicated and beyond the scope of this report moreove r many of the gal and constitutional issues chart new ground for these reasons many observers have concluded that it is difficult to predict how the courts will interpret and decide these issues regardless of the ultimate strength and outcome of the legal arguments opposing stateled climate change policies affected stakeholders will almost certainly challenge the implementation of emission reduction programs it is uncertain how long these anticipated legal challenges might delay ghg reductions in the states
