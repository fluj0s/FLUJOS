chief of mission for rea sons 14 b and d 1 c during press conference on the margins of the italyturkey summit in izmir on november 12 italian pm berlusconi said that the us had provoked russia by unilaterally recognizing kosovos independence pressing forward on missile defense and inviting ukraine and georgia to have closer relationship with nato while berlusconis latest comments are culmination of string of inflammatory and unhelpful comments in support of putin that began shortly after berlusconi took office this year these latest statements went considerably further in attempting to place the blame for russias paranoia on the us additionally berlusconi appears to be encouraging his own government and russia to disregard the current administration and lobby the incoming us president to take softer line on russia at the same time he has attempted to portray himself as the primary interlocutor between putin and the west and particularly with the us as result of berlusconis latest comments post reached out to interlocutors at all levels to register our dismay at the latest barrage of berlusconisms our contacts universally responded with combination of dismay dismissal or shouldershrugging in an effort at damagecontrol fm frattini dispatched senior mfa official the following morning to see the adcm and clarify the gois stance instead he took back terse message to the fm that such comments risk substantial and lasting damage to italys credibility in washington end summary 2 c during press conference with turkish pm erdogan on november 12 in izmir pm berlusconi said the us had provoked russia by unilaterally recognizing kosovos independence pressing forward with missile defense and encouraging ukraine and georgia to have closer relationship with nato berlusconis latest comments represent continuation of long campaign of support for putin since the italian pm returned to power this year in addition to his latest comments berlusconi has supported russian initiatives to create new security architecture in europe to supersede nato and osce has insisted that putin acted appropriately during the georgiarussia conflict and has opposed nato expansion on the basis that it presents threat to russia he has even called for russia to be full member of the eu comment he made at time when the eu was considering whether to continue business as usual with russia in the aftermath of the georgiarussia conflict 3 c most disturbingly berlusconi has attempted to portray himself to russia and the eu as the principal interlocutor between the transatlantic community and in particular the us and russia he has repeatedly called on the us to take softer line with russia on virtually all democratic and security issues and has even called on his government and russia to look beyond the current administration to the incoming us president in order to achieve these goals 4 c following this latest set of remarks we reached out to virtually every senior interlocutor on russia within the goi and in berlusconis own centerright coalition the ambassador called dpm letta adcm called fm frattinis chief of staff the mfa director general for europe the national security advisor and member of parliament from berlusconis party poloff reached out to the acting director of the mfa russia office the director of the security planning department the diplomatic advisors to berlusconi and members of berlusconis party we expressed our concern that berlusconis attempts at creating dialogue with russia were in fact creating greater tension and undermining common efforts to bring stability to the balkans and portraying the successful and peaceful expansion of the euroatlantic space as threat to russia in an apparent effort at damagecontrol fm frattini sent senior member of his staff policy planning director maurizio massari the day after berlusconis remarks to call on adcm to clarify goi policy 5 c massari as did virtually all of our interlocutors told adcm that the pm was accustomed to making offthecuff remarks that should not be interpreted as policy statements per massari said that frattini was urging the us to rome 00001386 0022 of 002 look to italys strong bilateral cooperation rather than berlusconis comments as an indication of the strength of the relationship and the direction of italian policy italys foreign policy remained strongly atlanticist berlusconi according to massari had meant to be constructive and wanted to take positive role in creating understanding between its key strategic partners the us and russia the comments had not been meant to criticize the us 6 c adcm countered that the pms statements risked damaging to our efforts to bring stability to the balkans by calling into question the basis for kosovos independence process that italy had been part of from the beginning additionally berlusconis comments ran headlong into sensitive negotiations with russia on confidence building measures as well as czech and polish internal deliberations on ratification of missile defense by characterizing ukrainian and georgian nato aspirations as inherently threatening to russia berlusconi was casting doubt on process which had produced significant reforms in aspirant countries that are looking to join the community of democratic nations 7 c adcm told massari that the goi gave every appearance that the us was experiencing power vacuum the current administration was still in charge and the incoming one had made that abundantly clear by encouraging his own government and russia to speak past the current administration and offer advice to the presidentelect berlusconi was losing credibility for italy as reliable partner which he could ill afford to do given the challenges ahead of us in afghanistan and elsewhere adcm added that the new administration would conduct its own diplomacy and would not need berlusconi as bridge to engage in dialogue with russia on either bilateral or multilateral basis 8 c massari in obvious discomfort said he fully understood the us perspective on berlusconis recent stream of commentary said he would take this message back to fm frattini in detail he also asked for our thoughts on how to avoid any further misunderstandings of this nature he said he would recommend that the fm make statement clarifying italys support for kosovo and nato expansion he also said he would advise the fm to talk to berlusconi about the degree to which his comments on the usrussia relationship georgia md and other issues had irritated washington adcm ended the conversation by suggesting that pm refrain from making any further offers to guide the new us administration in its relationship with russia 9 c comment all of our interlocutors were at visible pains to underscore that they understood the pms comments in izmir had crossed the line all however particularly party officials reiterated that berlusconi does not listen to the advice of his own experts in crafting his approach with other states on russia berlusconi takes this to an extreme not only conducting his own brand of foreign policy but on tactical basis as way of gaining favor with his russian interlocutors with whom many including his own party officials suspect he has personally and financially enriching relationship all of our contacts stated that it might be difficult to reign him in and somewhat fatalistically encouraged us to ignore his comments one senior mfa official went so far as to suggest ambassador take up the issue directly with berlusconi and asked us to let her know what berlusconi offered as his justification for his remarks since she said she had insight whatsoever as to what had animated his remarks on kosovo and md 10 c it will be all the more important that berlusconi and his advisors hear similarly blunt warning about the direction of italys russia policy during in any bilats or pullasides on the margins of the upcoming g20 summit spogli
