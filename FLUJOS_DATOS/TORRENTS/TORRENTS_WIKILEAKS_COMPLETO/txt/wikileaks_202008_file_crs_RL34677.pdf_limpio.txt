variables productivity growth may be among thos that remain relatively beyond the influence of deliberate economic policy although many policy proposals are advocated on the grounds that they will help boost productiv ity it may be that productivity growth rates have greater influence on policy than policy does on the growth of productivity variations in the productivity growth rate are so incompletely unders tood that there is clear cons ensus among economists about the best way for policymakers to promote it higher productivity growth means higher real incomes which in combination with progressive income ta x rates yields higher fe deral revenues productivity growth also extends the date of reckoning as far as social security is concerned because the incomes of those paying social security taxes will grow more rapidly compared to the rate of growth of benefits in the mid 1990s trend productivity gr owth accelerated that was unusual in mature economic expansion which has suggested to more than few observers that it was not just shortterm phenomenon but rather sign that there was an increase in the longterm economic growth rate that pickup in productivity growth has been attributed in part to computers and other it equipment which have undergone dramatic technical improvements and coincidental price declines as comp uter prices have fallen more and more applications for computing power have b een found because of falling prices it has become profitable to put computers to uses with smaller and smaller returns there is also the prospect that it may take firm s considerable amount of time to adapt the way they do business to take dvantage of their investments in it equipment as was the case with other historic technological advances the productivity gains attributable to investments in it equipment may ripple through the economy for some time an important question for policymakers is how much longer this surge in productivity growth might continue two r ecent studies attempted to project productivity growth based on the current understanding of post1995 developments between 1995 and 2007 average labor productivity grew at an annual rate of 25 the two projections suggest that in the future it is more likely to be closer to 2 that would still be faster rate of growth than in the years before

beginning in 1995 the longrun trend rate of growth of produc tivity accelerated that was welcome development the rate of growth of productivity has important consequences for policymakers faster productivity growth means faster economic growth and more rapid gains in living standards consumer s can buy more of those goods and services or leisure that make their lives easier or more enjoyable even when productivity growth is limited to certain i ndustries everyone benefits from the lower prices for or the improved quality of those goods and services while the growth rate of productivity varies in the short run it also exhibits relatively stable longrun trends the budget process typically looks at least five if not 10 years ahead in setting spending and tax policies with respect to social security the time frame is even longer over such an extended period of time some insight into the outlook for productivity gr owth is critical to projecting other economic variables and blishing an economic base line on which to base budget decisions policymakers have some influence over productivity growth but significant contributor to productivity growth is the pace of technological change which may be relatively removed from the influence of deliberate economic policy policies that promote education and capital investment may well have so effect however the major shifts in longterm trends seem to have been more related to shifts in the rate of technological progress these variati ons in the productivity growth rate are so incompletely understood that there is clear consensus among economists how policymakers might go about influencing them between 1973 and 1995 productivity growth was sluggish compared to what it had been during th 1960s in 1995 tr end productivity growth picked up this report explains what productivity is and how it is measured it examines both the cyclical and longrun characteristics of productivity growth di scusses continuing efforts to explain the post1995 acceleratio n in productivity growth and considers whether that faster rate of grow th can be expected to continuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34677crs2 1 when the economy is at full employment the combined growth rates of labor and its productivity represent sort of speed limit sustained economic growth above that limit is considered likely to result in an accelerating ra of inflation that is another reason why it is important for policymakers to be aware of productivity growth trendsproductivityoutput hours output productivity hours what is productivity productivity is ratio it is measure of the quantity of output produced relative to the amount of work required to produce it most often it is expressed as the ratio of some measure of inflationadjusted output to the number of labor hours involved mathematically it looks something like this labor productivity is measured in terms of average output per hour it is ratio of the quantity of output to the hours of work performed if the quantity of output rises by the same proportion as the am ount of work then the economy is only producing more because there are more wo rkers or because workers are putting in longer hours but there is productivity gr owth if output rises faster than hours worked labor productivity is also increasing rearranging the terms may help illust rate the significance of productivity this shows that total output is func tion of both work and productivity any increase in output must therefore come about as the result of increases in either hours worked or productivity in the short run hours worked may vary over the business cycle as the unemployment rate rises nd falls beyond that hours worked may vary somewhat over time as the proportion of the population in the labor force changes but in the long run hours worked is pr imarily determined by popula tion size output growth is an important policy goal but if it only comes by increasing hours worked then living standards are unlikely to improve1 some of the sources of productivity gr owth are clearly understood increased investment and growing cap ital stock raise bor productivity increased education and training also contribute but aside from the contributions of human and physical capital much less is certain the pace of technological advance is not easily explained httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34677crs3 2 j steven landefeld and bruce t gri mm note on the impact of hedonics and computers on real gdp survey of current business december 2000 3 some sectors of the economy may be easier to measure than others in the case of manufactured goods there is at least tangib product that can be counted even though there may be difficulties in assessing changes in its quality or other characteristics in the case of services it can be difficult even to fine what is being produced take medical care for example in the case of physician services should production be measured as the number of office visits per hour should success at treating various ailments be taken into accountmeasurement issues the most commonly cited measure of productivity published by the federal government is average labor productivity it is published quarterly by the bureau of labor statistics of the depar tment of labor bls the measure of output used by bls in its calculation is based on real gross domestic product gdp in the nonfarm business sector published by the bureau of economic analysis bea of the department of commerce problems in measuring real output production of goods and services is necessarily measured in terms of dollar values because that is the only unit of measure common to all of the goods and services produced the dollar value of output however reflects not only the quan tity of goods and services produced but also their prices the dollar value of output will rise with an increase in the quantity of goods and services produced but it will also rise with an increase in their prices distinguishing between changes in output that are real ie indicative of changes in quantity and changes that are due only to variations in the general price level is difficult problem productivity measures are ba sed on inflationadjusted measures of output the way in which price change is measured can thus affect measures of productivity growth if existing price indexes understa the rate of inflation that will cause estimates of productivity gr owth to be overstated few goods or services stay the same from year to year of all the goods and services produced computers may be changing the most rapidly from year to year the prices of computers have been falling and their performance has been improving dramatically rather than simply track changes in the price of computer from one year to the next the bea attempts to track changes in the price of computing power2 that means that it tries to take in to account changes in memory processing speed and other features when estimating price change in successive models of computers3 productivity growth in the short run in the short run it can be difficult to tell whether change in the rate of productivity growth is temporar or indicative of change in the longrun trend to economists productivitys significance has more to do with the long run and so variations in its longrun trend and the factors that influence it are the focus ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34677crs4 4 at the beginning of an economic contracti on firms may be slow to lay off workers because there are costs associated with rehi ring them when business recovers if the contraction continues firms may lay off workers who are relatively less productive reducing the quantity of labor employed thus tends to moderate any initial deceleration in measured productivity growth as the contr action comes to an end firms can put idle capital back to work as well as any underutilized labor already on hand this increase in output with little or increase in hours work ed results in relatively rapid productivity growth once increasing demand can longer be satisfied with existing capacity additional labor will be added those hired first will tend to be those relatively more experienced as more and more labor is hire d the contribution to output of each additional hire tends to drop as the expansion ages productivity growth tends to slow 5 these data reflect productivity in the nonfarm business sector the business cycle reference dates use here are those established by the national bureau of economic research nber and indicate the begi nnings and endings of periods of economywide expansions and contractions considerable research produc tivity however also tends to vary systematically over the course of the business cycle long run trend would be one that persisted for more than one business cycle although each business cycle has unique as pects there are certain tendencies that are common to most of them one of those tendencies is for productivity growth to be procyclical in recession it is typical for pr oductivity to decline or grow less rapidly as the recession ends and the economy begins to expand productivity growth usually picks up4 table 1 presents data for annual ra tes of growth in average labor productivity over th course of each of the nine co mplete business cycles of

productivity growth in the long run just as productivity growth varies in th short run it also varies from one cycle to the next economists have identified particular times when the longrun rate of

data constraint american economic review march 1994 8 angus maddison growth and slowdown in advanced capitalist economies journal of economic literature june 1987the post1973 slowdown in productivity growth for much of the post world war ii era the united states experi enced relatively rapi d rates of productivity growth between 1947 and the 1973 output per labor hour in the nonfarm business sector grew at an annual rate of 28 between the 1973 and 1 995 that rate fell to 14 per year most economists point to 1973 as the beginning of an extended period of slower productivity growth that drop in the rate of productivity growth has been the focus of much economic research thus far the slowdown remains poorly understood prime suspect in that slowdown at least initially was the opec oil price hike which in 1973 roughly doubled the price of cr ude oil the mere coincidence of the productivity slowdown and the rise in pri ce of major input to the production of goods and services made it an attractive suspect the theory was that because of higher energy costs much of the existing capital stock which relied on energy to contribute to output became obsolete6 subsequent experience however cas t doubts on the significance of the coincidence between 1979 and 1981 oil prices doubled again and then in 1986 the price of oil fell by nearly half that onl one of these large oil price changes was associated with shift in the trend rate of growth in productivity suggested that if there was single factor to blame for the 1973 slowdown it was to be found elsewhere another possible cause of the post1973 slowdown was slowdown in spending on research and development rd gr iliches found that rd spending as percentage of gdp declined beginning in the mid1960s7 the timing of the decline would seem to implicate it but it is hard to make strong case out of single instance moreover other countries so experienced decline in productivity growth without corresponding decline in rd spending griliches also pointed out that in the 1970s the number of patents granted in the united states declined that resulted in drop in the number of patents per dollar of rd spending griliches suggested that the decline in the number of patents per dollar of rd spending may have been evidence of diminishing returns to rd spending and he wondered if there might be sort of technol ogical frontier near which opportunities for inventi on become relatively scarce maddison examined number of factors in an effort to account for the role each one may have played in the slowdown8 maddison was able to explain only 41 of the total deceleration in output growth of 14 separate factors the most important was found to have accounted for less than oneseventh of the slowdownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34677crs8 9 robert j gordon problems in the measurement and performance of servicesector productivity in the united states national bureau of economic research inc working paper 5519 march 1996 10 robert j gordon comments in ben s bernanke and julio j rotemberg eds nber macroeconomics annual 1996 mit pressbecause the slowdown in tr end productivity has been da ted to single point in time it was suspected that single cause for the slowdown might be found identifying single cause would have been more satisfying in that policy measures might have been designed to reverse it if the slowdown had affected different industries more or ss equally that might have favored arguments that single cause was responsible however when productiv ity trends were examined for individual industries some were f ound to have fared well in comparison with others9 gordon offered slightly different perspective on the post1973 slowdown he maintained that rather than trying to ex plain why productivity growth slowed in the 1970s and 1980s the focus should instead be on why it was so rapid earlier10 gordon argued that in the 1970s productivity growth simply fell back to its longrun trend rate and that the growth experienced ear lier in the century was unusually rapid due to number of technological advances among the advances he cited were the spread of electric motors the internal com bustion engine and the telephone and its derivatives gordon argued that these i nnovations had much greater economic effect than the electronic computer he went on to suggest that the economy was on long run curve of diminishing returns to technol ogical advancement and that the various modifications and improvements to devices such as computers were less important than was their initial introduction the post1995 acceleration in productivity growth although it was not fully appreciated at the time it became increasingly evident by the turn of the century that productivity growth seemed to have accelerated around 1995 that it can be difficult to discern shifts in productivity trends was borne out by the fact that economic forecasts underpredicted grow th for five consecutive years table 4 shows actual rates of economic gr owth between 1996 and 2001 and associated forecast errors of the office of management and budget omb the congressional budget office cbo and

theory of economic growth has often been quoted as saying that the effect of co mputers can be seen everywhere but in the productivity statistics11 through the 1980s and early 1990s there seemed to have been big payoff from the increased use of computers that presented puzzle to those who had anticipated significant returns it is now believed that computers have had much to do with the acceleration in productivity growth since the mid1990s whet her that is the case and how computers have affected productivity grow th are important in trying to assess how durable the acceleration will prove to be it is widely assumed that the speed and memory capacity of those computers will continue to improve at steady pace this rapid rate of technological advance in the development and manufacture of comput ers was predicted in 1965 by gordon moore one of the cofounde rs of intel corporation12 specifically moores law predicted that the number of transistors th at could be put on single computer chip would double every 18 months whether that prediction was selffulfilling prophecy may be open to question but the fact is that the pace of technolog ical advance in the manufacture of computers has vindicated moores law over time because of rapid i nnovati on in the production of computer chips the prices of computers as well as other goods re lated to information processing and

to timating change in real output and thus productivity if the rate of price decline in computers is overestimated then measures of productivity will be overstated most studies estimate that in the

ways first there has been rapid productivity growth in the production of computers which as computers accounted for an in creasing share of total produ ction tended to raise the overall measure of productivity growth s econd the sh arp drop in computer prices has stimulated increased investment in computers which has contributed to an increase in the overall amount of capital availa ble to the workforce this is often referred to as capital deepenin g increases in the size of the capital stock generally tend to raise worker productivity two separate studies attempted to asse ss the contribution of computers and it investment to the post1995 acceleration in productivity growth oliner and sichel found that of 09 percentage point increas in productivity growth from the first half of the 1990s to the latter half all of it could be accounted for by the combined effects of advances in the production of computers themselves and in advances in the way those computers were put to

that in creased investment in it equipment would have an immediate effect on productivity growth according to gordon it took forty years for the benefits of electrification to be fully realized factories had to be reorganized to take advantage of electric power in the same way the introduction of computers has driven firms to change business practices those changes take time but the reorganization as well as worker training and other novel business practices made possible by the introduction of comput ers may have cont ributed to productivity in ways that are difficult to measure more recently jorgenson ho and stiroh have found that the it contribution to productivity growth fell after 200018 in spite of that there was little change in the growth rate of average labor productiv ity after 2000 apparently one reason productivity growth held up was decline in the growth rate of hours worked which tended to raise the amount of capital available to labor that is development that may be unlikely to persist one of the sectors of the economy that experienced relatively rapid productivity growth is retail trade retail trade may have benefitted great deal in the use of computers and it investments fernald nd ramnath cite the particular example of socalled bigbox stores that have become pervasive in retailing19 the success of those large scale retailers may have b een made possible by the introduction of computers computers allowed those stor to manage sophisticated distribution networks and improve inventory control nd by growing in size also benefit from economies of scale baily also suspects that the contributi on of it investments to faster productivity growth might have been overstated20 he points out that prior to 1995 economists were unable to fully explain variations in productivity growth by simply examining variations in those factors believed to c ontribute to it given the relatively small number of observations on which the studies linking it investments to productivity are based they might still be treated with some skepticism he argues that it might also be the case that the increase in it spending was motivated by the acceleration in growth an apparent inconsistency has caused others to ask whether the contribution of it investments might be overs tated many european countries did not enjoy the

productivity in the 1990 1995 and 19952003 intervals and points out that while the growth rate of output per hour increased by 09 percentage point afte r 1995 the us growth rate of output per hour fell by 12 percentage points in the european union21 gordon argues that european government policies may have inhibited the grow th of bigbox retail stores and thus minimized productivity gains it i nvestments might othe rwise have provided an oecd study looked at those industrie s that use it equipment and found that for the most part countries other than the united states and australia experienced little benefit from the use of increased investments in it equipment after 199522 this study pointed out that the increase in wal marts share of the retail market accounted for some of the post1995 increase in productiv ity it suggested that it may be more difficult for firms to expand and gain market share in some european countries than in the united states it would seem that public policy has influenced the extent to which it investment has contributed to the acceleration in productivity growth an nber study looked at the ability of individual firms to benefit from it investments23 it found significant difference between the productivity gains experienced by us firms as opposed to nonus firms and attributed it to it spending it seems that firm characteristics may be as important as the overall economic environment in termining the effect on pr oductivity of it spending investments in it equipment may contri bute to productivity by either substituting for labor or by complementing it when it is complement to labor the more educated the labor force is the greater the contribution is likely to be when it is substitute the more educated the displaced wo rkers are the easier it is likely to be for them to find new jobs in either case more flexible capital and labor markets may increase the potential contribution to produc tivity of increased it investment will the post1995 growth rates continue an important question for policymaker s is whether or not the surge in productivity growth of the late 1990s w ill continue higher productivity growth means higher real incomes which in combination with progressive income tax rates yields higher federal revenues higher productivity growth also extends the date of reckoning for social security because the

and other it equipment an important factor in those price declines has been innovation in the manufacture of microprocessors wh ether or not that rapid pace of innovation keeps up and prices continue to fall will be important factors in future rates of productivity growth howeve r ultimately there may be limits to the number of transistors that can be put on single comput er chip as computer prices have fallen computer use has become much more wide spread because of falling prices it has become profitable to put computers to uses with smaller and smaller returns two recent studies attempt to project productivity growth based on the current understanding of post1995 developments jorgenson ho and stiroh point out that some of the factors that contribute to pr oductivity are less mysterious than others25 growth in labor hours growth in the quality of the labor force and growth in the capital stock are relatively easy to predict for example in contrast it is harder to project the rate of technological advances in the production of it equipment jorgenson nd his coauthors point out that beginning around 1995 the product cycle which refers to the period of time between new product introductions shrank from three to tw years for semiconductors that shift the faster introduction of next generation processors may explain some of the it contribution to the acceleration in productivity growth if semiconductors reverted to threeyear product cycle that might tempor arily reverse some of the it contribution to future productivity growth it may be as difficult to project the ot her factors that contribute to productivity growth particularly the pace of technologi cal advance in the nonit sectors of the economy and improvements in the ov erall quality of the capital stock acknowledging those difficulties jorgens on and his coauthors suggest range of projections for the next ten years thei r outlook for annual growth in average labor productivity stretches from pessimistic 14 rate to an optimistic 28 rate based on those projections they expect gr owth in total private output to range somewhere between 21 and 35 ra of growth over the next decadehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34677crs16 26 robert j gordon future us productivity growth looking ahead by looking back october 27 2006 workshop paper available at httpfacultywebatnorthwesternedu economicsgordongroni ngen_maddison80thpdf 27 congressional budget office updated l ongterm projections for social security august 2008gordon in recent paper also attempte d to project productivity growth rates26 the critical question addressed by gordon concerned how long historical period should be taken into account as basis fo r productivity projections gordons general view is that the driving force behind pr oductivity growth is innovation and that the frequency of important innovations tends to vary in unpredictable ways he is also skeptical that the invention of the personal computer and the growth of the internet constitute innovations as important as the wide spread availability of electricity and the development of the internal combustion ngine given the historical record of innovation and of variations in productivity growth gordon feels that any longterm projection of productivity growth ought to take in at least the past 25 years rather than just the record since 1995 because gordon bases his pr ojection on the record over the past 25 years he does not expect productivity growth in the next 25 years to ma tch the post1995 rate he expects productivity growth closer to 2 than to 25 based on those expectations gordon projects longrun grow th rate of gdp of about 25 between 1973 and 1995 gdp grew at an annual rate of 28 between 1995 and 2007 that rate rose to 31 the outlook is thus for growth to slow somewhat with more rapid productivity growth offsetting the effect of slower growth in the labor force in august 2008 cbo released update d longterm economic projections27 cbo projects growth rate for labor produ ctivity of 19 over the next 75 years combined with expected growth in the bor force over that period cbo projects real gdp will grow by about 23 annually
