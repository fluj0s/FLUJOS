defense and trade division january 18 2008 abstract the creation of post911 intelligenceinformation fusion centers does not represent totally new concept but suggests an extension of pre911 state and local law enforcement intelligence activities most state policebureau of investigation agencies have run intelligence or analytic units for decades many of the fusion centers examined for this report were the outgrowth of those units prompting some to refer to fusion centers as state police intelligence units on steroids conceptually fusion centers diﬀer from their predecessors in that they are intended to broaden sources of data for analysis and integration beyond criminal intelligence to include federal intelligence as well as public and private sector data furthermore fusion centers broaden the scope of state and local analysis to include homeland security and counterterrorism

intelligence fusion function were conducted prior to 911 often at state police criminal intelligence bureaus the events of 911 provided the primary catalyst for the formal establishment of more than 40 state local and regional fusion centers across the country the value proposition for fusion centers is that by integrating various streams of information and intelligence including that flowing from the fe deral government state local and tribal governments as well as the private sector more accurate picture of risks to people economic infrastructure and communities can be developed and translated into protective action the ultimate goal of fusion is to prevent manmade terrorist attacks and to respond to natural disasters and manmade threats quickly and efficiently should they occur as recipients of federal governmentprovided national intelligence another goal of fusion centers is to model how events inimical to us interests overseas may be manifested in their communities and align protective resources accordingly there are several risks to the fusion center conceptincluding potential privacy and civil liberties violations and the possible inability of fusion centers to demonstrate utility in the absence of future terrorist attacks particularly during periods of relative state fiscal austerity fusion centers are statecreated entities largely financed and staffed by the states and there is one model for how center should be structured state and local law enforcement and criminal intelligence seem to be at the core of many of the centers although many of the centers initially had purely counterterrorism goals for numerous reasons they have increasingly gravitated toward an allcrimes and even broader allhazards approach while many of the centers have prevention of attacks as high priority little true fusion or analysis of disparate data sources identification of intelligence gaps and proactive collection of intelligence against those gaps which could contribute to prevention is occurring some centers are collocated with local offices of federal entities yet in the absence of functioning intelligence cycle process collocation alone does not constitute fusion the federal role in supporting fusion centers consists largely of providing financial assistance the majority of which has flowed through the homeland security grant program sponsoring security clearances providing human resources producing some fusion center guidance and training and providing congressional authorization and appropriation of national foreign intelligence program resources as well as oversight hearings this report includes over 30 options for congressional consideration to clarify and potentially enhance the federal governments relationship with fusion centers one of the central options is the potential drafting of formal national fusion center strategy that would outline among other elements the federal governments clear expectations of fusion centers its position on sustainment funding metrics for assessing fusion center performance and definition of what constitutes mature fusion center this report will be updated

integration beyond criminal intelligence to include federal intelligence as well as public and private sector data furthermore fusion centers broaden the scope of state and local analysis to include homeland security and counterterrorism issues despite being an expansion of existing subfe deral intelligenceinformation activities fusion centers represent fundamental change in the philosophy toward homeland defense and law enforcement the rise of fusion centers is representative of recognition that nontraditional actorsstate and local law enforcement and public safety agencieshave an important role to play in homeland defense and security in addition there has been shift towards more proactive approach to law enforcement in the united states numerous national strategies have assessed the primary threat to us national security as terrorism both at home and abroad 3 indeed the national strategy on homeland security provides that the american people and way of life are the primary targets of our terrorist enemy and our highest protection priority4 the means for combating this threat are broad and 1 intelligence is information to which value has been added thr ough analysis and is collected in response to the needs of policymakers at the most generic level there are two type s of intelligence raw and finished raw intelligence is that which has not been vetted verified and validated finished intelligence which includes information of unknown credibility has been through an analytical process which s resulted in conclusions and judgments being made as opposed to evidence which is generally gathered in supp ort of prosecution intelligence is gathered to inform policymakers and those individuals responsible for taking actions including national security law enforcement and public safety officials while intelligence may occasionally be introduced into legal proceedings generally it is not the distinction between intelligence and information is discussed at length in appendix 2 the fusion center guidelines define fusion center as collaborative effort of two or more agencies that provide resources expertise and information to the center with th goal of maximizing their ability to detect prevent investigate and respond to criminal and terrorist activ ity fusion center guidelines developing and sharing information and intelligence in new era august 2006 available from httpitojpgovdocuments fusion_center_guidelines_law_enforcementpdf accessed on june 26 2007 p 2 some apply this definition broadly to include any multijurisdictional anticrime or response effort that may utilize intelligence andor information to include federallyowned and operated collaborative efforts like fbiled joint terrorism task forces jttfs or high intensity drug trafficking area hidta the authors however limit their discussion of fusion centers to those 40 largely state and regional entities created to enhance the ability of the jurisdiction to prevent mitigate and in some cases respond and recover from manmade threats attacks and natural disasters 3 for example the national strategy on counterterrorism states that the paradigm for combating terrorism now involves the application of all elements of our national power and influence not only do we employ military power we use diplomatic financial intelligence and law enforcement activities to protect the homeland and extend our defenses disrupt terrorist operations and deprive our enemies of what they need to operate and survive see the national strategy for combating terrorism september 2006 p 1 and according to the director of national intelligence dni terrorist th reats to the homeland to our national secur ity interests and to our allies remain the preeminent challenge to the intelligence community see annual threat assessment of the director of national intelligence testimony of ambassador john d negroponte before the senate select committee on intelligence january

traditional sectors from law enforcement perspective it has been argued that state and regional intelligence fusion centers particularly when networked together nationally represent proactive tool to be used to fight global jihadist adversary which has both centralized and decentralized elements this network of fusion centers is envisioned as central node in sharing terrorism homeland security and law enforcement information with state local regi onal and tribal law enforcement and security officials5 today there are over 40 intelligence fusion centers across the country see appendix b for map and list of these centers research suggests that there is onesizefitsall model for these centers and there are significant differences between them there are however some common themes and more importantly common questions that arise when examining fusion centers to include do fusion centers solve the pre911 info rmation sharing problems and as such make americans safer can fusion centers work if they arent part of an integrated philosophy of intelligence and security who owns and benefits from fusion centers who should staff fund and oversee them what role if any should fusion centers play in the intelligence community ic and what role should federal agencies play in fusion centers to include funding do fusion centers represent shift in the security v civil liberties pendulum how active and proactive if at all should fusion centers be in the collection of intelligence that is not directly tied to specific and identifiable criminal act there is single model for how each center is structured or operates is some basic level of common standards necessary in order for fusion centers to offer national benefit moreover does the federal government have an integrated national strategy towards fusion centers is the current configuration of 40 plus fusion centers with in some cases several operating within one state the most efficient organizational structure is the current approach to creating authorizing funding and supporting fusion centers sustainable what are the risks to the fusion center concept and how have those risks been specifically weighed and balanced against the stated goals of fusion center operations in order to provide context for the analysis of these fundamental questions this report will highlight how the concept and development of these centers continue to evolve as well as provide an overview of current national trends in fusion centers the federal role in supporting such centers and the role of the private sector finally the report will provide congress with 5 this vision is promoted by the program manager information sharing environment pm ise which was created by intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 section

nations homeland security relies on at least four presumptions intelligence and the intelligence process plays vital role in preventing terrorist attacks it is essential to fuse broader range of data including nontraditional source data to create more comprehensive threat picture state local and tribal law enforcement and public sector agencies are in unique position to make observations and collect information that may be central to the type of threat assessment referenced above having fusion activities take place at the subfederal level can benefit state and local communities and

to briefly expand upon the four presumptions wh ich are often cited in arguments that fusion centers are valuable to homeland security it is important to first focus on the role of intelligence in homeland security especially with regard to prevention efforts at the first annual national fusion center conference secretary chertoff reiterated to the hundreds of state and local conference participants that he views intelligence as an early warning system that allows public safety officials to get jump on the adversary7 the 911 commission states not only does good intelligence win wars but the best intelligence enables us to prevent them from happening altogether8 all major post911 government reorganizations legislation and programs have emphasized the importance of intelligence in preventing mitigating and responding to future terrorist attacks this includes the creation of the department of homeland security specifically the departments office of intelligence and analysis the

foreign intelligence agencies were watching overseas alert to foreign threats to us interests there the domestic agencies were waiting for evidence of domestic threat from sleeper cells within the united states 9 as such the 911 commission concluded there was necessity for fusing domestic and foreign intelligence fusing foreign intelligence with wide spectrum of domestic information is the stated primary purpose of most fusion centers locally gathered information collected from broad array of law enforcement public health and safety as well as private sector sources is fused with intelligence collected and produced by the federal intelligence community to better understand threat and assist in directing security resources the authors of the fusion center guidelines developing and sharing information and intelligence in new era stated data fusion involves the exchange of information from different sourcesincluding law enforcement public safety and the private sectorand with analysis can result in meaningful and actionable intelligence and information the fusion process turns this information and intelligence into actionable knowledge10 the homeland security advisory council hsac finds that this process should be continual more than onetime collection of law enforcement andor terrorismrelated intelligence information and it goes beyond establishing an intelligence center or creating computer network11 furthermore hsac believes that out of the fusion process one of the principal outcomes should be the identification of terrorismrelated leadsthat is any nexus between crimerelated information and other information collected by state local tribal and private entities and terrorist organization andor attack12 by fusing state and local information with federal threat intelligence it could be argued fusion centers serve as vital linkage or translator for state and local authorities for example when bombing occurs overseas it can be very helpful for modus operandi and other tactical information surrounding that bombing to be communicated to states and localities in timely fashion so they may align their protective resources accordingly the fusion centers through their connectivity with the federal intelligence commun ity via either systems andor federal personnel collocated at the centers can serve as the single focal point for timely dissemination of that information the imperative according to charles allen chief intelligence officer at dhs is to push the defensive perimeter outward according to allen our ability to move analyze and act on information is our greatest strength and we must use the national fusion center information in that network to push our defensive perimeter outward13 9 the 911 commission report final

it has been argued that state local tribal law enforcement first responders and other public and private sector entities are uniquely positioned to collect information to identify emerging threats and assist in the development of more comprehensive threat assessment secretary chertoff speaking from his experience as former federal prosecutor and judge has noted that many organized crime cases were intelligence driven and that state and local police were best placed to discover anomalies in their communities that can lead to the prevention of violent acts 14 although the fusion process as outlined above goes beyond law enforcement or criminal intelligence the counterterrorism role of state and local law enforcement has been outlined in numerous reports 15 those who agree with secretary chertoff are apt to argue that the 800000 plus law enforcement officers across the country know their communities most intimately and therefore are best placed to function as the eyes and ears of an extended national security community they have the experience to recognize what constitutes anomalous behavior in their areas of responsibility and can either stop it at the point of discovery more traditional law enforcement approach or follow the anomaly or criminal behavior either unilaterally or jointly with the federal bureau of investigation fbi to extract the maximum intelligence value from the activity more intelligencebased approach 16 numerous examples are cited by officials as demonstrating the counterterrorism role that state local and tribal governments and by extension fusion centers which have law enforcement as their core function can play ambassador thomas mcnamarathe program manager for the information sharing environment 17cited three examples at the first annual national fusion center conference the first was narcotics investigation conducted by federal state and local law enforcement that revealed canadianbas ed organization supplying precursor chemicals to mexican methamphetamine producers was in fact hezbollah support cell second case involved local law enforcement investigation in torrance california in which an individual engaged in series of gas station robberies dropped his cell phone the phone was exploited by law enforcement officers who uncovered homegrown jihadist cell planning series of attacks another investigation into cigarette

theft ring led to the discovery of domestic group supporting chechen terrorists19 one school of thought suggests that sound law enforcement alone can disrupt terrorist plots this theory may be accurate as it pertains to individual terrorists or terrorist groups that are not particularly welltrained or resourced and as result may be more aspirational than operational however unsophisticated and lowtech these amateur extremist groups may be their intent is hostile and their activities are it could be argued worthy of disruption generally through law enforcement actions 20 one important question regarding this theory isare basic law enforcement tools which demand criminal predicate prior to the collection of intelligence likely to only uncover less sophisticated terrorists and forms of terrorist activity21 are current law enforcement methodologies including those that are deemed proactive such as intelligenceled policing effective tools for discovering the unknowns about potential terrorist activity in ones community or are different approaches necessary 22 it could be argued that sophisticated terrorist operatives may be so welltrained as to avoid any potential illegal activity that may undermine their inimical plots these operatives may dissociate themselves from direct interaction with supporters who may engage in criminal acts do all terrorists or terrorist supporters within the united states engage in criminal activity the answers to this question are arguable if however the premise that sophisticated terrorists do not necessarily engage in criminal activity is accepted is reactive and ex post facto collection of intelligence sufficient to uncovering sophisticated terrorist plots 23 moreover what are the limits of aggressive and pro active intelligence collection by state local and tribal security and law enforcement personnel

fusion cent ers are one of the most important tools that the community has to collect and connect the dots that can protect people and critical infrastructure he was however cautious to stipulate that he views these centers as entities of the state and local governments that established them and that the federal government had intention of controlling the centers according to secretary chertoff the desired end state is as follows 19 see criminal intent an police bust shows new tactics for fighting terrorofficers use local laws to arrest small offenders with highrisk po tentialfoiling chechen

arrest of group of men accused of plotting to attack military base in new jersey nj the would be terrorists were ultimately discovered because they took one of their terrorism training videos into circuit city store to be copied in to dvd format while the clerks actions in calling the local police who subsequently called nj office of homeland security and preparedness are laudable one could

but network of centers all across the country network which is visible not only to us at the federal level but as important if not more important visible to each of you working in your own communities so you can leverage all the information gathered across the country to help you carry our your very important objectives 24 the secretarys emphasis on the importance of fusion centers serving the state and local communities that largely own and operate them has been echoed by others25 counter argument for concentrating fusion resources at the subfederal level suggests that state and local authorities may not have the necessary resources and experience to conduct the level of advanced andor strategic analysis necessary for achieving true fusion

development one risk focuses on the hazards associated with creating fusion centers without the requisite philosophical and organizational changes necessary within the in telligence and law enforcement communities to sustain the work of the centers the other risks focus on factors that could ultimately diminish political and popular support for fusion centers and ultimately result in their demise or marginalized contribution to the national homeland security mission

fusion centers may have been premature that is the establishment of these entities in the absence of common understanding of the underlying discipline creating fusion center is tangible action that seeks to enhance state andor regional coordination and cooperation to prevent and mitigate and in some cases respond and recover from homeland security threats however if fusion center development occurs devoid of more fundamental transformation is any real progress made is the country any safer or more prepared with fusion centers or have we created false sense of security given recent terrorist activity overseas including plots and activity in the united kingdom what should fusion centers do to recognize potential indicators of similar plots in the homeland it could be argued that if information flow into fusion centers is limited the quality of the information is questionable and the center doesnt have personnel with the appropriate skill sets to understand the information then the end result may not provide value furthermore if fusion center constituent agencies dont buy into common fusion and prevention philosophy that arguably needs to accompany fusion centers ie responsibility for security proactive approach and 24 derived from crs transcription of secretary chertoffs keynote address to the first annual national fusion center conference march 6 2007 25 for

threats can fusion centers be effective it is also important to ask if fusion centers offer some benefit who are the beneficiaries are the benefits limited to the states and regions the fusion centers were largely designed to serve given the centers were largely molded by the needs politics and resources of the given jurisdiction or is there freerider benefit for the federal government and the nation as whole it could be argued that with little or investment in state andor regional fusion centers the federal government stands to gain some benefit if it is possible for state and regional fusion centers to serve state local regional and national interests what is an equitable division of responsibility labor and resources another philosophical concern stems from the different conceptions of intelligence among the intelligence and law enforcement communities see appendix in the absence of common understanding about what constitutes intelligence fusion center development and progress may be impeded ultimately without common framewo rk among disparate fusion centers and other homeland security agencies it is possible that benefits of the their efforts will remain narrow rather than having national impact while fusion center guidelines discussed more indepth below represent movement to provide fusion centers with common framework and were generally wellreceived by the centers arguably the guidelines have the following limitations 1 they are voluntary 2 the philosophy outlined in them is generic and does not translate theory into practice and 3 they are oriented toward the mechanics of fusion center establishment

the essence of fusion as outlined above is the integration and analysis of existing streams of information and intelligence for actionable public policy endsbe they counterterrorism broader countercrime issues or natural disaster response embedded in the fusion process is the assumption that the end product of the fusion process can lead to more targeted collection of new intelligence to include private sector data which can help to prevent crime it could be argued that through more proactive and targeted intelligence process one that has as its starting point an intelligence gap or unknown about particular threat it is possible that sophisticated criminal groups could be undermined however the potential fusion center use of private sector data the adoption of more proactive approach and the collection of intelligence by fusion center staff and partners has led to questions about possible civil liberties abuses director of national intelligence mike mcconnell acknowledges the difficulty of balancing effective intelligence efforts with civil liberties concerns stating the intelligence community has an obligation to better identify and counter threats to americans while still safeguarding their privacy but the task is inherently difficult oneone challenge is determining how and wh it is appropriate to conduct surveillance on group of americans who are say influenced by qaedas jihadist philosophy on one level they are us citizens engaging in free speech and associating freely with one another on another they could be plotting terrorist attacks that could kill hundreds of people 26 arguments against fusion centers often center around the idea that such centers are essentially preemptive law enforcementthat intelligence gath ered in the absence of criminal predicate is 26 mike mcconnell overhauling intelligence foreign affairs julyaugust 2007

further law enforcement public safety and private sector representatives get away from criminal predicate the greater the chances that civil liberties may be violated furthermore it could be argued that one of the risks to the fusion center concept is that individuals who do not necessarily have the appropriate law enforcement or broader intelligence training will engage in intelligence collection that is not supported by law27 the concern is to what extent if at all first amendment protected activities may be jeopardized by fusion center activities according to the american civil liberties union aclu were setting up essentially domestic intelligence agency and were doing it without having full debate about the risks to privacy and civil liberties 28 furthermore the aclu is also concerned with having dhs perform coordinating role at the federal level with respect to these centers we are granting extraordinary powers to one agency without adequate transparency or safeguards that hasnt shown congress that its ready for the job 29 most of the fusion center representatives interviewed for this report appeared to be aware of the need to be respectful of privacy and civil liberties as result of 28 cfr part 23 the fusion center guidelines30 the national criminal intelligence sharing plan ncisp31 dhsdepartment of justice dojsponsored fusion center conferences and dhsprovided technical assistance training as well as interactions with peer fusion centers several fusion centers had or were in the process of creating governance board to serve an oversight function especially on civil liberty concerns in one case fusion center cited concern for civil liberties as the reason it had specifically chosen former judge to sit on its governing board many centers also claim to have privacy policies couple of which were reviewed by local aclu or other civil liberties organization representatives 32 however few of the centers had aggressive outreach programs to explain to the public the type of intelligence activities their centers could and could not engage in there are exceptions for example one state fusion center works closely with the most active civil liberties organization in the state provides the centers standard operating procedures to the public and has appointed state attorney general office representative to the centers governing board in order to proactively address civil liberties issues33 another state center has brought in nonprofit research and training organization to audit their operations plan s to invite civil liberties groups into the center to show its operations and even stenciled the first amendment and the following quote by harry truman on its walls 27 some might argue that the entire concept for fusion centers particularly those aspects involving the incorporation of private sector data that may not be accurate or based on any criminal predicate is f undamentally flawed if there is little legal recourse for citizens to challenge information related to them that resides in commercially available databases and such information is included in fusion center operations privacy rights and civil liberties could be undermined 28 see shane harris issues and ideas fusion centers raise fuss in national journal february 10 2007 29 ibid 30 one of the prominent fusion center guidelines

never for the opinions they have34 an official from fusion center that advocated proactive approach to civil libertiesrelated outreach warned colleagues of the dangers of civil liberties abuses saying even the perception of abuse associated with single center will be devastating for us all 35 those centers not engaged in proactive civil liberties outreach effort cited the lack of need andor the lack of funds as impediments for dertaking such an effort several fusion centers suggested they did not need such proactive outreach program on civil liberties because there had been local complaints about civil liberties abuses in few cases fusion centers had done targeted outreach to assure specific communities that the fusion center and other law enforcement agencies were not out to target them but these programs did not reach large audience others suggested that other statelocal agencies were responsible for such programs although most of them were described as general homeland securityrelated rather than specific to concerns related to the fusion center in several cases fusion centers suggested they wanted to do public relations campaign but they didnt have the necessary funds while this report is not meant to provide an author itative legal interpretation of related law due to disparate state laws authorizing fusion center or criminal intelligence activities for purposes of criminal intelligence systems most fusion centers operate under federal regulations in addition to any applicable state policies laws or regulations36 at the federal level the authorities which guide the fbi in collection of intelligence are the attorney general s guidelines for fbi national security investigations and foreign intelligence collection 37 at the state and local levels if there is any analogue to the attorney generals guidelines for multijurisdictional criminal intelligence systems it is 28 code of federal regulations cfr judicial administration chapter 1 department of justice part 23 criminal intelligence systems operating policies many centers cite 28 cfr part 23 as the guiding legal mechanism for their criminal intelligence operations by its terms 28 cfr part 23 applies to all criminal intelligence systems operating through support under the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 as amended from the perspective of intelligence collection the 28 cfr part 23 standard is reasonable suspicion one of the operating principles of 28 cfr part 23 is that project shall collect and maintain criminal intelligence information concerning an individual only if there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal conduct or activity and the information is relevant to that criminal conduct or activity 38 further 34 interview with

information exists which established sufficient facts to give trained law enforcement or criminal investigative agency officer investigator or employee basis to believe that there is reasonable possibility that an individuals or organization is involved in definable criminal activity or enterprise 39 the question of how to balance civil liberties with security remains an open issue congress and the country often weighs the balancing is arguably moving target driven by the countrys collective sense of security and safety the nation cannot necessarily have absolute security nor absolute liberty pendulum swings between relative amounts of each of these public goods the question to which there is definitive answ er raised here is how aggressive should fusion centers be in proactively collecting and analyzing intelligence that may go beyond that which may be entered into criminal intelligence systems that fall under federal law which entity at the federal level is auditing the activities of fusion centers to ensure civil liberties are not violated given that these centers are creations of state and local governments should an entity of the federal government be the ultimate arbiter of civil liberties protection g18g152g157g142g151g157g146g138g149g561g20g146g156g148g559g22g146g150g142g561 some homeland security observers suggest that the rush to establish and enhance state fusion centers is post911 reaction and that over time some of the centers may dissolve it could be argued that in the absence of another terrorist attack or catastrophic natural disaster over the course of the next 5 to 10 years state and regional fusion centers may be eliminated andor replaced by regional fusion organizations the state fusion regional representation organizations may be an entity to facilitate future center consol idation efforts issues that may lead to state and regional fusion center consolidation into regional organizations include perceived lack of need by state leaders state and federal financial constraints duplication of effort without showing tangible products and services within given center and reduction of risks to given geographic location alternatively if there are additional terrorist attacks or natural disasters in the near future and fusion centers can demonstrate their tangible value by serving as proactive analytic andor operational informationintelligence hubs it is plausible that substantial additional federal state and local funds may flow to these centers

jurisdiction specific federal programs that fund andor support fusion centers ie dhs and fbi detailee programs could potentially also suffer under funding cuts it is unclear how fu sion centers would fare in such situation it is likely that the fate of fusion centers would diff er drastically from state to state depending on range of factors to include their level of maturity buyin from other agency partners their resource needs and noted successes balanced with other critical issues and programs within the jurisdiction during research for this report one fusion center official stated that if federal funding went away his fusion center would continue to operate albeit with less staff and possibly with more limited scope it could be argued in some states that fusion centers would not be able to continue long after federal dollars and support ceases to exist others might disagree believing it is quite possible that many fusion centers would survive despite dwindling federal support it is even possible that many fusion centers would survive even after drastic decline in state and local funding because states and localities would be in difficult position to officially dismantle these centers g7g159g152g149g158g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g8g158g156g146g152g151g561g5g142g151g157g142g155g561g5g152g151g140g142g153g157g561 as previously mentioned almost all state and regional fusion centers were created after the september 11th attacks while the attacks were the direct impetus for the creation of most state and regional centers the fusion center movement did not occur in

model also impacted the rise of state and regional fusion centers since 1990 28 areas have been designated as hidtas across the country 46 hidtas are designed to be multiagency entities that facilitate the coordination of law enforcement counterdrug efforts across all levels of government prior to 911 the benefits of collocation coordination of resources and information sharing across agencies was apparent to many in the law enforcement communities and there were several states and regions that were looking to replicate the hidta model in their communities in one case state had discussed creating hidtalike center in the area of the state that was not serviced by the existing hidta prior to 911 however the initiative lacked the political support to facilitate funding 47 after the attacks the proposal was revised and soon thereafter became that states fusion center48 in several cases post911 stateregional fusion centers have been located with hidta centers and in one case organizationally linked with the local hidtaperhaps an indication of the importance of the hidta model influence on the fusion center movement continued intelligenceled policing pr newswire

the growing focus on more intelligenceoriented policing models and the success of multi agency law enforcement efforts like the hidtas combined with post911 public demand and political support to create strong movement toward including subfederal law enforcement and nontraditional stakeholders in counterterrorism however unlike hidtas which are largely federally funded and managed this new movement was largely grassroots movement with state and regional leaders leading the charge former massachusetts governor mitt romney is an advocate of the role states and locals would play stating fundamentally we recognize that we cant protect the homeland by just putting cop out on the corner of the street we have too many bridges roadways hospitals schools tunnels trains you just cant protect all of the possible terrorist targets you have to find the bad guys before they carry out their bad acts that requires intelligence and the states and localities are going to finally have to be major part of that 49 this appears to be manifestation of fundamental shift in thinking regarding responsibility for national security in which state and local officials are increasingly taking responsibility for traditionally conceptualized federal roles this may have been the result of belief that regardless of origina terrorist training camp in afghanistan or radicalized cell in lackawanna ny state and local public officials are ultimately responsible for the safety of their citizens furthermore there was strong sentiment among state and local officials and law enforcement agencies that the federal government had not provided enough of the right information and intelligence to enable them to potentially prevent future attack or at least mitigate its impact and respond effectively

traditionally national defense and security were the responsibility of the federal government the homeland security advisory council hsac ac knowledged this reality when it addressed intelligence sharing in its 2005 report which states for the most part terrorismrelated information has traditionally been collected outside of the united states typically the collection of this type of information was viewed as the responsibility of the intelligence community and therefore there was little to involvement by state and local enforcement entities 50 it could also be argued the nature of postcold war transnational substate threats increasingly requires all levels of government all levels of law enforcement and wider spectrum of public and private officials to work together to protect the united states this may be especially important given the possibility that 49 cnn american morning breaking news bin laden tape interview with governor mitt romney cnn transcript december

appears to have been two waves of post911 fusion center development the first occurring in 2003 and the second wave of fusion centers that gained momentum in approximately 2005 based on conversations with some fusion centers this second wave gained momentum following the national governors association nga meeting in 2005 indeed the nga published its 2006 survey of state homeland security advisors and found that developing state intelligence fusion center ranked as their third priority 52 the importance of fusion centers to enhance states ability to collect analyze and disseminate intell igence and intelligence sharing among federal state and local government was priority in the previous survey nga released in january 2005 other catalysts include the homeland security advisory council hsac53 meeting in march 2005 the preliminary conclusions of which included that each state should establish an information center that serves as 247 all source multi disciplinary information fusion center54 many fusion centers also stated that their elected leaders law enforcement and other officials realized that this was national trend and recogn ized that the federal government was starting to provide funding to support existing centers defining moment in this realization appears to have been when the national governors association issued its 2007 governors guide to homeland security which identified intelligence fusion centers as one of 10 key points new governor should examine in an effort to enhance their states security intelligence fusion centers according to the nga are the focal point for information and intelligence sharing among local state and federal agencies from variety of disciplines55 the continued efforts of global justice information sharing initiative global56 the establishment of the ise and the publication of the fusion center guidelines amongst other developments also appear to have validated the growing fusion efforts at the state and local level

variously defined within single state ranges from two to eight in some states the fusion centers appear to work well together or at least have taken steps to enhance their working relationship in several states they have worked to prevent the creation of multiple nonintegrated information silos by ensuring automatic electronic data sharing or using the same information management system in at least two states representatives from the fusion centers andor its managing agency sat on the governing board of the other center in the state there was one case in which regional fusion center worked to help secure more funding for the state center which was having trouble getting homeland security grant funds due to the 8020 mandated split for local and state governments 59 this will be addressed in more depth later in the report in other cases there appeared to be friction when several fusion centers are operating or are proposed for development within single statesome even appeared to be in competition with each other overall the relationships between the multiple fusion centers within single state havent been long established and well tested it has been reported that in november 2007 dhs secretary chertoff and attorney general mukasey sent letter to each state governor asking for the designation of single fusion center to interface with the federal government for purposes of sharing homeland security information 60 g15g146g156g156g146g152g151g550g21g140g152g153g142g561 given the fractured development of grassroots fusion centers around the country and the broad nature of federal guidelines on the subject fusion centers have significantly different roles and responsibilities some fusion centers are solely counterterrorism focused while others have broader mission some are prevention oriented wh ile others have response andor recovery role with regard to the ultimate purpose of state and regional fusion centers the topic remains open to debate in some cases the stated purpose of these centers has shifted in the few years they have been operating many of the firstwave centers those created soon after 911 were initially solely focused on counterterrorism today less than 15 of the fusion centers interviewed for this report described their mission as solely counterterrorism in the last year many counterterrorismfocused centers have expanded their mission to include allcrimes andor all hazards for some this shift is official for others it is defacto reflected in the day to day operations of the center but not in official documentation this shift towards an allcrimes andor allhazards focus can be explained by several factors appearance of national trend need for local and nonlaw enforcement buyin and need for resources first leadership at several fusion centers interviewed for this report noted they believed the country was moving towards an allcrimes andor allhazards model and they felt they needed to move with the changing tide others suggested it was impossible to create buy in amongst local law enforcement agencies and other public sectors if fusion center was solely focused on counterterrorism as the centers partners often didnt

shades of meaning in the definition of allcrimes across fusion centers some fusion centers were concerned with any crime large or small petty or violent such centers provided support to invest igations into single criminal acts and larger criminal enterprises some centers however focused on largescale organized and destabilizing crimes to include the illicit drug trade gangs terrorism and organized crime one such center made the distinction that this approach was homeland security focused rather than allcrimes which appears to recognize the potentially destabilizing impact the aforementioned crimes can have on the overall security of community or region g3g149g149g556g10g138g163g138g155g141g156g561 little more than 40 of fusion centers interviewed for this report describe their center as all hazardsas well as allcrimes it appears as if allhazards means different things to different people the term itself appears to have come out of the federal emergency management agency fema work in the early 1980s to develop evacuation plans not only in response to nuclear attack but to address allhazards61 the allhazards approach to preparedness and mitigation two of the four interrelated emergency management actions the other two being postevent response and recoverysoon became part of the federal government and fema s approach to emergency management in many ways the concept has evolved from preparedness focus to more proactive stance after the september 11 th attacks the federal government continued to emphasize an allhazards approach to preparedness indeed the december 2003 homeland security preparedness directive hspd 8 encourages an allhazards appr oach to homeland security preparedness and specifically defines allhazards preparedness as preparedness for domestic terrorist attacks major disasters and other emergencies 62 however the focus of the term seems to have shifted with the help of the fusion center movement as some fusion centers appear to have adopted an allhazards mission with more proactive preventionfocused stance 61 intimations of mortality the economist november 26 1983 available from httpwwwlexiscom accessed on june 4 2007 see us

centers viewed allhazards as pertaining to either their data streams agency partners or the centers role for some allhazards suggests the fusion center is receiving and reviewing streams of incoming

representatives from the aforementioned array of public sectors are represented in the center andor considered partners to its mission at some centers allhazards denotes the entitys mission and

postevent response and possibly recovery role several fusion center officials that described their center as having an allhazards focus mentioned the influence of hurricane katrina on their centers

entirely preventionoriented allcrimes or counterterrorismfocused centers also facilitated situational awareness postevent again for both manmade or natural disaster in most cases allhazards oriented

majority of fusion center officials interviewed for this report saw their centers as primarily preventionoriented entities in order to prevent as well as mitigate variety of threats fusion centers work to enhance information sharing conduct threat assessments and analysis and support andor facilitate preparedness efforts to those ends most fusion centers acted as intelligenceinformation relay centers collocation centers for personnel from various agencies often with access to their agencies databases facilitators of coordination on variety of projects analytic centers and case support centers for example some centers operated largely as filtering stationssifting through many finished information and intelligence products from federal agencies other state fusion centers and state and local law enforcement agencies to identify relevant information for the centers jurisdiction which would be distributed to customer agencies in the region others added analytic value to existing products by supplementing local information or explicitly highlighting local connections to the larger trends some fusion centers check the variety of databases they and their partner agencies have access to in response to inquires from local police departments as the result of private citizen tip relating to suspicious incident or as result of information gleaned from another information product sometimes fusion centers provide case support to law enforcement agencies at all levels of government as general tre nd it appears as if all of the fusion centers interviewed for this paper are involved in at least one step of the intelligence cycle but none appears to be involved in all steps of the cycle g20g142g156g153g152g151g156g142g561 in most states there is an emergency

described by their leadership as being primarily prevention focused in order to be successful in preventing and mitigating threats fusion center officials across the county frequently advocate the proactive stance their centers have adopted many fusion centers state their proactive orientation marks departure from traditional po licing which is often reactive postevent and prosecution focused however research indicates that while fusion centers want to become more proactive many continue to follow reactive model most fusion centers respond to incoming requests suspicious activity reports andor finished informationintelligence products this approach largely relies on data points or analysis that are already identified as potentially problematic as mentioned above it could be argued that this approach will only identify unsophisticated criminals and terrorists the 2007 fort dix plot 65 may serve as good examplewould law enforcement have ever become aware of this plot if the wouldbe perpetrators hadnt taken their jihad video to video store to have it copied while state homeland security and law enforcement officials appear to have reacted quickly and passed the information to the fbi would they have ever be able to find wouldbe terrorists within their midst if those individuals avoided activities criminal or otherwise that might bring to light their plot it is unclear if single fusion center has successfully adopted truly proactive prevention approach to information analysis and sharing state and its local jurisdictions appear to have fully adopted the intelligence cycle while some states have seen limited success in integrating federal intelligence community analysis into their fusion centers research indicates most continue to struggle with developing true fusion process which includes value added analysis of broad streams of intelligence identification of gaps and fulfillment of those gaps to prevent criminal and terrorist acts

fusion center information sharing and analysis efforts is the centers access to and quality of relevant information and intelligence following the september 11 th attacks there was an outcry about the failure of information sharing between the federal intelligence and law enforcement communities and state and local officials the 911 commission concluded the biggest im pediment to allsource analysisto greater likelihood of connecting the dotsis the human or systemic resistence to sharing information66 as some homeland security observers have noted those who do not share information outside their agency may use the classification barrier not having appropriate clearances or the reciprocity challenge associated with security clearances having clearance sponsored by an agency other than the one that owned the information as an excuse for failing to probatively share information this was especially true with regards to vertical information sharing sharing 65 for more information

and local law enforcement and other first responders g5g149g142g138g155g138g151g140g142g156g561 in the nearly six years since the attacks it appears as if federal intelligence agencies have made concerted effort to provide clearances to numerous state and local personnel almost all fusion centers studied for this report had multiple personnel with security clearances although there were couple of exceptions that had few if any cleared personnel on average fusion centers appear to have 14 staff with secret clearances 67 which is not insignificant considering the average staff size of the fusion centers interviewed for this report was approximately 27 fulltime persons68 clearances for state and local personnel were not restricted to secretlevel clearances but also included some top secret approximately 6 persons on average and top secretsecure compartmentalized information sci approximately one person on average clearances as well 69 in some cases federal detailees to the centers held the highest level clearances in other cases state and local officials assigned to the center held tssci clearances it is important to note that discussions with fusion center officials suggest there is lag between obtaining clearances and obtaining the necessary equipment fo r receiving and storing classified intelligence it appears the fbi provided most of the initial security clearances for state and local authorities following september 11th according to the fbi as of august 2005 6011 such clearances have been authorized since the program began in 200270 however based on interviews with fusion centers that appears to be changing fusion center representatives claimed that in recent months dhs has increasingly conducted security clearances for state and local personnel at fusion centers fusion centers claimed that the dhs proces s has improved to the point that it was faster than the fbis in few cases fusion centers re ported turning to dhs after local fbi leadership longer offered to clear state and locals in their fusion center others suggested the fbi only provided highend top secret ts sci clearances while dhs conducted investigations for secret clearances regardless of who is sponsoring security clearances for nonfederal government personnel issues remain regarding reciprocity among agencies in recognizing anothers clearance which at times hinders an individual from accessing facilities and computer systems g5g149g138g156g156g146g143g146g142g141g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g156g561g3g140g140g142g156g156g561 in the past few years state and

in some cases fusion centers have large number of cleared parttime personnel 69 it should be noted that in some cases those individuals with top secret and top secret sci clearances are actually

to be priority for the dnis office as is evident by the efforts of the program manager for the information sharing environment pm ise or ise however it could be questioned whether the pmise has authorities commensurate with the offices responsibilities to implement its initiatives across all levels of government76 numerous fusion centers officials claim that although their center receives substantial amount of information from federal agencies they never seem to get the right information77 or receive it in an efficient manner according to many stat fusion center leaders often pertinent threat intelligence must be requested by fusion centers rather than federal agencies being proactive in providing it the obvious difficulty arises regarding the inability to request relevant threat information that is unknown to members of the fusion center the 911 commission criticized the lack of incentives to share information and penalties for those who didnt share within the intelligence community even if federal ic agencies have instituted incentives and penalties for informationintelligence sharing it is unclear if these requirements would apply to vertical sharing with state and local authorities as well as the private sector counterparts and what mechanisms might be in place to assess effectiveness both hr 1 and s 4 two bills pending before congress address enhanced information sharing mechanisms including monetary and nonmonetary awards to federal employees as incentives for information sharing 78

accounts information sharing between federal and subfederal agencies has improved since the september 11 th attacks however according to some fusion officials it appears that information sharing from the federal government to the state and local fusion centers continues to be largely reactive especially when it comes to information state and local officials believe is relevant to their jurisdiction several fusion center officials remarked that they receive such intelligence andor information when they request it which is an improvement over pre911 situation however according to fusion center officials federal agencies are still not proactive in reaching out to state and regional fusion centers sometimes even when connection to that locality is apparent in an analytic product

management systems that some of them manage have access to vast amounts of private sector data this is largely unfounded even within fusion centers that have long established relationships with private sector organizations and individual companies as some do fusion centers do not typically appear to have access to their data the flow of information from the private sector to fusion centers is largely sporadic event driven and manually facilitated it does not appear that these databases are directly linked together in general the private sector seems very wary of that level of sharing concerned with lack of government safeguards industrial espionage exposing weaknesses to competitors as well as privacy and civil liberties concerns

systems within the state or regionally despite federal efforts to promote the use of extensible markup language xml as the standard format across levels of government for justice and public safety information management systems81 fusion centers and states continue to purchase systems that operate using proprietary language and that cannot speak to other systems without additional equipment and costs this may be due to the lack of mandatory guidance on this issue and other technology related concerns currently all guidance on this is voluntary

consistent and constant issue raised by fusion center officials relates to the plethora of competing federal information sharing systems the fusion centers interviewed for this report cited numerous

sister systems hsinsecret and hsdn law enforcement online leo federal protective service fps portal regional information sharing systems riss among others respondent fusion center officials remarked

several sites but because of the occasional situation when it is not fusion center officials believe they need to check them all one official found the message from washington regarding efforts to streamline dissemination channels contradictory with the continued promoti on of individual agencys pet projects at the state and local level in addition fusion center officials found the systems usability and security lacking this problem affects not only how fusion centers receive information but how they pass it to federal agencies in several cases it appeared as if information flow to particular federal agency was severely impeded because the fusion center resisted using the systemportal run by the agency and did not have personal contacts to send information directly

secure spaces to house their classified information systems the lack of reciprocity for such spaces and the lack of coordination between federal agencies likely results in increased costs for fusion centers the construction of secure spaces needed to house classified intelligence systems can reportedly cost two to 10 times the cost of conventional office space depending on features required 82 construction companies estimate that the cost of building scif in an existing statelocal facility can cost 200500 per square foot and sometimes more depending on the requirements of the federal sponsoring agency 83 several fusion centers interviewed for this report mentioned estimated costs between 75000100000 to build each secure space at their respective centers in few cases fusion centers mentioned they had been advised they would need more than one such space because individual federal agencies had different security requirements for their own systems one such center that is moving to new space was told they needed to create three different secure spaces to house different federal information systemsa cost that would be largely if not entirely borne by the center 84

systematic overclassification was identified by the 911 commission report as preventing critical intelligence from reaching law enforcement state officials and infrastructure operators 85 it could be argued that the federal government has been slow to address the overclassification of intelligence and the culture of ownership over intelligence products generated by particular federal intelligence or law enforcement agencies continues to be an obstacle to information sharing 86 in addition there is serious lack of standardization regarding classification designations and dissemination

large number of distinct security designations and variety of handling instructions that make using classified information unnecessarily confusing and onerous 2006 government accountability office gao study found federal agencies involved with terrorismrel ated intelligence currently use total of 56 different designations for information they determined to be sensitive but unclassified and agencies that account for large percentage of the homeland security budget reported using most of these designations 87 more than half of the agencies involved in the study reported encountering difficulties sharing sensitive but unclassified information88 this is certainly echoed by state and local law enforcement agencies which found the multiplicity of designations and definitions not only causes confusion but leads to an alternating feast or famine of information89 in addition lack of clarity on dissemination rule s and lack of common standards for controlling sensitive but unclassified information often overwhelm end users with the same or similar information from multiple sources90 gao concluded that without standardization for security designations guidance and monitoring there is probability that the designation will be misapplied potentially restricting material unnecessarily or resulting in the dissemination of information that should be restricted91 one pmise effort that may ameliorate this issue is the controlled unclassified initiative cui which is seeking to reduce the number of sbu designations from over 100 to three with clear instructions for security handling and dissemination92 this initiative appears to still be in the development stage g17g159g142g155g556g140g149g138g156g156g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561 congress and the administration have acted to address overclassification through the irtpa which required the president within 270 days of the enactment of irtpa to issue guidelines for acquiring accessing sharing and using information including guidelines to ensure that information is provided in its most shareable form such as by using tearlines to separate out data from the sources and methods by which the data are obtained93 to

irtpa the 911 commission also addressed the issue of overclassification in its final report the report proposes that when an intelligence report is first created its data be separated from the sources and methods by which they are obtained the report should begin with the information in its most shareable but still meaningful form therefore the maximum number of recipients can access some form of that information if knowledge of further details becomes important any user can query further with access granted or denied according to the rules set for the networkand with queries leaving an audit trail in order to determine who accessed the information 95 the argument that security designations are often necessary due to sensitive sources and methods which prevents intelligence from reaching many slt officials may be overstated in many cases the intelligence may have even been culled from open source information in addition the majority of fusion center officials interviewed for this report were near emphatic that they were not concerned with sources and methods rather fusion center officials wanted to know if the originating agency had deemed the threat credible and if the threat had been corroborated g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g497g561g3g561g21g157g138g157g142g561g18g142g155g156g153g142g140g157g146g159g142g561 while not mandated by federal law or executive order many federal government agencies recognize the utility of state created fusion centers as such over the past two years the federal government has provided financial support to the fusion centers with the states continuing to pay for approximately 80 of fusion center budgets 96 while state leadership has expressed appreciation for this funding others have questioned the effectiveness of federal government support to state fusion centers 97 other state leaders are concerned that the desire for additional federal funding and direction may be problematic as they are concerned that the greater support

as major hurdle in channeling the homeland security funds toward statewide fusion center efforts several also cited the required spending split as leading to the creation of regional fusion centers within states that already had statewide center operating these requirements have been used in several previous grant cycles101 much like the diverse missions of fusion centers state and federal funding and programmatic support to the nations fusion centers also varies greatly as noted earlier in the report to date the nations fusion centers have largely been paid for with state funds some of the surveyed fusion centers did not receive state or federal startup funds and were established by simply combining and renaming existing state andor local public safetyrelated agencies into state fusion center annual budgets for the fusion centers studied for this report appear to range from the tens of thousands to several million with one outlier at over 15 million similarly the sources of funding differed significantly from center to centeras stated some were entirely dependent on diverting funds from existing state andor local f unding streams while others were largely funded by federal grants federal funding ranged from 0100 of fusion center budgets with the average and median percentage of federal funding at approximately 31 and 21 respectively thus it appears that on the whole fusion centers are predominately state and locally funded g21g157g138g143g143g146g151g144g561 in general the fusion centers studied for this report remain largely law enforcement oriented

full time staff at approximately 27 persons part time personnel ranged from 0 to over 100 with the average number of part time staff at fusion centers running far lower federal representation at the fusion centers in question is small percentage wise but can have big impact on the center itself such participation can provide access to additional information streams and help facilitate the

local departments some may argue this is natural given the majority of fusion centers are statewide entities that grew out of state policebureau of investigation intelligenceanalysis units of the local law enforcement agencies represented the overwhelming majority are from the largest local police departments in the country which have more resources and in some cases intelligence units which are somewhat rare in local police departments as will be discussed below while in general law enforcement and public safety officials have more prior experience with intelligence then the other nonlaw enforcement public sector entities that are increasingly involved in fusion centers it is important not to overstate law enforcement experience andor resources with regard to intelligence in general many local law enforcement agencies may not have an intelligence or analytic unit reiterating what rand found in 2004 when it reported that 64 percent of state law enforcement agencies reported having separate criminal intelligence unit as compared to only 10 percent of local law enforcement agencies102 while many local police departments do not have an intelligence unit they may have an analysts however even when local departments have an analysts and were interested in detailing someone to the fusion center they may not have enough man power to do so on full time basis and for many on part time basis there are many other cases where local law enforcement agencies appear unconvinced of the value of fusion centersand by their costbenefit analysis it does not currently benefit the department to detail personnel to the center

although the majority of fusion center personnel come from law enforcement agencies not all of them are sworn officers it appears that most fusion centers have made concerted effort to hire crime andor intelligence analysts in one case fusion center had tactically oriented case support analysts and more strategic analysts that managed specific threat portfolios as well as nonsworn analyst supervisors103 over the last two funding cycles fusion centers have increasingly hired contract analysts using homeland security funds although the length of the contracts has proved problematic for many fusion centers which will be discussed further below g16g152g151g556g14g138g160g561g7g151g143g152g155g140g142g150g142g151g157g561g18g142g155g156g152g151g151g142g149g561 allhazards centers are more likely than their counterterrorism or allcrimes colleagues to have noncriminal justice personnel104 to include department of health fire emergency management services ems and other nontraditional homeland security partners in the public sector surprisingly there were number of fusion centers that had been described as allhazards that did not have nonlaw enforcement personnel working in the center in many cases nonlaw enforcement public sector detailees to the fusion centers worked parttime andor had desk and were precleared so they could work out of the center as needed andor during an

have some federal presence the agencies represented roles they play and size of detailee staff differed significantly from center to center to varying degrees federal participation in state and regional fusion centers appears to influence the relationship between levels of government state and local access to information and resources the flow of informationintelligence and maturation with regards to intelligence cycle functions approximately 30 of fusion centers are collocated with federal agencys and as result that federal agencys may have significant influence on their development operation and even budget demands there appears to be direct correlation between contact between federal agency and fusion center and the centers positive outlook on the relationship between the two in general fusion centers collocated with federal agency reported favorable relationships with that agency this was often in stark contrast to the views of other fusion centers not collocated with federal agencys for instance one fusion center collocated with immigration and customs enforcement ice had nothing but praise for the agency but another fusion center not collocated expressed frustration at not getting cooperation from ice 105 it should be noted that collocation and praise for interagency coordination does not necessarily translate to enhanced organizational effectiveness many fusion center leaders stated that collocation and the appearance of seamless coordination did not obviate the need to frequently inquire about information or an incident that was known to federal employees but not shared with state fusion center representatives furthermore fusion centers that were not collocated with federal agency but had representative from federal agency located full time in the center were more likely to have favorable impression of the relationship between the two than centers that lacked such representative thus it is not surprising that many of the fusion center directors surveyed spoke of close relationship with the local fbi entities jttf field office and fig given the large number of detailees from those entities

the central if implicit themes that runs throughout this report is federalism that is while fusion centers were largely established by states if the federal intent is to create network of fusion centers that can be leveraged for both state local and federal public safety and homeland security purposes there are several challenges that must be overcome research indicates one of the central challenges of designing constructive and productive federal role in supporting these state and local fusion centers is working to ensure that the centers retain their state and locallevel identity and support from those communities according to many homeland security observers one manifestation of this tension lies in the need to strike balance between the national needs for consistent provider of state and local threat information with the states autonomy to pursue issues deemed of importance to local jurisdictions 106 this tension is often notable when reviewing the diverse and at times incompatible types of threat and warning products required 105 interviews with state fusion center officials april 12 april 17 and may 2 2007 106 with passage of the implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 pl 11053 dhs was given significant authorities for supporting state and local fusion center activities while undertaking efforts to improve information flow into the federal government for purposes of performing terrorism threat assessments

homeland security and law enforcement entities part of the challenge from the federal perspective has been how to guide but not dictate to the owners and operators of these largely stateestablished entities prior to the provision of any federal financial support and once federal financial and human resources support was provided how to coordinate and target these resources for maximum overall return on investment another example of how federa lism flows throughout the fusion center issue is the legal treatment of terrorism terrorism is federal crime if it is prosecuted at all it is usually done at the federal level however since the september 11th attacks terrorism has been codified as crime in many states107 another example of how federalism permeates fusion centers is privacy there is one federal privacy act108 and numerous state privacy laws109 if fusion centers are serving both state local and federal ends one of the central questions becomes what is the role of the federal government in supporting these centers and what products and services can the federal government reasonably expect the centers to produce given federal funding levels as elements of the states and regions they serve fusion centers began to develop critical mass or staying power in the years immediately following the terrorist attacks of 2001 as these centers continued to proliferate across the country and garnered state support federal entities began to take notice while some 30 percent of the fusion centers interviewed were established prior to 2004 concrete federal financial support for the centers did not materialize until fiscal year 2004 when according to dhs it provided 29 million of homeland security grant program funding 110 federal guidance to the fusion centers followed shortly thereafter in july 2005 finally in 2006 human capital support in the form of dhs and fbi detailees to the centers began taking place while dhs has provided direct financial support to the fusion centers through the hsgp the fbi has not provided direct financial support the fbis contributions have come more in the form of support for security clearances111 personnel support and other inkind contributions such as rent payments when centers are collocated with fbi joint terrorism task forces or field intelligence groups112 the federal government has played several roles in assisting states and regions to develop their fusion centers including the provision of recognition post911 of the need to have state and local governments and the private sector nontraditional actors in national security matters play an increasingly important role in homeland security 107 national conference of state legislatures summaries of crimerelated terrorism state enactments available from

as alluded to above the rise of state and regional fusion centers is part of greater movement to decentralize homeland security to include nontraditional stakeholders public health emergency responders and the private sector at all levels of government to include state local and tribal the federal government appears to have recognized that the september 11th attacks signaled need for greater state and local participation in homeland security the 2002 national strategy for homeland security acknowledges the expansion of responsibility for homeland defense and security stating the nature of american society and the structure of american governance make it impossible to achieve the goal of secure homeland through federal executive branch action alone the administrations approach to homeland security is based on the principles of shared responsibility and partnership with the congress state and local governments the private sector and the american people 113 even prior to the attacks of 9112001 before the term homeland security was part of our national lexicon the department of justice was working to ensure public safety and criminal information was shared across levels of governments in 1998 the department of justice created the global justice information sharing initiative global group of groups representing more than 30 independent organizations spanning the spectrum of law enforcement judicial correctional and related bodies 114 in october 2003 global released the national criminal intelligence sharing plan ncisp which sought to link federal state and local law

for fusion centers has largely come in the form of homeland security grant program hsgp funding while the amount of funds recently provided by congress to dhs to support state fusion center activities are unknown past departmental funding activities could be interpreted as somewhat confusing the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 provides dhs office of security and office of intelligence and analysis funds to support state and local fusion centers 123 in december 2006 dhs reported that it has provided over 380 million in support of these centers124 according to dhs office of grants and training gt representative this information includes the period from 2001 to the end of 2006125 subsequently in april 2007 dhs reported that in fiscal years 20042006 it provided total of 131 million to establish or enhance fusion center or fusion cell126 if the 250 million delta between these two figures is attributable to time alone that would mean that from march 2003 when dhs was established the department allocated127 approximately 250 million to 121 according to the deputy program manager for the ise federal governmentwide ise privacy guidelines committee has been established to ensure

given the lack of dhs focus on fusion centers at that time128 and the small number and relative immaturity of fusion centers in existence during the 20012003 time period according to dhs representative the difference between the two figures lies in two factors time and requested versus actual funding data129 because data on actual funding lags data on requested funding in order to provide the most up to date information dhs gt has used both figures while this may be reasonable even given dhss methodological explanations such wide variance in funding 380 million versus 131 million can be misleading empirical research suggests that the figures cited by dhs as having been allocated to fusion centers do not necessarily reach the centers themselves 130 this may represent problem at the state level as state administrative agents s aas that administer hsgp funds may not always allocate funds in manner that is entirely consistent with how the funds were requested alternatively it could represent problem with how dhs has defined fusion centers and calculates the hsgp funding provided to the centers one example offered by fusion center leader noted that the center hired several analys ts using hsgp funds but within few months these personnel were reassigned to another nonfusion center homeland security effort131 according to dhs its methodology for calculating dhsfunded activities at fusion centers involves relying upon state and localities to report to the department through use of the state biannual strategy implementation reports bsir 132 an element of the grants reporting tool grt133 dhs searches through the grt databases using among other methods keyword search terms such as terrorism intelligence emergency preparedness response teams fusion analysis and others dhs recognizes this method has its limitations in terms of accuracy as it has stated because fusion center andor fusion cell related projects may exist in the grt that do not specifically use the term fusion in one of the search fields this list of projects should not be considered to be all inclusive of dhsfunded fusion center activities nationwide 134 moreover the information on dhssupported fusion center activities is based on grant recipients entry of information into the grt while this method of calculation may serve dhss purpose of articulating the specific projects funded related to fusion centers there are number of limitations associated with this methodology continued or fusion center contractors for products and services provided 128 interview with former senior dhs official may 2007 129 ibid 130 fusion center personnel are generally not the saa for federal grant funds and as result may not n ecessarily know the explicit origins of hsgp federal funds however respondent fusion center leaders or operational directors generally are aware of which information technology projects or human capital positions are funded with federal hsgp grants 131 interview with fusion center official may 7 2007 132 according to dhs officials the bsir reports require states to demonstrate how the actual expenditure of grant funds is linked to the states

both figures continue to be provided historical percentages of requested amounts that are approved for actual funding might prove helpful it speaks more to how hsgp funds may have been spent versus how they have been allocated notwithstanding the fact that fusion center guidelines may not have been developed until 2005 if dhs and doj have been supporting fusion center related activities since 2001 when there were few fusion centers the agencies should be able to ascertain the funding amount allocated to these activities grants allocated to fusion centers are done in manner consistent with annual hsgp guidelines which while increasingly including direct language relating to fusion center activities such as analysis of intelligence and information are not specifically targeted to fusion centers there is fusion center grant program if it is departmental priority to develop national network of fusion centers it could be argued that direct funding stream andor hsgp fusion center program might facilitate more targeted and tailored development of fusion centers alternatively it could be argued that targeting fusion center funding more directly could undermine broader homeland security goals which transcend fusion center activities in recent federal homeland security grant cycles funds were permitted to be used to finance several fusion centerrelated activities and infrastructure investments in review of fusion centers nationwide it appears that federal funding was likely to be used for start up costs and technology and infrastructure investment in the last two years of homeland security funding federal grants could be used to fund one to twoyear contractor slots for analysts at fusion centers additionally federal grants were used to fund training for fusion center personnel the salaries of federal employees detailed to fusion centers and the cost rent etc associated with collocation if federal agency housed the fusion center neither of which are funded through federal homeland security grants are also represented in the overall federal contributions tallied in this report another central question with respect to federal funding for fusion centers not unlike other federal funding streams is the extent to which it is reasonable to attach certain conditions to the funding as mentioned above one challenge is to retain the grassroots state and local priority basis of these centers yet from business perspective it is not unreasonable for the federal government to expect some return for its investment in fusion centers other than generally enhanced information sharing it is not certain what that return on investment is from the federal perspective part of this question may be resolved when decisions are made about the extent to which if at all the federal government determines sustainment funding will or will not be provided to the centers g21g158g156g157g138g146g151g150g142g151g157g561g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 one of the central questions and challenges to fusion centers continues to be the provision of sustainment funding or funding which is provided annually on sustainable basis to fusion centers to support personnel costs and information connectivity among other functions at the first annual national conference on fusion centers secretary chertoff stated that one of the manners in which dhs has supported fusion ce nters is by providing grant fundingover 300 millionfor the creation of fusion centers however he continued the funding

fundamental baseline capabilities this is not meant by the way to be sustainment funding we are not signing up to fund fusion centers in perpetuity but we do want to use these grants to target resources to help fusion centers make the capital investment and training investment to come to maturity and then of course we expect every community to continue to invest in sustaining these very important law enforcement tools 135 at the same conference where secretary chertoff delivered his direct message that sustainment funding was unlikely representative of the homeland security counc il hsc delivered seemingly more sanguine message on this topic according to the hsc representative the administration realizes that fusion centers are not fly by night operation and as result if we are asking you to invest resourceswe need to remain committed136 the hsc representative stated that while there were definitive percentage splits on burdensharing the administration was having such conversations 137 representative jane harman having recently visited numerous fusion centers raised concerns about fusion center sustainment funding stating all the dhs staff assistants detailees in the world wont get the job done if fusion centers do not have adequate and sustained funding without money theyre going to disappear and dhs state and local fusion center programs wont succeed 138 dhs chief intelligence officer echoed representative harmans funding concerns139 testifying that i share many of the concerns expressed by this subcommittee about creating sustainable fusion center capability at the nonfederal level dhs in partnership with doj is major supporter of fusion centers through our grants and accompanying technical assistance program and in providing classified infrastructure 140 alternatively it could also be argued that if fu sion centers can prove their tangible value to their state local and regional constituents support base funding will continue to be provided through state and local revenue sources empirically numerous respondent fusion centers shared that if federal funding is eliminated it was likely that the center would continue to exist but its activities would become far more parochialby focusing rgely on criminal intelligence relevant to the state and locality aloneand not issues pertaining to federal homeland security concerns what remains to be defined and will be addressed below is from federal perspective how is fusion center maturity defined and how is it being assessed by the federal government and according to what

research indicates that there are two levels of federal human capital support provided to fusion centersindividuals who have some level of contact with the centers as either local clients of the center andor providers of information to the center and parttime or fulltime federal detailees to centers the first category includes relatively broad range of federal law enforcement and public safety professionals including representatives from the national guard centers for disease control highintensity drug trafficking area s as well as various dhs elements the second category of parttime and fulltime detailees to the fusion centers is composed largely although not exclusively of fbi and dhs representatives while the fbi and dhs share certain missions such as counterterrorism they are unique agencies with distinctive missions and resource levels to meet their mission questions concerning the deployment of federal human capital resources to the centers might include to what extent have the fbi and dhs formally coordinated their deployments to fusion centers 141 how did the fbi and dhs determine to which fusion centers they would deploy personnel what criteria were used to support the decision what types of professionals were deployed to the center how have the fbi and dhs personnel currently deployed been utilized what roles have they played and what value have they added to fusion center operations and analysis table 1 below provides some data related to each of the aforementioned questions what is notable is that it does not appear that the fbi and dhs drafted joint formal strategy outlining their approach to interaction with the center s while each agency has its own unique mission counterterrorism and countering crime are two large areas of mission overlap between these two federal agencies and the state and local fusion centers moreover it also does not appear that the homeland security council coordinating body akin to the national security council nsc primarily focused on homeland security issues has issued national strategy for fusion centers 141 according to the deputy program manager for the ise the fbi and dhs are still developing an integrated deployment plan see remarks of susan b reingold deputy program manager ise at the national guard bureau j2 intelligence knowledge management conference june 12 2007 given that the fbi has already deployed 250 personnel and dhs is in 15 centers the effect such plan may have at this point may be marginal however such plan may prove useful if it clarified the roles and responsibilities of dhs and fbi detailees in the centers and outlined joint oversight process to monitor agency progress in effectively implementing those responsibilities

result in numerous centers with significantly increased human resources while others with arguably similar levels of risk remain in stage of relative immaturity due to lack of human resource support the question of what the federal government collectively defines as mature center or what the minimum level of capability for fusion center is from federal perspective it could be argued hampers the development of longterm and sustained partnership between the federal government and the state and regional fusion centers

fusion center leadership often described fbi detailees as having welldefined roles and responsibilities compared to that of the dhs representatives whose roles in the organization were often less welldefined 144 dhs officials claim to place department representatives based on the needs and wants of the center thus there appears to be wider spectrum of roles for dhs personnel detailed to the various state fusion centers as their tasks vary from an intelligence analyst to departmental coordinators to an advisor on federal grant applications yet all 15 dhs detailees come from the office of intelligence and analysis some critics suggest that work undertaken outside of the core information sharing role between dhs and the fusion centers hampers the primary reason for being detailed to the center and negates any opportunity to facilitate the flow of timely actionable allhazard information between state and local governments and the national intelligence and law enforcement communities 145 overall relationships with dhs were described by fusion centers having dhs detailee as relatively positive however by comparison fusion centers reported more favorable relationship with the fbi than dhs there are numerous plausible explanations for such attitudes ranging from the different missions of fbi and dhs to the sheer difference in numbers of fbi and dhs personnel assigned to these centers furthermore it is likely that fusion centers despite the traditional friction between state and local law enforcement and the fbi are more comfortable with the fbi because they share common lexicon and world view that comes with being member of the greater law enforcement community corporate dhs is however relatively new entity and in many ways state fusion center personnelwho are often sworn law enforcement officersare still trying to determine how they interact with the department an example of this is the concern many state and local law enforcement and fusion center staff have expressed regarding sharing law enforcement sensitive information with the department which often has contractor analysts and other nonlaw enforcement personnel review data on few occasions fusion centers mentioned steps they had taken to ensure dhs analysts would not be able to access various portals utilized by the center or participate in information sharing calls with other law enforcement agencies common refrain from state fusion center leadership was that there was coordination between the fbi and dhs with respect to substantive mission support and resource allocations were often 144 conversations with fusion center director may 2007 based on input from state fusion center leaders dhs personnel detailed to center performed functions ranging from analysis dhs liaison and coordination point of contact operations providing grant writing expertise logistics and administrative 145 statement of charles allen assistant secretary of intelligence and analysis department of

terrorismrelated issues that are brought to the attention of state fusion center entities are provided directly to the local jttf with the fbi146 deciding to investigate the issue or retu rning the lead to the reporting agency147 however dhs has also requested that all state fusion centers report any suspicious incident that may be perceived to be terrorist activity to the department confusion exists whether this information should be transmitted to dhs office of intelligence and analysis the dhs national operation center or provided simultaneously to the dhs and the fbi jttf if the latter homeland security observers are concerned that due to lack of definitive federal roles and responsibilities crucial information may not be acted upon as dhs and the fbi will presume the other agency is undertaking the proper due diligence of ascertaining the viability of potential threat the reporting chain problemfrom state and local fusion centers to the federal government has been recognized under ise guideline 2 one recommendation is that doj and dhs in consultation with the program managers office develop standards to 1 specify the means through which state local and tribal data related to terrorist risks and threats and associated requirements and tasks is communicated to federal authorities and private sector entities and 2 develop maintain and disseminate assessments of terrorist risks and threats gathered at the state local or tribal levels and 3 develop processes and protocols to ensure suspicious incident reports and suspicious activity reports are reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities 148 implementation of this recommendation within fusion centers remains nascent and therefore inefficient dissemination procedures continue related problem that further highlights the lack of coordination between the federal agencies is the vehicles for reporting and receiving information as previously stated fusion center officials expressed continued frustration about the multiple seemingly competing information systems promoted by various federal agencies entering the same data into multiple databases is time consuming and inefficient one fusion center official criticized dhs and fbi for failing to consider fusion center needs while promoting their own favorite pet projects 149

goal located within the office of the director of national intelligence the program manger for ise has been working to integrate fusion centers into broad initiative to enhance information and intelligence between the federal government and state and local law enforcement and public safety entities as well as the private sector the homeland security advisory committee believes that the concept of intelligenceinformation fusi on has emerged as fundamental process or processes to facilitate the sharing of homeland securityrelated information and intelligence at the national level and therefore has become guiding principal in defining the ise 152 according to its information sharing envir onment implementation plan november 2006 the ise has or will take the following actions with respect to fusion centers establish federal fusion center coordination group to identify resources to support the development of network of statesponsored fusion centers charged to share information at all levels of the ise and will recommend funding options 153 encourage dhs and doj to work with governors and other senior state and local leaders to designate single fusion center to serve as the statewide or regional hub to interface with the federal government 154 encourage statewide and major area fusion centers to ensure locally generated terrorism information is communicated to the federal government through appropriate systems identified by federal officials as part of ise implementation 155 if as mentioned above one of the federal governme nts goals is to create national network of fusion centers to share homeland security information in timely and effective manner these initiatives once implemented will assist in integrating federal state and local public safety and law enforcement officials together however these initiatives do not necessarily in and of themselves constitute national strategy for fusion centers as they do not clearly articulate among other

relationship the itacg will have with state and regional fusion centers director for the hsac stated that dhs used to have it s own way of sending out information and the fbi did toonow thanks to the itacg we have coordinated way to send out threat assessment information 157 however there are some indications that the fbi and dhs will retain dissemination rights thus calling into question whether the itacg will streamline intelligence flow to state and local authorities or exacerbate the current information sharing channel problems158 some might suggest the itacg would be the natural arbiter for fusion center information and intelligence coordination efforts

have federal statutory basis federal agencies with homeland security responsibilities appear to be relying heavily on the information gathered at the local level to support the development of national threat assessment congress plays role in supporting these centers and federal government homeland security efforts in at least two areas first as mentioned above it authorizes and appropriates both hsgp funding some of which is allocated to support fusion center related activities and the national foreign intelligence program nfip budget which supports dhs and fbi personnel detailed to the centers second congress has held numerous hearings to learn more about fusion centers notably during the 109 th congress there were over five hearings held related to intelligence sharing dhs intelligence and fusion centers federal witnesses included representatives from the fbi dhs and office of the dni there were also numerous witnesses from state and local agencies including but not limited to the illinois state police the virginia fusion center the new jersey office of homeland security and preparedness and the commonwealth of massachusetts thus far in the 110 th congress there have been at least five hearings related to state and local fusion centers with one hearing taking place in washington state witnesses have included representatives from the private sector including the boeing company and pacific northwest national laboratory and individuals from state and local fusion centers in florida tennessee and delaware 156 according to conversation with senior odni official in january 2008 the itacg has accomplished the following 1 dhs official is currently the director of the itacg with an fbi serving as the deputy director 2 the nctc has allocated space for the agency and 3 two state and local officials have been detailed to the itacg with two other detailess to join the office in the coming months 157 quoting thomas bossert jason miller white house coun

challenges while attempting to meet the statutory mandates of the agency reportedly the itacg has had difficulty in having senior officials of the nctc dhs and fbi agree on the role and responsibilities of the organization it was also noted that the nctc has developed an organization that is coordinating with and providing intelligence products to state and local homeland security

as mentioned above all fusion centers are guided by federal regulation 28 cfr part 23 with respect to how they manage their multijurisdictional intelligence systems operating under title i of the omnibus crime control and safe stre et act of 1968 pl 90351 28 cfr part 23 requires all multijurisdictional law enforcement information management systems funded in part by federal grants161 to follow guidelines for the collection storage and purge of information 28 cfr part 23 states that information stored in such system must be reviewed and validated for continuing compliance with system submission criteria before the expiration of its retention period which in event shall be longer than five 5 years162 it is based on need to know and right to know which are not explicitly defined terms rather 28 cfr part 23 calls upon each project to establish their own written definitions163 in many ways 28 cfr part 23 may be outdated and in need of evaluation against the backdrop of the current threat environment 28 cfr part 23 is focused on traditional crime not terrorism as such it has relatively short information retention periods which may not necessarily be consistent with known terrorist planning cycles andor the need for historical data for terrorism threat assessment164 furthermore this federal regulation was written before many of the data storage and datamining technologies were avai lable it is unclear whether some of the technological devices available today like those that allow users to query disparate databases which are not directly connected would fall under the jurisdiction of 28 cfr part 23 the regulations also promote need and right to know standard which has been judged as one of the factors contributing to the real or perceived wall between intelligence and law enforcement at the federal level that prevents effective information flow finally it could be argued that 28 cfr part 23 is too vague in parts because it allows agencies to define their own 159 see pl 107296 section 201h codified at 50 usc 401a 160 see pl 11028 title i chapter 5 the language requires quarterly reporting to the house and senate appropriations

the relationship and role of the private sector is function that most state fusion centers have yet to fully define andor embrace number of the fusion centers surveyed have undertaken informational and securityrelated discussions with some of the major critical infrastructure owners and operators and dataproviders within their respective jurisdictions however while acknowledging that comprehensive understanding of the risks to the stateregion is impossible to attain without viable relationship and cons istent information flow between the center and the private sector entities within the centers jurisdiction the vast majority of centers have yet to put the processes in place to support such an endeavor very few of the state and regional fusion centers have an infrastructure sector representative detailed to their organization and rely in part on opensource information data provided by the federal government or contract data vendors for information about threats to critical infrastructure facility common reasons for the lack of relationship between the fusion center and private sector entities are prioritizing the infrastructure sectors to be represented in the center based on risk lack of appreciation as to the role and information sector representative might provide and the lack of federal government strategy or recommendations regarding how the fusion center should incorporate private sector data into the analytic fusion process

pending legislation and issues of concern to specific infrastructure sector isac organizations originally envisioned as mechanism for the sharing of critical infrastructure information between partnering corporations and with the federal government 165 currently are not being fully utilized by state and regional fusion centers as resource for information one option for fusion centers is to enhance their relationship with private sector organizations through the establishment of education and informationexchange efforts with isac representative organizations some homeland security observers suggest that the building of productive relationship with private sector entities may allow the fusion center to enhance information sharing efforts with operators of the states critical infrastructure and assist in the preparation and prevention phase of homeland security 165 the goal of presidential decision directive pdd 63 was to assure the security of the united states vulnerable and interconnected critical infrastructures with the signing of presidential decision directive 63 in may 1998 the private sector was encouraged to blish numerous isacs for the purpose of having

g9g152g159g142g155g151g150g142g151g157g561 as stated throughout this report some homeland security observers note that increasing the universe of available information does not necessarily translate into better understanding of the risks to geographic location or infrastructure sector since 911 many programs have been established or enhanced for the purposes of searching for signs of terrorist activity in central repository to assist with information collection trend analysis and spotting of anomalies 167 of note the dhs analysis dissemination visualization insight and semantic enhancement

provide information to the nations fusion centers to assist with analytic strategic indications and warnings should advise or other data collection and analysis programs become fully functional and accessible by fusion centers some might see this as devolution of national intelligence capabilities from the federal government to state governments resulting in the encroachment on individual civil liberties some are concerned that as fusion centers and the ic agencies codify relationships there is increased potential for misuse of private sector data it could be argued that such relationship will allow state entities to act as agents of the federal government in performing federal in telligence community activities that violate federal privacy laws 166 the dhss protected critical

the sensitivities associated with federalism there may not necessarily be federal remedy to every fusion center related issue identified in this report moreover there is direct correlation between federal remedies to issues affecting fusion center development and the extent to which congress wishes to condition the funds it authorizes and appropriates for such centers as result there are at least two categories of challenges and potential options i those challenges for which there are unique federal remedies and ii those challenges for which there are unique federal remedies and may be more oriented toward possible state or level governmental intervention congressional remedies could potentially involve broad range of possible actions including but not limited to oversight of federal agencies and entities engaged in interaction with fusion centers requesting executive branch action on any number of fusion ce nterrelated issues establishing statutory basis for fusion centers convening additional hearings which include state and local fusion center leaders as expert witnesses adjusting future funding levels for fusion centers andor considering the extent to which

notwithstanding the fact that individual fede ral agencies and offices may have their own strategies concerning their interaction with state and regional fusion centers there remains definitive national strategy on fusion centers one option for congress is to recommend the executive branch draft crossagency national strategy with input from the fbi dhs odni pmise dod and other intelligence community and state and regional fusion center representatives should such strategy be determined desirable it might address the following issues ownership and benefits who owns fusion centers and who benefits from their work federal versus slt roles and responsibilities to include funding what is an equitable division of labor and costs permanencestatutory basis and sustainment funding if fusion centers play an important homeland security role should they be provided statutory basis at the federal level if continued federal funding is being contemplated how might it be structured to yield the

security have coordinated plan for fusion and efficient interaction with fusion centers relationship between fusion centers and the federal intelligence center how closely if at all should fusion centers be integrated into the federal intelligence community are fusion centers members of the intelligence community adjuncts or partners with the intelligence community proxy information source or an unrelated and parallel information effort pros and cons there are many arguments in favor of the creation of national strategy for fusion centers such strategy would likely create coherence to what could be argued is currently somewhat ad hoc and informal approach to fusion centers some might argue that without such overarching national strategy fusion centers will only provide limited benefits to limited consumers arguments against this option might include disruption to ongoing activities or that such strategy while not formal already exists in the form of the collective activities of dhs the fbi global justice and the office of the director of national intelligences program manager for the ise furthermore to be successful in creating cohesive structure for forty fusion centers across the country national strategy may need to deal with several politically sensitive issues such as the need for joint ployment strategy for the federal agencies that detail personnel to state and regional fusion centers however if this issue and other sensitive topics are not comprehensively addressed and resolved fusion centers may have limited national impact the strategys potential for success is likely to hinge on the perception of input by all levels of government and sectors and the means used to implement the goals and objectives outlined in the strategy

respondent fusion center leaders had many high priority items concerning their interaction with the federal government the question of sustainment funding was foremost in their minds should federal funding to fusion efforts be continued to what end and how conditional does congress want federal aid to fusion centers to be the current regime of hsgp funding includes some limited conditions for funding fusion centers however the fusion center guidelines remain entirely voluntary even for recipients of federal hsgp funds as result for example the federal government has formal and systematic means of auditing whether each center is appropriately protecting civil liberties or using federally funded intelligence analysts in manner that is consistent with national goals and objectives for fusion centers should they be explicitly defined as outlined above should congress determine it wishes to take action on this option range of possible legislative tools are available as discussed below g344g138g495g561g21g157g138g157g158g156g561g19g158g152g561 the most obvious option is to continue the current manner of fundingthat is using the hsgp grants as the federal mechanism to make funding available for states and localities for potential allocation to state and regional fusion centers this process is reliant on state grant applications and the flow of federal funds to stateregional fusion centers is largely determined by the subfederal designees that make homeland security grant allocation decisions within each state andor

range of homeland security initiatives for funding while certain elements of hsgp funding are geared toward supporting fusion center development there is targeted funding stream directly allocated to fusion centers themselves if the approach to funding fusion centers remains the status quo then secretary chertoffs statement that dhs has not signed on to fund fusion centers in perpetuity will remain true without dedicated funding stream andor another largescale terrorist attack within the united states it is unclear whether fusion centers will continue to receive federal funding as well as sub federal resources to continue their current functions as outlined in this report pros and cons arguments in favor of maintaining the status quo include those who suggest such an option would result in natural progression of the current funding model it would allow for certain amount of continuity in funding streams and methods of allocating funds such an option would likely result in minimal hsgp program disruption arguments against this option might include that the status quo would continue to leave the fundamental sustainability questionone that is foremost in the collective

grant program could be slightly altered to address some of the oft cited hurdles that state and local officials believe impede the flow of federal grant funds to fusion center projects two such alterations to be considered include increasing the duration of grant cycles in order to allow for enhanced continuity and human resource planning particularly for contractsupported intelligence analysts building some level of autonomy into the hsgp 8020 localitiesstate split of hsgp funding to allow state political leadership some autonomy to reallocate portion of overall hsgp funds to single designated statewide fusion center such flexibility could be conditioned on formal hsgp audits to ensure accountability and that funds reallocated within state hsgp awards are consistent with the states fusion center mission and federal fusion center guidelines these audits would include input from fusion center leaders state administrative agents and the states homeland security advisor more significant adjustment to the existing hsgp that could potentially alleviate some of the difficulty associated with facilitating the flow of federal homeland security funds to fusion centers is the creation of narrowly targeted fusion center grant category similar to the port security grant program psgp and the other four subcategories included under the infrastructure protection program ipp

increasing leverage to condition the funding on number of factors not the least of which may be compliance with fusion center guidelines or other more specific fusion center performance metrics pros and cons arguments against this option might include the position that such program might set precedent for other more narrowly tailored homeland security oriented programs to advocate for similar approach it could also be argued that such program might undermine the current federal approach to fund the functions which underlie homeland securitysuch as information sharing and analysis alternatively it could also be argued that there are several existing programs that are narrowly tailored to ensure that risks and capabilities determined by the federal government to be nationally critical are already funded in this manner such as the buffer zone protection program bzpp and other infrastructure protection program ipp grants if the federal government determined that state and regional fusion centers provide critical homeland security function both protecting critical national infrastructure and transportation security might it not be prudent to have fusion center grant

establishing national network of fusion centers serves longterm national homeland security interests it may be reasonable to design system which provides resources to state and local fusion centers commensurate with the national benefit derived this presupposes the development of 1 cogent set of concrete national interests served by fusion centers 2 set of metrics that can quantitatively capture how well fusion centers are meeting these interests and goals 3 standards for minimum levels of capability and fusion center maturityand 4 thresholds linking levels of maturity to levels of federal funding these standards and metrics could be developed as part of cooperative endeavor between federal state and local representatives possibly under the global program as with other options above the extent to which congress could condition such an approach is an open question pros and cons one of the primary arguments that could be made against this option is that it is too complex and as result would be difficult to implement and may encourage states to game the system so as to remain immature enough to retain federal funding alternatively arguments in favor could be that congress is responding to fusion center requests for longterm and explicit federal approach to sustainable funding while the states may not like the performance metrics developed andor the thresholds for funding phaseouts these metrics and standards would at least create an environment of certainty in which states could better plan and target state and local funding streams to meet their ongoing funding needs that the federal government has clearly informed them it will not meet if this option is pursued metrics development and center evaluation would likely be most effective if designed and undertaken with fusion centers and slt agency sponsors to ensure they are not resisted or rejected

alternatively congress alone or with input from dhs the fbi and the odnis pm ise could determine that there are certain fusion center functions that provide direct value and benefits to the federal

sustainable manner if such decision were made pilot program might be established and implemented at certain fusion centers over specified time period to ascertain empirical federal benefits derived from direct support of such functions pros and cons arguments against this option might include that such an approach goes beyond what some in the federal government have stated the government will support and could increase federal outlays beyond levels currently being supported and might create sense of entitlement among fusion centers arguments in favor of this option are that such an approach would provide fusion centers with sense of certainty about federal funding if for example fusion centers knew congress would support fund ing for intelligence analysts they would longer need to budget for such personnel it could also be argued that such an approach would be relatively simpleafter period in which seed funding is provided and centers reach maturity as judged by the federal government centers would get some level of sustainment funding for relatively specific function or set of functions subject to pilot programs assessment of output that benefits national interests some lessons could be learned from the federal governments other grant program experiences including the community oriented policing program model 170 it could be argued that federal support and cultivation of the relevant skills and capabilities within fusion centers that provide direct benefit to the federal government may result in state and regional fusion centers acting as force multiplier for federal efforts g17g153g157g146g152g151g561g345g497g561g22g155g138g146g151g146g151g144g561 given that effective informationintelligence fusion and proactive approaches to allhazard prevention and preparedness depends on common understanding of intelligence and information and the potential uses thereof an argument can be made for enhanced and uniform fusion center training research indicates that the diversity of types of professionals serving in fusion centers can lead to differing perspectives or possibly competing visions for the fusion center retired military intelligence officers may approach intellig ence differently from for example state first responder personnel while neither approach may be best and the center might benefit from diversity of opinions common understanding of and lexicon for intelligence and its benefits and limits amongst all level of fusion center personnel can go long way toward ensuring cohesiveness clarity of vision and productivity of fusion center in addition to intelligence training some homeland security observers note that fusion centers may benefit from additional and standardized civil liberties training most fusion centers surveyed claim to have institutionwide civil liberty training and awareness activities that ensure all employees are aware of how personal and corporate information can be collected received stored and combined with traditional intellig ence community information toward producing risk assessment for given issue of concern howe ver this training is often agencyspecific and there may be differences between state activities and federal expectations as such the federal government may wish to require part of all funding allocated toward state fusion center be used for nationally consistent civil liberties training with special attention to concerns surrounding the use of private sector data another option would make such training 170 analogies to other federal programs do however have limitations as any pilot program would have to assess the potentially unique national interests served by fusion centers for example while hiring local police to prevent crime may serve the national interest does the prevention of terrorist attacks another crime serve the national interest more or less than general violent crime prevention at the state and local levels

state local and tribal slt and federal to develop common lexicon and definitions for intelligence information situationa l awareness and other key concep ts to ensure all entities at all levels of government that are engaged in homeland security are working from the same play book these basic definitions and standards may be applicable whether the informationintelligence is national securityrelated or criminal in nature the pm ise which is currently working to reconcile different sensitive but unclassified security designations and handling instructions might be natural coordinator for such an effort the creation of enhanced and standardized national fusion center training could help promote this common dictionary of intelligence pros and cons arguments in favor of this option might include that the lack of clarity between pure intelligence and criminal intelligence role leads to overaggressive or underaggressive intelligence postures in fusion centers in shor t clarity would lead to greatly enhanced information sharing arguments against this op tion could include fundamental disagreement with the belief that there is difference between pure intelligence and criminal intelligence both seek to prevent manmade threats including crime and terrorism therefore additional training is neededfusion centers understand the legal regimes under which they operate another argument against creating these standards and common definitions is that it is likely to be difficult undertaking given the sheer number of agencies involved and remnants of ownership culture that still persist within the federal intelligence community

potential for privacy and civil liberties violations to substantially undermine the public support for fusion centers enhanced and periodic refresher training in civil liberties may be valuable tool for fusion center personnel while all respondent fusion centers were cognizant of the need to protect civil liberties and provided initial training on privacy and civil liberties protection in general this was one time static training enhanced training might include instate or national instances in which violations of privacy andor civil liberties occurred and possible lessons learned from those instances moreover annual refresher training that emphasizes how first amendment protected activities differ from speech which incites violence or sedition may be useful in addition the adoption of national standards andor guidelines in this area would support this effort there have been some efforts in this area pmise issued privacy guidelines for the information sharing environment in december 2006 which are available to the public and could be utilized by fusion centers 171 it could be argued however that these guidelines arent 171 pmise guidelines to ensure that the information privacy

centers in their current form as they are too vague only focused on federal agencies and entirely voluntary pros and cons arguments against this option may be resourcebasedthat is training resources

training on 28 cfr part 23 the federal regulation governing multijurisdictional intelligence systems many law enforcement agencies involved in fusion centers often because the latter were an outgrowth of the former reported that they had received some training from doj andor other contractors on the regulation when they first began operating an intelligence management system in many cases that training took place many years ago and the agencies in question have had little to follow up training many didnt know who at doj to contact in the event that the fusion center had 28 cfr part 23related question or what office fielded additional training requests almost all fusion centers interviewed for this report facilitated 28 cfr part 23 training for their staff either through the center directly or via the state police or bureau of investigation as this is taking place at the state and local level it is unclear if there is consistent application of 28 cfr currently fusion centers are in the difficult position of being urged to be proactive to help prevent future attacks while simultaneously being warned about being too aggressive additional and periodic training to fusion centers might be considered even if their parent state policebureau of investigation agency and other law enforcement participants have already received such training at some point in their development consideration may also be given to providing legal resources for fusion centers that want an external legal opinion on their collection storage and dissemination activities pros and cons some might argue that the advantage to this type of additional and periodic training is that it might help eliminate questionable intelligence practices clarify legitimate activity and ensure the protection of civil liberties the availability of additional legal resources to fusion centers and slt law enforcement agencies may result in better and consistent legal advice and assist

days and many fusion center respondents desire longerterm and sustainable assistance the type characteristic of traditional mentoring programs while some fusion centers have created informal mentoring

surmounting what may be common obstacles to fusion center development pros and cons arguments against this option may be that it is essentially superfluous as informal mentor relationships are already being established by the proactive outreach of fusion center leaders either informally within their region or at fusion center conferences moreover fusion center conferences and the dhs lesson learned website172 provide an opportunity for centers to conduct liaison and share best practices formally and informally arguments in favor of this option include the position that such program would constitute relatively minor addition to the technical assistance program in terms of resources the program could facilitate the pairing up fusion centers they believe could learn from one another

some homeland security observers view the relationship between state fusion centers and the private sector as one of both unlimited potential and great concern currently most fusion centers describe an interest in expanding their relationship with the private sector in their jurisdiction but consistently most fusion centers were admittedly behind in developing those relationships information sharing with the private sector was often ad hoc and inconsistent furthermore it is important to note that fusion centers did not appear to be systematically importing and incorporating private sector data into their info rmationintelligence fusion efforts although some expressed an interest in better utilizing private sector data in some form it is important however to identify the opportunity to introduce new types of data including those from private sector sources into the intelligence fusion process to allow for comprehensive risk assessment to given geographic environment or infrastructure facility it may be that the data pointing to pending attack cannot be understood in context unless all knowable information is available for assessing on the other hand absent strenuous civil liberty protections and safeguards the possibility for misuse of personal or corporate data looms over many fusion center activities the state may undertake in partnership with or support of private sector organizations furthermore it could be argued that massive private data collection and analysis efforts are wasteful and better use of resources would be to follow known criminal leads rather than sifting through an enormous amount of data looking for possible signs of terrorism pros and cons arguments in favor of increasing interaction between fusion centers and the private sector focus mostly on increasing the availability of possible terrorismrelated information should the federal government and private sector routinely share information some believe this will lead to better understanding of the threat environment which in turn may deter or defeat future terrorists attacks others argue that the sharing of significant amounts of private sector data with the nations fusion centers will do little to increase security as crucial pieces of terrorismrelated information will not be discernible due to being included in databases containing large quantities of irrelevant information these homeland security observers suggest that the possibility of civil liberty abuses of private sector data residing in states fusion center 172 for more information on the lessons

outreach strategy that included website brochures and billboards andor 1800 tip line that encouraged the public to call into the center directly more often fusion centers had minimal level of interaction with the public by design 173 and due largely to resource constraints while not violating the precept that one size does not fit all fusion centers it could be argued that if resources allow centers should be encouraged to have public message and image consistent with their public mission public support and understanding of what these centers can and cannot do may be essential to their long term viability moreover the law enforcement elements of fusion centers are responsible for knowing their communities and being able to spot an omalies public outreach can facilitate calls into fusion center tip lines when they witness behavior that just does not seem right pros and cons arguments against this option are likely to be largely resourcebased centers with fewer personnel do not have the necessary staff to operate these programs for example phone bank necessary for tip line if the federal government is considering requiring such outreach as condition of accepting funds it may need to provide additional funds andor reprogramming of existing funds arguments in favo r of this option include fundamental belief that these centers serve public mission and should be not

argue that clearing slt personnel which remains an obstacle to effective information sharing option 6e without providing them traini ng on how to handle classified intelligence and how to use it without disclosing sensitive information to their staffs may be unfair and illadvised congress may wish to consider funding additiona l intelligence training for the slt personnel assigned to fusion centers it may also be possible for the federal agency detailees at fusion centers to assist with this process congress may wish to consider urging dhs the fbi and other agencies with detailees at fusion centers to train their staff to assist fusion center leadership with using classified intelligence and tasking personnel based on threat information without divulging classified information pros and cons arguments in favor of such training program include that it may help facilitate necessary information sharing while ensuring classified information remains secure however federal agencies may reject the idea of having field personnel assisting in such an effort and may wish to retain such authority at headquarters 173 this was sometimes due to general law enforcement appro ach when dealing with sensitiv issues in few cases it was due to some of the resources or partners with which the center was collocated eg an fbi field office

of the interagency threat assessment coordination group itacg was first raised in november 2006 in the pmise implementation plan and then subsequently in january 2007 in s 4 the improving americas security by implementing unfinished recommendations of the 911commission act of 2007 under the terms of the act the itacg which has been alternatively called the federal coordination group is intended to facilitate the production of federally coordinated products derived from the information within the scope of the ise175 since the establishment of the intelligence community there has been little reason or mandate for federal intelligence community agencies to have direct or sustained interaction with state and local law enforcement and public safety personnel 176 what little interaction there was generally took place between the fbi statutory member of the intelligence community and state and local law enforcement entities it could be argued that the nature of the threat today requires broader range of interaction in 2007 the executive branch established the itacg and the organization was placed the national counter terrorism center nctc to date few state employees are assigned to the center and most fusion center leaders were unaware of the organization or its mission to provide timely and relevant information to state and local homeland security entities pros and cons the arguments against the itacg as currently envisioned in s 4 might include 1 the name itself is misleading as the group will be unlikely to engage in formal threat assessment analysis while at the nctc 2 security concernsback channel and unauthorized communications between state and local representatives to the itacg could undermine existing intelligence dissemination channels and further complicate the cohesiveness of federal threat assessments to state and local consumers and 3 the detailing of handful of state and local personnel to the burgeoning nctc while useful may not be enough personnel to have substantial impact 174 see office of the director of national intelligence 100 day plan for integration and collaboration p 9 175 see s 4rs section 131 b 176 pursuant to eo 12333 united states

center include recognition of the importance of crosstraining and mutual learning it is sometimes the case that federal intelligence officials and state intelligence officials speak past one another because they each have limited understanding of respective consumer demands use different terms and standards and the dont always recognize the inherent limitations of intelligence by participating in the production of federally coordinated products at the national level it could be argued state and local fusion center personnel will learn about the volumes specificity and inherent limitations of the numerous ints 177 collected by the intelligence community moreover through interaction with state and local fusion center personnel federal intelligence community officials will learn what is most valuable to state and local personnel and as such will be better prepared to create products tailored to their needs

g11g151g157g142g149g149g146g144g142g151g140g142g561 while the proposed itacg would work on developing federally coordinated intelligence products for dissemination to state and local fusion centers for further dissemination itacg members are unlikely to be engaged in formal analytical threat assessments it could be argued that further analytical crosstraining could be achieved through significantly increasing state fusion center intelligence analysts who are not federal employees to the nctcs itacg or directorate of intelligence and offering nctc analysts an opportunity to work at fusion center congress may wish to consider enhancing support for the itacgs efforts to enhance information exchange with state and regional fusion centers and facilitate analytical crosstraining with state and local representatives detailed to the organization pros and cons one central argument against such an exchange is that there may be limited utility if analysis is discipline that has at it s core fundamental set of skills including but limited to critical thinking hypothesis generation and testing written and oral communication skills and an ability to ascertain salient trends from voluminous data sets why does it matter if these skills are exercised at the state or federal level furthermore there are very few fusion centers andor public safety agencies at the state and local level with the resources and existing capacity for this type of strategic analytical assessment another argument against such an option is that fusion center analysts and nctc terrorism threat analysts arguably serve different consumers and as result do not necessarily need to understand one anothers positions arguments in favor of such an option might incl ude that the nctc is client of the fusion centers and the fusion centers are client for the nctcs directorate of intelligence as result walking mile in your clients shoes can help you understand what is valuable to them another argument in favor of such integration could be that threat analysis at the federal level may be more welldeveloped than at some fusion centers and crosstraining may be very instructive for fusion center intelligence analysts who could also take advantage of other federal intelligence community analytical training session while detailed to washington dc 177 ints refers to intelligence

assumption supported by some terrorist cases within the united states that some terrorists have engaged in criminal activity or terrorism precursor crimes to support their activities178 one way to prevent terrorism is therefore to use all existing law enforcement tools aggressively fusion centers can assist law enforcement agencies in directing their resources to areas of greatest threat however as mentioned above one can reasonably question if sophisticated terrorists those who have received formal terrorism training from established international groups and may be planning catastrophic attacks engage in criminal activity prior to and in support of terrorist attack will foll owing all criminal leads nd terrorism tips lead to the disruption of sophisticated terrorist plots should such an nie not exist it may be useful to draft one focused on the nexus between terrorism and crime the dnis national intelligence council could draft it and potential clients might include the homeland security advisory council national security council all members of the intelligence community and state and regional fusion center leaders importantly research and analysis for the report might incorporate input from the fusion centers to determine the extent to which criminal cases in the united states demonstrate meaningful linkage between precursor criminal activity and terrorist activity such data sets could be compared and contrasted to the activities of terrorist groups overseas to determine any commonalities any such findings or trends overseas could be applied to the domestic arena through fusion centers to align protective resources accordingly pros and cons arguments against such an option might include the hypothesis that existing cases in the united states have already demonstrated link between terrorism at least with respect to aspirational terrorist groups and crime therefore there is need for specific nie on the subject as it would require extensive resources needed elsewhere arguments in favor of such an option might include the reasoning that if such study has not been done it represents an example of how international trends may inform our national counterterrorism efforts which include in part the contributions of national network of fusion centers furthermore such an nie would provide fusion centers with specific trends and potential threats that they could be used to create their own collection requirements as well as enhance their strategic understanding of potential terrorism precursor crimes

to acquire information tailored to their needs from the federal intelligence community if there is movement as dni mcconnell stated to formalize information sharing with fusion centers which implies bidirectional flow of information there will be need to develop robust feedback loop where information shared is assessed and requests for information are handled expeditiously while not all respondent fusion centers had developed intelligence collection requirements some not only developed requirements but had collection plans designed to fill those requirements for example some fusion centers might ask how might simultaneous 178 see crs report rl34014 terrorist precursor crimes issues and options for congress by siobhan oneil

responsibility or why might fusion centers be more concerned with thefts of chlorine gas than diesel fuel some of this general information reaches fusion centers now although many argue that federal agencies are still not as proactive and sufficiently wide in scope in what they choose to share with slt agencies but it is the followup requests that are not met in timely fashion respondent fusion centers often indicated that information they provided to the federal intelligence community largely through the fbi or dhs went into black box with little feedback as to the value of the information or how it may have been used frequently fusion centers are told that they cant receive follow up information because it is part of an open investigation fusion centers are often in position of not knowing if the information they passed was noteworthy or worthless they dont know if they should be actively looking for similar information to pass onto the federal community moreover the lack of feedback creates resentment towards federal agencies state and regional officials reported being further disheartened to learn that locally gathered info rmation they provided to dhs for risk assessment and subsequent grant allocations was not used in any systematic and meaningful manner 179 it is important to note that the lack of feedback and forthcoming information from the federal government is frequently cited as one of the predominate reasons many fusion centers were established initially critics might ask if fusion centers do not have access to feedback can they ever expect to fully participate in the intelligence cycle and achieve true fusion two bills pending before congress s 4 and hr 1 include language under the subtitle homeland security information sharingestablishment of business practices that would require the secretary of dhs to develop mechanisms to provide analytical and operational feedback regarding the analysis and utility of information provided by any entity of state local or tribal governments or the private sector that gathers such information and provides such information to the department pros and cons an argument against enhancing the feedback loop would include what some might view as reasonable amount of time for the federal government to respond to fusion center requests some fusion centers as result of coll ocation with the fbi or having federal detailess integrated into their centers might get fairly rapid responses to certain requests for information however even some fusion centers with established relationships with fbi jttfs and figs found the fbi still held tightly to certain sets of ongoing case data an argument in support of such an option would be if the nation is truly going to use fusion centers as national network to prevent and respond to manmade and natural disasters without timely and effective information sharing and feedback mechanism practic ed daily in times of crisis the network may prove ineffective

the national intelligence priorities framework nipf outlines the process and results for determining where intelligence assets are directed against prioritized threats as one would expect intelligence priorities are linked to assessments of threats to national and homeland security yet today there are few direct mechanisms which allow fusion centers individually or collectively to provide their

perspective that unless it is national trend which presupposes collective sense of existing fusion centers threat does not belong in the national emphasis added intelligence priorities framework one argument in favor of such input could be that the trends being seen at the state and local fusion center level may represent national trends andor may include trends not yet identified by federal agencies even if there is national fusion center currently in existence that integrates all the trends being seen by individuals centers

created by state and local governments with participation and s upport from federal entities at what point if at all does the federal government become responsible for privacy and civil liberties issues associated with fusion center activities within the states where does the federal responsibility to protect civil liberties and privacy stop and where does state responsibility to protect these social goods begin it could be argued the more federal financial and human resources provided to the centers the more the centers are perceived as hybrid federalstate entities therefore the federal government could be perceived as being partly responsible for any potential violations of privacy or civil liberties when congress passed the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 it established the privacy and civi l liberties oversight board to among other functions review the implementation of laws regulations and executive branch policies related to efforts to protect the nation from terrorism including the implementation of information sharing guidelines 180 if fusion centers are to become true partnerships it could be argued that there is shared responsibility to protect civil liberties in terms of the modalities of the oversight boards role it might work with state agency general counsels to ensure that the fusion centers have requisite policies and practices in place consistent with the fusion center guidelines moreover the oversight board might assist in designing an oversight or inspection regime for privacy and civil liberties protection at fusion centers pros and cons arguments against this option might include belief that as fusion centers are creations of state and regional communities the federal government has minimal responsibility to exercise oversight with respect to them some might argue that legally the federal government has right to direct fusion centers on protection of privacy and civil liberties with respect to privacy rights it might also be argued that the differing standards for privacy across states would complicate any effort to implement consistent approach in this area arguments in favor of this option might include the claim that even if the federal role in exercising oversight of fusion centers is limited federal financial and human resources support as well as support for formalization of the fusion center requires some level of civil liberties oversight some might argue the current voluntary implementation of civil liberties and privacy protection may be insufficient has the federal government conducted audits of fusion centers to determine if they are in compliance with even the voluntary standards as set out in the fusion center guidelines moreover it might be argued that without federal oversight litigation is likely to serve as the only significant oversight mechanism litigation however may not necessarily be the most effective oversight tool due to the

information reportedly provided to state and local fusion centers andor statelocal officials manifested competing assessments of source reliability and validity and by extension the nature of the threat in the two incidents which took place in boston in january 2005 and in new york city in october 2005 the fbi and dhs provided local officials with competing assessments of source reliability andor the urgency of the threat 181 federal officials have since testified that coordination mechanisms have been put in place to prevent such future occurrences182 however in order to assist state and local fusion centers to determine how imminent andor valid potential threat may be congress may wish to consider the creation of universal confidence ranking for federally produced intelligence products that would rank an agencys confidence in the reliability of the sourcesreflecting the sources reporting history and corroboration with other intelligence sources etc to some extent the failures associated with certain elements of prewar intelligence on iraq have served as catalyst for an intelligence confidence and transparency initiative underway at the national level and with respect to national intelligence estimates thomas fingar deputy dni for analysis stated recognition of the need to showing our homeworkgreater transparency about sources which allow analysts to better assess the quality of intelligence reporting 183 former deputy director of the cias directorate of intelligence stated in speech to all cia analysts that when you are calling it as you see it you must give the policymaker full transparency into your confidence in the judgments you are making184 an important question concerning these recognitions however is the extent to which this confidence system is formal and is being extended into products and judgements regularly provided to fusion centers congress may wish to consider oversight hearings to determine the progress of this initiative as it pertains to fusion centers pros and cons credibility ranking system might reduce the need to include sources and methods information in intelligence products thus making the creation of declassified and less classified versions of intelligence products easier such ranking would provide state and regional fusion centers better information to use in making informed decisions about the threat to their communities and related responses an argument against this option suggests it may be difficult to get multiple federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies to agree on common credibility criteria getting consensus on assigning particular ranking to intelligence product could potentially be lengthy process that could potentially delay intelligence dissemination on the occasion that one or more agencies disagree with the majority consensus system for line item analytic comments may be necessary as is currently utilized for national intelligence 181 lara jakes jordan bogus boston

mentioned throughout this report there is cookie cutter approach to fusion centers although the centers may all have some core functions the financial and personnel resources they have to dedicate to those functions differ widely structurally the continued development of the fusion center concept could progress along any of the following albeit nonexhaustive paths should congress determine it wishes to take action on this option range of possible legislative tools are available that might influence that path of development as discussed below

development states an d localities continue to make decisions about the number of fusion centers there is little to federal input into these independent decisions as the centers are created and largely funded by the states and localities this has reportedly resulted in several seemingly unusual homeland security purchases and funding decisions according to fusion center officials who noted the creation of competing fusion centers in some states pros and cons an argument in favor of this option is the position that it would respect states rights and the ability of states and localities to make independent determinations about the structure of fusion centers that best fits their n eeds an argument against this option suggests the increasingly complexity from federal perspective of funding numerous fusion centers within one state proliferating amount of fusion centers in single state can lead to competition for resources that may lead to an allocation of existing funds that does not necessarily best advance the fusion function

under this option the states homeland security advisor acting on behalf of the governor might dedicate one fusion center as being the lead center for the state 185 federal financial resources could be provided to that center which would have the ability acting through the state administrative agency to reallocate portion of those funds to satellite fusion centers across the state as mentioned earlier in the report dhs and doj have requested that each state governor designate one state fusion center as the main interface for exchanging terrorism and homeland security information pros and cons arguments in favor of this option might include the belief held by some fusion center respondents that the competition for limited federal resources does not serve fusion centers well that is particularly if there are relatively few highly qualified intelligence analysts having them at one central location where they have easiest access to the flow of information coming 185 the pmise implementation plan november 2006 p 119 included as part of its pm recommendations and summary of actions that doj and dhs will work with governors to designate single fusion center to serve as the statewide or regional hub to interface with the federal government

arguments against this option may include that fusion centers are essentially state and local entities and as such they should be designed in whatever configuration to include multiple centers if desired if that is determined to serve the state or localitys interests for example some large states have several large cities and having one central fusion center serve as the recipient of federal grants might undermine satellite fusion center operations

although provocative and radical fusion center critics might argue that fusion centers are superfluous insofar as the primary federal benefit they seek to provide is prevention of manmade terrorist attacks traditional federal agency ro andor destabilizing crime gangs narcotics etcboth federal and slt responsibility those who subscribe to this school might argue that state and regional fusion centers could be eliminated and federal agencies take over all the functions those centers once performed with intelligence and counterterrorismrelated work going to the fbi and the allhazards functions adopted by some fusion centers turned over to fema or the statelocal agencies that traditionally handle natural disasters the counter to this argument is that changed threat environment requires nontraditional thinkingdesigned to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks and respond efficiently and effectively to substantial natural disasters nevertheless the argument that fusion centers may represent an organizational solution to functional information sharing and analysis problem can still be made less radical albeit still drastic version of th is option would suggest that the fbi take over all strategic analysis and assessment roles and that state and regional fusion centers focus solely on tactical analysis of criminal intelligence u nder this option the fbis field intelligence groups figs whose primary purpose is to manage the fb is intelligence process at each of the 56 fbi field offices would assume broader set of res ponsibilities one version of this option would have the figs conducting this analysis using fbi analysts to be shared with slt agencies another approach would have slt personnel previo usly assigned to fusion centers be redetailed to the figs to assist with the analytic process although that process would be run and directed by the fig either way the fbi might be able to conduct the types of analyses that could assist state and local law enforcement public safety and private sector potentially to direct their protective resources into the areas of greatest criminal and homeland security threats if the fbi had direct access to all the state and local criminal intelligence and information that fusion centers have established relationships with even rural law enforcement personnel private sector personnel and other related homeland security stakeholders information systems which could facilitate the sharing and analysis of unclassified and classified information across all homeland security stakeholders in the country in timely and effective manner this option does not presuppose that existing state and local fusion centers would be supplanted however federal financial resources could be redirected toward the establishment of statewide intelligence systems that are interoperable and to which the fbi figs would have direct access as an input into strategic analysis relieved of the strategic analysis burden fusion centers could focus on tactical analysis in support of constituent member or fusion center cases andor situational awareness

relative to fusion centers might find that it represents thought process that is part of the problemthat is that homeland security is essentially federal function with minimalist role for state and local law enforcement and public safety personnel such an approach might marginalize the important role that state and local homeland security stakeholders can play it may also result in the failure to fully utilize the resources and institutional knowledge of slt agencies the stakeholders who know their own communities more intimately than any federal agency moreover it could also be argued that the fbi is being asked to do so much in the post911 worldto be the foremost counterterrorism and countercriminal organization in the united statesthat this somewhat expanded role may be asking too much lastly from an analytic perspective tactical and strategic analysis are mutually supportive and it may not be prudent to separate the two arguments in favor of this option might find that such role for the fbi does not involve supplanting existing fusion centers it would merely federalize the strategic analytic function one that many fusion centers have difficulty dedicating personnel to because their clients do not necessarily demand these types of products lastly it is not great expansion of fbi responsibilities it only involves analysis of an enhanced set of raw data that is relatively under developed due to the nascency of statewide criminal intelligence systems staterun emergency management agencies or the fusion centers in coop eration with these agencies would continue to respond to natural disasters as the fbi fulfills its traditional investigative mission

today there are more than 40 plus fusion centers operating largely independently around the country it can be argued that the next fusionrelated development should be 2 nd generation fusion or fusion of the fusion centers informally this has started to happen to some degree post911 demands for increased domestic security served as catalyst for some state fusion centers to collaborate with each other to facilita the flow of information and intelligence the means and the ends of that collaboration are importa nt first the means at times these informal centertocenter or more formalized regional group relationships have been used to share threat information specific to investigating past or ongoing incident of concern186 to achieve the next step in fusion center collaboration from ad hoc relationships to more formalized structured relationship between fusion centers that would create representative voice to address mission and resource related issues with the federal government there are several organizational network models that could emerge as well as hybrid of several models 186 interview with fusion center leader may 22 2007

grap hic it is important to note that the depictions in figure 1 represent pure theoretical models187 elements of these aggregate models exist today although the models could be formally adopted in an effort to bring more structure to the existing fusion center network structure for example all the fusion centers interviewed for this report have some direct linkages with other fusion centers although an individual center may not have established links with every other center in the country nor are those links of the same strength it is also common for fusion centers to have stronger links and more constant contact with nearby fusion centers or those centers at similar levels of maturation to the former point there are examples where fusion centers in particular area have set up regional fusion center coalitions like southern shield in the southeast 188 to facilitate information sharing each option has its own advantages and disadvantages moreover like fusion centers themselves it is not clear that one model would work for all stakeholders involved in the network in reality any fusion ce nter configuration is likely to be hybrid of some or all of the models represented above however some homeland security observers argue that significant success in maturing national fusion center constellation may be assisted by the creation of nation fusion center representative entity that provides the federal government prioritized mission and resource issues of interest second the endsan often stated concern by state homeland security leaders is lack of understanding how the federal government priori tizes funding personnel and technical support provided to the nations fusion centers conversely many homeland security observers note that federal government leadership has difficulty in responding to the needs of the fifty state fusion centers in prioritized and logical manner to facilitate more comprehensive approach to putting forth the needs of state fusion centers in given region some state leaders have established regional fusion center representative organizations 187 hub and spoke model consists of multiple nodes fusion centers that are all connected to same central node national fusion center or other coordination group regional network includes regional groupings of nodes fusion centers withor without central node national fusion center etc connected with each grouping an all channel network has each individual node fusion center directly linked to every other individual node fusion center withor without central node

support from dhs that are relevant only to the organizations operations it is the perception of fusion center leaders that dhs responds to the needs of single center without the consideration of the priority of the request with respect to the needs of others centers that ma be in locations deemed higher at risk or the needs of all of the nations fusion centers coordinated national or regional representative fusion center organization that can propose to the federal government prioritized common issues of concern may assist dhs and fbi submit manage and allocate fusion centers budgets based on strategy rather than the perceived need by single center pros and cons an argument in favor of the establishment of national fusion center representative organization entails increasing the nations contextual understanding of threats and vulnerabilities through increased collaboration by state fusion centers such an organization may assist the federal government in ascertaining the risks to the nation and understanding the resources needed to support the federalstate information sharing environment an argument against such structure is the possibility of the inadvertent creation of groupthink environment whereby centers in an effort to support unity of effort and collaboration may compromise their independent analysis of risks to the region in favor of supporting the representative organization g347g142g495g561g15g152g159g142g561g22g152g160g138g155g141g561g20g142g144g146g152g151g138g149g561g8g158g156g146g152g151g561g5g142g151g157g142g155g156g561 second option for addressing the need for 2nd generation fusion is the creation of regional fusion centers to coordinate disparate fusion efforts at the state and regional level this option is likely to be supported by those homeland security observers who question the viability of each state having its own homeland security fusion center or several in some cases there are some indications that federal intelligence community agencies are already considering developing regional architecture to promote information sharing 189 under this option fusion centers could move to regional model based on any number of federal regional designations hidta fbi fig fema drug enforcement agency organize d crime drug enforcement task forces etc190 increasing centertocenter and regional collaboration on issues of common concern may help garner support for such proposal regional approachin the several forms it could takemay help facilitate information sharing effective resource dispersal and help transform the current localized reactive and tactical approaches to threat analysis to more proactive and strategic posture one possible approach to regionalization could be the combining of numerous state fusion centers into regional homeland security center such strategy may become more popular if there are largescale terrorist attacks or disasters in the united states which result in less homeland securityrelated funding and lack of political support to sustain fusion efforts such an occurrence may be predicated by the following situations existing state fusion centers detailing personnel to bordering state organizations thus developing notional regional network within existing organizations 189 jason miller white house council puts cybersecurity in focus fcwcom july 2 2007 httpwwwfcwcom

throughout the nation hidtas fbi figs see option 5c above fema federal governmentled regional fusion center is established in partnership with state employees focused on strategic analysis andor response efforts in support of federal state and local missions pros and cons an argument against this option includes the reasoning that by adopting regional fusion centers the new fusion entities will longer provide as many benefits to local communities and as such they will have difficulty maintaining buyin and detailees from local agencies an argument for regionalization is the claim that by pooling resources expanding their scope and establishing regional spokespersons regionalization may assist with the resource dilemma and facilitate both more strategic approaches to analysis and

as highlighted above 28 cfr part 23 the federal regulation which governs state and local criminal intelligence systems was written in part as response to the domestic intelligence abuses of the late 1960s and early 1970s related to cointelpro while the concerns raised then about civil liberties violations remain demonstrably present today and must be vigilantly guarded against so too has the threat environm ent changed along with changes in the threat have come substantial technological changes including the ability to exploit voluminous amounts of commercially available data as result it could be argued that 28 cfr part 23 might be revised to include updated information retention time frames and mechanisms to include available technologies pros and cons arguments in favor of such revision include that reexamination of 28 cfr part 23 would potentially result in new balance being struck between protecting civil liberties and effective and proactive security efforts such revision might also contribute to the creation of national standards for information collection and exchange furthermore changes that address technological advances and the realities of the cu rrent threat environment may clarify the limits of how such technologies can be used by fusion centers an argument against such revision might include civil liberties advocates being critical of any alterations to 28 cfr part 23 that may be seen as loosening requirements andor expanding existing law enforcement powers any changes made without slt consultation andor that narrow sltlevel leverage are likely to be met with resistence from fusion centers and slt law enforcement

peertopeer communication has been priority for the administration and congress as demonstrated in the irtpa instructions to the ise congress may wish to consider further steps to enhance such communication between fusion centersdubbed by some in the fusion business to be 2nd generation fusion congress could consider several initiatives in this area to include requiring fusion centers and states that wish to use federal funds to purchase information management systems to ensure their systems are able to speak to other systems this would enhance the potential to make connections between disparate data points and reduce information silos at state andor regional levels this may limit the number of systems fusion centers can purchases in the short term but in the long term such move is likely to force the companies that sell these systems to work in xml or create the appropriate loaders to translate between xml and its proprietary language pros and cons there are several arguments for implementing this option including the need to ensure federal funds dont contribute to further siloization of information streams as well as the potential to encourage more effective information sharing and better data analysis arguments against this option may highlight concerns about the immediate limiting impact on systems choices and potential financial costs for state and regional fusion centers and related agencies g348g140g495g561g21g157g138g151g141g138g155g141g146g163g142g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g146g151g144g561g8g152g155g150g138g157g156g561 another option that may enhance peertopeer communication among fusion centers and between fusion centers and the federal community is standardized reporting formats currently while there are common topdown standardized federal reports including intelligence information reports iirs intelligence bulletins and intelligence assessments such standard set of products exists for bottomup reporting from fu sion centers to the federal community191 the creation of common lexicon and standards is likely to contribute to this end dhs has given its roughly 15 fusion center detailees reports officer training to facilitate this effort but it is clear it needs to be done on grander scale and in coordination with the fbi and other federal recipients if this is to be successful coordination with fusion center staff is likely to be essential to ensure that fusion centers are not overburdened with multiple reporting formats required to fill out duplicate copies and upload through various information systems option 6d thus thwarting effective information sharing standardized format will also reinforce efforts to instill the use of common lexicon and definitions nationally such formats should likely include input from state and local law enforcement and fusion centers to ensure consistency and buyin and find ways this requirement can fit within existing standard oper ating procedures rather than creating additional work 191 according to the ise guideline 2 fusion centers shou ld continue to maintain andor develop capability to support number of critical counterterrorism homeland security and homeland defenserelated activities including1 statewide regional sitespecific and topi cal risk assessments 2 alerts warnings notifications advisories and bulletins regarding time sensitive or strate gic threats 3 situational awareness reports and 4 analytical reports regarding incidents or specific threats see ise guideline 2 develop common framework for the sharing of information between and among xecutive departments and agencies and state local and tribal governments law enforcement agencies and the private sector pp 1920 as indicated throughout this report central element missing amongst most fusion centers is baseline threat assessment baseline assessments arguably should be relatively high priority for fusion centers standardized product sets of the type mentioned above may enhance information sharing across all levels of governments and with the private sector and could also contribute to the research and drafting of baseline assessments

is the likely difficulty of getting federal and slt agencies to agree on standardized report format furthermore it will likely be equally difficult to devise way to create common report form and process that does not create additional work for fusion centers it can be argued that to be effective and efficient such an option is inextricably tied to the consolidation of federally run information systems option 6d below and without serious effort to consolidate information flow between federal and fusion center entities standardized reporting format may still be unwieldy an argument for this option is the assertion that without standardized reporting the current range of standards and formats being used is likely to impede effective information sharing and analysis which has been deemed crucial for our nations homeland security efforts

congress might consider compelling federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies to consolidate existing federally owned and operated information sharing systems designating single system as the primary system through which all information from the federal government would be sent to state local and tribal agencies may also be an option to consider congress may wish to continue to exercise rigorous oversight of the progress the ise has made toward creating the necessary policies procedures and technologies linking the resources people systems databases and information of federal state local and tribal entities and the private sector to facilitate terrorism information sharing access and collaboration 192 pros and cons prioritization andor consolidation of federally run information systems would likely reduce the stress on fusion centers and enhance the flow of intelligence between slt and federal agencies however it could also be argued that such changes are likely to be opposed by the federal agencies whose respective systems are not promoted as the single information sharing architecture ownership of intelligence and information systems appears to remain an obstacle in sharing information with subfederal entities

to andor slated to work at state and regional fusion centers congress may also wish to examine the classified intelligence reciprocity issue which prevents holder of dhscleared fusion center for example from accessing dodorigin classified systems and intelligence while perennial issue within the federal community the continued lack of reciprocity creates needless bureaucratic and logistical hurdles that continue to thwart effective information sharing pros and cons an argument in favor of this option would be that it allows additional personnel at the centers to receive threat information and direct it to appropriate personnel for action this may reduce some of the obstacles that currently inhibit the flow of federal intelligence assessments that fusion center analysts can fuse with locally focused grassrootscollected information with better access to classified information fusion centers may increase their 192 program manager information sharing environment website

threat assessments generated by federal agencies with locally focused grassrootscollected information an argument against this option could include the contention that while seemingly positive it does nothing to address the overclassification of intelligence and in fact could further promulgate culture of classifi cation clearing fusion center personnel especially management and not the boots on the ground personnel puts the former in difficult position they are usually incapable of deploying resources or directing collection based on the classified intelligence they have received as such it may be more beneficial to enhance the declassification processand the capability to create sltrelevant intelligence products option 4a page 59at the federal level then overemphasizing the importance of clearing additional slt personnel furthermore an increased number of cleared personnel at the state and local level will not be beneficial to fusion centers unless it is accompanied by equipment to receive and store such information training on how to use intelligence and guidance on how to identify gaps or generate collection requirements from that intelligence

efforts to declassify existing products as well as produce less sensitive or tearline versions of classified intelligence reports this could be done by urging the compliance with the requirements and deadlines laid out in the irtpa pl 108458 many of which have not been met congress may also wish to consider this and other incentives for facilitating the creation of declassified or less classified versions of intelligence threat reports to ensure fusion centers can receive store and utilize threat reporting pros and cons federal governmentwide effort to declassify relevant intelligence products could potentially assist slt agencies and fusion centers to identify potential threats and trends within their respective jurisdictions alone some critics might argue declassified products based on federal intelligence will not meet the information needs of fusion centers and slt agencies rather intelligence products need to be created based on slt information requirements and operational considerations to ensure they are relevant to the recipients potential negative tradeoff of concerted effort to declassify intelligence for fusion centers and slt agencies might be an increase in the

said about the partnership between slt agencies state and regional fusion centers and federal agencies to tackle homeland security challenges while there are many agencies initiatives and individual leaders who are working to advance the level of cooperation between wide spectrum of public sector agencies at all levels of government there are indications that the partnership between them is not as strong and dynamic as it is frequently described it could be argued that the federal government will be hardpressed to view slt agencies and entities like fusion centers as true partners rather the federal government will likely approach the later as consumer of their work but not necessarily common and equal partner it is also important to recognize that this tension goes beyond the level of

traditional intelligence and law enforcement agencies see appendix and between first responders and law enforcement the relationship between slt and federal agencies can be tensionfilled they each operate from different historic roles and responsibilities resources and jurisdictions in some locations there appears to be some residual resentment of the fbi and some other federal agencies amongst slt entities after years of being treated as inferior and an information sourcenot necessarily as consumer on the federal side there is often distrust of slt entities concern about the erosion of federal jurisdiction and in some cases resistence to accepting an enhanced slt role in some homeland security areas although relationships vary across the country in some locations the two groups do not have the necessary understanding and familiarity with each other despite some continued contact ie state and local interaction with the fbi via jttfs several fusion center officials cited their perception about the failure of federal agencies to understand their needs in january 2007 washington dc police chief kathy lanier testified to the cultural differences and lack of understanding between slt and federal communities the department of homeland security is not law enforcement agency like the fbi is law enforcement agency so its very difficult for them to understand what my need to know is if they dont know what it is that i do if theyre not familiar with what i do on daily basis what resources i have and how i can reduce vulnerabilities through the daily activities of more than 4500 employees here in washington dc so lot of information doesnt get to because they dont believe i have need to know i think its just lack of understanding and this is not in all dhss fault local law enforcements just as much at fault the department of homeland security is not completely aware of what our operational capabilities are and how the information if passed on to us could be used to reduce the vulnerability so information that may be shared with us is not shared with us because they dont think its something that we can do anything with or that we can use to help reduce that vulnerability 193 as mentioned above this lack of understanding can lead to unrealistic expectations in talking with state and local officials who are relatively ne w to the intelligence discipline it is often apparent that they believe that the federal govern ment knows far more than it tells them and that the intelligence the feds have is usually clear and specific regarding the who what where and when of threat this is often not the case but it leads to latent distrust instead of open discussion as previously stated the two sides operate using different language and standards the lanes in the road are often unclear and in some cases there remains degree of competition between various agencies and levels of government in short while there is an enhanced level of trust between the federal and state and local communities according to some fusion center respondents they would not necessarily characterize the relationship as true partnership pros and cons arguments against this option are likely to focus on the difficulty of creating plan and implementing strategy for enhancing sltfederal partnership something that can be difficult to define and measure in tangible terms those who wish to maintain the status quo are unlikely to support such an option on the other hand supporters of this option may opine that regardless of logistical challenges the

g21g145g138g155g146g151g144g561 number of fusion centers had state laws which had the unintended effect of impeding information sharing in one instance state law made it class misdemeanor if any person knowingly released criminal intelligence informa tion as defined in statute to an agency or person other than criminal justice agency194 according to one fusion center leader195 one of the unintended consequences of this law was that any intelligence the fusion center received from the federal community could not be shared directly w ith any non criminal justice entity or person that may be target of the threat andor have resources essential to preventing or preparing for an event

research also indicated number of potentially problematic issues related to state fusion center personnel which again do not necessarily have any unique federal remedy these issues include

as the fusion centers continue to mature and the security role and functions of the organization attempt to align with the realities of the threat environment some homeland security observers hypothesize that state leadership may wish to reconsider the attributes required of fusion center leaders in response to the evolving homeland security environment some centers have started ensuring that the core leadership team of the organization have representative experience and knowledge of the four phases of homeland security preparation prevention response and recovery for example fusion centers that focus on allhazards may look for leadership that have both criminal and emergency responder experience some state homeland security observers are concerned that one implication of possible significant increase in federal funding to state fusion centers might entail the federal governments desire to be consulted regarding personnel selected by state leadership for positions that are responsible for managing state fusion center funds

one concern often voiced during the interviews with fusion center leadership was the ability to select and manage the personnel assigned to the center there is general concern about the quality of detailess given resource constraints within partner agencies fusion center leadership are concerned that those agencies may seek to detail personnel who fail to perform considering the immaturity of many of the nations fusion centers and their need for personnel centers often unknowingly accept individuals with skills that do not support the mission 194 interview with fusion center leader march

responsibilities despite memorandums of understanding mou signed by the fusion centers and the detailing organization there is often lack of definitive understanding of the roles and functions the detailee is to undertake in support of the fusion center with regard to federal agency detailees this lack of clarity could result in unmet expectations reduced federalstate coordination and agency representatives departing the center prior to the conclusion of the assignment unlike the lack of specifics of the functions to be performed and the role of the individual in the organization the mous often specify that salary training and annual performance reviews will continue to be provided by the parent organization it is often argued this programmatic arrangement is necessary to quickly detail individuals to the organization however such process does not appear conducive to the effective management of individuals detailed to the fusion center while it is true that fusion center leaders are on occasion asked about the performance of detailees many suspect the arrangement does not have lasting impact on detailee work productivity barring dismissal from the center the organizational relationship limits the leverage center leader may have in increasing the performance of detailees that may have suspect qualifications or lack of knowledge of the assigned mission such an organizational dynamic may negatively affect the centers mission effectiveness and compel center leadership to question the parent organizations commitment to the fusion center

fusion center officials mentioned concerns regarding the lack of tools to measure personnel performance during times of fiscal crisis which is especially acute in some states fusion center officials are being pressured to justify their existence in light of other cuts to law enforcement and public services without well established entitywide and personnel specific metrics fusion centers reported difficulty demonstrating their importance to those officials responsible to budgets and grant allocations to address this situation one fusion center was creating their own metrics to evaluate individual performance based largely on the military performance evaluation system 196

as previously mentioned many st ates and municipalities are currently in fiscal crisis there are numerous agencies and projects competing for limited state budget dollars as well as federal grant resources numerous fusion center officials cited the lack of strategic planning for resource distribution within their state in some states nonintelligence focused agencies and personnel are responsible for dividing federal grant funds among statelocal initiatives some fusion center leaders believe lack of understanding of the role of fusion centers has put the centers at disadvantage for receiving federal grants from the decision making bodies in at least one case fusion center was told by those making grant distribution decisions that fusion centers benefitted the federal government so the federal governme nt should fund them directlyan indication they did not think the homeland security grant funds should be used to fund that states fusion center 197 196 interview with regional

coordination in some states regional councils or municipalities themselves can determine what to spend federal homeland security grants on without proving that such expenditures fit within strategic statewide effort to reduce risk in one state regional councils that distribute funding choose to fund local fusion centers even though there was already one established for the state potentially creating duplication of effort wasting resources and stirring competition198 one example of poor planning included the authorization by one council for 500 megahertz radios while another council approved and funded ones that were 800 megahertz thereby perpetuating lack of interoperability199

potential hurdle to fusion center development is creating buyin at the substate level in many states there are indications that small poli ce departments and public sector agencies are not thoroughly convinced of their fusion centers worth and if and how the center will benefit them creating buyin is difficult process expanding from solely counterterrorism focus to an all crimes approach appears to have helped some fusion centers create buyin as previously mentioned providing investigative resources to small agencies that need them has assisted another in this regard however these services are not often fusionrelated and thus it begs the question how can fusion centers convince local law enforcement agencies that they should expend resources and time to working to enhance the fusion process moreover nonlaw enforcement agencies are often skeptical about fusion centers first all crimes and counterterrorismfocused centers have more difficult time than allhazards centers marketing themselves to public health environmental protection fire fighters etc these entities tend to have had far less intelligence experience and enjoy reduced level of comfort with the intelligence cycle than law enforcement in ddition to apprehension with the subject nonlaw enforcement public sector agencies are unclear about what role they should play and how to play it furthermore some nonlaw enforcement fusion center officials complained about what they perceive as conflicting messages from the federal government about the role of agencies like theirs in the fusion process 198 interview

effective integration of intelligence and information fusion centers with existing federal intelligence and terrorismcrime prevention efforts it is helpful to examine the different conceptions of intelligence within the federal intelligence community and the law enforcement community intelligence community and law enforcement community approaches to intelligence the absence of common lexicon between the federal intelligence community and law enforcement intelligence is one area in need of further explanation as it is manifested in approaches fusion centers take to their work the majority of fusion centers examined for this report deal with combination of intelligence information and situ ational awareness most centers that described themselves as having response role or support function for another responseoriented entity were more concerned with situational awareness however in few cases it was not clear if the fusion center leadership had thorough understanding of the differences between intelligence and information this is somewhat understandable people often use the term intelligence interchangeably with information but there is an important distinction intelligence community conception of intelligence mark lowenthal an expert on intelligence issues differentiates intelligence from information in the following way information is anything that can be known regardless of how it is discovered intelligence refers to information that meets the stated or understood needs of policy makers and has been collected processed and narrowed to meet those needs intelligence is subset of the broader category of information intelligence and the entire process by which it is identified obtained and analyzed respond to the needs of policy makers all intelligence is information not all information is intelligence 200 intelligence is the product of the intelligence cycle see figure a1 below process that begins with step 1 planning and direction which leads to step 2 the setting of collection requirements based on threats in the form of questions and identified gaps in existing knowledge and which is followed by step 3 the collection of intelligen ce based on known gaps step 4 includes synthesis and analysis of collected intelligence and results in the creation of an intelligence product which in step 5 is disseminated to policymakers and those responsible for taking action based on that analysis step 6 is the feedback loop from the customer to evaluate the utility of the product and facilitate another round of the cycle by assisting with step 1 planning and direction 200 mark m lowenthal intelligence from secrets to policy third edition washington dc cq press 2003 pp12 lowenthal draws on sherman kents the father of intelligence conception as intelligence as process product and organization intelligence as process is means by which certain types of information are required and requested collected analyzed and disseminated and as the way in which certain types of covert action are conceived and conducted intelligence as product is product of these pro cesses that is as the analyses and intelligence operations themselves finally intelligence as organization can be thought of as the units that carry out the various functions see loch k johnson and james j wirtz ed strategic intelligence windows into secret world an

tiple sources it is important to explain that there are different definitions of intelligence and those used by the fusion centers often differ from the more pure conception of intelligence outlined immediately above law enforcement conception of intelligence in law enforcement the term intelligence has been defined slightly differently than within the hall s of federal intelligence agencies engaged in all source strategic intelligence david carter criminal intelligence expert states in the purest sense intelligence is the product of an analytic process that evaluates information collected from diverse sources integrates the relevant information into cohesive package and produces conclusion or estimate about criminal phenomenon by using the scientific approach to problem solving ie analysis intelligence therefore is synergistic product intended to provide meaningful and trustworthy direction to law enforcement decision makers about complex criminality criminal enterprises criminal extremists and terrorists 201 law enforcement intelligence leint is thus the product of an analytic process that provides an integrated perspective to disparate information about crime crime trends crime and security 201 david l carter law enforcement intelligence guide for state local and tribal law enforcement agencies washington dc us department of justice office of

definition appears akin to what the intelligence community would consider finished intelligenceintelligence that has been synthesized and analyzed one might argue that criminal intelligence as conceptualized above is reactiveinformation becomes intelligence after it is analyzed as compared to more pure concepts of intelligence which are more proactive in that preidentified intelligence gaps based on policymaker needs are the starting point for intelligence collection this would be in line with traditional approaches it could be argued that the intelligence community tends to be proactive in dealing with national security matters while law enforcement in the united states has traditionally been reactive postevent and prosecution focused some might argue that the use of law enforcement tools such as the enterprise theory of investigation have indeed been proactive in the collection of intelligence although not necessarily through the formal implementation of the intelligence cycle carter believes intelligence can be used for both prevention and planningresource allocation within law enforcement the primary differences then between pure or traditional conceptions of intelligence and law enforcement intelligence lie in the following thre areas 1 the predicate for the intelligence activity itself 2 intelligence clients and consumers and 3 the legal regimes under which intelligence is collected whereas the pure intelligence community uses known intelligence gap as the starting point for collection it is less likely that law enforcement intelligence group will have developed set of intelligence collection requirements and as result criminal event or case is the starting point for intelligence collection with respect to consumers while the intelligence community serves actionoriented officials within the military and federal intelligence communities it largely serves the needs of national policymakers in the law enforcement community the consumers are largely law enforcement officers investigating crime or criminal groups prosecuting attorneys and law enforcement executives seeking to align protective resources from legal regime perspective national intelligence collection arguably operates under less restrictive legal regime than law enforcement intelligence an issues which is largely driven by the subjects of intelligence collectionus persons or nonus persons the conceptual differences between these two closely related communities and disciplines has implications for fusion centers under which model and legal regime are they operating as mentioned above how proactive can the centers be in intelligence collection without violating civil liberties lack of clarity on these issues can lead to fusion centers either taking too conservative or too aggressive approach either of which undermines their full productivity and serves as an overall risk to the fusion center concept 202 ibid 10 alternatively law enforcement information can be defined much more broadly for purposes of the ise law enforcement information means any information obtained by or of interest to law enforcement agency or official that is both related to terrorism or security of our homeland and b relevant to law enforcement mission including but not limited to information pertaining to an actual or potential criminal civil or administrative investigations or foreign intelligence counterintelligence or counterterrorism investigation assessment of or response to criminal threats and vulnerabilities the existence organization capabilities plans intentions
