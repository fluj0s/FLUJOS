administrative procedure act apa of 1946 5 usc 551 et seq generally requires federal agencies to publish their proposed rules also called regulations in the federal register to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on those proposed rules and to pub lish final rule at least 30 days before its effective date the apa does not however specify how agencies are to develop their proposed rules or who should participat in that process consequently agencies sometimes develop rules w ithout discussing relevant issues with all affected interests and there may be little or opportunity for an informal exchange of views among affected parties or between those parties nd the rulemaking agency either before or after the proposed rule is published negotiated rulemaking sometimes referred to as regulatory negotiation or reg neg is supplement to the traditional apa rulemaking process in which agency representatives and representatives of affect ed parties work together to develop what can ultimately become the text of proposed rule1 in this approach negotiators try to reach consensus by evaluating their prio rities and making tradeoffs with the end result being draft rule that is mutually acceptable negotiated rulemaking has been encouraged although not usually require d by both congressional and executive branch actions and has recei ved bipartisan support as way to involve affected parties in rulemaking before agencies have developed their proposals some questions have been raised however rega rding whether the approach actually speeds rulemaking or reduces litigation development of negotiated rulemaking the development of negotiated rulemaking is traceable to dissatisfaction with what some viewed as the formal complex and adversarial nature of traditional rulemaking procedures for example in 1982 administrative law expert philip j harter an early advocate of negotiated rulemaking said malaise had settled over the federal rulemaking process because of the defensive and armslength manner in which agencies and affected parties interacted2 he suggested different approach in which differences were acknowledg ed and resolved through facetoface negotiations and laid out ries of principles that c ould make those negotiations successfulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32452crs2 3 administrative conference of the ited states recommendation 824 1 cfr

that are not entirely composed of fulltime federal employees 6 another process for early stakeholder involv ement in rulemaking was established by the continuedalso in 1982 the administrative conference of the united states acus recommended that agencies consider using negotiated rulemaking as way to develop proposed rules published crite ria for determining when negotiated rulemaking was likely to be successful and suggested specific procedures to be followed when implementing the approach3 for example acus said agencies should use conveners to determine whethe r negotiated rulemaki ng is appropriate and to identify affected interests acus also recommended that congress pass legislation explicitly authorizing agencies to use negotiated rulemaking but giving them substantial flexibility to adapt negotiation methods in 1983 the federal aviation administrati on became the first federal agency to try negotiated rulemaking regarding flight and rest time requirements for domestic airline pilots followed by the environmental protection agency epa and the occupational health and safety administration in 1985 acus recommended refinements to the procedures based on these agencies experience with the approach4 for example acus sa id that agencies sponsor ing the effort should take part in the negotiations and pointed out th at negotiated rulemaki ng could be used at several stages of th rulemaking process congressional action the negotiated rulemaki ng act of 1990 5 usc 561570 as amended and permanently aut horized in 1996 by the administrative dispute resolution act of 1996 110 stat 2870 3873 essentially enacted the acus recommendations establishing basic statutory authority and requirements for the use of the approach while giving agencies wide latitude in its implementation the act supplements but does not suppl ant apa rulemaking procedures and establishes framework by which agencies are encouraged but not required to use negotiated rulemaking to velop proposed rules the act established public notice requirements and procedures by which affected parties can petition for inclusion in the process and clarified that agencies must generally comply with the federal advisory committee act in establishing and administering the negotiating committee5 the negotiated rulemaking committee composed of representatives of the agency and from the various nonfederal in terests that would be affected by the proposed regulation addresse s areas of concern in the hope that it can reach agreement on the contents of proposed re gulation the agency can if it agrees then issue the agreement as proposed ru and eventually as final rule under existing apa procedures the expectation is that any rule drafted through negotiated rulemaking would be easier to implement and less likely to be the subject of subsequent litigation6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32452crs3 6 continued small business regulatory enforcement fair ness act of 1996 pl 104121 codified at 5

issued execu tive order 12866 which in part directed federal agencies to explore and where ppropriate use consensual mechanisms for developing regulations incl uding negotiated rulemaking8 president clinton also issued separate memorandum in septem ber 1993 directing each agency to identify at least one rulemaking for which the agen cy would use negotiated rulemaking during 1994 or to explain why the use of the approach was not feasible9 in may 1998 president clinton issued another memo randum to th heads of executive branch departments and agencies intended to promote greater use of negotiated rulemaking10 specifically he designated the regulatory working group which had been established by executive order 12866 and was composed of the heads of agencies with significant dom estic regulatory responsibilities as an interagency committee to facilitate and encourage agency use of negotiated rulemaking the negotiated rulemaking process the negotiated rulemaking act permits agencies to establish negotiated rulemaking committee if the head of the agency determines that doing so is in the public interest in making that determination the act says the head of the agency must consider whether 1 rule is needed 2 there are limited number of identifiable interests that will be significantly affected by the rule 3 there is reasonable likelihood that balanced committee can be convened that will adequately represent those identifiable interests and is willing to negotiate in good faith to reach consensus on proposed rule 4 there is reasonable likelihood that the committee will reach consensus on the proposed rule within fixed period of time 5 the negotiated rulemaking process will not delay the issuance of the proposed or final rule 6 the agency s adequate resources that it is

the legal obligations of the agency the act also specifically permits the use of conveners to help the agency identify aff ected parties and to determine whether committee should be established if the agency decides to establish negotiated rulemaking committee the act requires the agency to publish notice in the federal register and as appropriate relevant trade or other specialized publica tions containing among other things description of the subject and scope of the rule list of affected interests list of those proposed to represent those intere sts and the agency and solicitation for comments11 the comment period must be for at least 30 calendar days membership on the committee is limited to 25 members including at least one from the sponsoring agency unless the agency head determines that more members are needed the agency can select subject to the approval of the committee by consensus an impartial facilitator to chair meetings and oversee the administration of the committee the facilitator does not have to be federal employee but agencies are required to determine whet her person under consideration to be convener or facilitator s any financial or other conflict of interest any agreement on negotiated rule must be unanimous unl ess the negotiated rulemaking committee agrees to othe r conditions if the committee reaches consensus it must submit report to the sponsoring agency containing the proposed rule and any other information it deems ppropriate however any proposal agreed to by the committee is not binding on the agency or other parties the agency may decide not to issue proposed rule at ll or not as designed by the committee and interest groups represented on the committ ee may oppose the rule that they helped craft12 the committee terminates later than promulgation of the final rule an agency may pay reasonable travel and per diem expenses and reasonable compensation to negotiating committee memb ers under certain conditions agency procedural actions related to establishing assisting or terminating the committee are not subject to judicial review but any j udicial review available regarding the rule resulting from negotiated rulemaking is unaffected httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32452crs5 congressional mandates to negotiate although the negotiated rule making act gives agencies substantial discretion as to whether the approach should be employed in rulemaking congress has sometimes mandated its use by rulemaking agencies and established specific procedures and time frames to follow for example section 7212 of the intelligence re form and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 required th secretary of transportation to use negotiated rulemaking in veloping regulations establishing minimum standards for drivers licenses or personal identification cards section 222 of the consolidated appropriations act 2004 pl 108199 required the secretary of housing and urban development to conduct negotiated rulemaking with representatives from interested parties for purposes of any changes to the formula governing the public housing operating fund section 1901b3a of the child left behind act pl 107 110 required the secretary of edu cation to establish negotiated rulemaking process on at minimu m standards and assessments the section went on the stipulate th at those involved in the process should be selected from among those that provided advice and recommendations on how the title s hould be carried out and said that the process should follow the process outlined in the negotiated rulemaking act except that it shoul d not be subject to the federal advisory committee act section 1125a5 of the child left behind act required thesecretary of education to establish negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare for schools funded by the bureau of indian affairs catalog of the cond ition of school facilities school replacement and new construction report and renovation repairs report the act specified the contents of each report and required that it be submitted to particular congressional committees within 24 months section 106b2 of the native am erican housing assistance and selfdetermination act of 1996 p l 104330 required that all regulations under the act must be issued according to negotiated rulemaking procedures and required that the negotiating committee be composed only of representatives of the federal government and geographically diverse small dium and large indian tribes section 6 of the native american housing assistance and self determination reaut horization act of 2002 pl 107292 required negotiated rulemaking for any rules issued pursuant to amendments to the original act httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32452crs6 13 cary coglianese is consensus

international 2001 pp 93113section 490db3 of the higher education amendments of 1998 pl 105244 required that negotiate d rulemaking must be used for all subsequent regulations pertaining to the acts title on student assistance unless the secretary determines that applying such requirement with respect to given regulations is impracticable unnecessary or contrary to the pub lic interest the secretary is required to publish such determination in the federal register at the same time as the proposed rule several bills that have been introduced in the 110th congress would if enacted also require the use of nego tiated rulemaking for example the indian health care improvement act amendments of 2007 and 2008 hr 1328 and s 1200 would among other things revise the indian catastrophic health emergency fund chef requirements and require the secretary of hhs to use negotiated rulemaking for the promulgation of chef regulations evaluations of negotiated rulemaking according to acus and other advocates of the approach negotiated rulemaking can have number of beneficial effects including the following reduced time money and effort expended on developing and enforcing rules earlier implementation of associated rules better agency understanding of regulated partie s concerns greater understanding by regula ted parties of their responsib ilities and higher compliance rates more creative and effective regulatory solutions less litigation associated with the rule and more cooperative relations hips between the agency and other parties acus and others have also identified number of disadvantages of negotiated rulemaking acus noted that the approach can be more resourceintensive than traditional rulemaking at least in the short term and does not work when the number of affected interest s is too large eg more than 25 negotiators one author said that the approach has been used only rarely reportedly for less than onetenth of 1 of all rule s and he said only few of those rules were considered major or significant13 the author noted that the negotiated rulemaking act instructshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32452crs7 14 william f west formal procedures informal

their likelihood of consensus not their importance another author said that nego tiated rulemaking has been used sparingly for the good reason that it represents corporatist abdication of public authority to private interests and that even when used it only results in proposed rule that is subject to the same procedural requirements as rules develope d conventionally14 another commenter asserted that negotiated rule making does not work when developing regulations based on broad statutes and may inadvertently perpetuate the probl em of statutory vagueness by facilitating efforts to shift blame for controversia l public policies from legislators to bureaucrats15 yet another study concluded that the principles theory and practice of negotiated rulemaki ng subtly subvert the basic underlying concepts of american administrative law an agencys pursuit of the public interest through law and reasoned decisionmaking in its place negotiated rulemaking would establish privately bargained interests as the source of putative public law16 nevertheless number of observers c ontinue to view negotiated rulemaking favorably with one regulatory expert describing it as offering the public the most direct and influential role in rulemaking of any reform of the process ever devised17 empirical studies studies of how negotiated rulemaking works in practice have reached substantially di fferent conclusions about its effects and prospects in 1990 eight agencies that had convened negotiation committees reportedly told acus that even though full consensus was not always possible the informati on developed through the process contributed substantially to the rule that was produced18 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32452crs8 19 cornelius kerwin and scott furlong time and

approach reduced the time needed to develop rules particularly during the period between proposed and final rulemaking19 however another study five years later examining more epa negotiations reached the opposite conclusion finding that conventional rules and negotiated rules took about the same amount of time and that negotiated rules were more likely to be challenged in court20 similarly 1999 study also concluded that negotiated rulemaking had discernibl effect on the amount of time between proposed and final rulemaking21 another study indicated that ne gotiated rulemaking can improve participants perception of the final rule and of the overall rulemaking process22 participants in negotiated rulemaking were reportedly more pleased with the quality of the information the process generated than those w ho filed comments on conventional rules and more likely to view their participation as having an effect on the final rule the study also indicated however that negotiated rulemaking imposes substantial costs on participants who are required to attend multiple meetings and interact with other stakeholders for long periods of time substantial disagreements exist regarding how the effectiveness of negotiated rulemaking should be measured eg timeliness and the am ount of litigation23 most researchers agree however that the approach is not appropriate for all rules and that more research is needed to determine its effects on rules the rulemaking process and participan ts in that process
