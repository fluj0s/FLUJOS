level order code rs21273 july 30 2002 crs report for congress received through the crs web the law of church and state public aid to sectarian schools david m ackerman legislative attorney american law division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21273 one of the most persistent issues of constitutional law concerns the extent to which the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment imposes constraints on the provision of public aid to private sectarian schools the supreme courts past jurisprudence construed the clause to impose severe restrictions on aid given directly to sectarian elementary and secondary schools but to be less restrictive when given to colleges or indirectly in the form of tax benefits or vouchers the courts recent decisions have loosened the constitutional limitations on both direct and indirect aid this report gives brief overview of the evolution of the courts interpretation of the establishment clause in this area and itemizes the categories of aid that have been addressed by the court and held to be constitutionally permissible or impermissible both at the elementary and secondary school level and at the college level overview the first amendment provides in pertinent part that congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion 1 that clause has been construed by the supreme court in general to mean that government is prohibited from sponsoring or financing religious instruction or indoctrination but the court has drawn constitutional distinction between aid that flows directly to sectarian schools and aid that benefits such schools indirectly as the result of voucher or tax benefit programs with respect to direct aid the court has consistently employed the tripartite test it first articulated in lemon v kurtzman2 that test requires that an aid program serve secular legislative purpose have primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion and not foster an excessive entanglement with religion the secular purpose 1 the first amendment has been held to apply to the states as well as to the federal government see cantwell v connecticut 310 us 296 1940 free exercise clause and everson v board of education 330 us 1 1947 establishment clause 2 403 us 602 1971 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 aspect of this test has rarely been problem for direct aid programs but prior to the courts recent decisions both the primary effect and entanglement prongs were substantial barriers to avoid primary effect of advancing religion the court required direct aid programs to be limited to secular use and struck them down if they were not so limited but even if the aid was so limited the court often found the primary effect prong violated anyway because it presumed that in pervasively sectarian institutions it was impossible for public aid to be limited to secular use alternatively it often held that direct aid programs benefiting pervasively sectarian institutions were unconstitutional because government had to so closely monitor the institutions use of the aid to be sure the limitation to secular use was honored that it became excessively entangled with the institutions these tests were particular problem for direct aid to sectarian elementary and secondary schools because the court presumed that such schools were pervasively sectarian it presumed to the contrary with respect to religious colleges the courts recent decisions in agostini v felton3 and mitchell v helms4 however have recast these tests in manner that has lowered the constitutional barriers to direct aid to sectarian schools the court has abandoned the presumption that sectarian elementary and secondary schools are so pervasively sectarian that direct aid either results in the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21273 advancement of religion or fosters excessive entanglement it has also abandoned the assumption that government must engage in an intrusive monitoring of such institutions use of direct aid the court still requires that direct aid serve secular purpose and not lead to excessive entanglement but it has recast the primary effect test to require that the aid be secular in nature that its distribution be based on religiously neutral criteria and that it not be used for religious indoctrination the courts past jurisprudence imposed fewer restraints on indirect aid to sectarian schools such as tax benefits or vouchers the court still required such aid programs to serve secular purpose but it did not apply the secular use and entanglement tests applicable to direct aid the key constitutional question was whether the initial beneficiaries of the aid ie parents or schoolchildren had genuinely independent choice about whether to use the aid for educational services from secular or religious schools if the universe of choices available was almost entirely religious the court held the program unconstitutional because the government in effect dictated by the design of the program that religious option be chosen but if religious options did not predominate the court held the program constitutional even if parents chose to receive services from pervasively sectarian schools moreover in its recent decision in zelman v simmonsharris5 the court legitimated an even broader range of indirect aid programs by holding that the evaluation of the universe of choice available to parents is not confined to the private schools at which the voucher aid can be used but includes as well all of the public school options open to parents 3 521 us 203 1997 4 530 us 793 2000 5 70 uslw 4683 2002 crs3 specific decisions concerning public aid to sectarian elementary and secondary schools 1 bus transportation in everson v board of education6 the court held it to be constitutionally permissible for local government to subsidize bus transportation between home and school for parochial schoolchildren as well as public schoolchildren the court said the subsidy was essentially general welfare program that helped children get from home to school and back safely in wolman v walter7 on the other hand the court held the establishment clause to be violated by the public subsidy of field trip transportation for parochial schoolchildren on the grounds field trips are an integral part of the schools curriculum and wholly controlled by the school 2 textbooks and instructional materials in several decisions the court has upheld as constitutional the loan of secular textbooks to children in sectarian elementary and secondary schools8 and in wolman v walter supra it upheld the inclusion in such textbook loan program of related manuals and reusable workbooks the courts rationale has been that the textbooks are by their nature limited to secular use and that the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21273 loan programs are general welfare programs that only incidentally aid sectarian schools in contrast the court in meek v pittenger supra and wolman v walter supra held the provision of instructional materials other than textbooks such as periodicals photographs maps charts films sound recordings projection and recording equipment and lab equipment to sectarian schools or sectarian school children to be unconstitutional on the grounds such aid provides substantial aid to the sectarian enterprise as whole and inevitably has primary effect of advancing religion but in its most recent decision mitchell v helms supra the court overturned those aspects of meek and wolman and held it to be constitutional for government to include sectarian schools in program providing instructional materials including computer hardware and software on the grounds the aid was secular in nature was distributed according to religiously neutral criteria and could be limited to secular use within the sectarian schools without any intrusive government monitoring 3 teachers and other personnel in lemon v kurtzman supra the court held it to be unconstitutional for state to subsidize parochial school teachers of such secular subjects as math foreign languages and the physical sciences either by way of direct subsidy of such teachers salaries or by means of purchase of secular services program the state the court said would have to engage in intrusive monitoring to ensure that the subsidized teachers did not inculcate religion and it held such monitoring to excessively entangle government with the schools for similar reason the court in meek v pittenger supra struck down program of auxiliary services to children in nonpublic schools which included enrichment and remedial educational services counseling and psychological services and speech and hearing therapy by public 6 330 us 1 1947 7 433 us 229 1977 8 board of education v allen 392 us 236 1968 meek v pittenger 421 us 349 1975 and wolman v walter supra crs4 personnel and in aguilar v felton9 it held unconstitutional the provision of remedial and enrichment services to eligible children in sectarian schools by public school teachers under the title i program if they were provided on the premises of the sectarian schools finally in city of grand rapids v ball10 the court also struck down similar state program of remedial and enrichment services as well as program in which the school district hired parochial school teachers to provide afterschool extracurricular programs to their students on the premises of their sectarian schools but in agostini v felton supra the court overturned the aguilar decision and the pertinent parts of meek and ball and upheld as constitutional the provision of remedial and enrichment educational services to sectarian schoolchildren by public teachers on the premises of sectarian schools in addition the court in zobrest v catalina foothills school district11 upheld as constitutional the provision at public expense under the individuals with disabilities education act idea of signlanguage interpreter for disabled child attending sectarian secondary school in both cases the court reasoned that the programs were general welfare programs available to students without regard to whether they attended public or private sectarian schools and in zobrest it reasoned as well that the parents controlled the decision about whether the assistance took place in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21273 sectarian school or public school 4 tests and staterequired reports in levitt v committee for public education12 the court struck down program reimbursing sectarian schools for the costs of administering and compiling the results of teacherprepared tests in subjects required to be taught by state law for the reason that the teachers controlled the tests and might well include religious content in them in contrast the court in wolman v walter supra upheld program in which state provided standardized tests in secular subjects and related scoring services to nonpublic schoolchildren including those in religious schools similarly in committee for public education v regan13 the court upheld program that reimbursed sectarian schools for the costs of administering such stateprepared tests as the regents exams comprehensive achievement exams and college qualifications tests in both cases the rationale was that such tests were limited by their nature to secular use in regan the court also upheld as constitutional program which reimbursed sectarian and other private schools for the costs of complying with statemandated recordkeeping and reporting requirements about student enrollment and attendance faculty qualifications the content of the curriculum and physical facilities on the grounds the requirements were imposed by the state and did not involve the teaching process 5 maintenance and repair costs in committee for public education v nyquist supra the court struck down as unconstitutional state program subsidizing some of the costs incurred by sectarian schools for the maintenance and repair of their 9 473 us 402 1985 10 473 us 373 1985 11 509 us 1 1993 12 413 us 472 1973 13 444 us 646 1980 crs5 facilities including costs incurred for heating lighting renovation and cleaning on the grounds the subsidy inevitably aided the schools religious functions 6 vouchers and tax benefits in committee for public education v nyquist supra and sloan v lemon14 the court held unconstitutional programs which provided tuition grants and tax benefits to the parents of children attending private schools most of which were religious in both instances the court found that the programs benefited only those with children in private schools that most of those schools were sectarian and that the programs had primary purpose and effect of subsidizing such schools in three other decisions however the court has upheld voucher and tax benefit programs where the benefits were available to children attending public as well as private schools or their parents mueller v allen15 involved state program giving tax deduction to the parents of all elementary and secondary schoolchildren for variety of educational expenses including tuition witters v washington department of services for the blind16 in turn involved grant to blind person who wanted to attend bible college to prepare for religious vocation under state vocational rehabilitation program which provided educational assistance for wide variety of vocations in zelman v httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21273 simmonsharris supra the court upheld voucher program that assisted parents in failing public schools in cleveland to send their children to private schools most of which were sectarian in each instance the courts rationale in upholding the programs was that the benefits were available on religiously neutral basis and that sectarian schools benefited only indirectly as the result of the independent choices of students or their parents in zelman the court further held that the universe of choice open to parents was not limited to the private schools where the vouchers could be used but included the full range of public school options open to them as well 7 health and nutrition services the court has in dicta repeatedly affirmed the constitutionality of the public subsidy of physician nursing dental and optometric services to children in sectarian schools17 and in wolman v walter supra it specifically upheld the provision of diagnostic speech hearing and psychological services by public school personnel on sectarian school premises in addition the court has repeatedly in dicta affirmed the constitutionality of the public subsidy of school lunches for eligible children in sectarian schools18 8 general public services in dicta in everson v board of education supra the court affirmed as constitutional the provision to sectarian schools of such general public services as police and fire protection connections for sewage disposal highways and sidewalks the establishment clause the court intimated does not require that religious schools be cut off from public services so separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function 14 413 us 825 1973 15 463 us 388 1983 16 474 us 481 1986 17 lemon v kurtzman supra meek v pittenger supra and wolman v walter supra 18 lemon v kurtzman supra and meek v pittenger supra crs6 specific decisions concerning public aid to sectarian colleges and universities 1 general aid in roemer v maryland board of public works19 the court found statutory restriction barring the use of the funds for sectarian purposes sufficient to enable it to uphold state program of noncategorical grants to all private colleges in the state including ones that were churchaffiliated the court stressed that the church related colleges that benefited were not pervasively sectarian and that the aid was statutorily restricted to secular use 2 construction assistance in tilton v richardson20 the court upheld as constitutional federal program that provided grants to colleges including church affiliated colleges for the construction of needed facilities so long as the facilities were not used for religious worship or sectarian instruction the statute provided that the federal interest in any facility constructed with federal funds would expire after 20 years but the court held that the nonsectarian use requirement would have to apply so long as the buildings had any viable use subsequently in hunt v mcnair21 the court upheld httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21273 program in which state issued revenue bonds to finance the construction of facilities at institutions of higher education including those with religious affiliation the program barred the use of the funds for any facility used for sectarian instruction or religious worship 3 student publication subsidy in rosenberger v the rector and board of visitors of the university of virginia22 the court held that it would be constitutional for state university to subsidize the printing costs of an avowedly religious student publication the university made the subsidy available to nonreligious student publications as way of fostering student expression and discussion and the court said it would constitute viewpoint discrimination violative of the free speech clause of the first amendment to deny the subsidy to student publication offering religious perspective 4 vouchers in two summary affirmances the court has upheld the constitutionality of programs providing grants to students attending institutions of higher education including religiouslyaffiliated colleges both smith v board of governors of the university of north carolina23 and americans united for the separation of church and state24 involved grants given on the basis of need for students to use in attending either public or private colleges including religiously affiliated ones in affirming the decisions the supreme court issued opinion in either case but the lower courts reasoned that the religious colleges benefitted from the programs only if the aided students independently decided to attend 19 426 us 736 1976 20 403 us 672 1971 21 413 us 734 1973 22 515 us
