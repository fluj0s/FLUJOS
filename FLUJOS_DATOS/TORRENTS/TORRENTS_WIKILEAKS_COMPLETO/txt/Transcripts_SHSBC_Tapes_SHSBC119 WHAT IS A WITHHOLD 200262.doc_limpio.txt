what is withhold lecture given on 20 february 1962 okay you have by the way seen an example of sec checking on rudiments as opposed to prepchecking and you had three or four rudiments live on the other session the first session you saw do you remember that the earlier session same pc and the auditor just swept these by grandly do you remember audience yes hmmm hmhm and you gasped with horror you remember gasping slightly with horror and you didnt use any sound and today you saw handling them with sec checking and going in and straightening up every rudiment or trying to and bypassing prepchecking we never got to prepchecking did we never got to our business at all if its all right with you fred we will now ask the pc you understand this is not preordained particularly this isnt taped as to so as to give you an example of which is which it just turns out that you now have an example of which is which all right which session gave you the most gain fred male voice first one the first one mm we handled the whole ruddy lot with prepchecking didnt we hm and on the other one we never got any auditing done to amount to anything and go ahead and tell them what you told at the end of the session about having the areas confused male voice well he was asking about the withhold on something had to do with money and i had three different areas if you noticed the center theater the american theater association big area there and this area here and i wasnt sure about which area the withhold was in and on thursday in prepchecking coming around to what about such and such the number one question you see every time he came around to the number one question i knew where i was i could locate myself kind of on the track or what are we working on together here you see how youre working i knew where i was every time the number one question came around and we got new number one question we kind of narrowed down to one area and cleaned that up before it went on to something else this time i wasnt sure and so i kept saying well gee where you know what or something like this okay all right male voice ill keep prepchecking good enough okay you see this you see this well we learn what we learn that was not scheduled to teach you these two things but you get out you understand these are live sessions they are not demonstrations and you learn what you learn out of something like that of course i feel silly when i dont get pc pressed on forward i didnt intend actually to run onto this much crash on this and frankly an hour an hourand fifteenminute session is very short session for i normally will audit three to five hours in session and im having to scale my sessioning down see to match the demonstration but frankly it is my opinion after this session its my opinion after this session that the more you monkey around with rudiments except for havingness why the less auditing youre going to get done thats just what we sort of mean that does not apply to 3d criss cross but weve got prepchecking now and it is highly precise activity and i dont think that sec checking even vaguely compares to it thats my opinion i couldnt get it off the launching pad see if wed gone on auditing i would have given him break and id have said well none of this is clear none of these things are null i would have given him break and wed had cigarette and i would have brought him back into it and started new session see i would have ended that session and started new session instantly and i would have swung right into the rudiments all right this ones live and this ones live i would have told him see and then i would have come down on prepchecking and i would have said well what about money see or what about taking money or what about this subject because this seemed to be the subject we were on and then i would have gone ahead and cleaned it up by area and type of withhold and so forth and i would have cleaned it up properly but i was trying to clean that up with the who and the when if you will notice just who and the when and man it didnt spring did it so scrub it it didnt spring if i cant do it i cant expect you to okay theres substitute apparently for just full dress parade clean zone troop the colors prepchecking get 0 proceed from the 0 go to your 1 proceed from your 1 to your 11 you know whatever it is there is substitute for it ive run couple of sessions since i was that well i ran another session particularly i was just standing on my head i could have been sitting there knitting like the childrens tutor does she teaches them school while knitting it requires strain on the auditor this was quite strain on the auditor wondering where the hell you were going see and this other i ran threeandahalf hour prepcheck session terrific numbers of withholds falling off the line and it was just dead easy there was nothing to it sunday night i woke up you know well lets go to dance you know there wasnt anything to this on the auditor okay all right this is saint hill special briefing course whats the date audience twentieth thank you whats the month audience february oh thank you whats the year audience ad 12 ad 12 all right all right we will let you away with that thank you very much special briefing course saint hill now im going to talk to you about withholds and this is all about withholds so rather relatively brief lecture but i have now found the common denominator of withholds you didnt get an opportunity to see it in todays demonstration but that doesnt make any difference to that what is withhold withhold is something that person believes that if if it is revealed it will endanger their selfpreservation in other words withhold is something that endangers the selfpreservation of the pc now that is very important definition its taken very long time to get that definition it gives us new line for 3d criss cross although this is not about 3d criss cross and it worked back and forth is an absolute killer because this is the reason whole track is occluded this is where your whole track memory went and this is the button on which it is sitting so this is very important discovery therefore we would consider that that person who had very little whole track recall would consider themselves in very dangerous position in other words youve got gradient here the less whole track recall the more the person considers they are in danger and the less likely you are to get withhold off of them the more fantastic the whole track recall the same thing we are dodging here somehow or another with that now thats quite important to you because it gives you and gives hahahahahaha the exact reason this is why you get off such as i am now going to say and call them withholds these are actual student withholds i went outside and looked at the sky and felt strange and an auditor bought it as withhold and worked it over i had picture of my mothers bedroom and i dont know why that is withhold i spoke crossly to an instructor george and bill told that they had heard that agnes and that is withhold why is that withhold all right lets start with the first one first of course its safest to get off other peoples withholds these are all safe withholds they are so safe and that is all students tend to get off on each other is safe withholds im sorry to send that arrow so deeply they get off safe withholds if they reveal these things they itd be perfectly all right to reveal them because its perfectly safe to reveal now why do we get into tacit consent of this particular kind very interesting why we do overts on other peoples withholds we take somebodys withhold and we yapyap at them and we trip them up with it and we make them guilty with it and we sort of punish them little bit for having gotten off withhold we yipyap on the subject and after that we are little bit afraid to get off withhold of ourself because we have an overt against the other persons withhold so therefore we dont consider it safe to get off withhold do you see what the what the rationale of the overt is we have an overt on other people getting off withholds so we dont get off withholds you see because it isnt safe to get off withhold now of course the more unsafe you make it to get off withhold the battier it all becomes until you get civilization like this one now the one thing by which the communist profits in australia and suid afrika are the laws against perversion the state of all means is regulating how you are going to perform the sexual act i think thats very interesting ive seldom seen any police officers in my bedroom and im afraid if i did theyd have short shrift of course i have i have had the people the police officers are supposed to restrain trying to crawl into my bedroom windows and few things like that you know but that of course they wouldnt be interested in now what are they doing theyre just trying to invent some new withholds arent they i think thats fascinating because the communist uses blackmail of this particular kind as means of controlling heads of state in other words if the state itself lends its weight to punishment of withholds see it has just laid itself out to be crazy because now anybody in the state can be blackmailed so as to overthrow the state because the state will punish the overthrow or the withhold do you understand this or any part of this audience yes all right now there it is on the third dynamic the state makes it unsafe for anybody to confess to anything so everybody is withholding from the state what happens if you withhold from the state or the state misses withholds on you of course you begin to hate the state and that is the downfall of nationalism of course this may be very fortunate but nevertheless they have sown the seeds of their own destruction by the number of great laws which they arise on how person shouldnt get off withholds lets apply that to an auditing session the auditor upsets the pc or tries to make the pc guilty every time the pc gets off withhold therefore the auditor is making it unsafe for the pc to get off withhold all right then therefore the auditor trains the pc not to get off unsafe withholds the auditor then trains the pc to get off only safe withholds and we read on an auditors report i went out at night and looked at the sky and felt strange and that is withhold great day in the morning thats safe withhold isnt it well of course the funny part of it is there it is its not withhold its not withhold at all so you can actually get into games condition with your pc by punishing the pc for his withholds you can actually get into games condition where the pc will only try to get off safe withholds and there you go now if pc isnt giving withholds im afraid that i would become persuasive withhold is something that if revealed would be prejudicial to his survival now naturally his individuation comes from his withholds this hyper individuation of the pc this onlyoneness this withdrawal into only self all of that and withdrawal out of groups and withdrawal here and there and so forth all of these things stem exclusively and only and entirely from of course withholds which if gotten off the person believes would injure their survival now the funny part of it is is these is this is not true the person gets an aberrated idea of what would injure his survival if he got it off dont you see and its this aberrated idea of what they dare get off that brings about the condition of aberration i think that possibly youve got one two or three apiece some kind of an average like that that if you revealed it in the wrong quarter your its factual that somebody would be likely to take action see if the state of new south guinea or something of this sort found out about this well huh might be poor show youve all got some that were factual there are some factual ones see some real ones and you get those real buried and they get very encysted and the other aberrated idea builds up on those and we get buildup of that now the punishment of our parents of course we feel offhand that this comes from past life 3d criss cross gets these areas cleaned up but when we started this life we already had the idea that if we disclosed certain things to our parents or we did certain things or we were didnt withhold mean words and so forth from our father or something like that wed find ourselves suddenly without food clothing and shelter in other words we get this exaggerated idea well its built on our past life structure but thats bad enough basis now we take off from there and we move into areas and then do commit something which if revealed would be very upsetting or would have been very upsetting and then other little things start piling up on the top of that and so on and we get up to point where we become quite aberrated quite individuated and we get so we cant even communicate with parts of our body and the result of all this naturally is feeling of high antisocialness and somebody comes close to these withholds and we believe implicitly you see that if we got off this withhold naturally we could just see the police running in my god the sirens going in all directions you see and police by the squad coming bursting in the front door probably with battering rams you know and they got handcuffs and theyre all ready to put them on you you know and drag you off and naturally the cell theyre going to drag you to is not any of the modern jails you know which just dramatize withholds its probably one of the oldtime dungeons you know where they bury you up to the neck in water and leave you there for forty years or something like this you see you get an aberrated idea of the punishment in jail and this all of sudden rekindles you know the auditor gets close to one of these things and this idea ooooooh you know oooooooooooooooooo you know at any minute this horrible series of circumstances are going to occur and naturally we consider the auditor dangerous listen the auditor is only dangerous if he doesnt pull the withhold and that is recurring phrase that is starting to happen here in this school there are certain auditors that we designate as dangerous auditors why are they dangerous because they will only tick and not pull withhold and we call those people dangerous auditors why their pcs are all going to be mad at them they are themselves going to goof up and get lots of loses one way or the other and theyre going to always be involved in arc breaks of some kind or another and theyre going to have people going around gossiping about how bad central organizations are and how bad they are and how bad everything else is and so forth and they are dangerous but from the pcs viewpoint the person becomes dangerous the moment they might find out whatever this thing is you see and the auditor appears for moment dangerous the auditor might find out and the pc gets arc breaky however only when the auditor fails to find out the auditor has to go the whole way and an auditor who wont go the whole way an auditor who will only get off safe withholds off of pc is dangerous and that is todays adjudication on whether person can audit or not are they safe auditor or dangerous auditor oddly enough its complete reversal the auditor who gets off safe withholds is dangerous and the auditor who will get off unsafe withholds is safe you understand that now youve got to youve got to bust through any feeling you have on this and look at this square in the teeth and follow it through because your actually all of your activities as an auditor are totally 100 percent based on this one little fact it all cones down to this an auditor who will not pull dangerous withholds from the pc is dangerous auditor youre going to have an arc breaky pc your pc is going to be upset with you there are only two or three ways you could possibly mess it up but how could you fail to do this one you could fail to use an emeter you could fail to make an meter play any tune that was ever written by bach beethoven and brahms you see you could just fail to make an emeter talk in other words you look at the thing and the needle falls off the pin and so forth and there it is and the parts are all collapsing and so forth and we say well that needle thats null haha thats null needle haha hm god man well you dont have to clean it up in one session but you have to make sure that youve got another session you notice i had about two or three rudiments banging there in that demonstration today and even missed withhold as banging and the pc didnt spit at because the pc knows i know that theyre missed see and the pc knows i know where were going on this sort of thing pc has confidence in this all right but you go whole intensive and you never pull any of these things and you never ask for missed withholds and you never try to inquire any deeper into any of these things and that pc blows up in your face every arc break you ever got off of pc was due to missed withholds although missed withholds is brandnew as principle its been functioning this whole time and every time you failed to get off withhold you missed withhold on the pc you ticked it you had an arc break that accounts for every arc break you have ever had with pc that accounts for every pc who never wanted to be audited again by you that accounts for all of your own difficulties with pcs right there in one fell swoop now you could accomplish it by not operating with an emeter you could accomplish it by very unreal or nasty auditing approach every time the pc said something you say nyaaaaa you know something like this you could accomplish it by just having your technology all backwards and shuffled into another deck you could accomplish it by just poor auditing but in the final analysis poor auditing only exists if person is determined that theyre never going to hurt pc by getting off any nasty withholds theyre going to be nice to pcs and theyre only going to get off safe withholds uuuhhhrr you almost have to use sjamboks and clubs on some auditors im not kidding you my method on the thing is just to stampede the auditor on the subject and theres more than one here whos already been stampeded by straight at the subject you know what the only thing you want to worry about the only thing you should really worry about is when i give up on you ive done that too just quit you know and then you get very nice auditor reports you get an initial or something like that i just wont do anything more about it why i know you wont but that doesnt include very many and the other ones is you start missing withholds pc goals and gains well i didnt make any goals and i didnt make any gains and so forth well it might as well have been printed in letters of fire auditor has missed withholds on this pc auditor did not clean up things on this pc auditor read the emeter upside down something wild went on here thats all i mean because frankly i have to tell you this but ive got you in box right now with prepchecking youre taped and targeted the auditor who cannot get result with prepchecking will not audit uuuhhrrr its been weaving closer and closer to this point see weve been converging on this point technology has been getting better and better and better and better and here we sit looking at prepchecking well prepchecking gets little better there was little change the other day in 3d criss cross as soon as i found out that this applied to 3d criss cross i realized that you cant let pc cross out anything on list because thats you not because the pc says thats pretty dangerous lets see thats pretty dangerous lets see thats pretty dangerous and i think this this item i think thats awfully dangerous i think we ought to have that off the list and that off the list and that off the list and we just cross the whole list off its all too dangerous and then you have missed an item which actually amounts to missed withhold and so the person gets upset with 3d criss cross so we cant allow the pc once he has put it on the list after weve blackjacked him tricked and hoodwinked him into getting it onto the list we cant let the pc take it off even though that makes more work on differentiations i found this is the case i find pcs will take live items off the list if you dont watch them so there it is so some of your lists are disappearing into smoke and some of your items are being crossed off because your pc has misgivings upon the safety with which they can be revealed since all of these items went out of sight to some degree or another because it was very unsafe at some time or another to reveal them im looking at somebody right now that was going around with very very hot terminal tucked under her arm in family who believed implicitly that the exact reverse of this terminal was way of life and how to be closer to god and this pc just had to withhold this one like mad and of course the whole more the pc withheld it and so forth why the hotter it got see the whole family this would have been heresy its like the of priest you know he wouldnt believe in god nobody gets that joke boy youre slow today youre very slow today wake up the of priest and he has terminal called atheist see that would be very upsetting very upsetting hed have withholds so would the priest but anyway as you get this straight across the boards we find that hundred trillion years ago why well lets take an example we had one mentioned in the session today something like well lets just call it out of thin air embezzler or something like that you see and this fellow was born in banking family where integrity is all you see and he hears from his father and he hears from his mother and he hears from his brothers and sisters in the business and he and 90 forth and hes got hot terminal hes been one of the best embezzlers that the country has ever had dont you see something like that and here he has to live in this atmosphere with this terminal hot you know so all the time hes pulling this terminal back im not saying thats the terminal but you get the idea thats withhold man would it be unsafe to be that embezzler right and he might dramatize it at any moment and so he fights it and he fights it and he fights it and then one night he goes into the bank vault and he cleans out the whole thing and goes over the hill see the wrong time wrong place wrong terminal see for his environment and when these things get badly restimulated and so forth why theyve had it all right now some auditor is auditing him see and we get down to this terminal and who or what would enforce an outflow from others see and he puts down an embezzler and he goes down the line and the auditor goes down and they he had little arc break with the auditor something of this sort the auditor looked at him crosswise or didnt acknowledge him just right and its not really an arc break it was just that and he clicks on that other one you see you know this i dont auditor has already missed withhold on him and so forth and hes he says i i dont know were differentiating the list and we get down to embezzler and we he thinks we better cross that off so he says well it it really wouldnt enforce an outflow cross cross that off the list gives him second thought and we mustnt let the pc have that second thought so theres that little change in 3d criss cross you see why it is all right now you see that the pc now lets take up prepchecking these two things you see suddenly go hand in glove in other words we have one straight line we have prepchecking as basic for this lifetime that keeps the pc insession and then we have its extension 3d criss cross and both of them are devoted to the same thing of letting the guy stand in the sun theyre both devoted to the same thing you see getting him over all of his oddball notions about how dangerous it would be to reveal the fact that he had crooked left ear nothing to it i mean he looks at this after while and laughs but he isnt laughing at the time you start auditing him you say all right now okay now what about that activity there that was going on in tacoma and now lets see if i think of something else or if i can get the auditor thinking or talking about something else you know this is all reactive you know so lets lets lets move it all over onto some other perimeter then he says well it has to do actually with mexico city in other words hes trying to throw red herrings he can get into point of reactively regretting having mentioned it and youll see him pass through that little band of regretting he brought it up in the first place now if the auditing is bad he does this often if the auditing is good he only does it once in while it is always present matter how good the auditing is im kind of sorry i brought this up now what is going to happen to of course all the time hes being sorry he brought it up youre just crossing into the actual zone and area you actually have tremendous unknowns left on the whole subject and the pc does not know much and great deal about this thats what the difficulty is in other words he still has tremendous unknowns now in prepchecking in prepchecking also theres been little discovery here about when the pc prepchecking when the pc equivocates you know youre looking at the package when he starts to explain watch when the pc starts to explain at that moment add what 13 or whatever its coming up this time and lets find out what this little hot subject is hes going over right this minute hes explaining now theres rule theres rule about this about asking what questions and this isnt really about what questions but ill just show you what this is the first rule is when the pc gives you motivator you know youre on hot ground and so you always ask what question thats rather overt says well my mother beat every day my what question im afraid at the moment is what have you done to your mother i would not even monkey with this motivator see i wouldnt fool with it at all the next gradient up that would be thatd be the most certain ground to mine motivator motivator motivator man that just takes the what question and practically writes it in legible script in front of your face you see your next one up the line from that is the person is critical the person is being critical of somebody well the criticalness you can go on and pull criticism forever without getting anyplace you want to know what he did did did did did done done done done action action action there must be action back of that criticism otherwise we wouldnt have it see so criticism is sure indicator of an overt now lets take the milder form of it which is explaining why it happened the pc starts explaining i dont let the pc explain very long without giving him new 1 subsomething or other on the what question i give him new what question to clean up pc starts explaining and says well actually the truth of the matter was that i was on the ferryboat i hadnt i hadnt actually meant to be on the ferryboat you understand but i was coming down from the taxi rank and i just saw the ferryboat there im liable to cut him off at that moment on whatever we were talking about and ask little more pinchedinclose what what were you doing you know something like this and he says well ohoh oh that and it alerts him so you have these various indicators they make gradient pc gives you motivator oh well thats an absolute certain indicator and you must pull the overt straightaway just convert the thing into an overt without any slightest person says well my just my mother beat every day just on and on and on and beat every day and so forth its just leadpipe cinch what have you done to your mother i mean it just might as well appear be printed on the auditor form you know i mean itd be that inevitable your next one is criticism criticism criticism well theres real overt back of this and so forth now were not going to dignify getting off other peoples withholds by even classifying it an auditor who would do that oh man thats very safe but its so safe that theyre not withholds theyre not his withholds what are you doing what are you doing monkeying with somebody elses withholds theyre not this pcs actions perfectly safe to reveal other peoples withholds isnt it or it might be unless they find out about it but then your area of explanation and then there is the actual withhold now of course the actual withhold the person says well i i used to stand down on the battery and bung paving stones through the windshields of cars see and youve got your tailormade what question standing right in front of your face because its not what about bunging paving stones through windshields of car on the battery on july 1st 1962 or something like this you see thats not the question the question is what about damaging cars or something but theres your what question its tailormade because its the withhold now lets drop downstairs little bit and we find the pc is explaining something so we get the what question out of the bulk of his explanation hes saying well i actually i actually would never never really liked liked liked my wife and i really never liked her and so forth and this was easy to understand i of course was came home late and all that sort of thing but she never kept herself up and she never really did anything for around the house and she never really paid much atten thats actually he hasnt given motivator you know he hasnt given an overt its just an explanation of how it was all messy and you could just cut him short on his explanation get your new what now ill give you an example out of your session today we had two or three periods of explanation when i wasnt doing prepchecking in view of the fact that i wasnt doing prepchecking i of course could never get to the bottom of it it was just crippled you see because i couldnt slide in the what see because in clearing rudiments i was avoiding whats and i certainly wasnt prepchecking you see i was sec checking doesnt work all right so next indicator is the pc is being very critical about something or other hes being very critical of you the auditor thats very special case if hes being critical of you the auditor you have missed withhold and you better find out what it is what should you have found out about when did you think i was fool anything that you could possibly mention that would throw missed withhold into view that would be the stage at which you pulled this particular one but its the criticism you want to find out what has been done the missed withhold underlies all of these things by the way but you can find an actual doingness at the point of criticism hes saying well i natter natter natter and actually i always thought always thought that he wore the wrong color ties and that was why i didnt like him or something of the sort and so on well hes done something to that person or done something to person like that so your what question is tailormade out of that and then there is your fundamental fundamental is motivator man red flag lets just find out what hes done to the source of that motivator or the type of beingness of that motivator just overtly find out what hes done in other words youre getting off overts and so on now if you look at this as scale you will find out that the withhold is measured by the degree of danger the only reason im giving you this scale im not talking about how you ask what questions the degree of danger the pc conceives to be present on the subject of getting off the withhold all right if the pc doesnt think its very dangerous they give it to you directly and straight if the pc thinks its little bit dangerous they explain around the fringes of where it might lie if the pc thinks its rather confoundedly dangerous its getting just little bit grim maybe on the jail borderline on that chain the pc will criticize see criticism enters and if it is so dangerous that the pc believes you understand im saying pc believes im not saying its factual the pc is right up to the point where with jingle jangle the patrol wagon arrives the officers pick up the battering ram they knock down the front door they come crashing in with the handcuffs and leg irons you see and drag him screaming off towed back of the black maria you see something like this and they can see this is going to happen if that withhold is missing they give you the motivator they always give you motivator flat flat total motivator hundred percent now what how do you use this well it gives you the gradient scale and indexes of all cases case is not as bad off as he is crazy case is not as bad off as he is aberrated case is not as bad off as anything except how dangerous he considers it would be if he revealed himself and so you have from the top to the bottom all cases on that gradient just like you have the what questions and the degree of the withhold and the safety on those that gradient so you have all cases on that gradient and the person who will die before he will reveal himself is also on that scale so you have them from the case that you could audit to clear in twenty five hours see bang you sneeze the person is clear well this person has not had any great idea that itd be dangerous to tell people things thats the index of that case all right now the person who went 150 hours to routine 3 kind of clear well that person doesnt have very much he considers his be all right pretty easy now we have the case that we went 200 hours on without finding only finding goal and terminal well hahahahahahaha that case has got quite little hatful there is nice little hatful of stuff that if the individual revealed any part of that he thinks he believes that hmmm it would be well itd be rough it would be pretty rough hed probably lose his family and hed lose this and that you see and now you take the person who went 500 hours with goal and terminal and gain and that sort of thing now we know darn well this person has moving up into the perimeter of the police breaking in the front door if it were learned about this person see and now we take the case the case that actually goes to the spinbin rather than reveal things well man thats in extremis because insanity is the last protest against punishment see i cannot feel your punishment i do not even know about it im not even rational being youve driven out of my mind you see thats total motivator on the subject of punishment so where we go then youve got your whole your whole thing its just length of time in auditing your length of time in auditing is indexed by the danger the individual believes would be present if he revealed certain things and danger to reveal is the direct index of length of time in auditing there it is want to know how long it takes to clear somebody well how dangerous does this person consider it would be to reveal certain things now how could you cut down this length of time in auditing well ive given you the answer dont pull safe withholds just move in and pull actual withholds dont fool around with it and use prepchecking and youve got that all right now that gets this lifetimes danger out of the way and ive even given you new type of line and slight change in 3d criss cross that does not permit the person to escape once youve got the item on the list and the type of line is the line for 3d criss cross of course is what identity would it be unsafe for you to reveal or some such wording see and they will blow into view and what identity would it be safe for you to reveal of course could be relief line which would just be nonsense but it would sort of balance the thing off and throw the other one into view in other words just be trick line in other words you could drag these things out and you could you know now what the pc is doing so it becomes relatively simple that is what the pc is doing while he is there sitting in front of you he would like to reveal himself he would like to reveal this and he would like to get out of it but he does not know how to get out of it and the person is always hoping that somebody will come along and give him shot in the gluteus maximus with some magic fluid by which he will not have to reveal thing and become totally clear and anytime anybody has ever proposed that to why ive had an instinct on the subject now i know why i should go back through the files and find out whos proposed it because we would have an index of some of our roughest cases itd be the person who wants to be cleared without revealing anything now the people who get spinny in processing you must be tripping right over you must be falling right over something well now prepchecking will get it for you there is contest about it this is very easy easy activity because person moves right up into it but the basic prepcheck question that would get them all would of course be one of these unsafe to reveal questions your zero have you ever have you ever done anything that might have been unsafe to mention see that would be your zero is there anything youve ever done that would be unsafe to you if you told about it if you reveal certain things about yourself would it be unsafe to you some such zero dont you see doesnt matter how it expresses to the pc then you get your what off of what the pc said then youd mine that down youd strip the whole bank interesting safe to reveal this is the index on it now you must figure its awful safe to show up with mest body meat body you see and then you get the idea that its unsafe so you begin to take it down that must be what old age is that must be the only thing old age is so take heart girls now you just look at this as the idea of apparence apparency appearances disappearances being there not being there well it all passes over into the field of fact offering the fact is dangerous withholding the fact is apparently not dangerous all it does is pull the person to pieces thats the trick of the body builder that is the basic trick of this universe and the basic trick of this universe is if you withhold it it wont hurt you any and of course that is stinking lie so they get everybody to withhold things they invent codes of law and that sort of thing and these things are all supposed to get everybody to withhold the thing and then the thing thetan gets to packing up mass and occupying less space and he occupies less space and less space and he can permeate less and less things and here he goes hes got it made yeah but whos got it made of course that is game nobody wins scientology is the only game where everybody wins now theres your there is your index of withholds there is your what theyre about that is why your pc wont talk to you that is why your pc reveals what he reveals thats why you sometimes look very silly writing down well the pc has withhold that the pc has bent toe and why after youve prepchecked bent toe for five or six sessions there has been gain on the part of the pc you see you see how this might work does this straighten out anything for you audience hmmm now you could use this principle but if i give it to you youll work it to death instead of using it as zero you can flip over and you mustnt work this to death who would have been dangerous to have revealed that to could be version of the who question but you get on some hot line and the person is talking about having robbed every restaurant in the entirety of new york and hes robbed every restaurant in new york practically and so forth and he just keeps going on and on you dont seem to clean this up the who that will clean it up is who wouldnt it have been safe to have told about that and who didnt find out about it and of course hed say well the restaurateurs and hes been saying the restaurateurs all this time and all of sudden he looks at you and he says well all right the police all right when did they fail to find out about it and we get the rest of the chain and it blows do you see that now there is there is your gradient of the value of the withhold to the pc i call very strictly to your attention that i have said the pc believes it would be unsafe and that is what is most interesting believes it would be unsafe and of course these things i think i think the crime you committed i think they probably run out of witnesses i think the i dont think the government would spend cent trying to dig up enough witnesses or even find the records in order to prosecute you and so forth particularly if it was real crime the government is much more interested in minor crimes than real crimes and the essence of the situation however is one little thing like that gets stacked up on other little things and something else gets stacked up on that and the next thing you know person believes its very dangerous to put his nose out of doors cant cant go outside and theres your cant go outside thing godawful things are liable to happen to this person if they go outside liable to be recognized as the person who committed the murder only they kind of vaguely think maybe they have committed murder which is quite interesting you have very few backtrack things on this that are hot but every case must have few on it you suddenly say oh man i bet theyre still waiting for i bet theyre still looking for someplace or another and the pc is liable to have his hair almost stand on end for moment when he hits one of these things and then he suddenly well thats nonsense been long time ago long long i wonder if they are but this equally applies to 3d cross cross and to prepchecking but is most salient in your use of prepchecking and there is where you should use it and i wont get nasty or mean with you or anything i will just forbid anybody to get off your withholds if i hear any more session being spent on i went out in the evening and looked at the sky and felt strange i wouldnt even try to make anything out of it except that some pc had hot area someplace and had just thrown great big floppy squishy red herring and i dont like red herring so i would let that one drop there are certain withholds you let go by you just let them go by you dont do thing with them and there are certain withholds that you hang to till grim death until they are all revealed and youll just have to learn which ones and the index of it is what is it the pc consider it safe to reveal what does the pc consider it unsafe to reveal and that unravels the whole problem for you thank you
