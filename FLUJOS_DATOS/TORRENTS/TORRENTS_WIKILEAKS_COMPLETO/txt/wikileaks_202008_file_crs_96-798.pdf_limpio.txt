its incorporation of th senkakus diaoyus was an act apart from the sinojapanese war china argues that japan used its victory in the war to annex the islands china also argues that the intent of the allied declarations at cairo and potsdam during world war ii was to restore to china territories taken from it by japan through military aggression5 us administration of the islands 19531971 us

okinawa reversion treaty would affect the determination of sovereignty over the senkakus d iaoyus secretary of state william rogers answered that this treaty does not affect the legal status of those islands at all11 in his letter of october 20 1971 acting assistant legal adviser robert starr states the governments of the republic of ch ina and japan are in disagreement as to sovereignty over the senkaku islands you shoul d know as well that the peoples republic of china has also cla imed sovereignty over the islands the united states believes that return of administrative rights over those islands to japan from which the rights were received can in way prejudice any underlying claims the united states cannot add to the legal rights japan possessed before it transferred administra tion of the islands to us nor can the united states by giving back what it received d iminish the rights of other claimants the united states has ma claim to the senkaku islands and considers that any conflicting claims to the islands are matter for resolution by the parties concerned12 successive us administrations have restated this position of neutrality regarding the claims in the midst of the current tensions the state department and the us embassy in japan have reiterated this position13 the usjapan security treaty and the islands the inclusion of the senkakus diaoyus in the okinawa reversion treaty under the definition of the ryukyu islands and the da ito islands made article ii of the treaty applicable to the islands artic ii states that treaties conventions and other agreements concluded between japan and the united states of america including but without limitation the treaty of mutual cooperation nd security between japan and the united states of america become pplicable to the ryukyu islands and the daito islands as of the date of entry into force of this agreement using okinawa as shorthand for the territory covered by the treaty secretary of state rogers stated in his testimony before the foreign relations committee that the security treaty becomes applicable to okinawa the same as applied to the japanese home islands14 deputy secretary of defense david packard in his testimony stre ssed that japan would assume the primary responsibility for the defense of the treat area but that the security treaty was applicable15 in short while maintaining neutrality on the competing claims the united states agreed in the okinawa reversion treaty to apply the security treaty to the treaty area including the senkaku diaoyu islands it so should be noted that in ratifying thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96798crs5 treaty the senate did not act on the advice of several committee witnesses that it include in the instrument of ratification reservati ons concerning the senkakus moreover the security treaty itself declares in article v that each party would act in accordance with its constitutional provisions and processes in response to an armed attack in the territories under the administrati on of japan administrati on rather than sovereignty is the key distinction that applies to the islands since 1971 the united states and japan have not altered the app lication of the security treaty to the islands
