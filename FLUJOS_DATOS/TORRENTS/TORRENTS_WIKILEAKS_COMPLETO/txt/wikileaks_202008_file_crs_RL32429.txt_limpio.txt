law and legislative proposals updated november 12 2004 david l brumbaugh specialist in public finance government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress foreign investment and tax incentives analysis of current law and legislative proposals summary during 2004 major focus of the tax policy debate in congress was tax policy towards international income and investment major international tax legislation was approved by the full senate in may as s 1637 and by the house in june as hr 4520 in july the senate approved version of hr 4520 amended to include the language of s 1637 as passed in may in october both the senate and house passed conference agreement on hr 4520 the president signed the measure and it became public law 108357 the starting point for the legislation was longrunning dispute between the european union eu and the united states over the us extraterritorial income eti tax benefit for exports each of the bills address the dispute by proposing repeal of eti but repeal of eti raises additional tax policy questions for example if eti is repealed should alternative tax incentives be implemented for investment in the domestic economy in order to offset repeals employment effects and should legislation repealing eti be offset by tax relief for us multinational firms with an aim towards maintaining the competitive position of the united states in world markets sluggish domestic employment performance and concern over perceived increase in us firms substitution of foreign for domestic employment outsourcing have helped broaden the debate with some charging that the us tax system poses an incentive to invest abroad and others defending the positive impact of profitable overseas operations on us employment along with repealing eti both the house and senate versions of the eti bill addressed these broader questions with additional tax proposals that would affect international investment flows both the house and senate bills proposed mix of new tax benefits both for domestic and overseas investment another prominent eti bill considered in 2004 was hr 1769 which proposed replacing eti with tax benefit for domestic production this analysis looks at two questions that the policy debate addressed first what is the impact of the us tax system on the flow of investment abroad second what would be the impact of the principal legislative proposals on that flow it concludes that under current law the tax system poses patchwork of incentives and disincentives for overseas investment in some cases encouraging us firms to shift operations abroad in some cases discouraging overseas investment the overall net impact of the system on incentives defines generalization the legislative proposals considered in 2004 likewise contained mixture of tax incentives for domestic and foreign investment and whether they would on balance encourage overseas or domestic investment is not clear this report will not be

principal focus of the congressional tax policy debate in 2004 was the impact of the us tax system on firms international investment decisions at issue was how taxes affect firms decision to either expand operations in the united states or instead channel their investment resources to operations in foreign countries the debate began narrowly with focus on exports the us tax codes extraterritorial income eti exclusion provides us firms with tax benefit in the form of tax exemption for between 15 and 30 of their export profits depending on the nature of their production process in response to complaint by the european union eu series of world trade organization wto rulings held that the eti benefit violates the wto agreements prohibition of export subsidies in response to the rulings congress began consideration of legislation to repeal eti but repeal of eti raised additional tax policy questions for example if eti were to be repealed should alternative tax incentives be implemented for investment in the domestic economy in order to offset repeals employment effects and should legislation repealing eti be offset by tax relief for us multinational firms with an aim towards maintaining the competitive position of the united states in world markets sluggish domestic employment performance and concern over perceived increase in us firms substitution of foreign for domestic employment outsourcing have helped broaden the debate with some charging that the us tax system poses an incentive to invest abroad and others defending the positive impact of profitable overseas operations on us employment in keeping with the policy debate the congressional bills that addressed eti had scope that was considerably broader than repealing the export subsidy the most straightforward of the bills was hr 1769 which proposed to supplement etis repeal with just one additional provision tax deduction for domestic production in may 2004 the senate approved s 1637 which combined etis repeal with mix of tax changes some of which would benefit domestic investment and some of which favored foreign investment hr 4520 approved by the house in june likewise contained both provisions favoring domestic investment and proposals benefitting foreign investment the particulars of the bill approved by the full house differ in several respects from those of hr 2896 an eti bill approved by the ways and means committee in late 2003 its general thrust however is the same in july the senate passed its own version of hr 4520 amended to include the language of s 1637 as approved in may and in october both the house and senate approved conference agreement on hr 4520 it became pl 108357 crs2 the focus of this report is tax incentives it addresses two questions raised by the policy debate and the pending legislation what is the impact of the current us tax system on the flow of investment abroad and what would be the impact of the principal legislative proposals on that flow the discussion that follows begins by outlining the principal tax code provisions applying to international investment including jurisdictional principles the deferral benefit subpart f and the foreign tax credit the report continues by assessing the current tax systems impact on the incentive to invest at home or abroad it then evaluates the incentive effects of the most prominent legislative proposals in the current congress the final sections of the report rely on economic theory to identify the likely economic effects that result from the systems incentive effects the conclusions of the analysis are these first current us tax law presents patchwork of incentives disincentives and neutrality towards foreign investment that varies across firms and foreign locations the net aggregate impact of the system is uncertain each of the eti bills likewise contained mix of provisions some favoring domestic investment and others favoring foreign operations the likely net impact of the bills and of the measure that was ultimately enacted is also not clear before presenting this analysis in more detail we take brief look at the basic statutory provisions of the us tax system as it applies to international investment the us systems basic provisions at the heart of the us system for taxing international income is dichotomy depending on its circumstances firm may face either current us taxation of its foreign operations or an indefinite tax deferral the system begins with jurisdictional principle the united states taxes international income on the basis of residence rather than source or territoriality individuals who are us citizens or residents are generally subject to us tax on both their foreign and domestic income in the case of businesses corporations chartered in the united states us resident corporations are likewise subject to us tax on their worldwide income in contrast corporations chartered in foreign countries are not subject to us tax on their foreignsource income1 the statutory dichotomy follows from this jurisdictional principle if us chartered corporation conducts its foreign operations through branch that is not separately incorporated us taxes generally apply to the firms foreign income on current basis us taxes apply to income in the year it is earned in contrast if the firm operates through subsidiary corporation chartered in foreign country us taxes are deferred as long as the income remains in the hands of the subsidiary and is reinvested rather than repatriated feature of the system known as the deferral principle or simply deferral us taxes apply only when the foreign income is remitted to the us parent as dividends or other income thus reentering the us tax jurisdiction 1 they generally are however subject to us tax on their ussource income crs3 there are exceptions to deferral since 1962 the us tax codes subpart f provisions have denied deferral to income from certain types of investment primarily income from passive investment made through foreign corporations controlled by us stockholders or parent firms socalled controlled foreign corporations or cfcs along with certain other types of cfc income whose geographic source is thought to be easily manipulated2 under subpart f us stockholders of cfcs are subject to current us taxation on their cfcs subpart f income whether it is actually repatriated or not still the dichotomy remains with the current taxation of subpart f and branch income contrasting with the indefinite tax deferral of subsidiaries active business income another important feature of the system is the foreign tax credit whose function is to alleviate double taxation where current us taxes apply to foreign income for example with subpart f or branch income double taxation becomes potential problem host countries frequently apply their own taxes to inbound foreign investment and without some special provision overlapping tax jurisdictions would produce combined tax burdens sufficient to stifle at least some portion of investment flows like most countries the united states assumes the responsibility of relieving double taxation for its resident investors like many countries it does so with foreign tax credit under the credits provisions us investors are permitted to credit foreign taxes they pay against the us taxes they would otherwise owe on foreign source income the foreign tax credit contains number of complicating features first the credit is limited to us tax on foreign source income foreign taxes are not permitted to offset the portion of taxpayers us tax that applies to domestic income the limitation in effect places barrier between firms foreign and us income if firm pays foreign taxes at high rate it may have enough foreign tax credits to completely offset any us tax it owes on foreign income foreign taxes that exceed that amount however are not creditable in the current year and become excess credits in tax parlance3 while the foreign tax credits limitation restricts firms ability to credit foreign taxes phenomenon known as cross crediting can ease the limitations effect in some cases crosscrediting is phenomenon where firm credits excess credits generated by one investment against us taxes due on income from another investment for example firm may have one investment in country with low tax rates taken alone the firm would not have sufficient foreign tax credits to offset all us taxes due on the lightly taxed investment if however the firm also has heavily taxed foreign investment the firm may in some situations be able to cross credit the foreign taxes from the hightax investment against us taxes on the lightly taxed investment 2 passive investment is generally income from investments where the investor does not conduct and manage the production or business activity generating the income passive investment income is income such as interest dividends rents and royalties 3 foreign taxes that exceed the limit however can be carried back and used to offset us tax paid up to two years in the past and carried forward up to five years in the future crs4 while each taxpayer calculates single overall limitation for the bulk of its active business income the tax code specifies several types of income for which separate limitations must be calculated the purpose of the separate limitations baskets is to limit crosscrediting in manner similar to subpart f the types of income subject to separate baskets are generally income whose source is thought to be easily manipulated for example income from passive investment second complication is the indirect foreign tax credit under whose terms us parent firms are permitted to credit foreign taxes paid by their subsidiary corporations when the parent receives dividends from their overseas operations the credits are permitted for foreign taxes the subsidiaries have paid on the profits generating the repatriated dividends the indirect credit thus permits firms that use deferral to also utilize the foreign tax credit although the tax savings produced by the indirect credit are also delivered on deferred basis the logic of the indirect credit is that foreign taxes have reduced the pool of subsidiary income available for dividend payments and so would contribute to double taxation if not credited incentive effects of the system the basic structural features of the us tax system are thus its dichotomy between current taxation and deferral and the ability of taxpayers to credit foreign taxes subject to limitation we now look at the incentive effects of the system at the manner in which us taxes affect firms decisions to invest at home or abroad as we shall see the systems effects vary widely it can pose an incentive or disincentive towards overseas investment or it can be completely neutral the system defies generalization regarding its overall net impact on the decision to invest abroad whether us taxes on balance encourage or discourage overseas investment is not certain economic analysis of the systems incentives begins with the recognition that firms principal goal is to maximize profits after taxes taxes can therefore pose an incentive for firms to invest overseas if the tax burden abroad is lighter than the burden on identical investment in the united states alternatively taxes can pose disincentive towards foreign investment compared to investment in the domestic economy or taxes can be neutral towards the investment decision if the tax burden is the same on foreign investment as on identical domestic projects then taxes have impact on where firms employ their capital the incentives facing us investment abroad echo the twopart statutory structure of the us system outlined above with one pattern of incentives disincentives and neutrality applying where current us taxation applies and second structure facing us firms that use deferral we look at each in turn beginning with current taxation not because it is the most prevalent pattern but for expository convenience incentives where current taxation applies as described above current us taxation can apply where investment occurs through an overseas branch or where subpart f applies here the incentives facing new investment depend crs5 heavily on the foreign tax credit and on the tax rate imposed by the country in which investment occurs as we shall see investment in lowtax countries can face either tax neutrality or tax incentive depending on firms foreign tax credit situation investment in high tax countries faces either disincentive or tax neutrality again depending on the firms foreign tax credit situation the most straightforward situation is the case where firm has existing overseas investment and thus has existing excess foreign tax credits for example the case of firms first venture abroad where the firm has existing streams of income or taxes to complicate matters consider first prospective investment in country with low tax rates in this case foreign tax will offset some but not all of the firms us tax and some residual us liability will apply to the new investments income suppose for example the foreign tax rate is 10 while the us firm pays precredit us taxes at the 35 us corporate tax rate foreign tax credits will offset 10 percentage points and the firm will pay 10 percentage points of foreign tax and 25 percentage points of us tax the combined tax rate on investment in the lowtax country is thus 35 and while it consists of both foreign and us taxes it is equal to the tax rate on domestic investment thus where current taxation applies and firm has existing investment investment in lowtax countries faces tax neutrality and neither an incentive nor disincentive to invest abroad we look next at prospective investment by the same firm in country with high tax rates again keeping in mind that the firm has existing overseas investment here the investment would generate more than enough foreign tax credits to offset all us tax due on the new investment suppose for example the foreign tax rate were 50 the firm could use 35 percentage points of foreign tax to offset the entire us tax liability applicable to the new investment because of the foreign tax credits limitation as described above the prohibition against crediting foreign taxes against us tax on us income foreign taxes could not be credited in excess of the 35 percentage points and the remaining 15 percentage points of foreign tax would become noncreditable excess credits total taxes on the prospective investment would consist only of foreign taxes and would be paid at the 50 rate the firm would thus face disincentive to undertake the investment in the hightax country but this was firm with existing foreign investment if corporation has existing operations abroad cross crediting can complicate matters as described above cross crediting is where excess credits generated by one investment offset us tax on another to see how the phenomenon affects incentives suppose first that firm has existing foreign operations in hightax countries so that it has stock of available excess credits consider now prospective investment in lowtax country as seen above if this were the firms only investment residual us tax liability would apply and the investment would face tax neutrality if however the firm has excess credits from existing investments it may be able to use the excess credits to offset the residual us tax thus the only tax that would be due on the new investment after credits would be the low foreign tax and the firm would face tax incentive to undertake the investment cross crediting of the existing excess credits converts tax neutrality into an incentive crs6 cross crediting can also affect incentives in hightax countries where firm has existing investment in lowtax countries here the firm does not have sufficient foreign tax credits to offset all us tax on its existing investment and pays residual us tax firms in such situations are said to have deficit of foreign tax credits rather than excess credits however the firm can cross credit taxes it would pay on the prospective hightax investment against its residual us tax on existing lightly taxed investment the true cost of the new foreign taxes is reduced by each dollar of excess credits that can be used to offset existing us taxes at the limit if the firms existing foreign tax credit deficit is large enough to absorb all the new excess credits the effective tax burden on new investment in the hightax country can be reduced to rate equal to the us tax rate and the hightax investment is converted from position of tax disincentive to tax neutrality chart 1 below summarizes the incentive pattern for foreign investments the top three rows present the outcomes we have just described for currentlytaxed investment the first row shows the incentives facing firm without existing foreign investment income or taxes it faces disincentive in hightax countries and neutrality in low tax countries the second row shows the situation for firm with existing heavilytaxed foreign investment that has generated excess credit the firm faces disincentive in high tax countries and an incentive in lowtax countries the third row shows firm with lightly taxed existing foreign investment on which it pays residual us taxes it faces neutrality or reduced disincentive in high tax countries and neutrality in lowtax countries incentives under deferral while firm can postpone us tax on its foreign subsidiarys income by reinvesting it abroad us tax may ultimately be paid when the foreign income is repatriated as dividends or other income in this case however the economic principle of discounting is crucial discounting is the idea that given amount of taxes or funds in general matters less to firm the further in the future it is paid as long as dollar in tax payments can be postponed by firm the firm can invest the dollar and earn return thus under the deferral principle us taxes on subsidiary income recede in importance to firm in the case of funds reinvested abroad for long periods deferral becomes almost indistinguishable from an outright tax exemption for us firms using deferral foreign taxes are therefore the chief element of the total tax burden on foreign investment given the dominant role of foreign taxes it follows that where foreign taxes are low compared to us taxes on domestic investment firms have tax incentive to invest in the foreign country deferral is powerless to deliver tax benefit for investment in hightax countries since foreign tax credits would offset all us tax is any event firms that invest through subsidiaries thus face tax disincentive for hightax investment first consider the case of firm without existing investments here prospective hightax investment would generate more than enough foreign tax credits to offset any us tax there would be us tax left to defer the only tax burden would be the relatively heavy foreign tax and the investment would face tax disincentive cross crediting does not change the situation the last row of chart 1 recaps the incentive pattern under deferral disincentive in hightax countries and an incentive in lowtax countries crs7 table 1 tax incentive patterns for overseas investment under current law investment in hightax investment in lowtax countries countries us taxes apply on current basis existing foreign tax disincentive tax neutrality investment existing excess foreign tax credits existing foreign tax disincentive tax incentive investment with excess foreign tax credits existing foreign reduced disincentive or tax neutrality investment with residual tax neutrality us tax liability foreign tax credit deficit us taxes apply on deferred basis deferred us taxes tax disincentive tax incentive incentive impact of other us tax provisions in addition to provisions that apply directly to international investment deferral subpart f and the foreign tax credit other us tax provisions affect international investment flows indirectly because they apply differently to domestic and foreign investment in the current policy setting prime example is the eti benefit by definition an export is produced in the domestic economy an export tax benefit thus reduces the tax burden on domestic investment compared to foreign investment other examples are accelerated depreciation the expensing allowance for equipment investment and the research and experimentation tax credit each of these provisions reduces the tax burden on domestic investment compared to that of overseas investment and thus helps determine which foreign locations are hightax countries in relative terms and which are lowtax locations the provisions thus help determine the range of foreign locations where taxes pose incentives disincentives and neutrality respectively chart 1 is useful to see the impact of the provisions more precisely suppose for example the area within each of the hightaxlowtax cells were proportional to the share of overseas investment occurring in that circumstance in terms of the chart 1 then provisions such as eti and accelerated depreciation help determine the location of the center line in the chart and thus the proportion of countries posing tax disincentives on the one hand and incentives or tax neutrality on the other since the provisions each reduce the domestic tax burden compared to the foreign tax burden they each in effect shift the center line in the chart to the right increasing the range of countries crs8 presenting tax disincentive or neutrality and reducing the range posing tax incentive or neutrality equivalently the provisions increase the range of overseas investment compared to which domestic investment poses tax incentive as we see in the next section most of the individual elements in the pending legislative proposals can be evaluated in similar way incentive impact of legislative proposals as described at the outset of the report the principal tax bills in 2004 that addressed the eti controversy hr 1769 s 1637 the senate bill the house passed version of hr 4520 and pl 108357 would each repeal the export benefit but also contained additional provisions hr 1769 was the most straightforward it would have combined etis repeal with just one additional provision 10 tax deduction restricted to domestic production the initial house and senatepassed bills hr 4520 and s 1637 also proposed to implement their own set of tax benefits for domestic investment but also contained tax benefits for overseas investment the measure that was ultimately enacted in october contained blend of the house and senatepassed provisions several of the proposals that were enacted or considered would change the incentive situation confronting overseas investment in ways that are perhaps surprising given the complexity of the subject and the amount of attention the policy debate has given to incentives it is thus useful to look at the incentive impact of the bills most important elements carefully and in detail repeal of eti hr 1769 the senate bill the house bill and pl 108357 the eti benefit provides us firms with tax exemption of between 15 and 30 of their export profits depending on the particular nature of their production process by definition exports are produced in the country that exports an export tax benefit such as eti therefore provides an incentive for firms to invest in the united states rather than abroad repeal of eti would remove that incentive as in the preceding section we can use chart 1 to get more detailed idea of etis effect because it reduces the tax burden on domestic investment relative to foreign investment the provision shifts the divide between hightax and lowtax countries to the right etis repeal thus shifts the divide to the left increases the range of lowtax locations and reduces the number of hightax countries repeal of eti will thus increase the range of foreign locations for which taxes pose an incentive or neutrality and reduces those for which taxes pose disincentive or neutrality in isolation repeal of eti will likely increase the share of us firms investment that occurs abroad rather than in the united states indeed this particular aspect of etis repeal is generally accepted and is one rationale for the presence in each bill of provisions intended to provide incentives for domestic over foreign investment deduction or tax rate reduction for domestic production the senate bill the house bill hr 1769 and pl 108357 each of the three bills provided substantial new tax cut for income from domestic but not foreign investment the details of the benefit differed from bill to bill but in broad terms crs9 in terms of the size and nature of the benefit delivered the bills are quite similar as passed by the house hr 4520 would have phased in reduction of current laws top corporate tax rate of 35 initially to 34 and then to 32 for 2006 and thereafter as passed by the senate and as ultimately included in the conference agreements s 1637 proposed to phase in 9 deduction from taxable income hr 1769 proposed phasedin 10 deduction the deductions in hr 1769 and the senate and conference committee bills are the equivalent of reduction in the tax rate to 3185 and 315 respectively in the case of each bill the proposed benefit would be restricted to income from production activities occurring within the united states the incentive effect of each of the domestic benefits would be the reverse of etis repeal because the benefits would be restricted to domestic production they would reduce the tax burden on domestic but not foreign source income the benefit in isolation would thus pose an incentive for firms to invest in the domestic economy rather than abroad the proposals would thus reduce the range of countries constituting low tax investment locations and increase the number of high tax countries in terms of chart 1 the domestic benefits would shift the center line dividing high and lowtax countries to the right expanding the foreign locations posing tax disincentive for overseas investment and reducing the incidence of tax incentives or tax neutrality towards foreign locations4 the deductions provided by hr 1769 and s 1637 as passed by the senate contained special rule sometimes called haircut that strengthened the deductions incentive effect the provisions would be permanent under hr 1769 but would expire after 2012 under s 1637 the haircut reduced the size of firms deduction in proportion to the share of the firms production that occurs abroad for example if onequarter of the value of firms production occurs overseas its maximum deduction for domestic production income would be reduced from 10 9 under s 1637 to 75 10 minus 14 times 10 the haircut would magnify the domestic incentive or equivalently magnify the foreign disincentive because each additional foreign investment would diminish the deduction for domestic production the haircut was not included in the conference agreement that became pl 108357 other tax benefits for domestic investment the senate bill the house bill and pl 108357 while the rate reductions and production deductions are the largest taxcut provisions in each bill the house and senate bills along with the conference agreement also contained additional substantial tax cuts that applied to domestic but not foreign investment the provisions differed between the bills in the senate s 1637 would have extended temporary increase in the carryback period for net operating losses nols generally the amount by which 4 the magnitude of the shift would be similar but not identical among the bills again the deductions and rate reductions differ slightly in their size though all are in the neighborhood of 3 percentage point taxrate reduction in addition hr 1769 would reduce firms deduction in proportion to the extent of its overseas activity firm could not claim the bills full 10 deduction unless it has foreign production this feature would magnify the bills incentive for domestic over foreign production s 1637s deduction contains similar feature that would expire after 2012 crs10 firms allowable deductions for tax purposes exceeds its gross income under current law the carryback period is generally two years although the carryback was temporarily extended to five years for nols incurred in 2001 and 2002 s 1637 would also have extended the carryback period to five years in the case of nols arising in 2003 s 1637 would also extend the research and experimentation re tax credit through 2005 the credit is currently scheduled to expire at the end of june 2004 as described above the research credit is only available for investments in research and development made in the united states and would therefore increase firms incentive to invest in the domestic economy in the case of nols conversion of carryforwards into carrybacks as under the bill would likely accentuate the benefit firms receive from tax preferences such as accelerated depreciation that accrue primarily to domestic investment thus to the extent the nol provision has an incentive effect it would favor domestic investment here however since the provisions would only apply to nols arising in one year 2003 any incentive effect from the proposal would likely be limited neither the nol nor re credit provisions were included in the conference agreement in addition to its reduction of the top corporate tax rate the housepassed version of hr 4520 would have reduced the tax rates applicable to the lower and intermediate tax rates that apply to small and mediumsized corporate incomes also the bill extended for an additional two years an increase in the cap on the expensing tax benefit small firms can claim for investment in equipment under section 179 of the tax code the expensing allowance was only available for investment in the united states and while the reductions in the lower corporate tax rates would apply in principle to both domestic and foreign income the reduction would favor domestic investment simply because the us corporate tax rate applies more frequently to firms domestic income than foreign income each of these provisions would favor domestic over foreign investment the conference agreement did not contain the house bills ratecut provision but did extend the expensing allowance for two years in terms of chart 1 each of these provisions favoring domestic investment would shift the center line to the right reducing the range of lowtax countries where taxes pose an investment incentive or neutrality foreign tax credits interest allocation rules the senate bill the house bill and pl 108357 the single largest tax cut the bills proposed in the international area proposal that was included in the conference agreement was revision of current laws rules for allocating interest expense for purposes of the foreign tax credits limitation since the revision applies to the foreign tax credit its benefit accrues to multinational firms yet the proposal is prime example of how incentive effects can be surprising the change is likely to favor domestic rather than foreign investment in view of this surprising result and the provisions relatively large revenue impact it is useful to look at the analysis more closely the revision works as follows as described above the tax code limits the foreign tax credit to the portion of firms us precredit tax liability that applies to foreign rather than domestic income to calculate the limitation then taxpayers must separate their taxable income into that having foreign source and that with domestic source because taxable income consists of gross income generally crs11 revenue minus deductible costs the sourcing of taxable income requires in turn that taxpayer assign both items of income and deductible costs to either domestic or foreign sources for firms that have excess foreign tax credits and for whom the foreign tax credit limitation is binding constraint whether particular item of cost is assigned to us or foreign source can have an important impact on their aftercredit tax liability to illustrate if deduction is assigned to foreign rather than domestic source it is subtracted from foreign rather than us gross income and reduces foreign taxable income rather than us taxable income because foreign taxes are only permitted to offset us tax on foreign taxable income allocation of the deduction to foreign sources reduces the maximum amount of foreign taxes that firm can credit perhaps more straightforward way of viewing this effect is by recognizing that firms with excess credits have aftercredit us tax liability on foreign source income thus any deductions expenses allocated to foreign sources are powerless to reduce taxes further and are in effect lost the tax code and associated internal revenue service regulations contain elaborate rules governing the allocation of income and costs including rules governing the allocation of interest expense current law provides for the allocation of interest expense based on the proportion of the firms assets that are located abroad thus even if all of domestic firms borrowing is done in the united states part of its interest expense may be allocated abroad this is based on the notion that debt is fungible that regardless of where borrowing occurs it funds the totality of firms investment us firms have long complained about the operation of current laws interest allocation rules method of allocation known as waters edge under this method firms foreign assets consist only of those it owns directly for example the assets of foreign branch and the stock it owns in any foreign subsidiaries the foreign subsidiaries debtfinanced assets in other words are not included in the calculation in isolation this omission has the effect of reducing the amount of interest allocated to foreign sources and increases creditable foreign taxes but second feature of current allocation rules works in the opposite way none of foreign subsidiarys interest expense is included in the calculation or allocated to domestic sources such an inclusion could reduce domestic income and increase creditable foreign taxes mathematically the impact of omitting foreign interest is larger than that of omitting foreign assets so that on balance omitting foreign debt from the formula reduces creditable foreign taxes both hr 4520 and s 1637 proposed to substitute worldwide allocation regime for current laws waters edge rule change that was adopted in pl 108 357 under this method the interest costs of foreign subsidiaries would be explicitly included in the allocation formula and subsidiary assets would be included in the allocation formula on gross basis rather than netofdebt basis that is all of subsidiarys assets would be included in the allocation calculation not just the parents equity stake in isolation the first of these changes would increase firms foreign tax credits and reduce us taxes while the second would have the reverse effect on balance however the first effect would dominate and switching to the crs12 proposals worldwide allocation regime would increase firms foreign tax credits and reduce their aftercredit us taxes the revision will at the same time probably reduce the attractiveness of foreign investment again the amount of interest allocated to foreign sources is proportional to the share of firms assets that are located abroad this effect would be magnified under the proposal since all subsidiarys assets would be included in the calculation each additional foreign investment would thus increase foreign allocations of interest reducing firms foreign tax credits and increasing its after credit tax liability in effect this would increase the tax burden on new foreign investment in terms of the overall incentive structure it will expand the number of hightax countries and reduce the number of lowtax countries increasing the range of locations posing tax disincentive for investment and reducing the number of foreign locations posing tax incentive temporary tax rate reduction for repatriated foreign earnings the senate bill the house bill and pl 108357 notwithstanding the deferral principle income earned by foreign subsidiaries of us firms is ultimately subject to us taxes when it is repatriated to the us parent firm as dividends or other income foreign tax credits can offset some or all of the us tax under the indirect credit rules but residual us tax may be due after credits some commentators have argued that the imposition of us tax on repatriations acts as an impediment to the repatriation of funds and encourages us firms to reinvest foreign earnings abroad accordingly it is argued that reduction in the tax that occurs upon repatriation will stimulate an increase in repatriations for its part the senatepassed bill proposed temporary oneyear reduction in the corporate tax rate applicable to repatriated dividends to 525 from the 35 rate that would ordinarily apply as passed by the house hr 4520 proposed sixmonth 85 tax deduction for repatriated dividends deduction that would produce the equivalent of 525 rate for firm paying the top 35 rate without the deduction the conference agreement adopted the oneyear rate reduction what will be the likely impact of the rate reduction on investment incentives the rate reduction could possibly temporarily stimulate repatriations by firms with existing mature operations overseas thus reducing overseas investment at least temporarily5 but even if the rate reduction does stimulate repatriations there is little reason to believe that it would lead firms to increase their investments in the united states firms incentive to undertake new investment depends on the aftertax return to the prospective investment and the rate of return savers require of investments in the corporate sector the rate reduction alters neither of these parameters suggesting that any repatriated funds would more likely be paid out as dividends or used to reduce debt further if the rate reduction is viewed as provision that will be 5 however prominent theoretical analysis in the economics literature also suggests that if the tax cut is seen as permanent it will not make difference in firms repatriation behavior according to this line of reasoning repatriation taxes have impact on firms incentive to repatriate because the repatriation taxes must ultimately be paid regardless of whether the repatriation occurs in the present or in the future for more detailed discussion see crs report rl32125 tax exemption for repatriated foreign earnings proposals and analysis by david l brumbaugh crs13 renewed when its expiration date approaches it may actually increase overseas investment compared to domestic investment permanent reduction of the tax due upon repatriation would increase the aftertax return on overseas investment compared to domestic investment albeit on deferred basis if the proposal is accepted as temporary however it is not likely to alter investment incentives consolidation of separate foreign tax credit limitations baskets house bill pl 108357 as described above taxpayers are required to calculate separate foreign tax credit limitations for certain types of income the purpose of the separate baskets is to limit cross crediting the types of income subject to separate baskets includes income whose source is thought to be easily manipulated or that are typically subject to either unusually high or unusually low tax rates under current law nine separate limitations apply including an overall limitation that applies to most active business income partial list of the remaining baskets includes income from passive investment income subject to high foreign withholding taxes financial services income and shipping income as passed by the house hr 4520 proposed to reduce the number of baskets to two general income category and passive income category this provision was included in the conference agreement its impact will likely be to increase opportunities to cross credit foreign tax credits that is to credit excess credits generated by one stream of income against us taxes on another stream of income that was formerly in different basket the impact of the revision will also probably be to reduce the tax burden on new overseas investment where cross crediting can be used for firm using deferral expanded crosscrediting could reduce the residual us tax liability that applies to dividends upon repatriation albeit on deferred basis the provision will thus probably accentuate deferrals incentive for investment in lowtax countries under both current law and hr 4520 however active income is placed in common basket it is thus likely that the consolidation of baskets could apply more frequently to investment that is passive in nature and is thus subject to current taxation under subpart f for investment subject to current taxation rather than deferral we return to the analysis above see the discussion beginning on page 4 above of incentive patterns if firm has excess credits the enhanced cross crediting would convert some instances of tax neutrality into tax incentives for firm has deficit of credits the cross crediting would convert some disincentives for hightax investment into neutrality6 in isolation the proposal would likely expand overseas investment expanded carryover for foreign tax credits senate bill pl 108 357 where firms foreign tax credits exceed us tax on foreign income the credits can be carried back and used to offset precredit us tax if any on foreign income from the two preceding years if the carryback reduces the firms after credit tax liability from either of carryback years it will receive tax refund if the 6 in terms of chart 1 the proposal would shrink the range of investments contained in the cells of the charts first row where crosscrediting occurs and expands the volume of investment in the second and third rows crs14 carryback does not exhaust firms excess credits the credits can be carried forward and used to offset precredit us tax in the five succeeding years s 1637 proposed to shorten the carryback period to one year but lengthen the carryforward period to 20 years the conference agreement shortened the carryback period to one year but extended the carryforward period to only 10 years many multinationals will probably register change from the provision including firms without excess credits but also firms that have always had excess credits in the past and that expect to always have excess credits in the future among these latter firms the change will likely make difference since their excess credits would expire regardless of the length of the carryforward period thus the impact of the proposal will likely be concentrated among firms that currently have substantial excess credits but expect to move to deficitofcredits position in the future in the long run the proposal will likely be most important for firms that move into and out of excess credit positions most affected firms will probably register an increase in creditable foreign tax credits under the provision although some may register reduction due to the plans shortened carryback period7 this increase in creditable foreign taxes will likely have an impact on incentives similar to that of the consolidation of limitation baskets for firms using deferral it will accentuate the existing incentive for investment in low tax incentives for firms subject to current taxation it would convert some instances of neutrality into incentives and disincentives into neutrality the effect of the carryforwards extension may in some cases be the opposite of that of temporary tax cut for repatriations suppose for example firm that has earnings produced by foreign subsidiary has excess credits that it expects to expire shortly because of the fiveyear carryforward limitation the firm may be induced to accelerate the date on which it repatriates the subsidiarys earnings so as to utilize foreign tax credits before they expire extension of the carryforward would relax this inducement and might lead the firm to reinvest income abroad rather than repatriate it recharacterization of domestic losses house bill senate bill and pl 108357 the us tax code contains special loss carryforward rules that interact with the foreign tax credit provisions in way that can under current law increase the tax liability of firm whose domestic operations incur losses the loss rules work as follows if firms allowable deductions in particular year exceed its gross revenue it registers negative amount of taxable income or loss for tax purposes termed net operating loss or nol nols can be carried back and deducted from positive taxable income if any in the preceding two years nols not used as carrybacks can be carried forward up to 20 years deductible carrybacks generate tax refunds carryforwards generate tax savings in the future year to which they are carried 7 for example firm that currently anticipates carrying back excess to the second preceding year would either lose its carriedback credits if it anticipates being in an excess credit position indefinitely or would be able to use them only on deferred basis as the carrybacks are converted to carryforwards crs15 if firm incurs tax loss with respect to its domestic operations the loss reduces foreignsource taxable income thus reducing the firms precredit us tax on foreign income however as described above in the discussion of the interest allocation rules where firms have excess credits deductions allocated to foreign source income do not generate tax savings and are in effect lost at the same time deduction of the loss absorbs an equal amount of the firms potential nol carryforward and thus reduces the tax savings the firm would ultimately realize in the future year to which the nol would be carried in effect prior to enactment of pl 108357 the foreign tax credit rules deny the use of some or all of the firms nol carryforward the house senate and conference bills alike permit taxpayers that incur domestic nol in particular year to recharacterize portion of ussource income earned in future years as foreignsource income the provision limits the amount of income that could be recharacterized to 50 of firms ussource income while the purpose of the provision is to compensate for the treatment of domestic nols the incentive impact of the plan will likely fall on overseas investment since the bills actual rule change applies to foreign tax credits it increases creditable foreign taxes for firms with excess credits as with the foreign tax credit carryovers the provisions effect will be similar to that of cross crediting it will permit excess credits from new heavilytaxed foreign investment to offset us tax due on other streams of income or it will permit excess credits from existing investment to offset us tax on lightlytaxed foreign investment where deferral applies the proposal will thus accentuate the existing tax incentive for lowtax investment where current taxation applies the proposal will convert tax disincentive into neutrality or tax neutrality into an incentive net impact of proposals the preceding section describing the incentive effects of the current us tax system concluded that the overall net effect of the system on incentives is ambiguous8 the different elements of the system have different effects in different contexts so that the average impact of us taxes on the decision to investment at home or abroad is uncertain even given the preceding analyses of the incentives in the three eti bills however we can reach more definite conclusion regarding current legislation it is not clear whether any of the bills would on balance increase firms incentive to invest abroad pose an incentive to invest in the domestic economy or produce net impact in either direction from the preceding analysis of incentives it is clear that each bill contains both provisions that would favor foreign investment or disfavor domestic investment and proposals that would favor domestic investment the net overall impact of each bill thus depends on the relative magnitude of the changes in either direction 8 see the section entitled incentive effects of the current system above crs16 definitive assessment of the magnitude of each change and an assessment of the net impact of the bills would depend first on estimates of the bills impact on what economists term the rental cost of capital concept that measures the rate of return corporate investments must earn before taxes in order to generate the rate of return after taxes that is required by savers according to economic theory the rental cost is the parameter to which firms respond in making investment decisions in addition the bills impact would depend on the amount of investment affected by each provisions change in the rental cost such rental cost and capital stock estimates for bill as large and complex as those at hand is not attempted here as substitute measure of the bills impact on investment it is informative to examine estimates of impact of the bills on tax revenues comparing the expected impact of those provisions that favor foreign investment with the effect of those favoring domestic investment as we shall see however such measures likewise yield firm conclusions regarding the bills net impact on investment in examining the proposals revenue impact for each bill we look at the average annual revenue impact of the bills most important components comparing the revenue effect of those favoring domestic investment with the impact of those favoring foreign investment to compare the different provisions on an even footing we include only those years for which the provisions are on an even footing also we include estimates for temporary provisions such as temporary extension of the research credit and extension of fiveyear carryback for tax losses thus the comparisons are not accurate if its is assumed that the provisions will not be extended the comparison of the bills different elements is most straightforward for hr 1769 since it only contains two provisions repeal of eti and new domestic production deduction detailed revenue estimates are not available for the bill but the its sponsors have stated that the revenue gain from repeal of eti would match the revenue loss from its new tax deduction an outcome that appears reasonable given estimates of similar measures in the other bills while at first glance it might therefore appear that hr 1769 would have neutral impact on incentives the haircut provision associated with its deduction the provision that reduces the bills deduction for firms with overseas income suggests at least the possibility that the deduction would produce more powerful incentive effect for marginal domestic investments than etis repeal9 the house senate and conference committee bills have more varied mix of provisions so we look at the bills separately beginning with s 1637 the senate bill according to calculations using revenue estimates by the joint committee on taxation the average annual revenue impact of those provisions reviewed in this report that probably favor foreign investment or as with etis repeal disfavoring domestic investment sums to 79 billion the annual revenue impact of provisions favoring domestic investment totals 198 billion in the case of the house bill the average annual revenue impact of provisions favoring foreign investment is 81 9 for more rigorous analysis of the haircut provision see crs report rl32103 comparison of tax incentives for domestic manufacturing in current legislative proposals by jane g gravelle crs17 billion the revenue impact of provisions favoring domestic investment is 128 billion for the conference agreement the annual revenue impact of foreign investment provisions averages an estimated 90 billion the average for domestic provisions is 127 billion thus in the case of the conference agreement as well as the house and senate bills the revenue impact of provisions favoring domestic incentives appears larger than those favoring foreign investment10 but too much uncertainty still remains to conclude that all of the bills would favor domestic investment and would thus increase domestic investment compared to current law most importantly large portion of the revenue impact measures the impact of the tax law changes on investment that is already in place inframarginal investment in the language of economics for example the largest revenue impact in the bills would result from reductions in tax rates or from provisions that have the same impact as rate reductions here the bills rate reductions would reduce the tax liabilities that apply to the current and future revenue streams from investments that firms have already placed in service while revenue estimates necessarily include this effect any impact on inframarginal investments is reflective of changes investments since the decisions leading to those investments have already been made other important provisions that may have large inframarginal effects include the temporary extension of the nol carryback and the reduced tax rates for lower corporate incomes summary and implications the analysis here has focused on the incentive impact of current tax laws and pending legislative proposals while it reached definite conclusion regarding the net impact of the proposals it is nonetheless informative to conclude by looking briefly at economic theorys understanding of why the international investment incentives examined here matter economic theory provides framework for evaluating taxes on international investment flows first when taxes affect where capital is employed they can also affect capitals efficiency when taxes do not distort firms decisions on whether to invest at home or abroad when taxes are neutral firms will employ their capital in the most productive location and thus promote economic efficiency tax system that is neutral in this fashion is said in tax parlance to promote capital export neutrality since capital is employed in the most productive way possible under this standard world economic welfare is maximized 10 note also that several temporary provisions specifically the nol extension and increased expensing amount would only be in effect for one year however since both provisions change the timing rather than amount of taxes shifting tax revenues from the present into the future oneyear snapshot of their revenue impact during the year of implementation would overstate their relative impact compared to other provisions that do not depend on timing thus we have included the revenue impact of these oneyear provisions during the entire estimating window in strict sense then their revenue estimates show the impact of oneyear implementation of the provisions crs18 tax policies that promote national welfare here the welfare of the united states can diverge from those that maximize world economic welfare specifically if country is large exporter of capital as is the united states national economic welfare can be increased by tax policy that discourages to some extent the export of capital such tax policy is termed national neutrality and applies higher taxes to overseas investment than to investment in the united states finally those that support the competitive position of us multinationals abroad support policy under which foreign investment is not taxed so as to place us firms on the same footing as competitors from other countries such policy has not been accepted in the mainstream of the economics literature11 the location of the current system in the this framework is not clear so to is the likely impact of the proposals as described above the existing system presents patchwork of incentives disincentives and neutrality whether the system is more consistent with capital export neutrality national neutrality or an exemption system is not clear because of this uncertainty even if analysis had produced definite conclusion regarding the impact of the proposals on investment the impact of the bills on efficiency would still be uncertain for example if it were certain that all of the bills would domestic investment it would still be unclear whether they would move the system towards the point at which national welfare is maximized or beyond it there is point in other words beyond which providing additional tax inducements for domestic investment or disincentives for foreign investment reduces the pretax productivity of capital to such an extent that even national welfare is diminished by additional distortions favoring domestic investment in addition to efficiency the location in which an economys capital resources are used can affect the distribution of income shares in the economy generally the larger the share of capital employed within the domestic economy the higher is the capitallabor ratio the higher is labor productivity and the higher are labor earnings thus the larger the portion of the capital stock that is employed in the domestic economy the larger the share of income that accrues to labor rather than capital here too the impact of the bills is not clear 11 for thorough review of the economics
