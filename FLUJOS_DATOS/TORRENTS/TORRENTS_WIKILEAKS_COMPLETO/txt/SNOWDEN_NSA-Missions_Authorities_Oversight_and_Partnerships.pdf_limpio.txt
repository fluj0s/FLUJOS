balance between our need for security and preserving those freedoms that make us who we are that means reviewing the authori ties of law enforcement so we can intercept new types of communication but also build in privacy protections to prevent abuse president obam may 23 2013 in his may 2013 address at the national defense university the president made clear that we as government need to review the surveillance authorities used by our law enforcement and intelligence community professionals so that we can collect information nee ded to keep us safe and ensure that we are undertaking the right kinds of privacy protections to prevent abuse in the wake of recent unauthor ized disclosure s about some of our key intelligence collection programs president oba ma has directed that as much in formation as possi ble be made public while mindful of the need to protect sources methods and national security acting under that guidance the administration has provided enhanced transparency on and engaged in robust public discussion about key intelligence collection programs undertaken by the national security agency nsa this is important not only to foster the kind of bate the president has called for but to correct inaccuracies that have appeared in the media and elsewhere this document is step in that process and is imed at providing vxfflqfwgh vfulswlr qri1 6v mission authorities

and counterintelligence purposes nsa performs this mission by engaging in the collection of ³vljqdovlqwhool jhqfhzklf ktxlw holwhudoolvwkh production of foreign intelligence through the collection processing and analysis of communications or other data passed or accessible by radio wire or other electromagnetic means every intelligence activity nsa undertakes is necessarily constrained to these

authority by which nsa collects retains analyzes and disseminates foreign signals intelligence information the principal application of this authority is the collection of communications by foreign persons that occur wholly outside the united st ates to the extent person located outside the united states communicates with someone inside the united states or someo ne inside the united states communicates with person located outside the united st ates those c ommunications could also be collected collection pursuant to eo 12333 is c onducted through various mea ns around the globe largely from outside the u nited states which is not ot herwise regulated by fisa intelligence activities conducted under this author ity are carried out in accordance with minimization procedures established by the secretary of defense and approved by the attorney general to undertake collections authorized by eo 12333 nsa use s variety of methodologies regardless of the sp ecific authority or collection source nsa applies the process described below 3 1 nsa identifies foreign entities persons or organizations that have information responsive to an identifie d foreign intelligence requirement for instance nsa works to identify individuals w ho may belong to terrorist network 2 nsa develops wkh³ qhwzrunzlwkwhich that shuvrqru rujdqldwlrqvinformation is shared or the command and control structure through which it flows in other words if nsa is t racking specific terrorist nsa will endeavor to determine who that person is in contact with and who he is taking direction from 3 nsa identifies how the foreign entities communi cate radio email telephony etc 4 nsa then i dentifies the telecommunications infrastructure used to transmit those communications 5 nsa identifies vulnerabilities in the methods of c ommunication used to transmit them 6 nsa matches its collection to those vulnerabilities or develops new capabilities to acquire communications of inter est if needed this proc ess will often involve the collection of communications metadata data that helps ns understand where to find valid foreign intelligence information nee ded to protect us national security interests in large and complicated global network for instance the collection of overseas communications metadata associated with telephone calls such as the telephone numbers and time and duration of calls allows nsa to m ap communications between terrorists and their associates 7klvv wudwhjkhosvhqvxu hwkdw16vfroohf wlrqof communications content is more precisely focused on only those targets necessary to respond to identified foreign intelligence requirements nsa uses eo 12333 uthority to collect foreign intelligence from communications systems around the world due to the fragility of these sources providin g any significant detail outside of classified channels is damaging to national security nonetheless every type of collection undergoes strict oversight and compliance process internal to nsa that is conducted by entities within nsa other than those responsible for the actual collection fisa collection fisa regulates certain types of foreign intelligence collection including certain collection that occurs with compelled assistance from us telecommunications companies given the techniques that nsa must employ when conducting 16 vforeign intelligence mission nsa quite properly relies on fisa authorizations to acquire significant foreign intelligence information and will work with the fbi and other agencies to connect the dots betwe foreign based actors and their activities in the us the fisa court plays an impor tant role in helping to ensure that signals intelligence collection governed by fisa is conducted in conformity with the requirements of the statute all three branches of the us gove rnment have responsibilities for programs condu cted under fisa and key role of the fisa court is t ensure that activities conducted pursuant to fisa authorizations are consistent with t he statute as well as the us constitution including the fourth amendment fisa section 702 under section 702 of the fisa nsa is authorized to target nonus persons who are reasonably believed to be located outside the united states the principal application of this 4 authority is in the collection of communications by foreign persons that utilize us communications service providers the united st ates lvdsu lqflsd okxel qwkhz ruogv telecommunications system and fisa is designed to allow the us gove rnment to ac quire foreign intelligence while protecting the civil liberties and privacy of americans in general section 702 authorizes the attorney general and director of national intelligence to make and submit to the fisa court written certifications for the purpose of acquiring foreign intelligence information upon the issuanc of an order by the fisa court pproving such certification and the use of targeting and minimization procedures the attorney general and director of national intelligence may jointly authorize for up to one year the targeting of nonunited st ates persons reasonably believed to be located overseas to acquire foreign intelligence information the collection is acquired through compelled assistance from relevant electronic communications service providers nsa provides specific identifiers for example email addr esses telephone numbers used by nonus persons over seas who the government believes possess communi cate or are likely to receive foreign intelligence information author ized for collection under an approved certification once approved those identifiers are used to select communi cations for acquisition service providers are compelled to assist nsa in acquiring the communications associated with those identifiers for variety of reasons including technical ones the communications of us persons are sometimes incidentally acquired in targeting the foreign entities for example us person might be courtesy copied on an email to or from legitimate foreign target or person in the us might be in contact with know n terrorist target in those cases minimization procedures adopted by the attorney general in consultation with the director of national intelligence and approved by the foreign intelligence surveillance court are used to protect the privacy of the us person these minimization procedures control the acquisition retention and dissemination of any us person information incidentally acquired during operations conducted pursuant to section 702 the collection under faa section 702 is the most significant tool in the nsa collection arsenal for the detection identifica tion and disruption of terrorist threats to the us and around the world one notable example is the najibullah zazi case in early september 2009 while monitoring the activities of qaeda terrorists in pakistan nsa note d contact from an indivi dual in the us that the fbi subsequently identified as coloradobased najibullah zazi the us intelligence community including the fbi and nsa worked in concert to determine his relationship with qaeda as well as identify any foreign or domestic terrorist links the fbi tracked zazi as he traveled to new york to meet with coconspirators where they were planning to conduc t terrorist attack zazi and his c oconspirators were subseque ntly arrested zazi pled guilty to conspiring to bomb the new york city subway system the faa section 702 collection against foreign terrorists was critical to the disc overy and disruption of this threat to the us fisa title i nsa relies on title i of fisa to conduc t electronic surveillance of foreign powers or their agents to include members of international terrorist organizations except for certain narrow 5 exceptions specified in fisa specific court order from the foreign intelligence surveillance court based on showing of probable cause is required for this type of collection collection of us person data there are three additional fisa authorities that nsa relies on after gaining court approval that involve the acquisition of communications or information about c ommunications of us persons for foreign intelligence purposes on which additional focus is appropriate these are the business r ecords fisa provision in section 501 also known by its section number ing within the patr iot act as section 215 and sections 704 and 705b of the fisa business records fisa section 215 under 16 vbusiness records fisa program or br fisa first approved by the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc in 2006 an d subseque ntly reauthorized during two different administrations four different congresses and by 14 federal judges specified us telecommunications providers are compelled b court order to provide nsa with i nformation about telephone calls to from or withi n the us the information is known as metadata and consists of information such as the called and calling telephone numbers and the date time and duration of the call but user identification content or cell site locational data the purpose of this particular collection is to identify the us nexus of foreign terrorist threat to the homeland the government cannot conduct substantive queries of the bulk r ecords for any purpose other than counterterrorism under the fisc orders

in 12 of those cases br fisa played role every search into the br fisa database is auditable and all three branches of our government hhuflvhryhuvljkwry hu16vxvhriwklvdxwkrulw fisa sections 704 and 705b fisa section 704 authorizes the targeting of us person outside the us for foreign intelligence purposes if there is probable cause to believe the us person is foreign power or is an officer employee or agent of foreign power this requires specific individual court order 6 by the foreign intelligence surveillance court the collection must be conducted using techniques not ot herwise regulated by fisa section 705b permits the attorney general to approve similar collection against us person who is already the subject of fisa court order obtained pursuant to s ection 105 or 304 of fisa the probable cause standard has in these cases already been met through the fisa court order process the essential role of corporate communications providers under all fisa and faa programs the government compels one or more providers to assist nsa with the collection of information re sponsive to the foreign intelligence need the government employs covernames to describe its collection by source some that have been revealed in the press recently include fairview blarney oakstar and lithium while some have tried to characterize the involvement of such prov iders as separate programs that is not accurate the role of providers compelled to provide assistance by the fisc is identified separately by the government as specific facet of the lawful collection activity the essential role of foreign partners nsa partners with well over 30 different nations in order to conduct its foreign intelligence mission in every case nsa does not and will not use relationship with foreign intelligence service to ask tha t service to do wha t nsa is itself prohibited by law from doing these partnerships are an important part of the us and allied defense against terrorists cyber threat actors and others who threaten our individual and collective security both parties to these relationships benefit one of the most successful sets of international partnerships for signals intelligence is the coalition that nsa veloped to support us and allied troops in iraq and afghanistan the combined efforts of as many as 14 nations provide d signals intelligence support that sa ved us and allied lives b helping to identify and neutralize extremist threats across the breadth of both battlefields the senior us commande r in iraq credited signals intelligence with bein g prime reason for the significant progress made by us troops in the 2008 surge directly enabling the removal of almost 4000 insurgents from the ba ttlefield scope and scale of nsa collection according to figures published by major tech provider the internet carries 1826 petabytes of information per day in its foreign intelligence mission nsa touche s about 16 of that how ever of the 16 of the data only 0025 is actually selected for review the net effect is that nsa dqdovwvorrndw riwkh zruogvwu diilflqfrqgxf wlqjwkhlupl vvlrq wkdwvoh vvwkdqrqh part in million put another way if standard basketball cour t represented
