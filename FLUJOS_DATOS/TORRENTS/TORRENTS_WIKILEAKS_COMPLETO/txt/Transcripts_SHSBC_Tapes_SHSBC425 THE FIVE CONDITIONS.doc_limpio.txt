the five conditions lecture given on 25 may 1965 thank you whats the date audience twentyfive twentyfive may ad 15 saint hill special briefing course meter with gray face isnt that interesting looking meter all right i have little bulletinbulletin to give you couple of bulletins and one of those bulletins is that mary sue is late today now theres rumor going about that if youre being processed in the hgc as student you cant come to lectures or something like that thats false let give you cluethis is the little bulletin you have ill give you clue on the way we have to operate in scientology if it isnt written it isnt true and you just put that down and youll get along fine in organizations and everyplace else if it isnt written it isnt true somebody says this that and the other thing you say well have you got it in writing and they say well as matter of fact something well then it isnt true and thats that this by the way had to come into being the first place i know of it was when we were down at 2600 hoover in angeles in 1950 and people used to walk in off the street and say ron said to give fifty hours of processing or something like that and by george they would theres very often some misunderstood statement or rumor line or something like this is passed on verbally and frankly iteven if it was uttered verbally it should have been in writing so once more if it isnt written it isnt true you find out that when things are moving very fast whole bunch of verbal orders will get mixed up in the thing that other people arent aware of and suddenly why nobody in the organization can agree with anybody else because the verbal orders are standing in the road of everything and it just all breaks down so you have to have that rule and you have to make it stick now the other one is that saint hill had to be declared in condition now declaration of condition is something new and you will soon find it applying to the course and the bulletins are all practically writtenthe policy letters are all practically written on this but i havent had chance to finish them up or sign them or something of the sort but weve been using this nevertheless for some little time and that is strictly condition is an operating state organizationally its an operating state and oddly enough in the mest universe there are several formulas connected with these operating states and it for instance england the british government knew these or the united states government knew these they wouldnt get into very much trouble but as it is they dont know them and they get into great deal of trouble there are apparently certain formulas which have to be followed in this universe or you go appetite over tin cup ill give you an idea of the emergency formulathe emergency formula of course were more accustomed to being in state of emergency on this planet than we are in any other state and nevertheless there is certain way that you handle an emergency and an emergency status is declared simply and only by down statistic that is to say the statistics went down and it doesnt matter what statistics if they were supposed to go up and they went down why thats an emergency now the reverse can take place the reverse can take place lets take the number of students in unit lets say it keeps going up and it kept going up and it doesnt go down do you see then obviously the students arent being graduated from the unit at the same rate theyre being put into the unit so there must be slowdown in that unit of some kind or another so that will create state of emergency too so its the desirable statistic has not been attained and the statistic which should go down goes up or the statistic which should goes up goes down now lets take the gross income of an organization at large that has to do with let us say drop and its consistent drop one week we dont pay any attention to it two weeks we start paying an attention to three weeks why and then we jolly well pay an attention to it dont you see and if it consistently does this in an organization and shows down down down for four consecutive weeks we declare them in state of emergency now the declaration is issued by secretarial executive director which is positive order in other words its written posted order people are not left in the dark concerning this state of emergency you just had unit on this course go into state of emergency now there are several policy letters connected with this which i wont particularly bother to delineate but there are certain actions which one has to undertake when state of emergency is declared the first of these actions is well you can say promotethat applies to an organization to an individual youd better besay produce thats the first action regardless of any other action regardless of anything else why that is the first thing they have to put their attention on very often you will find out that the moment that the emergency was noticed well lets take you you find your money is going downhill at great rate and youre not getting as much money in as you should have been getting in and theres less and less money and so forth well you actually are in state of emergency now the proper thing to do according to mr wilson thetan that wandered in from someplace well he did he had an ambition to end britain and thats libel and slander so well have to cut it off the tape but anyway he really made this statement he says england should be fourthclass power and hes making his postulate you didnt know that he said that oh yes man thats matter of publicized public statement made right after leaving the united states before he was elected anyhow hes making it but now you see he finds the organization called the government in poor state economically so he economizes the united states government does this all the time as soon as they find out that their treasury balance doesnt equal their squidawoof and the ideas of the secretary of the treasury that he just got from the first cell of the communist party or wherever it isor wherever they get their ideas the united states government you know runs its economics today straight off karl marxs das kapital if you dont believe it read das kapital if you can now that sounds awfully rabblerouse and very extreme but it happens to be very banal statement its even been noticed by the wall street journal the formula of economics in das kapital is from each according to his ability to pay and to each according to his need socialism thats the formula of taxation contained in karl marxs das kapital written about 1879 something like that see and the governments of the world are following this today and these capitalistic governments are having ball with this well now supposing when they find that theyre going broke they economize supposing they take that as their first step ahhhhh every time they recover from an emergency they will be smaller and less able if thats all they do do you follow they have violated this actual formula of emergency there is an actual formula of emergency it does exist in this universe its in the woof and warp of the universe itself and its first line isits first line isthe first broad big action which you take is promote you better jolly well promote and that carries with it on the part of an individual or factory the idea that he better make his intentions known and so on now after you have promoted and after youve got that well in hand you economize but you have to do that first dont bother about economy bother about promoting exactly what is promotion well look it up in the dictionary its making things known its getting things out its getting oneself known getting ones products out or something like this in the form of an artist the ideahe finds heshis statistics are shot he suddenly looks up one day and the bank balance is down to nothing and that sort of thing and the landlord is camping on the first landing and so forth well heshe must first and foremost promote he better take those three academy paintings that he was busy dabbling with and he better sit up all night long and finish those things real fast he better wrap all those other paintings that hed already finished he better get them off to gallery awful quick and he better call up press boy of some kind or another and say i am having an exhibition see and it didnt matter how many pounds shillings or pence he had to borrow to make the phone calls or put the ad in the paper or get asome literature printed that he was having an exhibit you see that didnt matter promote man lets get it up there lets get it out there lets get the lines straightened up see huuh now economize you follow and thenim giving you the very rough formula and then hes got to prepare to deliver now he actually during his promotion could have sold half dozen paintings well then he economizes and then he paints them and delivers got the idea so its in that action and when you find your statistic is down you first have to promote and when you got your promotion well in hand then you better economize and then you jolly well better prepare to deliver and thats the onetwothree if you do it backwards youve had it now theres another condition known as affluence and this is one of the most dangerous conditions there is and nobody recognizes it as such lets takelets take some fellow on the south side of the northeast side of lower chicago and hes always been going along with twentyfive cents in his pocket that was about the most money he ever had in his pocket and all of sudden he gets in crap game and he wins ten thousand dollars well whats his normal operation whoa huh i remember famous movie victor mclaglen paidplayed in that showed beautiful rendition of this it was the informer and hes paid huge sum of money for turning in one of his fellow irish republican army soldiers and he just blows this dont you see its marvelous example the first impulse somebody gets when they get that much is tois to get very rich indeed so whats this fellow on the lower east side of south chicagos lower north sidewhats this fellow do oh well he buys himself house the future payments of which are going to be 175 month he buys himself car the future payments of which are going to be hes got all the down payments for these things you see he buys himself watch he lays out bunch of clothes that he doesnt need and he neglects to pay off anybody that he owes and his ten thousand dollars is gone he now owes another twenty thousand and he hasnt got prayer of paying that off hes violated the condition of affluence and the state of affluence formula has been definitely wildly violated now the first thing you must do in affluence is economizejust right now you got ten thousand bucks you didnt expect it from anyplace you didnt know it was going to be there and so forth just quickly cover it up with your hat and economize say where are we wasting money bang you must just at once and then make very very very sure that you dont buy anything that has any future commitment to it dont buy anything with any future commitments dont hire anybody with any future commitments nothing see thats all part of that economy clamp it down get every bill that you can possibly scrape up from anyplace every penny you owe anywhere under the sun moon and stars and pay them pay every bill is your next big broad step pull everything down in all directions until youve got it down to as close to zero as you can get or zero now invest the remainder in service facilities make it more possible to deliver see service facilities and part of the formula is to discover what caused the condition of affluence and strengthen it you see move your operation or what your life or youre doing and so forth slightly over so that it admits this zone and area of affluence now if you do those things and so forth why life will look like dream but you notice that the condition of emergency if handled at the beginning with economy would inhibit getting out anything in order to produce enough money to raise the statistic so if you went into condition of emergency and economized instantly you either might always remain in this condition of emergency or if you recovered from it you would find your organization was smaller or you were smaller or you had less scope because you have applied the state of affluence formula to the condition of emergency and all youve got to do is misapply one of these formulasbe in condition b and say youre in condition or continuing condition when you have moved into condition b in other words be operating on the wrong formulaand youll wrap the organization up youll wrap it up and part of the emergency formula since these things will be published in great detail actually theres about thirteen steps to one of these formulas there are certain major points these are the ones im taking up if for instance you didntyou went into condition of emergency and then you didnt changeafter youd promoted you didnt make any changes in your operationwell you just head for another condition of emergency see so that has to be part of it you better change your operating basis you better do something to change the operating basis because that operating basis led you into an emergency so you sure better change it but affluenceaffluence you must have been doing something awful right to get in that much money well you jolly well better discover what it is thats the search that you go into at its proper numbered slot you go into search and overhaul anything and review it all after youve provided some service facilities and youre straightened up and thats the end of all of that big kettle of money that came in then you had just better looklooklooklooklooklook what the devil did cause this because you may have the wrong idea of what caused it it might have been complete fluke or it might have been this or that but you betterbetter hunt and research and look at it and watch it very carefully and say aaah yes yes thats because i st well in the case of painter you see thats because i started being nice to editors and painters and art gallery peoples wives that was that program i went out on last month of be nice to the hostess hm so after this im always going to be nice to the hostess dont you see oh it works like bomb see gorgeous after that nice to the hostess conditions of affluence happen every now and then you follow itll be some screwball thing of this particular character you might have thought that it was because the world was suddenly more conscious of art that had nothing to do with it see until somebody can define what art is the world is not likely to become more conscious of it so here is ahere is case where you could go into aan operating condition unknowingly pay attention to it keep running as though you were in another operating condition and all of sudden just go appetite over tin cup the whole thing just crashes and you dont quite know what happened to you its all big mystery but if you know these operating formulas of which by the way there are five why youre jolly well welloff the lowest most basic of them and the most snarly one is the condition of emergency when youre in state of emergency boy thats snap and pop well now part of condition of emergency contains this little line of youve got to stiffen discipline or youve got to stiffen ethics to an individual this would simply mean well not go down to the pub every friday night you know lets stiffen up the discipline lets stay home and grind the midnight oil away you see lets stay home and do ones homework or something you get the idea discipline stiffened up be little more regular on the job work little harder something of this sort see dont goof quite so much dont make so many mistakes this would be part of that operating action and as net result organizationally when state of emergency is assigned supposing the activity doesnt come out of that emergency regardless of what caused the emergency supposing the activity just doesnt come out of the emergency in spite of the fact that they have been labeled state of emergency they have been directed to follow the formula they have been told to snap and pop and get that thing straightened out and theyre still found to be goofing the statistic is going down and continues to go down and so forth what do you do theres only one thing left to do and thats discipline because life itself is going to discipline the individual life itself is going to discipline the individual very cruelly and savagely living in another age in less socialistic period why the net product of it was starving to death in business why itd be going into bankruptcy see its crash situation and it usually winds up in an ethical situation fellow whos starving to death will quite normally steal bankruptcies wind up in bankruptcy courts it becomes an ethical situation whether one likes it or not youve got justice staring you in the teeth so the rule of the game is that if state of emergency is ignored and the steps are not taken successfully do you understand not taken successfully is different than not taken whyand the condition is continued then you get an announcement after while that the condition has been continued and if the condition is continued beyond specified period of time why thats it it has to walk forward into an ethics matter because how else could you straighten out that activity there must be somebody goofing like crazy sitting on most of the comm lines do you see thereyouve got some ethical problem involved with it theres somebody who wont function do you see theres somebody whos got the brakes on so that you can hearsmell them smoke and so you walk forward into an ethical situation now the state of normal operation is the second condition and that is supposed to be just normal operation it meansnot stability you could call it condition of stability and it probably should be called condition of stability except for this one little factor this universe does not admit of static statenot using our definition of the word staticbut it wont admit noincrease innodecrease you cannot have condition in this universe where there is increase and decrease thats totally stable condition there is such thing in this universe from one end of it to the other itsthere isnt anything that always remains the same you take some of the hardest substances there are which oddly enough are plutonium and some other such elements those things diminish you see or explode you take lead you say well lead will stay there long time well i invite you to look at the lead on some churches and so forth and youll find out that its diminishing as hardy as the element is supposed to be its still diminishing and you take tree or body after it attains its supposed size and so forth why it actually doesnt have long period of an absolute plane you see its either increasing increasing increasing and when it goes into that plane and so forth youll find out that its really decreasing so that very old people have actually shrunk in size you understand im not talking about this from the viewpoint of it is right im just saying this is the way the universe is rigged im giving you some laws that i managed to strip out of this universe and where the agreement of beings and their interlockings of organizations and materiel and that sort of thingwhere these things function well youll find out theyre governed by these universal laws these are quite interesting because they overthey completely knock out economics as we have known it and they supplant different operating basis for economics we dont expect to be teaching anybody these things particularly but we certainly are interested in using them ourselves theyre very valuable data the condition of normal operation then is not one of stability and therefore im not going to call it stabilityalthough its probably supposed to be called stabilitybecause it cant be normal operation must be regroutine or gradual increase and there must be regular routine gradual increase and if there is gradual increase there will not be condition of stability you cannot have total even state of existence which does not eventually fall on its head the second you get this even state in this universe it starts to deteriorate so state of stability would eventually deteriorate well to prevent deterioration you must have an increase that increase doesnt have to be spectacular but it has to be something there has to be bit of an increase there well the way you maintain an increase is when youre in state of normal operation you dont change anythingyou dont change blessed thing you just let it go and youre very benign about the whole thing ethics are very mild the justice factor is quite mild and quite reasonable dont you see and theres nothing very desperate going on you see theres savage actions taken particularly people come tositting around in an old shirt or something like that well let them sit around in an old shirt maybe that has part of the increased statistic youre not sure see but dont go plowing around now what you do do is you very carefully examine every slightest rise in statistic every time statistic betterslet put it more accuratelyevery time the statistic betters then look it over carefully and find out what bettered it and then do that thats the only changes you make and every time statistic worsens slightly quickly find out why and remedy it and you just jockey those two factors the statistic bettering the statistic worsening repair the statistic worsening and youll find out inevitably some change has been made in that area where statistic worsens some change has been made you better get that change off the lines in hurry and whatwhen you find that statistic is bettering something like that you better find out how it is bettering you very often find out it may depend on an individual you maybe got newa new person on some post or something like that and theyre doing extremely well you see well one of the ways to better it is pat them on the back and hold them up as an example dont you see give them little bump in pay something of this sort dont you see but increase that statistic weve sent out mailing or weve done something or weve approached somebody or weve talked to different type of person recently and suddenly our statistic is little bit better well wed better add it up very carefully that we talked to this type of person and without abandoning what we were doing before also do this other one do you see and therefore you will find that your statistic is justkeeps bettering and the worsening statistics tend to fall away and you just keep riding this horse on that sort of jockey basis its just very niceit isnt ait isnt lazy operation its very alert one you watch youryou watch your statistics now let give you an example of how i speak of this organizationally of course we have oic boards and that sort of thing to watch statistics by and everything has to be staticizable that is to say youve got to be able to get statistic on anything anywhere in an operation if you cant why its all on rumor and god knows what all and you very soon will be in trouble maybe your own life is only in trouble because you dont staticize it very seldom does clerk for instance ever look at his pay as statistic if some fellow for instance has been getting nothing but that same paycheck now for the past two or three years thats state of emergency do you follow although the statistic hasnt dwindled thats the other way you can get into state of emergency because sooner or later thats going to dwindle thats going to crash you never saw anything quite so silly weve got couple of organizations which never rise and never fall and sure enough after about two or three years of never rising and never falling one of them had hysterical cable in here the other day that it couldnt pay its rent see oh well without anything dramatic occurring it had gotten itself into an emergency see the statistic hadnt even visibly declined it was just the fact that here was this linelevellevellevellevellevel increase over these years poof all of sudden bang its into some kind of state of emergency that has sneaked up on it you see the state of emergency that would sneak up on it to somebody that had gross income across here happens to be in the woof and warp of the universe itself you have things like inflation things become less valuable so if you had the same income it wont buy as much and actually that was declining statistic do you follow i mean although it looked level it was really declining the civilization around it was growing so it didnt have the relative importance to the civilization around it that it should have had see so it wasnt really level at all and all of sudden there it is in an emergencycant pay its rent so the individual clerk who has been dragging down x number of dollars per week over the past three years and has had rise of any kind whatsoeverno rise prospects of rise or anything like thatdoes not realize that he is looking at catastrophe he thinks hes looking at security the idiot but for sure if he has had change of any kind in pay status for that period of time hes looking at personal emergency if only because inflation itself will catch up with him his twentyfive cent pieces now dont buy as many cigarettes as they used to so its actually declining statistic in the expansion of the world around him and the crowd that he is moving with and so forth their statistics are changing and his isnt theres more recreation available to be purchased by his fellow man but he isnt now getting more money with which to purchase the recreation see these little tiny factors will enter in to his life and although he hasnt watched it at all he sees this level statistic and doesnt realize hes in state of emergency well how does he get out of state of emergency obviously ask mr wilsoneconomize oh you treat it as state of affluence huh well look whether he knows it or not he is acting as though hes in state of affluence and if he tries to follow the thing by first economizing without promoting hes going to then get all of the consequences of emergency if you start applying one of these condition formulas to the wrong condition you will get into operation the consequences of the one you are applying you seethe one you are in its being neglected so that if you want to really go into an emergency be in an emergency and apply an affluence formula in emergency apply affluence formulaboy youre in emergency itll crash you do you follow that and all of that is hidden and out of view were not talking now about something thats just dreamed up or thats good idea this was what lay in back of the operation of the machine called the physical universe if these things didnt occurwhether amongst living forms or organizations or chemicals or rocks or something like thisif thesethese actions didnt occur one kind or another howit is very hard to see yet they are there matter follows these formulas other things follow these formulas you see now of course they become little more flexible when you apply them to life and theres little more life can do about it just to havedoesnt lie there like alike rock and simply erode see life has more volition and so can apply the condition very definitely so herehere let us take condition of normal operationindividual is in normal operation apparently and then the curve longer goes up and it lies there level everybody feels secure they all feel its all going all right twitterwit and featherbrain company solicitorstheyve always been there see so they will always be there of course and much to their astonishment they wind up in bankruptcy court and how the devil did they get there because their income had never changed they say howdhowd it happen you know huuh so life is very fateful and life is very fantastic and life is very incomprehensible well they didnt know the laws and that was the real law they should have been following twitwit and featherbrain company and so forth had business having totally even income since 1832 if it didnt do anything to improve it it was in aingoing into an emergency and it will eventually react as though its in an emergency and because theyre ignoring handling an emergency of course it becomes real emergency and the next thing you know why theres they dont ever know how this happens to them by the way theres one of the most famous boot makers in the entin thein englandpeelwent by the boards the other day so help pete they have made boots for royalty since time immemorial probably henry viii had his boots made at peel company see fantastic they did this fabulous job of boot making theyre longer amongst us and they blamed it on all kinds of things they blamed it in all different directions the funny part of it is that they were so apathetic about the whole thing they didnt even bother to sell the name of the company any fool could have bought the name of the company and turned line of bostonmadelynn massachusettsmade shoes and stamped them peel andthats what they did to stetsons you can longer really get stetson thats stetson dobbs or somebody bought up stetson and they just stamp stetson on the hats well they were so apathetic about this whole thing and it was so incomprehensible to them they just suddenly went out of business you know they did well along aboutalong about 1835 at the very latest they should have started advertising it didnt matter how manyhow many royal feet were covered by peel boots see thatroyalty and so forth they probably never even thought of giving somebody five thousand pounds or something like that to wear the name of the company on his boots in white letters or something you know i mean theyhowever crude it was they thought of nothing do you see and thats how civilizations go to pieces civilizations generally dont know these formulas and they go bzzzt well theres always been roman empire there will always be roman empire actually the roman empire went into affluence tried to treat it as normal operation and disappeared from the ken of man the affluence they went into was brought about by julius caesar he expanded the empires borders fantastically suddenly and immediately he also violated the normal operating procedure of the roman empire which was pax romana build the roads keep them open and keep peace everywhere and trade with everybody and rule nobodyto hell with them and that was the way the roman empire was doing and it was doing all right theyd been going like that for oh long time all of sudden this bird comes along and he gets the idea of conquest he was doing rehearsal for hitler or somebody and he gets this idea that the thing to do is expand the borders and get rich and make everybody rich and make everybody rich suddenly without any basic structure or anything so oh my god he was taking in this area that area and the other areathis very area right here was tremendously affected by this nut it was typical by the way as i was telling you the other day about how they follow people who havent got good sense there was an epileptic homosexual god almighty marvelous how in the hell anybody would listen to him i wouldnt know but youre probably not aware of the fact that the main battles fought for the possession of the british isles were fought just few miles from saint hill here over in the ashdown forest they were just over the hill over here well this nut did such things as take the british isles which for years and yearsdecadeshad been getting roman pottery and roman cloth and roman coins and the old phoenician tin ship line and so forth was coming into the south here they were in trade dont you see and this channel over here you could jump across it if you felt not too heavy one day and the stuff had been coming over from europe and the british isles here were in very close communication with the quote roman empire unquote they werethe civilization was very nice and they were very enamored with this new civilization it looked new to them and they for instance had an older civilization that they were going on which you found remnants of in ireland well it was over here fairly strong and it had wicker chariots and things like this and this new civilization looked good to them that pottery looked good and those togas they looked real good and so forth and they actually would have lined up on the shore the way people do occasionally with scientologists in group you know they want to know all about it you know what is all this you know and so on and if you havent got suppressive present why they get you talking for hours the british would have lined up on the beach down here if theyd heard the romans were coming over to show them how to fix up few things you know they would have said hurrah you know hello how are you you know gosh you know been waiting for you for long time i know some latin listen you know pax vobiscum you know this nut caesar he getshe gets some little baskets or something they call ships and sails across this and he lands on the beach in hostile battle array and has got to find somebody to fight and he finds some people to fight and of course they fought him because it looked sure like an invasion he had himself ball and then for some hundreds of years why you had this country stumbling along and trying to intervene in the politics of the roman empire and outside the roman empire but inside the roman empire and occasionally running the roman empire oh wild affluence he all of sudden got this tremendous quantity of territory tremendous quantities of peoples did it all wrong way to didnt deliver really he gave them slavery not roman civilization they didnt treat it by the formula of affluence they just squandered the wealth of the empire on this socalled conquest of new wealth and that was the end of the roman empire and it after that certain other political factors existed in the world the chinese by the way about the year one licked the russians thats not well known butthe russians havent publicized it theyve said more about inventing tv than they have about that particular thing but the chinese licked them and it fought them down to nub and they retreatedthe russians didand they actually vacated and evacuated all of siberia and the chinese drove them straight down into what is now the urals and so forth boy they were running and they were running hard you know they were scared and they were sufficiently powerful even so china was at the height of her civilized might you see about thethat was the real thing that occurred in the year zero it wasnt christ it was this cataclysm and in went the chinese and out went the russian people and they hit over into this area of poland and they kept hitting against that area and they took all the peoples that were in the area of poland and central europe and so on and that actually had been on this side of the urals and so on and those people were just forced out of their homeland by these new people that had been chased down defeated by the chinese and those people then migrated south and they kept migrating in waves and fighting and so forth and they were actually streams of refugees and they kept crossing the danube and so forth and the roman he didnt know what this was all about if hed been smart he would have treated this as new affluence of some kind or another he wouldnt have fought these people they frankly were not in warlike state of mind they were defeatedthey had been defeated by the peoples the chinese had defeated you see oh they were without household goods or bread or any other doggone thing and they were coming down in streams and then theyd get organized somewhere up around the german forests or somewhere down into france somewhere and they would form into an area that was trying to find some way out and the roman empire barred their retreat from these russians that had been chasing them out and that actually is apparently the real basis of theoh things like the vandals and other erasures of roman history these birds were just driven down on the empire and they had all sorts of wild adventures and so forth but it wiped it out but the roman by that timehe couldnt stand up to anything he probably could have handled these people politically if hed still been operating on his old basis of pax romana hed still have been trying to keep the peace and keep the roads open he would have said yeah well theres lot of country over there that doesnt have anybody in it why dont you people go over there you know something like that instead of that he had to hold down this phony empire that julius caesar had put together that gave him boundaries up to that time hed owned the whole world without putting any signposts on it dont you see julius caesar went out and gave them affluence by putting up some signposts saying this is roman territory so they couldnt handle these barbarian invasions and theyre longer with us i dont know if you havent noticed recently but i noticed in the last war that nobody was ever very worried about being faced by italian troops broke their backs now these various conditions and there there historically was huge condition of affluence which was begun and which wound up appetite over tin cup now furthermore the russians didnt do all right on their defeat because they went into an emergency but didnt promote see they didntthey didnt follow any kind of formula well you have to dream up what theyd have to do you see they would have had to have promoted something we are useful to you chinese dont you see or people of the balkans we come in peace you know or something theyall they did was just walk out there defeated and everybody they ran into cut his head oft you know uhuhh they didnt know much about formulas but you can get yourself in one of the most remarkable appetiteover tincup states that you ever cared to be in in your life just apply the wrong formula to your own personal existence this doesnt just apply to big organizations big civilizationsapplies to the individual you go into one of these conditions youre in it without knowing youve got to be in one or another of these conditions you see there isnt any other conthere isnt this thing of nocondition and youre in one or another of them and the funny part of it is state of emergencyyou know state of emergency continued is still state of emergency only its worse and that state of emergency not recovered from with emergency formula ended is worse and thenthat condition is continued and so forth its worse there is condition of emergency over because everything is dead thats one of the horrible things to look at in this universe nothing ends you could probably take any pc and get theget the tail end of some duel he had at some unimaginable point of the past and you find out to some degree the duel is still going on its quite interesting he never really gave up you see he was killed in the duel but he nevernever really gave up you see the total persistence of the universe is one of the most amazing features of it it will persist survival of anything and everything is the god and watchword by which it functions so what about this guy hes in condition of emergencyand he becomeshe used to be bank president and becomes clerk all right hes still in condition of emergency and he doesnt repair that as clerk so he becomes skid row bum well hes still in condition of emergency and he doesnt repair that so he becomes negative skid row bum and then he goes down to point where he still canthe cant even pick up body or function in any way whatsoever so hes still in condition of emergency at time along the line does he pull out of this condition of emergency hes still trying to handle it as the wrong condition or something like that you want to know what the dwindling spiral is its really just applying the wrong formula to an existing situation and thatll give you dwindling spiral every time and the handiest one to go into of course is emergency because when the others arent repaired or handled properly why emergency then occurs thats why we know far more about emergency than the other states now theres condition of power change i might as well tell you the other two conditions theresthe first one is the state of emergency the next one is the state of normal operation parenthesis stabilitybut dont be fooled by the word thinking its level the next one is state of affluence and the next one is state of power change and the state of power change is thewhere you have company running all right let us say but the general manager has been hired by some other company because he has such successful record now this is one of the most mishandled states anybody ever heard of you know you get that cliché the new broom sweeps clean well it doesnt only sleep queen sweep clean man it just sweeps everything out youre always getting condition whereby mr sykes has taken over now in the main central bank and he has left the branch bank where he has been so successful and his job is taken over by bill smithers and bill smithers moves into this little local branch position and the new broom sweeps clean he violates the formula almost always it just seems to be sewn into his makeup to knock it off and its just ignorance you see well he makes changes now look the little bank must have been doing all right if its boss was able to take off to become manager of bigger bank must have been doing okay huh well if that little bank was doing all right and if it was in state of normal operationwhich it normally would have been in for anybody to have been promoted out of itthis new bird coming in actually life is beautiful song if he follows the condition formula and therethats perfectly easy you just dont change anything power change dont change anything just because power has changed dont change anything now look it applies to the individual on the basis that the new manager of this little district bankthe new manager of the little district bankhas been previous to that the chief cashier well hes had power change see hes from chief cashier to manager of the little local bank well what do they normally do what does wog normally do when he runs into this situation well you know very well the wife has to have bigger house and they have to have better car dont they thats obvious hes got to be the part hasnt he hes got to have morebetter clothes to live up to this its obvious hes got to havehes got to have better front you know and they have to have more social affairs and make more social contacts dont they which makes it less possible for anybody to get his job done dont you see also runs up nice bill of expenses on entertainment and all this sort of thing but if it were only that it would simply be the individual violating it he goes ahead and violates the formula for the local bank well its always irritated him the fact that he has had to say good morning governor or something when the manager came in you see this has always irritated him and he hasnt got any better sense than to alter the operating procedure so when he comes in he doesnt let his new chief cashier say good morning governor dont you see he decides that this had better be that he is met in the office with most of the papers of the day so the chief cashier is supposed to be in the office with most of the papers of the day well he never gets chance then even to hang up his hat hes hit with all the papers dont you see and he gets all the chitchat of the bank before he can even breathe so this makes him little bit sore so he gets mean to people in his immediate vicinity and spoils the morale see so people make few more mistakes than they ordinarily would have made in adding up the figures and then theres this new rule about the tea break he has decided that he had better put the tea break from lufluf to bluluf see and this is big change and then theres another change and theres another change and theres another change and theres another change the new broom is busy sweeping bank clean of being any bank and the next thing you know theres bank see its statistic goes pshew so you want to ask why is it when they have moved off bill smithers to become the head of the whole chain do they have such hell of time replacing him in the locallocal area well it isnt that the guys that replace him are stupid or incapable of doing the job or something its just they dont know this formula what song it is to inherit pair of successful boots that is really song theres nothing to it just step in the boots and dont bother to walk and this is somehow or another considered by people reprehensible you see youre supposed to strike out on your own youre supposed to put your own personality on the bull put on the boots but dont walk man you just sit around for while just sit around and people want things signedyou know immediately that youre going to getall of the pressure points in the organization are going to come to you at once andthe fellow who had it before you had all these pressure points but he must have resisted them successfully because theyrestill exist see there see so anybody wants anything signed that your predecessor didnt sign dont sign it thats an easy rule to follow isnt it this absolutely is the laziest position that anybody could ever occupy and thats the only way it can be occupiedwith total laziness dont do anything keep your eyes open learn the ropes and depending on how big the organization is after certain time why see how its running and run it as normal operating condition if its not in anything but normal operating condition just apply the normal operating condition to it go around andbesides the little routine thats done why go around and snoop around and find out what made it little bit better that week you know and reinforce that and what worsened little bit and take that out that made it worse you see and just sniff around by that time youre soyoure so well acquainted with the operation you know everybody by his first and last names and you know this that and the other thing and you know where all the papers are and you know the favorite dodges and youve seen all these things happen dont you see and frankly the operation will just keep on moving on up it would move ahead very successfully because quite normally there are only two kinds of replacements only two circumstancesnot conditionsbut there are only two circumstances which require replacement the very successful one or the very unsuccessful one so the place was probably not in condition of affluence it was probably in condition of very steady normal operation for long time which eventually came to the fifththe fifth one which is power and the fifth condition unless there is some other condition ive overlooked in it is powerthe condition of power now this fellow in operating this bank had operated under normal operating conditions coped with all of its emergencies didnt go blooey in all the affluences and so forth and he finally got into position where he himself had assumed position of power in the eyes of his own superiors see he must be quite bloke he must be extending the activities of his organization all around and he is operating at position of where for instance powerwell somebody asks him for his position or opinion on something or other and he says soandso and soandso well his position of power is simply that they say oh yes well thats the way it is even his superiors you see in other words the operation was running so well and so forth he eventually found himself in position of power and so the reason he gets promoted is of course hes outgrown the zone that that power matches so they move him up to higher power position quite elementary in its actual look ithed inevitably move up to higher power position anyway and when he does so he would leave of course an operation which waswhich was in position of power that would be its actual condition quite normally when the fellow was promoted creditably then the organization he leaves behind must be in condition of power if the organization is in condition of emergency well then god knows what you do now the fellow who walks into the boots of somebody who has left it in disgrace very often there are two or three replacements before they finally set it down and stabilize it because every onceone of these guys willwell they try to actmaybe theirmaybe in the last job they had they inherited condition you see of normal operating condition see and they found out they didnt have to do anything and it all came off all right so the next one they inheritthey inherit its in condition of emergency its statistics have gone to hell causing the boss to be fired so they decide not to do anything you see ooh all hes got to do when he inherits one in emergency is nothing extraordinaryits just apply the state of emergency formula to it which is immediately promote oh statistics down oh well lets see what do we normally produce around here we produce eggs all right eggs good who do we use for our advertising weve got an advertising manager or an accountant anyplace or weany firm that advertises for us they say well smythe company has been our advertising firm for the last hundred years oh wait minute this organization is in emergency in spite of them well were going to get new one but meanwhile smythe company can turn out this campaign and ill also get somebody else to turn out campaign too smythe company get out the standard campaign thatthe one that last produced lot of egg selling now repeat that whole campaign but the fellow says oh you mean you wanted the girls with the bows on their i wonti dont care whether they had bows on their hair or not just repeat the campaign that was the last point of success so get that one out quick can youcan you get that out any timewhere thein the next well ill give you lots of time youve got until yesterday oh the fellow says but you havent paid your last account and so forth well weithatsthats something else i havent got anything to do with that and neither do you the only chance you ever got to get your account paid is just to get out that advertising campaign flash and so forth and if you dont get out the advertising campaign flash why you lose our account and youre also going to lose your bill so take your choice they say he speaks sooth so they get promote out dont you see and he meanwhilemeanwhile gets ahold of another firm thats going to replace this other firm and he says get out an egg campaign right away sell lots of eggs and the fellow says weve always had an idea about selling egg campaign we have radio ad and this rooster comes in and winks you see and you say hows he going to wink on the radio well they say well we had it worked well good put on the whole program thats right thats it fine fine and the board of directors bunch of old fuddyduddies or something are sitting around saying but how are you going to pay for all this pay for it see theyre trying to put the emergency formula into the affluence formula and so forth well fine wellill give you complete memorandum on that hi give you memorandum on that by next monday yes sir yeah well give you complete memorandum on the whole thing grace copy something out of an economics textbook or something would you all right very good now see he also handles that by promote hes going to give them something dont you see and then after hes got this firm over here putting on the last successful campaign hes got new firm that is going to take their position if the new firm succeedswhen hes got all that promotion out then he sits down to his desk and works all night long every night and gets out the promotion thats going to save the bacon got the idea on all lines and regardless of any expense and then he makes sure that it happens and then the next thing you know that organizations curve starts going up elementary sometimes it takes longer sometimes its sooner sometimes you hold your breath for long time your promotional period is just week after week after week oh my god that last promotion didnt bite lets get something new here lets get something going you know keep it up until you all of sudden see the statistic start to recover and then economize and then just say all right purchase orders nothing nobody can have anything i dontcant pay any bills im awfully sorry nobody can pay any bills i meanno we cant buy anything you say theyre going to cut off the water tomorrow well i dont know how well bathe just shut it off right there and then say how thewhere the hell we havent even thought of this up to this point now where are we going to get some eggs horribly enough thats the only possible way it can be done if you work it in reverse and worry about getting the eggs before you sell any eggs youre going to go crash in this universe before you have an opportunity dont you see so now youve got new fantastic and frantic condition which you are now going to have to enter in on where are we going to get the eggs why i thought you knew joe i didnt know big conference with juniors are there any eggs somebody says well there are irish eggs nobody has ever sold those over here before oh yeah irish eggs hmm i thought we had lots of eggs oh youyou forgot the thing that caused the emergency and that sort of thing was because henbite got loose amongst the hens and they all died oh is that so but you see now it requires real frantic fast operating skill with which to get supply and if youre very very clever why the first order that comes in from the big wholesaler for eggs you immediately fill it how that happened is concatenation of miracles dont you see but you fill it you make good there because youyour next thought is to prepare to deliver and in the lagwhen your promotion was going out and everything elsein that lag you are actually able then to prepare to deliver see so you conference with your juniors and so forth they got lots of eggs in ireland they havent been able to sell any eggs in ireland for some time you know there used to be tariff and it more or less got uncustomary to import eggs from ireland and so forth theyreand they dont use them anymore why well because theyre brown eggs oh yeah well i thought theyre brown eggs wellhow whitewhite eggs lets see whiteeggs are white and brown all right very good and do housewives have anything against white eggs well as matter of fact they used to have superstition that brown eggs were healthier and made better cakes or something theyin old cookbooks you used to see occasionally brown egg you know you use six brown eggs for this particular type of cake kidding and they have brown eggs in ireland all right good weve got all of that propaganda going weve got all that campaign going and so forth we will release another propaganda campaign now that brown eggs and well quote old betty kettlebottoms recipe for brown eggs yeah yeah well fix that up and here we go and heresand well get in the irish eggs and the wholesaler calls up and he says say those eggs you just shipped us theyre brown eggs and you say theres additional charge theyre not dyed theyre natural and hell go are they and accepts the brown eggs thats how the universe goes together and thats what fast management of an existing area is and anybody by knowing these formulas actually could apply them to his personal life in very wonderful fashion ill repeat them again for you theres the condition of emergencythe state of emergency same thing the normal operation of affluencestate of affluence sudden peaks of income and power change where the guy comes off and the last one is powerand the condition of power and condition of power change merely means the old boss and the new boss that can play hob very often we have gotten into this in scientology because ive left an operating area and its been taken over by somebody else weve gotten into condition of power change and instead of sitting back quietly why whoever inherited the boots changed some of the things that i had going dont you see they didnt reinforce them and the area would go bzzt and they couldnt quite tell why it had gone down so fast and itattributed it to my magic personality well there might have been something to that i will have to admit but actually it wasnt actually attributable to that at all it was that during the time i was there i had certain operating lines moving and nobody kept those same lines moving exactly the way i kept them moving and of course power changesomebody else took over the control of that immediate area why theyd move those lines theyd make changes they wouldnt keep those lines flowing if the guy had been very clever he would have gone through the exact same routine of every day that i went through he would have signed nothing that i wouldnt sign he wouldnt have changed single order he would look through the papers that had been issued at that period of timethese are the orders that are extantand he would have just gotten busy as the devil just enforcing those orders and his operation would have increased and increased and increased and increased now when an operation then after i leave it does collapseyou know it goes downhill it doesnt ever totally collapse but it goes downhillthen you know very well what happened after i left somebody changed all the orders see it wasnt that the public responded badly or something like that its just that somebody must have shifted all of the orders thats all very elementary you can trace it very easily you see but the condition of power is quite interesting and that of all of them is the most fascinatingnot because one is particularly powerhappy but because it is peculiar its peculiar in that it apparently belies what you would normally think and expect to do as operating thetan because that is condition of power and moving up into that condition of power you have to follow its formulas now ive written its formulas down im not going to try to quote those formulas to you at the present momenti dont have the full list and i might tell you little bit wrong but i will tell you this about it is what you mustnt do is disconnect isnt that peculiar thats the first law of condition of power is dont disconnect that will bring about catastrophe for both you and anybody else now look at what might happen here we have an operating scientology organizationwe can see it organizationally very easilyand its operating pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa and after while some of the boys get the idea why are we demanding any money from preclears after all weve been operating in this area for some time only our currency is used in this area why charge anything furthermore we can mock up and put in place and haul in from the granite quarries outside the town all the building material we want why are we buying anything see and bunch of these birds get pretty eager beaver and they start to do it themselves and then they say well we really dont have to have any students or preclears and its the violation of that formula alone which brought about implanting trapping and an antagonism toward thetansthe violation of the state of power and the first thing it is is dont disconnect youll find out that people whine and complain about this how about the big boy who becomes the big boy and hes been local boy in some town and all of sudden he becomes big boy and hes highly powerful on wall street and he never again speaks to any of his friends in the old home town jesus those people resent that that is so much the matter of the thing that i can tell you personally that its almost impossible to speak to them that is to say if youve been in an area where youve been very well known and you suddenly become oh you might say become celebrity or something like thatthese people wont believe that you want to talk to them you see theyre so used to having the formula violated you get the idea youll find that youve been to saint hill and youveyoure in the org and you go back and youve always had good time talking to josie ann and sothe receptionist and so forth and youll find out that although shell chatter with you and that sort of thing she has feeling like youre quite superior now its going to be you who has to break down the communication barrier thats erected youll find out that very often these people have drifted off from you and you wait until youve gone through vii and youve gotten yourself well up the line on clear and you can handle power processes which gives you total dominion over any type of case there is now we havent talked about your state of case weve just talked about what you can do and the reputation of what youve got or what you arejust that you see were not talking about you being able to do anything beyond your business see wow one of your hardest jobs will be not disconnecting youll find out there are certain people around who are now absolutely sure that you dont anywant toany longer want to talk to them and you start communicating with these people and they will give you some of the weirdest reactions some of them flash back at you some of them are too respectful of you some are very propitiative of you your conversation quite commonly starts out with oh i thought you would have forgotten all about this is quite weird you see in other words beings in the universe fully expect that youre going to violate the first position of the power condition which is disconnect they think youre going to disconnect well lets supposing this organization got itself so that it was totally selfsufficient it didnt have to train anybody it didnt have to process anybody it didnt have to do thing next thing you know the community anywhere around it is going to think of nothing but implantation stakes violating any freedom that thetan might have theyre going to become very suppressive theyre being denied service for one thing bridge was put in one of the most dangerous things we could doif we just wanted to blow up everybody in this room theres one terribly dangerous thing that we could do we could just not make what we know available for instance to have the power processes being performed at saint hill and lets limit them totally to staff at saint hill huh somebody is going to get upset well they get upset enough when you dont let everybody do them youre not willing to sit still you see and watch somebody out in keokuk process somebody into the ground because nobody starrated him on the bulletin dont you see because we have way of starrating somebody in keokuk on these bulletins so we keep it corralled just to that degree and youll see little bit of natter but actually the public at large and so forth in responding to on this sort of thing quite well accepts the idea that certain of these materials the betterthe stronger tougher of these materials should be in trained hands they think thats good idea and thats as far as we go yes we say they should be in very trained hands and that we should have an ethics of their proper application thats about the only thing that worries people theyre still available dont you see people can still get these things and so forth we havent disconnected supposing i announced well i walked across the bridge now and ive given you some materials and so forth and im leaving ive got an appointment at the central galaxy and so forth its about time i reported back anywayive got to collect my back pay youd see some wild things occurring youd be just little bit amazed at how wild they would be you say well it doesnt make much difference because after all hes given us all the materials and hes done all this and hes all done that and so forth and so on i say well im clear now and im moving on up to ot and so forth and hopewish you people some luck bye back in the old days when id get disi would never get discouraged particularly but id just get to thinking about my own concerns and that sort of thing and i told some people im not going to be around forever and so forth and ive had several people immediately break down and cry and get upset and couple of others get angry and so fortha very misemotional mess do you see power position of power dont disconnect even though youre promoted to general from colonel of regiment dont be such fool as to think that you can totally disconnect from that regiment because the only way you cant disconnect from the regiment is to disconnect from it you cant just deny your connections what youve got to do is take ownership and responsibility for your connections now the condition of power is the guy going into condition of power or the organization going into condition of power and the condition of power changethat stateis actually fellow assuming condition which has been held from power you get the difference youre replacing bill who was in condition of power he was actually in the condition of power now when he moves oft disconnectswhen hes gonethen the power change is who took over do you see that applies to taking over post do you see or the upgrade of the power of an organization also is covered under that same formula weirdly enough and then this post up here of the assumption of this state of power and so forth is governed by its own formula and the first thing its got to do is make record of all of its lines and thats the only way it will ever be able to disconnect now for instance if you were very very succ ill giveshow you this applies big and small see supposing you were very very successfulyou were very very successful receptionist in an organization and you were so successful that you were made the registrar or something see supposing something like this went on well actually that is an upgrade of power isnt it now you dont permit the person who takes over the post to operate in condition of power change unless you make total record of your post so on condition of power the first thing you have to do is write up your whole post and youll find out if you dont write up your whole post youre going to be stuck with piece of that post since time immemorial and year or so later somebody will still be coming to you asking you about that post which you occupied because you didnt write up your post do you see so you made it possible for the next bloke inwhether he does or not thats beside the point but youve made it possible for the next fellow in to assume that state of power change of changing nothing because youve shown what was there so he knows now what not to change you got it but if you didnt write it up then he could change it and youre being pulled back to that post continuously and thats the surest way in the world to be snapped in against some old post that you have held and thats how never to get away from post its just dont write up the post of reception and go ahead and take the post of registrar and dont be very surprised however if you spend 50 percent of your time answering the telephone while being registrar and you say what wonderful mechanics are involved here thisthese newthese new people that take over these reception posts theyre just girls and theyre good and they dont care now lets make sure before we start being too critical did we ever write up this post registrar did we ever really leave the post did we leave it in condition that it could be left and then did we just negate the whole post after we left it or occasionally did we walk by and say hows the post coming see its sudden disconnection man thats what it really amounts to dont go disconnecting this is one of the most foul tricks that this universe plays at this particular time is permit death they have thing called the last will and testament and thats bequeathment who the hell cares about the bequeathment how about the birds lines see this guy is the school janitor and he says well the world can get along without the school janitor and so forth and its not important and you know and he kicks the bucket and i leave myi leave my sunday suit to the garbage man you know and he thinks hes done his job see hows he get time track hmphhmphhmphhmphhmph he just never wrote up the hat of janitor so it could be occupied in other words he didnt take responsibility for his former situation not having taken responsibility for it hes stuck with it it was his former position and he didnt take responsibility for it so of course hes stuck with it naturally he should have written up instead of the last will and testament he says oh oh ive got tb now and im kicking the bucket and the doctors have promised that theyre going to kill in few days what should i do you know what should he do theres only one answer man theres only one answer hed better write up his post it isnt whether or not hes in condition of power change or not hes in condition of power with relationship to the janitor see he may be doing poorly personally and may be in another personal condition he may be personally in condition of emergency but as far as his post is concerned hes in position of power he is the janitor and he just ought to get that old stub of pencil and that old account book and sit downand lie down and somehow or other get himself comfortable enough to say empties the ashes every tuesday and youll find the fuse on switch box number 17 is always blowing and heresponsibility is write the thing up and get it into the hands of the guy thats going to take care of it now if the other guy doesnt take care of it thats his track brother thats not yours do all you can to make the post occupiable sooner or later somebody is going to come along and occupy the post properly condition of power change that might go appetite over tin cup two or three times until somebody sees this old account book whats this well thats old sammys writeup of his job oh switch box number 1716 goes out well ill be of gun it does too hey wheres this every tuesday thats the best time oh good of course this stuff about the hot water doesnt apply weve had new boiler since well they had to have new boiler because they didnt apply the old hat you get the idea so one in his own personal life and in operation of post state of an organization state of family state of civilization or the state of planet or sector well of course all comes under the heading of the states of condition and if theyre in one state of condition operate into another they for sure will fail these will be issued in the nottoodistant future in the form of very exact bulletin giving you number of exact steps for every one of them there are quite few steps one right after the other and they can be applied by crossrelating them to an individual theyll be written up mainly for an organization of course but they can be applied crossways to that and one of these days studentsin the nottoodifferent future i think probably by tuesday of next weekstudents will be declared in condition of emergency if their statistic goes down thats the statistic of the number of passes so youre going less examination and more statistic you see your statistic goes down and thats what determines whether or not you go to review state of emergency dont you see what do you have to do in state of emergency well its covered exactly in the state of emergency and you find out if you follow the state of emergency why you come out at the other end smiling and smelling like rose theit is wonderful fact that those things did exist and that they do regulate existence regulate life and that life can therefore be followed but i invite you to do one thing after these are issued and you get an opportunity to study them i invite you to do one thing and that is take some existing civilization aspect take the course of existence of some government and estimate that governments state see find out what state that government really is in and then watch the newspapers for the measures which that government is taking youll go into stitches contained in these is why the british empire has become smaller every time they went into state of emergency or state of affluence then they would assume the wrong formula and the second that they assumed the wrong formula of course theyd emerge at the other end of the situation smaller thats always the case you want to become smallerjust always apply the wrong condition apply the wrong formula and youll get it every time now the united states has got bunch of formulas going right now i dont know what theyre operating on at the present time but its quite interestingits quite interesting it would be rather quite interesting mental exercise just to estimate what condition are they in see what should be the assigned condition now thats the assigned condition whats the formula all right the formula is soandso well what are they doing and youll generally find out theyre in some other wild condition that had nothing whatsoever to do with the condition that they are in and then you wonder why statesmen fail and wars happen and things get worse and civilizations go by the boards and why the dominican republic flag will be flying over the white house any day now anyway i think you can have some fun with this but much more important than this you could probably set yourself up as business advisory bureau that would actually bring out of the woods any failing business in the world you could set yourself up as an adviserjust using these states see and doing nothing but urge that they be taken dont you see boy theyd think how wise how wise you are dont you see and how does he know those things and onceif we did this then we would supplant im not advising anybody to do this its just gag we use it operationally ourselves but fellow by the name of keynes lord keynes is the top dog in todays economics and he only has one law and thats increase want thats his law increase want and ive worked that out economically if you increased wantif you wanted really to increase want youd just have to starve everybody to death and you would have reached and attained the end product of lord keynes central law and as far as i can see thats about as far as anybody has gotten on states of condition in modern civilization and i hope we can do bit better thank you very much
