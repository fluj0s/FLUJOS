ohio state buckeyes in 2002 helping his team to the national championship and earning big ten freshman of the year honors the next season however he was suspended from the football team after the university found that he had accepted thousands of dollars worth of improper benefits and lied to investigators rather than return to ohio state for his junior year clarett elected to declare for the national football league nfl draft the nfl would not allow clarett to enter the draft however citing league rules requiring players entering the draft to be th ree years removed from high school clarett filed suit against the nfl arguing that the threeyear rule acts as an unreasonable restraint on trade in violation of sections one and two of the sherman antitrust act1 and the clayton act2

hear its motion for stay pending app eal on an expedited basis on april 19 the second circuit issued stay of the lower courts ruling citing the nfls likelihood of success on the merits the supreme court subs equently refused to lift the stay and so clarett was not eligible to participate in the draft following the draft the second circuit issued its opinion on the merits of the case ruling that the nfls threeyear rule is protected from antitrust scrutiny by the nonstatutory labor exemption4 background in response to americas gilded age industrialization of the late 19th century congress passed sections one nd two of the sherman act which made monopolies and trusts in re straint of trade illegal5 the sherman act became the foundation upon which courts over the next cen tury constructed complex framework of antitrust jurisprudence initially the courts focused on actions such as price fixing and territorial exclusion arrangements so flagrantly anticompetitive that they were deemed per illegal in 1911 however the supreme cour t refined its analysis in finding that some restraints on competition are not violative of antitrust restrictions rather only unreasonable restraints on trade violate the sherman act6 the courts have thus created two standards of antitrust liability 1 per illegality and 2 unreasonable restraints on trade this second standard has become known as the rule of reason which is violated if practices anticompetitive injury outweighs its benefits to competition7 in 1922 the supreme court delivered an opinion that has effectively become an antitrust exemption for major league baseball in federal baseball club of baltimore v national league of professional baseball clubs 8 the court held that exhibitions of baseball are merely state affairs that do not affect interstate commerce and so are not subject to federal antitrust laws9 the supreme court has not extended this exemption to any other sport and has refused in ter cases to invalidate baseballs exemption holding that it is only for congress to do so10 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21869crs3 11 15 usc 17 29 usc 52 12 29 usc 104 105 113 13 see brown v pro football inc 518 us

football inc 518 us 231 1996while other sports leagues do not enjoy the antitrust exemption granted to baseball they can avail themselves of two major antitrust exemptions available to everyone else the statutory labor exemption and the nonstat utory labor exemption the statutory labor exemption was created by congress in provisions of the clayton act11 and norris laguardia act12 and exempts certain activities by bor groups such as boycotts and picketing from antitrust scrutiny the nonstatutory labor exemption on the other hand was inferred by the courts from the fede ral labor laws to protect the collective bargaining process even when collective bargaining agreement cba results in certain restraints on competition13 the exemption is intended to allow the federal labor laws through the judgments of the national labor relations board nlrb to operate in situations where cba is in place without interference from antitrust challenges as the supreme court has said the nonstatutory labor exemption thereby substitutes legislative and administrative laborrelated determin ations for judicial antitrustrelated determinations as to the appropr iate limits of indus trial conflict14 the courts have wrestled with the cont ours of the nonstatutory labor exemption almost since its inception15 and the question of how the exemption applies to sports leagues as multiemployer bargaining units has often been vehicle for this struggle recent cases suggest that once cba is in place the non statutory labor exemption protects wide range of actions from antitrust scrutiny in 1996 for example in dispute arising out of the nfls unilateral imposition of fixed salary for developmental players after negotiations with the national footba ll league players association nflpa had broken down the supreme court held that th nfls actions were protected by the non statutory labor exemption even though the parties had reached imp asse and had never agreed that the nfl could act unilaterally in the way it did16 in other words the court found that the protection afforded by the nonstatutory labor exemption extends beyond the actual terms of the agreement itself against this backdrop maurice clarett broug ht his suit challenging the nfls three year rule while the nfl and the nflpa have solid cba in place the threeyear rule was not negotiated by the par ties but rather was put in place by the nfl in 1925 decades before the nflpa even came into existence the major issue facing the courts in clarett therefore was whether the nonstatutor labor exemption protects league rule in place well before any cba was contemplated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21869crs4 17 mackey v national football league 543 f2d 606 8th cir 1976 18 325 us 797 1945 19 381 us 657 1965 20 421 us 616 1975 21 id at 614 22 clarett i 303 fsupp2d at 395396 23 id at 396 24 id at 395the district court ruling in assessing the applicability of the nonstatutory labor exemption the district court seemed to apply the threepart mackey test first promulgated by the eighth circuit17 and subsequently adopted by the sixth and ninth circuits in formulating this test the eighth circuit drew from the rationale expressed in string of supreme court cases in which employers challenged collectively bargained labor agreements allen bradley co v local 3 18 local 189 v jewel tea 19 and connell construction co v plumbe rs and steamfitters local union 100 20 under the resulting test in order for the nonstatutory labor exemption to apply 1 the restraint on trade must primarily affect only the parties to the collective bargaining agreement 2 the agreement must concern mandatory subject of collective bargaining and 3 the agreement must be the product of bona fide armslength bargaining21 applying the first part of this test th court found that the labor exemption cannot shield agreements that only affect those who are not part of the bargaining unit while the court conceded that collectively bargained agreements will always affect prospective employees who do not have the opportunity to participate in negotia tions the court drew distinction between provisi ons that affect current and prospective employees eg wages hours conditions of employment and t hose such as the nfls threeyear rule that affect only prospective employees in the former case it is right to hold the future employees to the terms of the collectively bargained agreement according to the court because they step into the shoes of the players who did engage in collective bargaining22 in the latter case however the court concluded that those who are categorically denied employ ment even temporarily cannot be bound by the terms of employment they cannot obtain23 the district court also concluded that the threeyear rule does not concern mandatory subject of collective bargaini ng ie wages hours or conditions of employment as the court put it the ru affects wages only in the sense that player subject to the rule will earn none but the rule itself does not concern wages hours or conditions of employment and is therefore not covered by the nonstatutory exemption24 applying the final part of the mackey test the district cour t found that the three year rule was not result of arms length negotiations in fact the court found that the rule was not product of any negotiations arms length or otherwise due to the fact that the nfl first instituted the three year rule in 1925 over thirty years before the formation of the nflpa and over forty years before the first collective bargaining agreement

not be protected by th nonstatutory labor exemption25 after finding that the non statutory labor exemption does insulate the nfls threeyear rule from antitrust challenges the district court applied the standard rule of reason antitrust analysis to conclude that the threeyear rule is an unreasonable restraint on trade26 the second circuit ruling the second circuit reject ed the district courts approach on two grounds first the second ci rcuit pointed out that it had never adopted the mackey test second th court found the mackey tests reliance on the rationale of the jewel tea line of cases inappropriate in case like this one where an athlete ie an employee challenges restraints on the mark et for professional sports players imposed through collective bargaining process27 as mentioned above the jewel tea line of cases concerned employers asserting claims that they were being excluded from competing in the product market the second circuit found that this difference warrants separate approach the second circuit held that its rati onale from line of its prior cases wood v national basketball association 28 national basketball association v williams 29 and caldwell v american basketball association30 was controlling the second circuit stated that those cases stand for the propos ition that collective bargaining agreement irrevocably alters the governing legal regime in cases like this one such that labor laws not antitrust laws offer the proper remedies if any are justified the court concluded that to permit antitrust suits against sports leag ues on the ground that their concerted action imposed restraint upon the labor market woul d seriously undermine ma ny of the policies embodied by these labor laws such as the congressional polic favoring collective bargaining the bargaining parties freedom of contract and the widespread use of multi employer bargaining units31 the second circuit then applie d this rationale to the facts of the case before it and found that none of those facts would justify allowing clarett to circumvent the scheme established by federal labor laws first the court rejected the distri ct courts finding that the three year rule was not mandatory subject of collective bargaining the second circuit viewed the threeyear rule together with the nfls general eligibility rule and held that these eligibility rules represent condition of initial employment for this reason alone the court stated the eligibility rules could be mandatory subject of collective bargaining32 the court went further howev er and concluded that the unique economic realities of professional sports ar such that many of the agreements inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21869crs6 33 id at 29 34 id at 30 35 id at 32 36 id 37 id at 34 citing brown v national football league 518 us 231 243 1996 38 id at 35 citations omittedprofessional sports that at first glance might not appear to deal with wages or working conditions are indeed mandato ry bargaining subjects33 the second circuit also ruled that the non statutory labor exem ption applies despite the fact that the three year rule affects pr ospective players outside of the union in this respect the court compared the threeyear rule to unionoperate d hiring halls long recognized as mandatory subject of collective bargaining hiring halls are placement centers where jobs from various employers are allotted to registered applicants according to set order usually based on rotation or seniority in ch hiring hall arrangements the second circuit stated the criteria for employment are t by the rules of the hiring hall rather than the employer alone34 the court next addressed the district courts concern that the three year rule was put in place by the nfl before the collective bargaining agreement came into being while the second circuit conceded this fact the c ourt focused on the point that the three year rule is clearly stated in the nfls constitution and bylaws copy of which was presented to the union during cba negotia tions because as discusse d above the court determined eligibility rules to be mandatory subject of collective bargaining the union or the nfl could have forced the other to the bargaining table if either felt that change was necessary35 as further proof that the union implicitly acquiesced in the operation of the three year rule the court cited the unions waiver in the cba of any challenges to the nfls constitution and bylaws36 building on this point the second circuit cited the supreme courts aforem entioned holding in brown to support the proposition that the nonstatutory labor exemp tion not only protects the terms of cba but also the whole collective bargaining process 37 conclusion in the clarett case the second circuit explicitly drew distinction in nonstatutory labor exemption cas between suits where competing employers challenge cba provision and suits where workers or prospective workers challenge cba provision according to the second circ uit the former case implicates the ills that the antitrust laws were enacted to prevent the latter case however reflects simply prospective employees disagreement with the criteria established by the employer and the labor union that he must meet in orde r to be considered for employment any remedies for such claim are the province of labor law38
