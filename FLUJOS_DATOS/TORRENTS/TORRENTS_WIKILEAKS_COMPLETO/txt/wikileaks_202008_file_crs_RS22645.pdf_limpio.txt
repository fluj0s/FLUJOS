world war ii to promote peace and economic prosperity in europe this european integration project has evolved over the last decade from encompassing primarily economic sectors to include developing common foreign policy an eu defense arm and closer police and judicial cooperation the us congress and successive us administrations have supported the eu project since its inception as way to foster stable europe democratic states and strong trading partners the united states has welcomed eu efforts since the end of the cold war to expand the political and economic benefits of membership to central and eastern europe and supports the eu aspirations of turkey and the western balkan states the united states and the eu share huge and mutually beneficial economic relationship twoway flows of goods services and foreign investment now exceed 10 trillion on an annual basis and the total stock of twoway direct investment is over 19 trillion nevertheless the useu relationship has been challenged in recent years as numerous trade and foreign policy conflicts have emerged the 2003 crisis over iraq which bitterly divided the eu and severely strained useu relations is most notable but the list of disagreements has been wide and varied although europeans are not monolith ic in their views many eu member states have objected to at least some elements of us policy on issues ranging from the israelipalestinian conflict to us treatment of terrorist detainees to climate change and aircraft subsidies since 2003 however both sides have made efforts to improve relations and successive useu summits have sought to emphasize area s of cooperation and partnership at the same time challenges and some tensions remain in the useu relationship

2007 germanys chancellor angela merkel proposed new initiative to enhance and deepen the transatlantic economic relationship the proposal advocated further liberalizing transatlantic trade and reducing investment barriers by reducing nontariff and regulatory barriers to trade the aim of such efforts is to lower costs to businesses on both sides of the atlantic and to facilitate higher levels of economic growth since the establishment of the new transatlantic agenda in 1995 number of initiatives have attempted to remove remaining nontariff and regulatory barriers to trade although each successive initiative has made some progress towards reducing regulatory burdens both european and us companies heavily engaged in the transatlantic marketplace argue that the results have not proved materially significant in departure from these past efforts that relied substantially on voluntary and nonbinding dialogues among regulators with politicallevel endorsement the merkel initiative proposed creating an overarching framework to provide greater commitment on the part of political leaders and greater accountability on the part of regulators according to business europe the eus main business trade association this would require legislators and officials to take into account how new laws and regulations affect the transatlantic marketplace 2 merkels proposal also covered issues such as public procurement intellectual property energy and the environment financial markets and security and innovation building on and borrowing from the merkel initiative the 2007 useu summit adopted framework for advancing transatlantic economic integration the framework affirmed the importance of further deepening transatlantic economic integration particularly through efforts to reduce or harmonize regulatory barriers to international trade and investment new institutional structure transatlantic economic council tec was established to advance this process the tec will be headed on both sides by ministeriallevel appointees with cabinet rank its mandate is to accelerate ongoing efforts to reduce regulatory barriers in part by introducing broader participation of stakeholders including legislators in the discussions and cooperative meetings meeting at least once year the tec will monitor progress and try to identify areas where regulations could be reduced or harmonized despite this effort to provide higherlevel political commitment to accelerating transatlantic economic integration useuropean differences in public values over issues such as health safety and environmental protection remain large the goal of reducing regulatory barriers through harmonization efforts and improved cooperation combined with divergent regulatory objectives and approaches thus remains difficult target g3g146g155g561g22g155g138g151g156g153g152g155g157g561g3g144g155g142g142g150g142g151g157g561 an aviation agreementopen skies plusbetween the united states and eu was

of aviation liberalization negotiations to commence by may 30 2008 the european commission predicts that the initial agreement will lower airline fares on transatlantic travel expand the number of passengers over the next five years and create 80000 new jobs but the agreement is not without controversy many europeans argue that it is not balanced because it does not give european carriers the right to fly between us cities and ma intains limits on eu ownership of us airlines although most us airlines support the agreement the major us unions representing pilots machinists flight attendants

development round of multilateral trade negotiations has been suspended since july 2006 the round which seeks to liberalize world trade flows and provide boost to development and the world economy has been stymied by persistent differences among the united states the eu and developing countries on major issues such as agriculture and services agreement between the eu and us has been key to the conclusion of previous multilateral trade rounds accordingly at the 2007 summit leaders reaffirmed their strong desire to reach prompt agreement that is ambitious balanced and creates meaningful new trade flows in agriculture industrial goods and services among and between the developed and developing countries trade negotiators from the two sides however face complicated task of getting the rest of the world to accept any agreement the united states and the eu might reach developing countries in particular are much more vociferous in their expectations and demands than they were in previous

climate change an integral objective of eu energy security policy in march 2007 eu members established binding targets for the use of renewable energy and biofuels and committed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 compared to 1990 levels by 2020 building on this agreement european officials are reportedly seeking us support for an international treaty regulating greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol is set to expire and for an international marketbased carbon emissions credit trading system the united states is not party to the kyoto protocol and us officials appear reluctant to commit to global regulation inst ead they advocate transatlantic cooperation to promote alternative and clean energy technology in light of the differences on global climate change regulation the united states and eu used the april 2007 summit to launch initiatives jointly promoting technological advances in clean coal and carbon capture and storage energy efficiency biofuels and methane recovery among other areas although european officials agree with the united states that these technologies should help improve transatlantic energy security and mitigate the negative effects of climate change they are reportedly disappointed by perceived us reluctance to pursue binding international emissions targets and global carbon trading syst em us officials pointing out that

based on fostering technological innovation as opposed to binding regulation is proving more effective in curbing global warming4 at the april 2007 summit us and european aders sought to downplay differences over carbon emissions targets and carbon trading expressing confidence that their decisions to promote clean and renewable energy sources represent step forward in transatlantic cooperation both to increase energy security and curb climate change however analysts note that past effortssuch as 2006 pledge creating an annual strategic review of useu energy cooperation useu high

over the last few years the united states nd many eu members have differed sharply on policies toward iraq iran the israelipalestinian conflict and democracy promotion in the middle east recently however the two sides seem to have found more common ground on some of these issues and the april 2007 useu summit highlighted such cooperation although eu officials continue to urge the bush administration to do more to get israelipalestinian negotiations back on track many appear encouraged by renewed us diplomatic initiatives and note that washington has backed germanys efforts as part of its eu presidency to revitalize the largely stalled road map for twostate solution washington and the eu have also managed to stay on the same page with regard to policies toward hamas since it won majority in the january 2006 palestinian legislative elections at the april 2007 summit the united states and the eu essentially reaffirmed that hamas must recognize israel renounce violence and accept prior israelipalestinian accords before either side permits contact with hamas members of the new hamasfatah coalition government the united states and the eu continue to provide foreign assistance directly to the palestinian people rather than giving it through the coalition government but some analysts question how long the united states and the eu will remain in lock step suggesting that the eu may be inclined to resume direct aid to the new government sooner than the united states 5 as for iran the united states has intensified cooperation with france germany and the uk the eu3 to curtail irans suspected nuclear weapons program in december 2006 and again in march 2007 the eu3 and the united states gain ed security council approval for limited sanctions on iran related to its nuclear work us officials have been urging eu countries to go even further by cutting off bank lending and other financial interactions eu states have so far responded tepidly to such calls 6 tensions between iran and the west have also risen following irans seizure in march 2007 of 15 british naval personnel off the iraqiran coast and amid us accusations that elements of the iranian government are supporting sectarian violence in iraq and supplying insurgents with explosives at the april 30 2007 summit the united states and eu reiterated their commitment to prevent an iranian nuclear weapons capability and expressed their mutual concern about the negative effects of irans policies in the region including in iraq 4 eu and us head for climate change clash european

humanitarian relief and reconstruction assistance to lebanon following fighting in julyaugust 2006 between israel and the lebanonbased hezbollah key sticking point however is that the eu does not recognize hezbollah as terrorist organization like the united states the eu has called on syria to end all interference in internal lebanese affairs but some analysts suggest that the eu has begun softening it policy of isolating the syrian regime in the summit declaration on political and security issues however the united states and the eu asserted that they remain concerned about syrias role in the region and its repression of civil society observers suggest that any gap between the united states and the eu on syria is not that wide noting that eu officials have stressed that improved relations are contingent on constructive actions by syria and that some in the united states advocate more engagement with syria they also point out that on may 3 2007 us secretary of state

has welcomed eu efforts over the last few years to boost police and judicial cooperation stem terrorist financing and improve border controls and transport security the eu and the united states have concluded several new agreements on police informationsharing extradition mutual legal assistance container security and exchanging airline passenger data nevertheless some challenges remain for example useu agreement allowing european air carriers to provide us authorities with passenger data has been controversial because of fears that it compromises eu citizens privacy rights the current deal expires in july 2007 and some caution that european parliamentarians and civil liberty groups may try to stymie its extension also some eu members continue to resist us entreaties to add suspected hamasrelated charities or hezbollah to the eus common terrorist list many europeans fear that the united states is losing the battle for muslim hearts and minds as result of the iraq war and some us practices in combating terrorism for example eu officials would like the detention center at guantánamo bay closed because they believe it degrades shared values regarding human rights and disregards international accords on the treatment of prisoners in addition europeans are concerned ab out us rendition policy and cia program to detain and question suspected terrorists outside of the united states us officials charge that allegations of us wrongdoing and ongoing crimin proceedings against cia officials in some eu members may put useuropean intelligence cooperation at risk 8 during the 2007 summit the united states and the eu reaffirmed that efforts to combat terrorism must comply with international law and promised to deepen useuropean dialogue on such issues

united states from certain countries to be applied to all eu members currently 12 eu members mostly newer ones from central and eastern europe do not qualify for the vwp due to problems meeting the
