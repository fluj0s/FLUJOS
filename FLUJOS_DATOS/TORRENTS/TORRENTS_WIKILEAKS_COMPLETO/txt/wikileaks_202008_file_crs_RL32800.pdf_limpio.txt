populous state identified two reasons for its relatively low rate of noncompliance 47 of 27689 offenders one is that each year the states department of law enforcement mails letters to sex offenders and closely monitors letters that are returned certain state agencies have entire units whose purpose is to followup on offenders who fail to respond the state employs 11 fulltime staff to track offenders who do not register another reason for floridas low rate of noncompliance is the states use of technology which helps keep track of unregistered offenders for exampl florida requires sex offender to carry state identification card several florida agencies including those that issue drivers licenses and state identification cards have direct electronic access to the sex offender database and by crosscheck ing can monitor offenders20 according to the attorney general of north dakota state with smaller population of x offenders required to register 32 of 1006 convicted

of sex offenders to register one view is that requirements to register every three months which apply to certain sex offenders place large burden on indivi duals who may have difficulty organizing their lives another view is that some x offenders are ignorant of the registration requirement and believe that they have to register only once some state that offenders are simply irresponsible and do not take the need to register seriously finally it is argued that sex offenders fail to register because they just dont want to be tracked26 effectiveness of community notificati on programs although sex offender registration and community notification programs were created primarily to protect the public some question whether they are effective they challenge the assumptions underlying these programs that communities would be safe with sex offender laws with harsh penalties that the recidivism rate of sex offenders is inordinately high and that once sex ffender always an offender they suggest that legislative approach would be more effective that recognizes pedophilia and some other sexual disorders as both criminal justice matter and public health problem27 few studies have been conducted to eval uate the effectiveness of sex offender registration and community tification programs only two states washington and wisconsin have conducted evaluations of th eir community notification programs and neither study is particularly recent washington in 1998 the washington state ins titute for public policy released its findings of telephone survey conducte d in the state

threefourths of respondents thought that as result of community notification convicted sex ffenders would have difficulty establishing new lives in terms of finding job obtaining housing making friends etc but less than half of the re spondents believed that offenders should be given ev ery opportunity for new start as lawabiding citizens and eight out of 10 respondents felt th community notification law was very important in another paper published in 1995 by th washington state institute for public policy the costs of implementing the states community notification law were addressed29 researchers found that the size of communitys population urban or rural and policy decisions at the local level influenced the cost of implementing community notification if community had small population and few sex offenders who were required to register notificati on was handled informally usually through the county sheriff resulting in lower costs further in an area with large population and many registered sex offenders the co sts would increase because of the time and manpower required to track offenders af ter notification and to investigate an offenders conduct and charges of harassm ent of an offender by some community members in addition policy decisions influen ce costs associated with community notification if law enforcement agency as an information repository relies on sex offender information supplied by state agenci such as the state patrol department of corrections etc and reviews only thos offenders who have been drawn to the agencys attention such as through special bulletin costs can be modest by using the standard manner of issuing releases for example through schools or press releases it saves postage costs and officer s time the study found that where public officials make community notification high priority and officers are assigned responsibility for monitoring convicted sex ffenders costs are higher to take these steps may require an increase in payroll ex penses and an investment in equipment andor software30 wisconsin generally there are three types of notification laws they require law enforcement agencies to inform residents of sex offenders moving into neighborhoods enable the public to gain access to relevant data on sex offenders and require convicted child molesters to identif themselves as sex

corrections and other agencies in executing the notification process survey data revealed that 86 of law enforcement agencies were familiar with the states guidelines and 66 reported that their policies and procedures reflected those guidelines many law enforcement agencies considered community notification to be an unfunded mandate because of the additional work and costs associated with implementing it more than 66 of law enforcement agencies responding to the survey were concerned about the incr ease in labor expenditures resulting from implementing community notification ag encies found the laws registration requirements beneficial because of an increase in informationsharing but reported that community notification was less beneficial with less than 41 believing that it improved the management and containment of sex offende r behavior due to greater visibility based on responses to the survey the following recommendations were made local and county law enforcement agen cies were to consider continuing the collaborative informationsharing and problemsolving approach developing written policies and training protocols that address the announcement of meetings distributing pertinent information about sex offenders such as th eir release locations answering questions and handling negative or hostile reactions to the release of specific offender and seekin g federal or state funding for training and overtime expenses associated with sex offender registration and community notification32 probation and parole agents of sex ffenders throughout wisconsin were also surveyed for their assessment of the imp act of community notification survey findings showed that agents and supervis ors who were responsib for implementing community notification were knowledgeable and trained on policies the survey revealed that the caseload for agents in urban areas was much greater than in rural ones the average caseload for agents rveyed was 25 active cases but nine agents had 40 or more sex offenders to supervis and six of the nine had 50 or morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32800crs37 33 ibid p 7 34 ibid p 8 35 ibid pp 910twentynine percent of agents had 30

nonviolent offense prior felony etc that did not require the same intensive supervision that highrisk offenders did nevertheless commun ity notification had considerably increased the workloads of probation and parole units in the state33 problems identified by agents and unit supervisors that are associated with handling sex offender cases include findi ng housing for offenders and increased paperwork associated with supervising high risk sex offenders an example of these increased time demands is agents participation in community notification meetings fortysix percent of respondents reported that as part of thei r job they attended at least one and in some cases more than six such meetings served as presenters at the meetings and assisted local and county w enforcement in planning and organizing notification meeting it was estimate d that this involvement with community notification required about 40 hour s of agent time per meeting34 finally highrisk sex offenders were rveyed to determine how the community notification process affected them of the 30 sex offenders in terviewed all but one stated that the process adversely affected them seventyseven pe rcent told of being humiliated daily ostracized by neighbors and lifetime friends and harassed or threatened by neighbors or strangers lthough only one was the victim of vigilante action all were concerned for their own safety twothir ds of survey participants mentioned the negative impact of the notification process on their family members including parents siblings and children five of the respondents who lived in the same communities as their victims expressed concern for how notification and renewed public attention might affect their victims while only few of the interviewed sex offenders thought the tification would prevent reoffending by making their actions more visible to the public majority suggested that the pressure they felt from the public and the media w ould drive many sex offenders back to prison35 federal funding in support of registration and notification requirements federal laws directly or indirectly relating to sex offender registration have provided substantial funding over time to support collabor ative effort of federal state and local law enforcement both in combating crime and in sharing information across jurisdictional and state lines th following

hereafter cited as csom recidivism of sex offenders 42 ibid 43 ibid pp 34recidivism rates recidivism is broadly defi ned as the commission of subsequent offense major factor that influenced passage of sex offender regi stration and community notification laws is the perception that the recidivism rate for sex offenders is extremely high results of studies of sex offender recidivism vary greatly and actually contribute to the confusion surrounding the act ual rate of sex offe nder recidivism in 2001 report that examined available re search the center for sex offender management csom identified several r easons for the contradictory findings of studies of sex offender recidi vism such as how recidivism is defined the sample of sex offenders and behaviors included in each study and the length of the time period studied41 according to csom the definition of recidivism can be measured by determining whether there is new arre st new conviction or new commitment to correctional institution while each of these criteria is valid measure of recidivism each measures something different leading to varied outcomes for instance when recidivism is measured using new arrests or charges as the criteria the recidivism rate will be higher because more individuals are arrested than are convicted when subsequent conviction is the criterion for m easuring recidivism the rate of recidivism is lower when the criterion for determining recidivism is return to prison it must be determined whet her the return to prison was because of the commission of new offense or technical violation of parole such as consuming liquor or being alone with minor child otherwise technical violation could alter the recidivism rate because it could include as recidivists individuals who may not have committed subsequent criminal offense42 many studies rely on official criminal justice system data to measure recidivism which presents problems because crimes of sexual assault ar greatly underreported also researchers must determine the speci fic behaviors that qua lify sex offenders as recidivists for example will the commission of any crime be sufficient to qualify as recidivating offense or will only sex offenses be considered if sex offense qualifies as recidivating offense then researchers must decide whether to include felonies and misdemeanors answers to these kinds of stions affect the level of recidivism reported in each study43 csom studies csom reports that while the vast majority of sex offenders are males they are heterogeneous group they include persons who have engaged in sex with children and family members as well as those who have sexually assaultedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32800crs41 44 ibid p 8 45 ibid p 4 46 ibid p 11 47 metaanalysis relies upon

and criminal sexual behaviors to reduce confusing results of sex offender recidivi sm csom states that studies should recognize this heterogene ity and examine specific types of sex offenders44 the period in which study monitors gr oup of sex offenders can also affect the reported recidivism rate although to ensure statistical integrity all individuals in study should have the same length of time in commun ity and consequently the same opportunity to commit subsequent offe nses often that is not the case in actuality some individuals in 10year followup study may have been in the community for eight or nine years while others were out of prison for only two years to correct this problem csom suggests that survival analysis should be used which is methodology that considers the amount of time each subject has been in the community rather than simple percentage many researchers believe that an ideal followup period for recidivism st udies is five years or more45 from public policy perspective recidi vism remains valuable measure of how various interventions with criminal offenders are performing46 the noted caveats regarding studies of sex offender recidivism notwithstanding seve ral notable efforts have been made to provide synthesis of studies of x offender recidivism one of the techniques used to summarize the findings of multiple studies is metaanalysis47 using metaanalysis approach has some advantages in that it can reveal the relativeimportance of number of factors affectin g recidivism across studies also the consistent appearance of certain offender and offense characteristics across different studies allows an estimate of how strongly they relate to recidivism in 1998 study hanson and bussiere th at used the metaanalysis technique offender and offense characteristics were grouped by demographics cr iminal lifestyle sexual criminal history sexual deviancy and some clinical characteristics 48 the study found consistent relationshi p between sexual offending and being young and single sex offenders were likely to recidivate if they had prior sex offense had male victims victimized strangers rather than family members started sex offending

analysis revealed that the factors with the strongest relationship to sexual offens recidivism were sexual in terest in children deviant sexual preferences and sexual interest in boys the study found that having general psychological problems was unrelated to xual offense recidivism but that having personality disorder was related another finding was that failure to complete treatment was moderate predictor of xual offense recidivi sm the study also found that being sexually abused as child was unrelated to sexual offense recidivism knowledge of these historical or static f actors helps to predic t the relative likelihood of reoffending49 studies that take into account changes over time dynamic factors can inform about the most useful types of interventi ons in lowering the risk of recidivism another fiveyear study conducted in 1998 hanson and harris focused on dynamic factors50 this study collected data on over 400 sex offenders under community supervision of whom about half were recidivists who had committed new sexual offense during the fiveyear followup pe riod the study revealed number of significant differences in dynamic factors be tween recidivists and nonrecidivists for instance employment status and drug habit of sex offender were found to play role in recidivism recidivists we re more likely to be unemployed especially rapists and to have substance abuse problems nonrecidivists were likely to have positive social influences but tended to have intimacy problems attitudinal differences between recidivists and nonrecidivists also were identified the recidivists in the study who had committed subsequent sex offenses tended to be less remorseful or concerned about the victim they were less likely to acknowledge that they were likely to reoffend and were less likely to avoid highrisk situations in this study recidivists were more likely to report engaging in deviant sexual activities compared to non recidivists the lifestyle of recidivists tended to be more ch aotic and antisocial51 bureau of justice statistics study the bureau of justice statistics bjs conducted study involving 9691 male sex offenders among 272111 prisoners
