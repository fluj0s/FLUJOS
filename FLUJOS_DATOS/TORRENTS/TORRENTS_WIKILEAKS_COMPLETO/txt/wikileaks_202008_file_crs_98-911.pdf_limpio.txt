in the wye memorandum would mea n 100 effort on the part of the palestinian authority to combat terrorism as israel and the united states have demanded it cannot however ensure complete effectiveness the parties reactions to terrorist incidents may indicate the extent to which they will let opponents of the peace process influence its progress and test their dedication to pursuing the process furthe rmore as with many diplomatic documents the wye memorandum itsel f contains potential pitfalls for example the statement about unilateral actions may not impede such behavior unilateral actions has been understood to refer especially t israeli settlement activity and to palestinian declaration of statehood shortly afte r signing the memorandum prime minister netanyahu declared that nothing in th memorandum affects israels right to ex pand settlements in the west bank he said we are building throughout the land of i srael and in jerusalem and he specifically promised to build 2000 homes on the disputed har homajabal abu ghneim site in south eas t jerusalem work has begun to expand jewish settlement near hebron will israel s action provoke pa lestinian protests and if so how will the palestinian authority react to them and to the construction meanwhile chairman arafat reiterated his right to declare palestinian state on may 4 1999 when the inter im period expires how will israel react if he does the answers to these questions may pose problems for the peace process most deadlines included in earlier israelipalestinian agreements have not been met the time line attached to the memorandum is tight it codifies israels insistence n reciprocity whereby one partys act triggers the other partys act at each stage th process could break down the effective date of the memorandum already has bee n postponed to allow the israeli cabinet and knesset parliament time for ratification and because of israels doubts about the palestinians performance moreover the accor d expects the rapid resoluti on of safe passage and seaport issues that have not been settled for three years and apparently could not be achieved during intensive talks at wye the memorandum defers to committee the issue of third israeli redeployment from the west bank but gives the committee deadline for its work netanyahu would like to limit the redeployment to 1 of territory but the palestinians expect much more finally by inserting an active us role in security matters the memorandum ma produce only limited direct contacts between the parties and fail to rebuild trust issues for congress role of the cia president clinton personally mediated over 70 hours of the talk s to achieve the wye memorandum because of the parties mutual distrust the unite d states agreed to undertake very active unprecedented role the united states i s mentioned repeatedly in the security section of the memorandum central intelligenc agency director george tenet was among its negotiators and most references to th united states are understood to create an unusually visible role for the cia som member s of congress have expressed concern about this development and the senat select committee on intelligence

intelligence resources from other4 important assignments to oversight of wye memorandum security measures also ma generate concerns about the cias role us assurances us officials provided letters of assurance to the israel i government and reportedly to the palestinian authorit affirming us policy to israel they pledged inter alia that the us commitment to israels security is ironclad that only israel can determine its own security needs and decide on satisfactory solutions that third israeli redeployment is for israel to implement not negotiate and that the us maintains tha t acceptable solutions can be found only through negotiations not unilateral acts5 the united states government appears to be responsible for the implementation f much of the wye memorandum if the administration is so committed to the success of its policy might it gloss over noncompliance possible us failure to perform to th satisfaction of either party may lead unintentionally to troubled relations aid at the signing ceremony president clinton said that he would consult wit h congress to design package of aid to help israel meet the security costs of redeployment and help the palestinian authority meet the economic costs of development this is i n addition to technical and other assistance to the palestinians specified in th memorandum to help enable the palestinians to fulfill their security commitments secretary of state albright clarified that the united stat would lead major donor effort to help develop the palestinian economy as well as seek to increase its own assistance6 heretofore congress has made aid to the palestinians conditional on their complianc with agreements with israel7
