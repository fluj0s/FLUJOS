divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31849energy selected facts and numbers summary energy supplies and prices are major economic factors in the united states and energy markets are volatile and unpredictable thus energy policy has been recurring issue for congress si nce the first major crisis in the 1970s as an aid in policy making this report presents current and historical view of the supply and consumption of various forms of energy the historical trends show petroleum as the major source of energy rising from about 38 in 1950 to 45 in 1975 then dec lining to about 40 in response to the energy crisis of the 1970s significantly the transportation sector has been and continues to be almost completely pendent on petroleum mostly gasoline natural gas followed similar pattern at lower level increasing its share of total energy from about 17 in 1950 to more than 30 in 1970 then declining to about 20 consumption of coal in 1950 was 35 of the total lmost equal to oil but it declined to about 20 decade later and has remained at about that proportion since then coal currently is used almost exclusively for electric power generation nuclear power started coming online in significant amounts in the late 1960s and by 1975 in the midst of the oil crisis was supplying 9 of total electricity generation however increases in capita l costs construction delays and public opposition to nuclear power following the three mile island accident in 1979 curtailed expansion of the technology and many construction projects were cancelled continuation of some construction increased the nuclear share of generation to 20 in 1990 where it remains currently the first new reactor license applications in nearly 30 years were recently submitted but new plants are currently under constr uction or on order construction of major hydroelectric projects has also essentially ceased and hydropowers share of electricity genera tion has gradually d eclined from 30 in 1950 to 15 in 1975 and less than 10 in 2000 however hydropower remains highly important on regional basis renewable energy sources except hydropow er continue to offer more potential than actual energy production although fuel ethanol has become significant factor in transportation fuel and wind power has recently grown rapidly conservation and energy efficiency have shown significant gains over the past three decades and offer encouraging potential to relieve some of the dependence on imports that has caused economic difficulties in the past as well as the present after an introductory overview

complicated by variations in different energy markets these mark ets for the most part ope rate independe ntly although events in one may influence trends in anot her for instance oil price movement can affect the price of natural gas which then plays significant role in the price of electricity since aggregat indicators of total energy production and consumption do not adequately reflect these complexities this compendium focuses on the details of individual energy sectors primary among these are oil particularly gasoline for transportation and electricity generation and consumption natural gas is also an important energy source for home heatin g as well as in industry and electricity generation coal is used almost entirel for electricity generation nuclear and hydropower completely so renewable sources except hydropower c ontinue to offer more potential than actual energy production although fuel etha nol has become significant factor in transportation fuel and wind power has recently grown rapidly conservation and energy efficiency have shown significant gains over the past three decades and offer encouraging potential to relieve some of the dependence on imports that has caused economic difficulties in the past as well as the present to give general view of energy consumption trends table 1 shows consumption by economic sector reside ntial commercial transportation and industry from 1950 to the present to supplement this overview some of the trends are highlighted by graphs in figures 1 and 2 in viewing these figures note on units of energy may be helpful each source has its own unit of energy oil consumption for instance is measured in million barrels per day mbd1 coal in million tons per year natural gas in trillion cubic feet tcf per year to aggregate various types of energy in single table common measure british thermal unit btu is often used in table 1 energy consumption by sector is given in units of quadrillion btus per year or quads while per capita consumption is given in million btus mmbtu per year one quad corresponds to one tcf of natural gas or approximately 50 million tons of coal one million barrels per day of oil is approximately 2 quads per year one million btus is equivalent to approximately 293 k ilowatthours kwh of electricityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31849crs2 2 in calculating these percentages electri c energy consumption includes both the energy value of the kilowatthours consumed and the energy lost in generating that electricitytable 1 shows that total us energy consumption almost tripled since 1950 with the industrial sector the heaviest ener gy user growing at the slowest rate the growth in energy consumption per capita ie per person over the same period was about 50 as figure 1 illustrates much of the growth in per capita energy consumption took place before 1970 table 1 does not list the consumption of energy by the electricity sector separately because it is both producer and consumer of energy for the residential commercial i ndustrial and transportation sectors the consumption figures given are the sum of the resources such as oil and gas that are directly consumed plus the total energy used to produce the electricity each sector consumed that is both the energy value of the kilowatthours consumed and the energy lost in generating that electricity as figure 2 demonstrates major trend during the period was the electrification of the resi dential and commercia l sectors and to lesser extent industry by 2007 electricity including the energy lost in generating it represented about 70 of residential energy consumption about 80 of commercial energy consumption and about third of industrial energy consumption2 table 1 us energy consumption 19502007 energy consumption by sector

mostly gasoline the perception that the world is on the ve rge of running out of oil widespread during the 1970s has changed however the ra pid price increases at that time aided by improved exploration nd production technology stimu lated global search for oil and resulted in the discovery of rge amounts of new reserves indeed as concerns about tightening supply and contin ually increasing prices were at peak proven reserves actually increased by about 50 between 1973 and 1990 some of the increase was in the western hemisphere mostly in mexico but most was located in the region that already dominated the world oil market the middle east with prices essentially steady during the 1990s th search for oil slowed but additions to reserves during the decade exceeded the amount of il pumped out of the ground by 2003 improved technology for retrieving petroleum from oil sands in canada and to lesser extent from heavy oil in venezuela led to significant production from

consumption of petroleum by sector reflects variety of trends see table 3 in the residential and commercial sectors petroleum consumption grew steadily from 1950 to 1970 while accounting for about 15 of total petroleum c onsumption after the price surge in the 1970s consumption in those sectors declined falling to less than 7 of total petroleum consumption by 1995 when oil prices surged again after 2005 consumption declined further to about 5 usage in the electric power sector followed similar but more abrupt patter n until 1965 only about 3 of petroleum went to power generation in the late 1960s efforts to improve air quality by reducing emissions led utilities to conve rt number of coalfired pow erplants to burn oil and many new plants were designed to burn il or natural gas utilities found themselves committed to increasing dependence on oil just at the time of shortages and high prices in 1975 almost 9 of oil c onsumption went for power production consumption then fell

similar dramatic incr ease about 6 of total petroleum consumption for transportati on in 1950 it ro to 11 by 1975 and to 20 in recent years diesel fuel is used by number of transportation sectors part of the increase involved the change of railr oads from coalfired st eam to diesel and dieselelectric power diesel fuel is used also in the marine transportation sector and some private automobiles are dieselpowered the major part of diesel fuel consumption in transportation is by larg commercial trucks total diesel fuel consumption increased from about 200000 barrels per day in 1950 to 30 million

power industry in creased gradually as access by pipeline became more widespread with the price increase in oil in the 1970s demand for gas also increased but interstate prices were regulated and gas availability declined in addition federal energy policy viewed gene ration of electricity by gas to be wasteful use of diminishing resource the fuel use act of 1978 prohibited new power generators from using gas and set timetable for shutting down existing gas fired plants gas prices were later dere gulated resulting in increased production and the fuel use act was repealed but in the meantime

construction delays and public opposition to nuclear power following the three mile island accident in 1979 curtailed expansion of the technology and many construction projects were cancelled
