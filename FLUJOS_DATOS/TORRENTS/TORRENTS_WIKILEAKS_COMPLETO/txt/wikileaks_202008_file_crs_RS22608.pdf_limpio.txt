promotion authority tpa formerly known as fasttrack authority is scheduled to expire july 1 2007 with it will expire the authority that congress grants the president to enter into certain trade agreements and the authority for congress to consider the agreements implementing legislation under expedited procedures currently the administration is negotiating number of trade agreements that may not be completed before tpa is set to expire if these activities are to continue tpa renewal may be central issue in the 110 th congress within the debate major issue is expected to be whether to include as principal negotiating objective in trade agreements enforceable core labor standards the current tpa is contained in the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 title xxi of the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 total of nine free trade agreements ftas have been negotiated under this authority they are with chile singapore australia morocco bahrain oman the dominican republic and central america peru and colombia the last two await congressional consideration the labor issue in these trade agreements is how key provisions in each reflect two principal negotiating objectives in tpa the first tpa principal negotiating objective is to ensure that party does not fail to enforce its own labor laws through sustained or recurring course of action or inaction in manner affecting trade between the parties all nine ftas track this principal negotiating objective by providing that countries shall not fail to enfo rce their own labor laws in manner affecting trade between the partiespopularly called the enforceyourown provision the second tpa principal negotiating objective is to seek dispute settlement and enforcement provisions that treat us principal negotiating objectives equally with respect to the ability to resort to dispute settlement the availability of equivalent dispute settlement procedures and the availability of equivalent remedies in what labor advocates see as departure from the tpa provision procedures for labor disputes differ in several respects from those for commercial disputes and include cap on monetary penalties while those for commercial disputes do not g13g142g162g561g18g149g138g162g142g155g156g561g138g151g141g561g22g145g142g146g155g561g18g152g156g146g157g146g152g151g156g561 those calling for expanded or strengthened labor provisions fault labor protections in the nine ftas 2 arguing that they 1 lack the enforceability of commercial provisions 2 fail to meet some congressional negotiating objectives and barely comply with others 3 represent big step back from both the usjordan fta and us unilateral trade preference programs such as the generalized system of preferences gsp3 and 4 completely exclude obligations for 1 for general discussion on tpa renewal see crs report rl33743 trade promotion authority tpa issues options and prospects for renewal by j f hornbeck and william h cooper 2 see for example us chile free trade agreement report of the labor advisory committee for trade negotiations and trade policy lac february 28 2003 p 3 3 the jordan fta in which all provisions are technically equally enforceable requires that parties reaffirm their obligations to uphold both core labor standards under the international labor organization ilo and internationally recognized worker rights under the us trade act of 1974 the gsp and other us trade preference laws require that eligible beneficiary countries be taking steps to afford their workers internationally recognized worker rights defined on

these advocates further argue that in order to strengthen fta provisions the blueprint for their negotiationthe tpa languageneeds to be strengthened advocates of strengthened labor provisions in promoting enforceable core labor standards appear to have two objectives the first objective could be characterized as humanitarian to promote the protection of workers around the world particularly those in developing countries where protections are weak andor poorly enforced the second objective could be interpreted as economic to help level the playing field between us and foreign workers so that us workers can compete on more equitable basis opponents respond in support of the current tpa noting that labor provisions in the nine ftas negotiated under it 1 are the strongest labor provisions attached to ftas to date 2 are the product of bilateral negotiation and 3 both depend on and reflect mutual agreement by negotiating countries 4 treat us principal negotiating objectives equally in that the principal remedies for labor and commercial disputes are equivalent and 5 are preferable to enforceable core labor standards because the latter could raise sovereignty issues opponents have as one key objective promotion of us investment they often represent the viewpoints of businesses and investors developing country governments and the current administration many business groups support the passage of tpa in order to facilitate the expansion of us multinational corporations abroadtheir most important avenue for continued growth in fact both tpa and trade agreements ty pically include many protections for investors developing countries care about protecting their ability to attract invest ment and are concerned about anything that might jeopardize that ability in the world trade organization wto developing countries have long resisted us proposals to study the relationship between worker rights and trade concerned that such study could lead to enforceable labor standards that could undercut their comparative advantage in lowcost labor however as with businesses and investors their flexibility to compromise on the issue of enforceable core labor standards seems to be related to the strength of their desire to have an fta with the united states

labor standards as principal negotiating objectives if tp were to be renewed include the following option 1 enforceable labor standards provisions this option would likely be viewed as step back from the expiring tpa option 2 renewal of the current enforceyourown provisions aiming 1 to ensure that party does not fail to enforce its own labor laws and 2 to seek dispute settlement provisions that treat us principal negotiating objectives equally and option 3 enforceable core labor standards as reflected in hr 3019 introduced in 2001 by representative charles rangel which aimed 1 to ensure that party does not fail to enforce core labor standards and 2 to provide that violation of these standards would be subject to enforcement under single set of dispute settlement procedures that would be applicable to all disputes under an fta

different sources the international labor organization ilo which calls them core labor standards and us trade law which refers to them as internationally recognized worker rights both definitions are almost identical and share four standards or rights 1 the right to organize 2 the right to bargain collectively 3 prohibition of forced labor and 4 protections for child labor including the worst forms of child labor4 they differ on the fifth standard us law identifies it as 5 labor standards pertaining to minimum wages maximum hours and occupational safety and health ilo conventions define it as 5 freedom from employment discrimination5

call for enforceable core labor standards include the aflcio human rights watch and the international labor rights fund6 labor advocates traditionally argue 1 that enforceable core labor standards help guard against race to the bottom as workers all over the world compete against each other for scarce jobs and 2 that labor standards do not interfere with natural comparative advantage in developing countries because labor standards are only one basis for comparative advantage others include abundance skills and education of available workforce infrastructure level of technological development of the country and natural resource base g3g144g138g146g151g156g157g561 opponents typically argue that 1 the enforceyourown standards model provides more direct less encumbered path to economic growth 2 most developing countries have few resources to devote to labor standards enforcement 3 once developing country is more economially developed and relatively near full employment labor standards and their enforcement begin to rise on their own and 4 imposing core labor standards on developing countries too soon could interfere with their comparative advantage in abundant and inexpensive labor and amount to protectionism 4 the worst forms of child labor include the employment of children for purposes including prostitution pornography drug trafficking armed conflict and forced labor 5 the us definition can be found in the trade act of 1974 sec 507 the current tpa in the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 title xxi of the trade act of 2002 combines the ilo name and the us list defining the us list as core labor standards 6 conversations with thea lee policy director aflcio carol pier labor rights and trade senior researcher human rights watch and

calling for enforceable core labor standards could help level the playing field for us workers and make them more competitive internationally g3g144g138g146g151g156g157g561 some opponents argue that the need or desire to earn living is often incentive enough to encourage displaced workers to find new employment others argue that there are better ways to help us workers than trying to level the playing field which at best may only slow the offshore movement or technological elimination of of some us jobs better way some argue would be to expand adjustment assistance benefits educational benefits or other training and retraining programs to cover all displaced workerswhether the job loss results from trade or technologyand help them transition into new careers

enforceable core labor standards can help foreign workers share in the gains of increasing productivity and economic expansion and thereby become consumers in their own right g3g144g138g146g151g156g157g561 opponents argue that real gains in standard of living in developing countries come from rising productivity not from artificially imposed labor standards including minimum wages in addition they argue some workers do not want enforceable core labor standards because these could limit their ability to maximize their earnings by working overtime

principal negotiating objective could argue that the ilo already requires that countries comply with ilo core labor standards as condition of continued membership in good standing even if those countries do not formally approve the ilo conventions therefore incorporating enforceable core labor standards into trade agreements does not add much more to this requirement 7 7 about the

enforceable core labor standards interfere with national sovereignty in way that ilo membership does not since enforcement powers of the ilo are limited to consensus and persuasion

as principal negotiating objective for trade agreements the aflcio is strongly in favor of using the ilo definition over the us definition see p 4 for definitions because it is more current human rights watch while not arguing for either definition specifically stresses that the definition of core labor standards must include prohibitions against employment discrimination which is in the ilo but not the us definition g3g144g138g146g151g156g157g561 if the ilo definition were adopted opponents point out foreign governments could hold existing us labor laws up to scrutiny arguing that they dont totally comply with ilo core labor standards this is because the united states has ratified only two conventions one on forced labor and one on the worst forms of child labor accordingly the us council for international business uscib argues that many us labor ws would need to be changed to come into compliance with the ilo definition of core labor standards especially in such areas as forced labor minimum age for employment and employment discrimination8

enforceable core labor standards is included in any such renewal international trade is likely to continue to expand in both volume and complexity the economic effects on trade investment and labor markets of including enforceable core labor standards as principal negotiating objective in tpa renewal could be relatively limited they would likely depend on number of factors including 1 the extent to which enforceable core labor standards were adopted and implemented in trade agreements 2 the number of trade agreements affected 3 the magnitude of us trade with countries under such agreements and 4 the extent of actual forcement of those standards in trade agreements in addition the effects from any of these four factors could be dwarfed by shifts in the value of the dollar that might occur relative to other currencies 8 crs communication from adam b greene vice president labor affairs and corporate responsibility uscib january 18 2007 echoing the conclusion of number of studies by

negotiating objective in tpa legislation whether or not the united states would need to make changes to its labor laws could depend on how the legislation defined the term core labor standards if tpa is not renewed or if it should be renewed without enforceable core labor standards number of ways might be available to promote labor standards and protect worker rights these include enforceable standards currently incorporated into us trade preference laws continuing efforts of the ilo to promote core labor standards the efforts of various labor advocates and international labor watchdog groups economic development forces in various countries which eventually lead to rising international demand for protections of the rights of workers codes of conduct guiding the actions of corporations in protecting the rights of international workers and us government trade capacity building grants which help to improve labor standards in developing countries
