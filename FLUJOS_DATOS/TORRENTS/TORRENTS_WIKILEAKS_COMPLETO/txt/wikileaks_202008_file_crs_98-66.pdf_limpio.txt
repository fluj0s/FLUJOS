agreement nafta and particularly maquiladoras or crossborde r production sharing plants maquiladoras generate large portion of usmexico trade yet the economic effects are not widely understood many believe there is benefit to such trade because it leads to the loss of us jobs production and wages maquiladora products however have high us content that in addition to fostering productivit gains in both countries may actually minimize the loss of us jobs by allowing th higher paying jobs to stay at home rather than be shipped entirely abroad for example to asia still adjustment to globalized production creates challenges particularly i n addressi ng the plight of lowskilled workers who become unemployed research however continues to point to dom estic rather than trade policy for the likely solutions particularly the emphasis on education and training programs mexico is the united states third l argest trading partner accounting for 9 of us world trade the significance of these figures however rests not so much on the trade itself but on the longterm economic integration that it reflec ts the maquiladora program emerged in the 1960s to encourage such integration theme that was further embraced and broadened three decades later with passage of the north american free trad agreement nafta critics contend that both arrangements hurt the us econom because they ncourage businesses and jobs to migrate south of the border this report1 examines the economics of maquiladoras nafta and deepening integration between the united states and mexico particularly the eff ects

treatment to the trade that it generates with respect to u smexico trade both countries have legislated such preferences in mexico shared production is governed under th maquiladora program spanish word in modern use denoting crossborder assembly it began in 1965 when mexico decreed that certain imports could enter duty free provided that once processed or assembled the end products would be exported the united states reciprocates under customs heading 9802 of the harmonized tariff schedule hts which allows goods manufactured or assembled in foreign plants using us parts to be imported with tariffs applied only on the value added abroad thes provisions are used by firms in many countries particular ly in the caribbean and southeast asia and cover various types of products such as automobiles apparel an d semiconductors the total value of hts 9802 imports in 1996 was 675 billion or 9 of total us imports although the percentage of productionshared imports may be s high as 15 because many from canada and mexico come in under nafta provisions and so are not counted under the 9802 heading3 mexico is the major source of us productionshared trade accounting for 41 of total hts 9802 imports in 1996 and 62 of those imports from developing countries as seen in table 1 the amount of us hts 9802 exports rose from 218 of total exports to mexico in 1991 to 281 in 1996 over the same time period the amount of ht s 9802 impor ts fell from 471 to 376 of total mexican imports this decrease however presen ts an inaccurate picture because as mentioned above there is way to track productionshared imports that enter the united states under nafta provisions other indicators suggest that productionshared imports are still growing despite decreasing ability to quantify them4 maquiladoras clearly have prospered under these i ncentives in 1975 they employed 67214 workers i n 454 plants producing 1 billion worth of goods by 1996 there were 754858 employees in 2411 plants

bilateral trade is occurring under nafta because 1 nafta is formall phasing out the maquiladora program which will end on january 1 2001 and 2 nafta9 provisions are less cumber some than dealing with the hts 9802 program elimination of the maquiladora program provides another benefit to us firms operating in mexico b allowing their products easier access to the local market second nafta is attracting n onus foreign investment to mexico mostly asian as way to access the us market foreign producers in mexico benefit from 1 naftas rules of origin which raise tariffs on traded goods that do not have certai n percenta ge of nafta country content 2 the 1994 peso devaluation which furthe r lowered the cost of labor in mexico and 3 mexicos proximity to the us as both supplier and final product market for these reasons it is critical to understand th e10 economic incentives that drive production sharing as well as the tradeoffs involved the economics of productionshared trade the benefits of trade between two countries is perhaps best understood when i t involves different goods the united states does not grow bananas and honduras does not make airplanes which leads to trade even when two countries can produce lik goods they tend to trade for the final products that the other produces relatively mor efficiently which is the concept of comparative advantage finally when production within industries and firms takes place in different countries the intraindustry trade reflects the economic integration taking place because countries are export ing and importing similar products questions arise over how to measure the benefits of this type of trade common but erroneous notio n suggests that such trade amounts to net gain the united states is simply drawing even or losing by exporting and importing the same goods and in the process also exporting jobs to mexico apparently counterintuitive is the idea that such intraindustry trade i s exactly the type of exchange to be expected from economic integration and was in fact the goal of policies put in place since the 1960s such as the maquiladora program i n mexico or uscanada auto trade agreement firms engage in production sharing to reduce costs increase efficiency and remain competitive in the global economy and how they accomplish these goals determines the type of intra industry trade that takes place firms can reduce costs by undertaking what economists refer to as rationa lizing production where savings are first realized by using specialized plants that engage in one stage of the production process or in one particular product second specialization leads to economies of scale and additional cost savings third close geographic proximity minimizes transportation costs thereby encouragin g border trade these types of cost reductions promote int raindustry trade with canada and mexico in sophisticated products such as automobiles and partshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9866crs5 for textbook

trade ho wever is explained by traditional trade theory that emphasizes relative factor costs capital and labor mexico has comparative advantage in low wage labor which allows the two countries to specialize in different stages of production that have different input mixes generally lower wag economie s such as mexico inherit certain industry segments assembly while mor develope d economies like the united states remain competitive producing in othe r segments specialized inputs or more sophisticated downstream prod uction consistent with their relative abundance of capital technology and high skilled workers this is i n11 keeping with economic development patterns nationally and worldwide for example this explains the migration of textile manufacturing in the united states from new england to the south that began in the 1920s internationally the same incentives now drive th movement of similar us lowwage jobs abroad in fact production sharing arrangements exist all over the world based on relativ labor costs and are further nurtured by trade agreements and other government policie s eg hts 9802 us firms have affiliate arrangements in southeast asia and th caribbean japan

sharing tradeoffs and adjustment in the us economy although maquiladoras will fade away under nafta as separate and privilege d sector of usmexico trade produ ction sharing will not it will likely increase indicative of the trend toward globalized production that transcends the maquiladora program nafta and u smexico trade this trend points to world in which productio n arrange ments create partnerships across national boundaries that previously were mad within countrie s measuring imports and exports within industry groups may even give false sense of competition where complementary relationships exist economists believe this fosters increased productivity faster economic gro wth and ultimately higher standards of living despite the benefits for the world as whole it is also widely accepted tha t globalization presents challenges as well as opportunities because industr y13 adjustments do not lead to gains that are distributed evenly eit her among countries or within them concerns over these challenges thrive in the united states where many argue that production and trade from maquiladoras have resulted in lost jobs and falling wages particularly in such in dustries as textiles indeed production shifts to mexico have shown up in the trade data with textile mill imports mostly knitted products rising 247 from 1993 to 1996 whereas textile mill exports to mexico most
