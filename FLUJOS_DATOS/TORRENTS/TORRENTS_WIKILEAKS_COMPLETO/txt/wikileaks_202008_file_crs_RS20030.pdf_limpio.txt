negotiations all by carol migdalovitz this report will not be updated introduction1 on januar 17 1999 the turkish parliament approved the fourth coalitio n government since the decembe r 1995 national election the governments main task will be to take the country to early national elections to be held simultaneously with loca l elections on april 18 1999 the government has truncat ed domestic program and will likely continue current foreign policies parliament has not passed any political reforms during the past three years therefore the election results may repeat or increase th current divisive part lineup and political instability is likely to persist despite concern that islamists may make strong showing as in 1995 party leaders favor holding th elections as scheduled only the powerful military appears uneasyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20030crs2 background turkey has multiparty political system in which the president is head of state and the prime minister is head of gov ernment in line with the 1982 constitution the turkish general staff tgs t he military leadership ensures that the state is governed according to the principles of mustafa kemal ataturk founder f the republic in 1923 the military has served as guarantor of secularism with particular vigilance since 1995 in december 1995 five parties won seats in parliam ent but none achieved more than 21 of the vote the islamist refah welfare par ty won the largest number of votes and most seats in parliament ostensible fear of refahs agenda and potential threat t secularism led centerright archriva ls mesut yilmaz of the motherland party anap and tansu ciller of the true path party dyp to form coalition with yilmaz as prim minister their personal animositie s however scuttled the effort within months in june 1996 ciller joined coalition under the prime ministry of refah leader necmetti n erbakan creati ng the first islamistled government of modern turkey the military soon charged that islamism was spreading in religious schools foundations the bureaucracy and even the police and armed forces and mobilized the media and civil society against the governm ent the resulting outcry combined with the refah and dyp leaders politica l miscalculations to produce their downfall the constitutional court eventually banne d refah for undermining the secular regime anaps yilmaz formed the next government in july 1997 with the democratic left party dsp of bulent ecevit the democrati c turkey party dtp group of defectors from the dyp and independents despit having three plus parties the governmen t lacked majority in parliament and relied for its survival on the republican peoples party chp led by deniz baykal who chose not to join them althoug h prime minister yilmazs initial priorities included electoral reforms parliament did not pass any instead the gov ernment emphasized the economy and made some needed advances it concluded an innovative oversight agreement with th internation monetary fund imf and in line with this accord inflation fell in 199 8 from an annual rate of 91 to 547 the government held the line on public secto r wages had some privatization successes and improved tax collections to pass the tax reform and other legislation however yilmaz had to make deal in june 1998 wit h baykal wherein baykal agreed not to oppose leg islation and yilmaz agreed to step down in decemb er 1998 in favor of transitional nonpartisan government that would lead to early elections in april 1999 the regular schedule called for an election later in 2000 in the following months neither man appeared to be fully committed to his part of th bargain or to trust the other although tax reform passed in november 1998 the prime minister was accused of corruption for allegedly assisting in the sale of stateowned bank to businessman said to have ties to organized crime baykal and ciller exploited th political opportunity presented by the scandal to force yilmazs departure under cloud few weeks earlier than planned yilmaz refused t resign of his own volition but he lost censure vote on november 25 and was compelled to do so president suleyman demirel then turned to democratic left party dsp leade r ecevit to form government dsp holds only 61 out of 550 seats in parliament an d ecevit required the cooperation of other political leaders to fulf ill his task as secularist ecevit ruled out bringing refahs successor the fazilet virtue party fp int ohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20030crs3 the turkish national security council is comprised of an equal number of civilian and military2 officials but the military drives the genda and civilian dissent from recommendations at meetings is not made p ublic its constitutional role is to formulate and implement national security policy which is defined very broadly in practicegovernment yilmaz was w illing to work with ecevit again but other party leaders were less accommodat ing ciller seeking to become prime minister herself to thwart ecevit and to appeal to fps constituency demanded an allparty government including fp baykal whose chp holds fewer seats in parliament than d sp demanded an equal number of ministries fo r all parties despite their parliamentary strengths ecevit was stymied and returned his mandate on december 21 demirel perhaps seeking to undermine hi s nemesis ciller next turned to the openly ambit ious independent yalim erez key ciller advisor and minister of industry in the refahdyp coalition erez had bolted the dyp and that government when it came under attack from the military and others he held the same portfolio in the yilmaz government as an independent erez reportedly was on the verge of forming government on january 4 1999 when ciller worried about hi s potential to split her party and resentful of his 1997 defection proposed that ecevit lead dsp minority government which she and yilmaz would support from the outside yilmaz still vulnerable to possible legal action for corruption should his parliamentar immunity be lifted went alo ng with his rivals idea since it was one of the alternatives he had proposed earlier ecevit agreed on january 11 ecevit presented government formed almost entirely from his party with only the interior justice and transportation ministries held by independents s constitutionally required of any government in the runup to elections cillers influenc on the governments formation is clear in the choice of one of her former advisors fo r justice minister and in the promotion of the education minister who had angere d islamists observers re mark on the fact that she remains political force despite having earned the lasting ntipathy of the military due to her championship of refah and fazilet role of the military the military has been frustrated by the inaction of the politicians against islamism the general staffs oppos ition to fundamentalism called reactionism in turkey has been unabated since befor the national security council issued list of recommendations or2 ultimata to ensure th protection of secularism on february 28 1997 the governments in power since then have not implement ed many of the recommendations other than law requiring 8 years of public education to prevent islamic schools from reaching children at impression able ages and more rigorous controversial enforcement of ban on hea d scarves in public institutions some conservative muslim legislators from parties othe r than refahfazilet are offended by the proposals others are reluctant to alienat conservative muslim constituencies who may manifest power at the polls the composition of the turkish general staff changed routinely in august 1998 with the replacement of the chief of staff his deputy and several commanders but its anti islamist determination has not as evidenced by recent stateme nts on november 30 1998 the office of the chief of the genera l staff rebuked fazilet party fp leader recai kutan

turkish view s abroad significantly the brochure observed it is compatible with democracy to ba n political entities that want to abolish secularism and destroy democracy the militar academies issued booklet calling for new war of national liberation against islamic activism and on parliament to pass legislation to protect the secularist republic 3 it is unclear whether the militarys sentiments will be translated into action in th past special pr osecutors seem to have carried out the militarys preferences yet normal legal processes would take months to ban fazilet should grounds be found as they did refah the socalled soft coup of february 1997 took several months to end the refah dyp government nd revealed that the military may be reluctant to intervene as directly as it did in 1960 and 1980 an election dreaded by the military because it might confirm continuing islamist strength therefore will likely occur despite those fears bulent ecevit4 bulent ecevit was born in istanbul in 1925 he gra duated from the american robert college in 1946 and became journalist in 1959 he was elected to parliament as republican peoples party chp deputy and became party chairman in 1965 ecevi t

observers and highlighted the dominance of personality over policy i n turkish politics as well as ecevits essential patriotism ecevit and his dsp cohor t controlled turkeys foreign policy and it reflected his nationalism and assertiveness ironically their policies and ardent secularism are similar to those of the military government programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20030crs5 ecevit on goals iraqi crisis incirlik interview on ntv january 12 1999 translation carried5 by fbis online january 12 1999 reuters november 4 19986ecevit has acknowledged that his governments main task is to lead the country to the election he expressed hope to pa ss budget social security reform and banking reform to signal turkeys trustworthiness to the international monetary fund imf an d international bankers and possibly secure financial agreement turkey has large deb t service payments due in early 1999 and has been harmed by the global financial crisis however the government is not expected to accomplish ven this modest agenda half year budget is in place and could last through the election although perhaps not until new government i s formed differences among parties over raising retirement ages have not been r econciled and some have reservations over bank regulation moreover members of parliament have had notoriously poor atte ndance and already are abandoning ankara to campaign parliament will likely recess in early february significantly electoral reforms that might ve produced twostage vote to contain the islamists and other legislation to guarantee the right of expatriates to vote are not on ecevits legislative agenda the lack of absentee voter rights could lead to challenges to the legitimacy of the election while an unchanged electoral system may perpetuate th profusion of parties in parliament and gridlock foreign policy issues and implications for the united states because dsp controlled fo reign policy in the previous government surprises are expected some officials intemperate statements may irk the us state department as in the past but they are unlikely to be matched by actions although viewed s instinctively suspicious of the united s tates ecevit nonetheless appears to appreciate the united states superpower status and its recognition of turkey s strategic importance the following current issues of concern to turkey also concern the us administration r congress iraq in his statements ecevit fondly recalls the pregulf war period whe n neighbori ng iraq was turkeys second largest market and he visited baghdad severa l times he is reported to be distrustful of what he believes to be the intent of the west including the united states to dismember ira q and create kurdish state in the north that would serve as precedent for t he division of turkey which has been fighting kurdistan workers party pkk separatists for 15 yea rs ecevit has faulted us policy toward iraq for lacking vision of postsaddam future and called for usturkish dialogue on the subject he also charged that us planes enforcing the nofly zone over northern iraq from incirl ik air base in southeast turkey operation northern watch have been firing on iraqi targets on the pretext that they have been targeted themselves on the othe r hand ecevit has said that it is incumbent on iraq to act in greater harmony with th world and observed earlier that baghd ads failure to cooperate with investigations of its5 weapons of mass dest ruction was dangerous while critical of the united states ecevit6 probably will not impede northern wa tch whose mandate the turkish parliament renews every six mon ths interestingly at the same time that ecevit was questioning us policy toward iraq his government requested an d rapidly received us patriot missiles to shield turkey from an unlikely iraqi attack httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20030crs6 cyprus unofficiall ecevit says that the cyprus question was solved by the peace operation of 1974 officially he supports turkish cypriot leader rauf denktashs call for confederation of two sovereign states as opposed to unendorsed federation ecevit and denktash announced the partial integration of turkish cyprus with turkey in july 1997 in response to european union membership talks with the greekcypriotled cyprus government although dec ember 1998 security council resolution called for new initiatives to reach settlement and president clinton vowed to take l necessary steps to support the security council resolutions new or us initiatives are expected before the turkish election the and us statement s provided an opening for the greekcypriots to cancel plans to deploy russian s300 anti aircraft missiles and avert missile crisis turkey made concessions in exchange for the cancellation and criticized the resolutions greece us nato allies turkey and greece have history of strained relations which hav worsened since january 1996 dispute over rocky islet in the aegean sea and since greece vetoed european union eu financial aid for turkey and oppose d turkeys eu membership c andidacy greece insists that the cyprus issue be solved and that turkey agree to take the islet and another aegean dispute to the international court of justice before athens lifts its veto prime minister costas simitis has lost popula r support at home due to hardships engendered by his economic program to achiev european monetary union membership weak simitis is unlikely to reach out to weak shortterm government in ankara that would not reciprocate unless athen s concedes on eu issues the ecevit governme nt is unlikely to compromise on cyprus and has stepped up its rhetorical challenges on the aegean this portends continuin g stalemate in bad bilateral relations and work for us policyma kers seeking to better them while crisis is anticipate d in the near term the 1996 crisis was unanticipated ignited by actions of citizens uncontrolled by the governments in either athens or ankara europe the united states has sought to anchor muslim turkey in the west b drawing it closer to the european union the achievement of this goal appears to have been blocked temporarily as events have moved turkey and europe farther apart and improvement is in sight turkey has appeared outwardly less caring about europe since the eu fail ed to include turkey on list of prospective members in december 1997 turkish officials engaged in vituperative undiplomatic recriminations against germany which they held responsible for the eu rejection and against italy for its refusal t extradite and later freeing of pkk leader abdullah oca lan the europeans have attempted to overcome strains for example the european commission developed plan to work around greeces funding veto and the eu joined us and efforts to encourag cyprus not to deploy the russian missiles but these acts had little positive effect n ecevit or on his ministers who suggested that the eu was merely doing what th situations required ecevits government has dropped what has sometimes been described as supplicants demeanor toward europe
