such volunt eers particularly medical personnel socalled volunteer health professionals vhp s will be protected from potential civil liability in carrying out their duties this report sketches the various federal and state liability protections av ailable to vhps responding to disasters generally with focus on the protections pplicable to the hurri cane katrina response introduction as volunteers pour into the regi on devastated by hurricane katrina some have raised questions as to the potential civil liability of those volunteer health professionals vhps indi vidual licensed medical prof essionals who gratuitously provide medical services who respond to the gulf regions clear need for medical skills and services the concern is that the specter of medical malpractice liability in particular may give pause to these vhps what follows is discussion of the patchwork of fede ral and state laws1 that operate to protect vhps in certain situations with focus on the gulf region which was hardest hit by hurricane katrina whether vhp is protected from civil liability depends on number of factors including under whos control the vhp operates and whether or not state of emergency has been declared the liability protections discussed in this report generally shield volunteers from civil liability for negligent conduct ie actions or failures to act that result in injuries or losses to others crimin conduct or willful intentional or grossly ne gligent conduct is not prot ected unless otherwise noted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22255crs2 2 federal sovereign

subsequent anthrax scare spurred some continuedsovereign immunity the federal and state governments generally enjoy sovereign immunity from suit2 while the federal and state governments have waived this immunity with the passage of the federal tort claims act3 and similar state tort claims acts these acts generally preclude suits in to rt against individual government employees4 one of the easiest ways to shield vhps from individual civil liability therefore is to make them temporary nonpaid empl oyees of the federal government5 or state government for liability purposes as noted below state governors generally have the authority under their emergency powers to make vhps tempor ary state employees emergency statutes and powers every state has regime for declaring state of emergency and such declaration can explicitly trigger liability protections or allow the governor to do so6 mississippis emergency management statute for example provides civil liability protection to state government employees and agents during declared emergency7 alabama protects much broader group of emergency management workers which includes all of those working for an entity res ponding to alabamas call for assistance during declared emergency8 some states have in addition to the general emergency procedures described above additional regimes fo r socalled public health emergencies phes the

emergency powers issued an executive order temporarily suspending all licensure requi rements for medical volunteers so long as they are licensed in other states and declaring such volunteers to be state employees shielded from civil liability13 volunteer protection acts and good samaritan statutes nearly every state has enacted some sort of volunteer pr otection act the protec tions of which vary the federal volunteer protection act vpa14 passed in 1997 provides baseline of liability protection in that the act preempts state standards that provide less protection than the act the vpa

services as part of an established free medical clinic21 louisiana protects vhp s operating as part of nonprofit medical clinics with reference to whether the vhps must be licensed in louisiana22 in addition to or in place of vpas every state has enacted its own good samaritan statute which protects from civil liability those who gratuitously provide emergency assistance23 generally good samar itan statutes lower the applicable standard of care owed by the person providing assistance24 these statutes were first enacted to protect the person who although under duty to help provides emergency assistance to another but fails to adhere to the otherwise applicable standard of care when doing so emergency in this context refers to medical emergencies the classic example being person trapped in car that is teetering on the edge of bridge as it is situation like this one that good samarita n statutes were enacted to ddress their protections arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22255crs5 25 745 ill

the emergency management assistance compact emac an overview by keith bea 32 pl 104321 only hawaii has not ratified emac 33 emac is intended to encourage mutual assistance in any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected stat including natural disaster technological hazard manmade disaster civil emergency aspect s of resources shortages community disorders or enemy attack emac article i often limited in some way for example to care provided at the s cene of an accident and sometimes exclude physicians from the statutes coverage altogether some good samaritan statutes however provide very broad civil liability protections the illinois stat ute for example provides ch protection to physicians licensed in any american state or territory who provide emergency care so long as the resulting harm was not the resu lt of willful or wanton conduct25 again however the term emergency is used in the medical context and courts are left to determine on casebycase basis what constitutes an emergency that triggers the acts protections26 louisianas good samaritan statute pr ovides liability prot ection to medical personnel licensed in louisiana who provide medical services at the scene of an emergency27 medical personnel licensed to practi ce in another state do not enjoy such protection under louisianas g ood samaritan statute althoug h they cannot be prosecuted for practicing without license when they ffer gratuitous assistance in an emergency situation28 alabamas good samar itan statute protects from all civil liability medical personnel who gratuitously and in good faith provide emergency care at the scene of an accident casualty or disaster emphasis added29 mississippis law protects duly licensed medical personnel who using r easonable care and in good faith provide gratuitous emergency medical services or transport30 mutual assistance compacts several states have entered into agreements under which they agree to provide assistance to each other in the face of certain disasters eg forest fires the most farreaching agreement and the one most relevant to hurricane katrina relief is the emergency management assistance compact emac31 approved by congress in 199632 emac represents an attempt by the signatories who now include 49 states and th district of columbia to remove the legal obstacles that can impede the flow of aid from sister states in times of emergency33 under article vi of emac when officers or employees of one state render aid to another they are treated as agents of the requesting state for tort and immunity purposes neither the officers or employees of the state providing assistance nor that state itselfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22255crs6 34 emac article v 35 see hrsa esarvhp background at h

which vhps could avail themselves these protections may be limited in that they appear to apply only to state officers and employees of course home states can enter into agreements with vhps extending state employee status and consequently emacs liability protections to the vhps closely related to the issue of liability protection for vhps in emergency situations is the necessity of verifying that vhps ar properly licensed as medical professionals under emac state requesting assistance agrees to recognize the medical licenses of health care workers from other states providing assistance34 however reciprocity is not automatically extended to vhps who do not provide services pursuant to an emac request for assistance unless authorities can verify an individuals claims they may be reluctant to accept the individuals professiona l services particularly where vhps arrive spontaneously the health resources and services administration hrsa in hhs has noted the experiences of new york city hospitals in the aftermath of the world trade center destruction were instructive about th issues confronting the use of health care professional volunteers in an emergency or mass casualty event according to reports hospital administrators involved in respo nding to the world trade center tragedy reported that they were unable to use dical volunteers when they were unable to verify the volunteers basic identity licen sing credentials training skills and competencies and employment in effect this precious needed health workforce surge capacity could not be used35 following the terrorist attacks in 2001 congress authorized creation of the emergency system for advance registration of volunteer health professionals esar vhp36 in order to develop national da tabase of currently licensed medical professionals which could be accessed by state authorities thus giving emergency managers and others the ability to quickly identify and use vhps during emergencies the esarvhp program which is based in hrsa assists state and local authorities by developing standards for national database by providing funding and technical assistance for statebased registration systems the program will when complete link to the national database37
