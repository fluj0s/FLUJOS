eyes wide open special report 1executive summary the recent revelations made possible by nsawhistleblower edward snowden of the reach and scope of global surveillance practices have prompted fundamental reexamination of the role of intelligence services in conducting coordinated crossborder surveillance the five eyes alliance of states comprised of the united states national security agency nsa the united kingdoms government communications headquarters gchq canadas communications security establishment canada csec the australian signals directorate asd and new zealands government communications security bureau gcsb is the continuation of an intelligence partnership formed in the aftermath of the second world war today the five eyes has infiltrated every aspect of modern global communications systems the world has changed dramatically since the 1940s then private documents were stored in filing cabinets under lock and key and months could pass without one having the need or luxury of making an international phone call now private documents are stored in unknown data centers around the world international communications are conducted daily and our lives are lived ideas exchanged financial transactions conducted intimate moments shared online the drastic changes to how we use technology to communicate have not gone unnoticed by the five eyes alliance leaked nsa strategy document shared amongst five eyes partners exposes the clear interest that intelligence agencies have in collecting and analyzing signals intelligence sigint in the digital age digital information created since 2006 grew tenfold reaching 18 exabytes in 2011 trend projected to continue ubiquitous computing is fundamentally changing how people interact as individuals become untethered from information sources and their communications tools and the traces individuals leave when they interact with the global network will define the capacity to locate characterize and understand entities1 contrary to the complaints of the nsa and other five eyes agencies that they are going dark and losing the visibility they once had the five eyes intelligence agencies are in fact the most powerful theyve ever been operating in the shadows and misleading the public the agencies boast in secret how they have adapted in innovative and creative ways that have led some to describe the current day as the golden age of sigint the agencies are playing dirty game not content with following the already permissive legal processes under which they operate theyve found ways to infiltrate all aspects of 1 nsa sigint strategy 23 february 2012 available at httpwwwnytimescominteractive20131123uspolitics23nsasigintstrategydocumenthtmlrefpoliticsgwh5e154810a5fb56b3e9af98df667ae3c8 2modern communications networks forcing companies to handover their customers data under secret orders and secretly tapping fibre optic cables between the same companies data centers anyway accessing sensitive financial data through swift the worlds financial messaging system spending years negotiating an international agreement to regulate access to the data through democratic and accountable process and then hacking the networks to get direct access threatening politicians with trumped up threats of impending cyberwar while operating intrusion operations that weaken the security of networks globally sabotaging encryption standards and standards bodies thereby undermining the ability of internet users to secure information each of these actions have been justified in secret on the basis of secret interpretations of international law and classified agreements by remaining in the shadows our intelligence agencies and the governments who control them have removed our ability to challenge their actions and their impact upon our human rights we cannot hold our governments accountable when their actions are obfuscated through secret deals and covert legal frameworks secret law has never been law and we cannot allow our intelligence agencies to justify their activities on the basis of it we must move towards an understanding of global surveillance practices as fundamentally opposed to the rule of law and to the wellestablished international human right to privacy in doing so we must break down legal frameworks that obscure the activities of the intelligence agencies or that preference the citizens or residents of five eyes countries over the global internet population these governments have carefully constructed legal frameworks that provide differing levels of protections for internal versus external communications or those relating to nationals versus nonnationals attempt to circumvent national constitutional or human rights protections governing interferences with the right to privacy of communications this notion must be rejected the five eyes agencies are seeking not only defeat the spirit and purpose of international human rights instruments they are in direct violation of their obligations under such instruments human rights obligations apply to all individuals subject to states jurisdiction the obligation to respect privacy extends to the privacy of all communications so that the physical location of the individual may be in different jurisdiction to that where the interference with the right occurs this paper calls for renewed understanding of the obligations of five eyes states with respect to the right to privacy and demands that the laws and regulations that enable intelligence gathering and sharing under the five eyes alliance be brought into the light it begins in chapter one by shining light on the history and structure of the alliance and draws on information disclosed by whistleblowers and investigative journalists to paint picture of the alliance as it operates today in chapter two we argue that the laws and regulations around which five eyes are constructed are insufficiently clear and accessible to ensure they are in compliance with the rule of law in chapter three we turn to the obligations of five eyes states under international human rights law and argue for an interferencebased jurisdiction whereby five eyes states owe general duty not to interfere with communications that pass through their territorial borders through such conceptualization we argue mass surveillance is cognisable within 3human rights framework in way that provides rights and remedies to affected individuals while the existence of the five eyes has been kept secret from the public and parliaments dogged investigative reporting from duncan campbell nicky hager and james bamford has gone some way to uncovering the extent of the arrangement now thanks to edward snowden the public are able to understand more about the spying that is being done in their name than ever before trust must be restored and our intelligence agencies must be brought under the rule of law transparency around and accountability for these secret agreements is crucial first step privacy international to grateful is ben jaffey caspar bowden dan squires duncan campbell eric metcalfe ian brown james bamford mark scott marko milanovic mathias vermeulen nicky hager shamik dutta for their insight feedback discussions investigation and support we are grateful to all of the whistleblowers whose responsible disclosures in the public interest have brought transparency to the gross violations of human rights being conducted by the intelligence agencies in our name given the current rapid nature of information disclosures regarding the intelligence agencies this paper will be regularly updated to reflect the most accurate understanding we have of the nature of the five eyes arrangement any errors or omission are solely attributable to the authors version 10 26 november 2013 4chapter 1 understanding the five eyes the birth of the five eyes alliance beginning in 1946 an alliance of five countries the us the uk australia canada and new zealand developed series of bilateral agreements over more than decade that became known as the ukusa pronounced yewkewzah agreement establishing the five eyes alliance for the purpose of sharing intelligence but primarily signals intelligence hereafter sigint while the existence of the agreement has been noted in history books and references are often made to it as part of reporting on the intelligence agencies there is little knowledge or understanding outside the services themselves of exactly what the arrangement comprises even within the governments of the respective countries which the intelligence agencies are meant to serve there has historically been little appreciation for the extent of the arrangement the arrangement is so secretive the australian prime minister reportedly wasnt informed of its existence until 19732 former prime minister of new zealand david lange once remarked that it was not until i read this book nicky hagers secret power which detailed gcsbs history that i had any idea that we had been committed to an international integrated electronic network he continued it is an outrage that i and other ministers were told so little and this raises the question of to whom those concerned saw themselves ultimately answerable3 there has been debate around the legitimacy or purpose of the five eyes alliance in part due to the lack of publicly available information about it in 2010 the us and uk declassified numerous documents including memoranda and draft texts relating to the creation of the ukusa agreement however generally the five eyes states and their intelligence services have been far too slow in declassifying information that longer needs to be secret resulting in mention on any government website of the arrangement until recently the intelligence agencies involved in the alliance are the united states national security agency nsa the united kingdoms government communications headquarters gchq canadas communications security establishment canada csec the australian signals directorate asd and new zealands government communications security bureau gcsb the extent of the original arrangement is broad and includes the 1 collection of traffic 2 acquisition of communications documents and equipment 2 canadas role in secret intelligence alliance five eyes ctv news 8

equipment draft of the original ukusa agreement declassified in 2010 explains that the exchange of the abovelisted information will be unrestricted on all work undertaken except when specifically excluded from the agreement at the request of either party to limit such exceptions to the absolute minimum and to exercise restrictions other than those reported and mutually agreed upon indeed in addition to facilitating collaboration the agreement suggests that all intercepted material would be shared between five eyes states by default the text stipulates that all raw traffic shall continue to be exchanged except in cases where one or the other party agrees to forgo its copy the working arrangement that was reached in 1953 by ukusa parties explained that while commonwealth countries other than the uk are not party to the ukusa comint agreement they will not be regarded as third parties4 instead canada australia and new zealand will be regarded as ukusacollaborating commonwealth countries also known as second parties one retired senior nato intelligence officer has suggested there is formal overarching international agreement that governs all five eyes intelligence relationships5 it is not known how accurate that statement is or how the agreement has been modified in subsequent years as the text of the five eyes agreement in its current form has never been made public today gchq simply states it has partnerships with range of allies our collaboration with the usa known as ukusa delivers enormous benefits to both nations6 the nsa makes direct reference to the ukusa arrangement or the five eyes states by name except by way of historical references to partnerships with the british and the dominions of canada australia and new zealand in the declassification section of their website7 the original agreement mandated secrecy stating it will be contrary to this agreement to reveal its existence to any third party unless otherwise agreed resulting in modern day references to the existence of the agreement by the intelligence agencies remaining 4 appendix j principles of ukusa collaboration with commonwealth countries other than the uk page 39 available

continues with only cursory mentions made across wide range of public policy documents to the existence of an intelligence sharing partnership for example the uk counterterrorist strategy contest referred to the existence of the five eyes agreement only in passing when stating the uk will continue to develop our most significant bilateral intelligence relationship with the us and the five eyes cooperation with the us australia canada and new zealand13 we have been unable to locate any major public strategic policy document that describes australias canadas new zealands or the united states

purpose of the rel to is to identify classified information that party has predetermined to be releasable or has already been released through established foreign disclosure procedures and channels to foreign country or international organisation14 notably while other alliances and coalitions exist such as the north atlantic treaty organisation eg tsrel to usa nato european counterterrorism forces eg tsrel to usa ectf or chemical weapons convention states eg tsrel to usa cwcs none of the documents that have thus far been made public refer to any of these arrangements suggesting the five eyes alliance is the preeminent sigint collection alliance the arrangement in this way was not just to create set of principles of collaboration or the facilitation of information sharing but to enable the dividing of tasks between sigint agencies the agreement explains that allocation of major tasks conferring onesided responsibility is undesirable and impracticable as main principle however in order that the widest possible cover of foreign cypher communications be achieved the comint agencies of the two parties shall exchange proposals for the elimination of duplication in addition collaboration between those agencies will take the form of suggestion and mutual arrangement as to the undertaking of new tasks and changes in status of old tasks15 the continuation of this sharing of tasks between agencies has been acknowledged with former defense secretary caspar weinberger observing that the united states has neither the opportunity nor the resources to unilaterally collect all the intelligence information we require we compensate with variety of intelligence sharing arrangements with other nations in the world16 the canadian sigint agency csec explain how it relies on its closest foreign intelligence allies the us uk australia and new zealand to share the collection burden and the resulting intelligence yield17 other former intelligence analysts have confirmed18 there is tasksharing between the five eyes groups 14 security classification markingsauthorization for releaseto reltoand dissemination control declassification markings ustranscom foreign disclosure office

is often indistinguishable19 this has resulted in former intelligence officials explaining that the closeknit cooperation that exists under the ukusa agreement means that sigint customers in both capitals seldom know which country generated either the access or the product itself20 another former british spy has said that cooperation between the two countries particularly in sigint is so close that it becomes very difficult to know who is doing what its just organizational mess21 the division of sigint collection responsibilities investigative journalist duncan campbell explains that historically under the ukusa agreement the five main englishspeaking countries took responsibility for overseeing surveillance in different parts of the globe britains zone included africa and europe east to the ural mountains of the former ussr canada covered northern latitudes and polar regions australia covered oceania the agreement prescribed common procedures targets equipment and methods that the sigint agencies would use22 more recently an exsenior nato intelligence officer elaborated on this point saying each five eyes partner collects information over specific area of the globe but their collection and analysis activities are orchestrated to the point that they essentially act as one precise assignments are not publicly known but research indicates that australia monitors south and east asia emissions new zealand covers the south pacific and southeast asia the uk devotes attention to europe and western russia while the us monitors the caribbean china russia the middle east and africa23 jointly run operations centres in addition to fluidly sharing collected sigint it is understood that many intelligence facilities run by the respective five eyes countries are jointly operated even jointly staffed by members of the intelligence agencies of five eyes countries each facility 19 robert aldrich 2006 paper transatlantic intelligence and security cooperation available at

intelligence operatives from nsa and other agencies likely accounting for the rest an american official runs the base itself with the posting being considered step towards promotion into the most senior ranks of the us intelligence community with an australian acts as deputy27 with such an overwhelming us presence it is likely that that majority of the cost of running is base is paid for by the us the australian defence department says australias contribution to pine gaps in 201112 was mere aus14 million28 the systems run at the base are tied into the largest five eyes intelligence structure with personnel sitting in airconditioned offices in central australia being directly linked on minutebyminute basis to us and allied military operations in afghanistan and indeed anywhere else across the eastern hemisphere 29 as result it has been reported that the practical reality is that pine gaps capabilities are now deeply and inextricably entwined with us military operations down to the tactical level across half the world30 the new zealand gcsb was similarly entwined with the nsa the gcsbs director of 24 see the defence signals bureau was established in 1947 as part of the

menwith hill and it was reported that for the first time the union jack was raised alongside the stars and stripes david bowe mep for cleveland and richmond said this was designed to mislead and that my information is that the raf representation on the base amounts to one token squadron leader the name change was presumably decided to make the whole site look more benign and acceptable32 the base was the subject of six billion pound investment over last 20 years with the majority of that likely to be us funds33 other bases such as gchqs operation in the south west of england at bude are also jointly staffed the guardian reported34 that in addition to jointly developing the tempora program 300 analysts from gchq and 250 from the nsa were located at bude and directly assigned to examine

within particular country this does not forestall five eyes parties from collecting intelligence therein on the host country exnsa staff have confirmed that communications are monitored from almost every nation in the world including the nations on whose soil the intercept bases are located39 intelligence collection analysis and sharing activities it is believed that much of the intelligence collected under the five eyes arrangement can be accessed by any of the five eyes partners at any time some codenamed programmes that have been revealed to the public over the last decade go some way to illustrating how the five eyes alliance collaborates on specific programmes of activity and how some of this information is shared it should be noted that these are just selection of programmes that have been made public and are likely to represent tiny fraction of the joint collection undertaken by five eyes partners nevertheless these codenamed programmes reveal just how integrated the five eyes sigint collection and analysis methods are and the existence of shared sigint tools and technologies 36 new slides about nsa collection programs electrospaces blog 16th july 2013 available

global internetlike communication network to enable remote intelligence customers to task computers at each collection site and receive the results automatically40 this network was known as echelon and was revealed to the public in 1988 by duncan campbell41 an oftenmisunderstood term echelon is in fact code name given by the nsa us national security agency to system that collects and processes information derived from intercepting civil satellite communications the information obtained at echelon stations is fed into the global communications network operated jointly by the sigint organisations of the united states united kingdom australia canada and new zealand echelon stations operate automatically most of the information that is selected is automatically fed into the worldwide network of sigint stations42 it is not known how long the echelon programme continued in that form but the nsa went on to develop programmes such as thinthread which emerged at the turn of the millennium thinthread was sophisticated sigint analysis tool used to create graphs showing relationships and patterns that could tell analysts which targets they should look at and which calls should be listened to43 one of the creators of thinthread bill binney described the tool to the new yorker as binney imagined it thinthread would correlate data from financial transactions travel records web searches gps equipment and any other attributes that an analyst might find useful in pinpointing the bad guys by 2000 binney using fibre optics had set up computer network that could chart relationships among people in real time it also turned the nsas datacollection paradigm upside down instead of vacuuming up information around the world and then sending it all back to headquarters for analysis thinthread processed information as it was collected discarding useless information on the spot and avoiding the overload problem that plagued centralized systems binney says the beauty of it is that it was openended so it could keep expanding 44 this programme was distributed around the world and trialed in conjunction with the five eyes partners tim shorrock explains the thinthread prototype went live in the fall of 2000 and several allied foreign intelligence agencies were given the programme to conduct lawful 40 inside echelon duncan campbell 2000 available at

at huge cost that this tool was shared even in trial version with five eyes partners is an important indicator of how tightly integrated the relationship is subsequent related programmes codenamed trailblazer turbulence and trafficthief were later adopted and used by five eyes partners46 more recently the guardian reported47 that 300 analysts from gchq and 250 from the nsa were directly assigned to examine material collected under the tempora programme by placing taps at key undersea fibre optic cable landing stations the programme is able to intercept significant portion of the communications that traverses the uk tempora stores content for three days and metadata for 30 days once content and data are collected they can be filtered the precise nature of gchqs filters remains secret filters could be applied based on type of traffic eg skype facebook email origindestination of traffic or to conduct basic keyword searches among many other purposes reportedly approximately 40000 search terms have been chosen and applied by gchq and another 31000 by the nsa to information collected via tempora gchq have had staff examining collected material since the projects inception

cooperation between their agencies and as james bamford author or multiple books on the nsa explains it is the senior liaison officers the sigint communitys version of ambassadors who control the daytoday relations between the ukusa partners and it is for that reason that the post of suslo office of the senior united states liaison officer at nsa is both highly prized and carefully considered51 these positions to facilitate cooperation continue to exist throughout the arrangement recent diplomatic cable from the us ambassador in wellington new zealand released by wikileaks

liaison and cooperation on vital signals intelligence matters this is an area where the us and nz already work together closely and profitably and continuing to build and expand that relationship

also be required for access to information from australian canadian or new zealand agencies suggest that gaining credentials for data is relatively easy the sessions are often done as selflearning and selfassessment with multiple choice openbook tests done at the agents own desk on its ilearn system agents then copy and paste their passing result in order to gain access to the huge databases of

look back on the last 365 days worth of dni metadata seen by the sigint collection system regardless whether or not it was tasked for collection60 giving five eyes partners the ability to look back on full years history for any individual whose data was collected either deliberately or incidentally by the system the nospy deal myth while ukusa is often reported as having created spy pact between five eyes states there is little in the original text to support such notion crucially first and foremost clause exists that attempts in any form to create such an obligation instead if anything the converse is true the scope of the arrangement consciously carves out space to permit stateonstate spying even by parties to ukusa it limits the scope to governing the relations of abovementioned parties in communications intelligence matters only and more specifically that the exchange of such material is not prejudicial to national interests61 additionally while the text mandates that each

engaged directly in the production of comint except such parts thereof which contain unexchangable information62 as best can be ascertained therefore it seems there is prohibition on intelligencegathering by five eyes states with respect to the citizens or residents of other five eyes states there is instead it seems general understanding that citizens will not be directly targeted and where communications are incidentally intercepted there will be an effort to minimize the use and analysis thereof by the intercepting state this analysis has been confirmed by leaked draft 2005 nsa directive entitled collection processing and dissemination of allied communications63 this directive carries the classification marking nf meaning foreign short for noforn or not releasable to foreign nationals the directive states under the britishus communications intelligence agreement of 5 march 1946 commonly known as the united kingdomunited states of american ukusa agreement both governments agreed to exchange communications intelligence products methods and techniques as applicable so long as it was not prejudicial to national interests this agreement has evolved to include common understanding that both governments will not target each others citizenspersons however when it is in the best interest of each nation each reserve the right to conduct unilateral comint against each others citizenspersons therefore under certain circumstances it may be advisable and allowable to target second party persons and second party communications systems unilaterally when it in the best interests of the us and necessary for us national security such targeting must be performed exclusively within the direction procedures and decision processes outlined in this directive64 the directive continues when sharing the planned targeting information with second party would be contrary to us interests or when the second party declines collaboration proposal the proposed targeting must be presented to the signals intelligence director for approval with justification for the criticality of the proposed collection if approved any collection processing and dissemination of the second party information must be maintained in noforn channels 65 significantly the details of some nsa programmes not intended to be shared with five eyes countries indicate that

green least subjected to surveillance through to yellow and orange and finally red most surveillance five eyes partners are not excluded from the map and instead are shaded green which is suggestive that some collection of these states citizens or communications is occurring changes to the original arrangement however suggest convention is in place between at least two of the five eyes partners uk and us that prevents deliberate collection or targeting of each others citizens unless authorised by the other state the 2005 draft directive states this agreement ukusa has evolved to include common understanding that both governments will not target each others citizenspersons this of course has not prevented spying without consent but it appears it is preferable that when five eyes partners want to spy on another member of the agreement they do so with the other countrys consent it is unclear on what basis consent may be given or withheld but the directive explains there are circumstances when targeting of second party persons and communications systems with the full knowledge and cooperation of one or more second parties is allowed when it is in the best interests of both nations67 the directive goes on to state that these circumstances might include targeting uk citizen located in london using british telephone system targeting uk person located in london using an internet service provider isp in france or targeting pakistani person located in the uk using uk isp historically the five eyes members expected each other to make attempts to minimise the retention and dissemination of information about five eyes partners once intercepted duncan campbell explains new zealand officials were instructed to remove the names of identifiable ukusa citizens or companies from their reports inserting instead words such as canadian citizen or us company british comint staff have described following similar procedures in respect of us citizens following the introduction of legislation to limit nsas domestic intelligence activities in 1978 the australian government says that dsd and its counterparts operate internal procedures to satisfy themselves that

ambiguity about who else can be spied on including third party partners an internal nsa presentation made clear we can and often do target the signals of most 3rd party foreign partners70 in other words the intelligence services of the five eyes agencies may spy on each other with some expectation that they will be consulted when this occurs everyone else is fair game even if they have separate intelligencesharing agreement with one or several five eyes members this understanding that allies may still be spied upon has been echoed in other public statements made by the us which in the wake of the snowden revelations has confirmed through an unnamed senior official that we have not made across the board changes in policy like for example terminating intelligence collection that might be aimed at all allies71 spying on heads of state questions remain however as to whether arrangements within five eyes may prevent the surveillance of the respective heads of states of five eyes partners it has been confirmed by the white house that uk prime minister david camerons communications have not are not and will not be monitored by the us72 however while new zealand prime minister john key has agreed that he is satisfied that the us has not spied on him and that he is confident of the position he will not confirm whether this is because the five eyes members have agreed to this73

infamously defected to the soviet union they revealed the scope of nsas activities reporting that we know from working at nsa that the united states reads the secret communications of more than forty nations including its own allies nsa keeps in operation more than 2000 manual intercept positions both enciphered and plain text communications are monitored from almost every nation in the world including the nations on whose soil the intercept bases are located76 other surveillance partnerships over almost seven decades the five eyes alliance has splintered notably only once when in 1985 new zealands new labour government refused to allow us ship to visit new zealand in accordance with the governments antinuclear policy not to allow ships into its new zealand waters without confirmation they were neither nuclearpowered nor carrying nuclear weapons this policy was turned into law in 1987 with the creation of the new zealand nuclear free zone77 the political fallout from the introduction of the policy included the splintering off of new zealand at least temporarily from the five eyes and the creation of four eyes alliance with the acronym acgu this split has been confirmed in number of military classification marking documents78 it is understood that there was some distancing of new zealand from the five eyes in the years immediately following the incident but that the schism was less significant than previously thought79 by making reference to documents dated in the past decade released as part of the snowden leaks it is clear that new zealand remains an integral part of the five eyes alliance 74 germany to seek spying deal with us financial times 12th august 2013 available at httpwwwftcomcmss067eef7f4037511e3980a00144feab7dehtml 75 germans rejected

communities with varying focuses dealing with military coalitions intelligence partnerships with many having established dedicated communication networks80 the guardian describes two such arrangements the nsa has other coalitions although intelligencesharing is more restricted for the additional partners the 9eyes which adds denmark france the netherlands and norway the 14eyes including germany belgium italy spain and sweden and 41eyes adding in others in the allied coalition in afghanistan81 this is supported by statements made by an exsenior nato intelligence officer the five eyes sigint community also plays core role in larger galaxy of sigint organizations found in established democratic states both west and east five eyes plus gatherings in the west include canadas nato allies and important nonnato partners such as sweden to the east pacific version of the five eyes plus grouping includes among others singapore and south korea such extensions add reach and layering to five eyes sigint capabilities82 new york times article83 again confirms such groups exist by acknowledging more limited cooperation occurs with many more countries including formal arrangements called nine eyes

concerns about sharing sensitive military and sigint documents on systematic basis88 as explained by scheinen and vermeulen89 however the agreement between the parties to the north atlantic treaty for the security of information of 1949 is quite short but article 5 for instance gives states carte blanche to make any other agreement relating to the exchange of classified information originated by

22chapter two secret law is not law the intelligence agencies of the five eyes countries conduct some of the most important complex and farreaching activities of any state agency and they do so under behind the justification of thicket of convoluted and obfuscated legal and regulatory frameworks the laws and agreements that make up the five eyes arrangement and apply it to domestic contexts lack any semblance of clarity or accessibility necessary to ensure that the individuals whose rights and interests are affected by them are able to understand their application as such they run contrary to the fundamental building blocks of the rule of law the rule of law and accessibility the accessibility of law is foundational element the rule of law many have different views of what exactly constitutes the rule of law but it is widely understood to play critical role in checking excessive or arbitrary power core to the rule of law is the idea that all individuals are able to know what law is exercised over them by those in power and how conduct must be accordingly regulated to ensure it is in compliance with such laws lord neubergers first principle of the rule of law explains just how critical the accessibility of law is to the rule of law at its most basic the expression connotes system under which the relationship between the government and citizens and between citizen and citizen is governed by laws which are followed and applied that is rule by law but the rule of law requires more than that first the laws must be freely accessible that means as available and as understandable as possible90 if law itself isnt published in clear and understandable way then citizens cannot evaluate when an action by another person or by their government is unlawful as tom bingham explains if the law is not sufficiently clear then it becomes inaccessible if people cannot properly access ie understand the law that they are governed by then so far as they are concerned they are being governed by arbitrary power for all actions by the state there must be legal justification simply because there is law on the statute books does not necessarily mean that it isnt arbitrary accessing the laws regulating the actions of the five eyes it has been alleged that there is formal overarching international agreement that governs all five eyes intelligence relationships91 but rather myriad of memoranda 90 httpwwwsupremecourtgovukdocsspeech131015pdf 91 canada and the five eyes intelligence community james cox strategic studies working group papers december 2012 accessible at httpwwwcdfaiorgpdfcanada20and20the20five20eyes20intelligence20communitypdf 23agreements and conventions that must be considered in tandem with complex national legislation scheinin and vermeulen argue that the overwhelming majority of these intelligence cooperation arrangements are secret or at least they are never published nor registered at the secretariat pursuant to article 102 of the charter92 from the perspective of international law they are likely to fall within murky area of nontreaty arrangements which can include arrangements such as memoranda of understanding political agreements provisional understanding exchanges of notes administrative agreements terms of reference declarations and virtually every other name one can think of93 however taken together the five eyes agreements arguably rise to the level of an enforceable treaty under international law it is clear from their scope and widereaching ramifications that the five eyes agreements implicate the rights and interests of individuals sufficiently to raise the agreements to the level of legallybinding treaty in any event it is impossible to know whether the initial intentions of the drafters or the scope of the legal obligations created under the agreements elevate them to the status of legallybinding treaty because the agreements are completely hidden from public view indeed not only are the public unable to access and scrutinise the agreements that regulate the actions of the five eyes but even the intelligence services themselves do not have complete picture of the extent of intelligence sharing activities the nsa admitted during legal proceedings in 2011 that the informationgathering infrastructure was so complex that there was single person with complete understanding 94 the domestic legal frameworks implementing the obligations created by the five eyes obligations are equally obfuscated with respect to the us for example the nsa acknowledged in recentlyreleased strategy document that the interpretation and guidelines for applying american authorities and in some cases the authorities themselves have not kept pace with the complexity of the technology and target environments or the operational expectations levied on nsas mission95 page 4 92 article 102 of the charter states that 1 every treaty and every international agreement entered into by any member of the united nations after the present charter comes into force shall as soon as possible be registered with the secretariat and published by it 2 party to any such treaty or international agreement which has not been registered in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article may invoke that treaty or agreement before any organ of the united nations 93

20122016 23 february 2012 24 the chair of the senate intelligence committee diane feinstein has strongly criticised the actions taken by the nsa under the purported ambit of the relevant legislation noting that it is clear to that certain surveillance activities have been in effect for more than decade and that the senate intelligence committee was not satisfactorily informed96 in the uk the intelligence and security committee in charge of overseeing the actions of the uk intelligence agencies including gchq have responded to the snowden leaks by remarking it has been alleged that gchq circumvented uk law by using the nsas prism programme to access the content of private communications and we are satisfied that they conformed with gchqs statutory duties the legal authority for this is contained in the intelligence services act 199497 yet the chair of the isc has in fact admitted to confusion about whether if british intelligence agencies want to seek to know the content of emails can they get round the normal law in the uk by simply asking an american agencies to provide that information98 when the head of the committee charged with overseeing the lawfulness of the actions of intelligence services is unsure as to whether such agencies have acted lawfully there is plainly serious dearth in the accessibility of law calling into question the rule of law without law that is accessible citizens are unable to regulate their conduct or scrutinise that of their governments in such circumstances it is impossible to verify whether governments are acting in accordance with the law as required of them under human rights law ensuring the five eyes act in accordance with the law there is significant body of european court of human rights jurisprudence on what constitutes interference in accordance with the law in the context of secret surveillance and information gathering such as that undertaken by the five eyes the court begins from the perspective that surveillance particularly secret surveillance is significant infringement on human rights and in order to be justified under the european convention on human rights must be sufficiently clear and precise to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on 96 paul lewis and spencer ackerman nsa dianne feinstein breaks ranks to oppose us spying on

what elements of the powers to intercept are incorporated in legal rules and what elements remain within the discretion of the executive and the law must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities100 in order that individuals may have some certainty about the laws to which they are subject and regulate their conduct accordingly yet the degree of certainty will depend on the circumstances101 as the court has noted foreseeability in the special context of secret measures of surveillance such as the interception of communications cannot mean that an individual should be able to foresee when the authorities are likely to intercept his communications so that he can adapt his conduct accordingly102 where power vested in the executive is exercised in secret however the risks of arbitrariness are evident in the words of the court in weber v germany system of secret surveillance for the protection of national security may undermine or even destroy democracy under the cloak of defending it103 in such circumstances is essential to have clear detailed rules on the subject especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated104 what then does human rights law require of law in order to ensure secret surveillance does not infringe the principles of accessibility and foreseeability the courts decision in weber is authoritative on this point in its case law on secret measures of surveillance the court has developed the following minimum safeguards that should be set out in statute law in order to avoid abuses of power the nature of the offences which may give rise to an interception order definition of the categories of people liable to have their telephones tapped limit on the duration of telephone tapping the procedure to be followed for examining using and storing the data obtained the precautions to be taken when communicating the

canada csec are articulated in part v1 to the national defence act section 273641 sets out csecs threepart mandate namely to acquire and use information from the global information infrastructure for the purpose of providing foreign intelligence in accordance with government of canada intelligence priorities b to provide advice guidance and services to help ensure the protection of electronic information and of information infrastructures of importance to the government of canada and c to provide technical and operational assistance to federal law enforcement and security agencies in the performance of their lawful duties part v1 of the national defence act in relation to csec does not contain any provisions on cooperation with other agencies including foreign agencies an analysis of these cursory legal provisions reveals that they fall far short of describing the fluid and integrated intelligence sharing activities that take place under the ambit of the five eyes arrangement with sufficient clarity and detail to ensure that individuals can forsee their application none of the domestic legal regimes set out the circumstances in which intelligence authorities can obtain store and transfer nationals or residents private communication and other information that are intercepted by another five eyes agency nor which will govern the circumstances in which any of the five eyes states can request the interception of communications by another party to the alliance the same applies to obtaining private information such as emails webhistories etc held by internet and other telecommunication companies there is there legal regime that indicates once such communications are provided to the authorities of one state the procedure for examining using or storing the communication the conditions for transferring it to third parties and the circumstances in which it will be destroyed the legal and regulatory frameworks that govern and give effect to five eyes cannot be said to be sufficiently clear and detailed to meet the requirement of being in accordance with the law nor they are they sufficiently accessible to ensure that they comply with the rule of law secret convoluted or obfuscated law can never be considered law within democratic society governed by the rule of law the actions of the five eyes run completely contrary to the fundamental building blocks of such society 30chapter three holding the five eyes to account the recent revelations of global surveillance practices have prompted fundamental reexamination of the responsibility of states under international law with respect to crossborder surveillance the patchwork of secret spying programmes and intelligencesharing agreements implemented by parties to the five eyes arrangement constitutes an integrated global surveillance arrangement that now covers the majority of the worlds communications at the heart of this arrangement are carefully constructed legal frameworks that provide differing levels of protections for internal versus external communications or those relating to nationals versus nonnationals these frameworks attempt to circumvent national constitutional or human rights protections governing interferences with the right to privacy of communications that states contend apply only to nationals or those within their territorial jurisdiction in doing so the five eyes states not only defeat the spirit and purpose of international human rights instruments they are in direct violation of their obligations under such instruments human rights obligations apply to all individuals subject to states jurisdiction107 jurisdiction extends not only to the territory of the state but to anyone within the power and effective control of the state even if they are outside the territory108 it is argued here that jurisdiction extends to situations where state interferes with the right to privacy of an individual whose communications are intercepted stored or processed within that states territory in such circumstances the state owes obligations to that individual regardless of their location by understanding state jurisdiction over human rights violations in this way we can give effect to international human rights obligations in the digital age through the concept of interferencebased jurisdiction whereby subject to permissible limitations states owe general duty not to interfere with communications that pass through their territorial borders mass surveillance is cognisable within human rights framework in way that provides rights and remedies to affected individuals without such perspective on responsibility for violations that properly reflects the nature and scope of five eyes surveillance and the way in which privacy violations occur states will continue to conduct surveillance in way that renders human rights obligations meaningless 107 iccpr article 2 each state party to the present covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction echr article 1 the high contracting parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in section i of this convention american convention on human rights article 1 the states parties to this convention undertake to respect the rights and freedoms recognized herein and to ensure to all persons subject to their jurisdiction the free and full exercise of those rights and freedoms without any discrimination for reasons of race color sex language religion political or other opinion national or social origin economic status birth or any other social condition 108 human rights committee general comment 31 10 31we seek to introduce an alternative perspective on jurisdiction and to further understandings of how human rights law can be understood in the digital age our intention is to supplement not to detract from other arguments around how jurisdiction in international human rights law functions in relation to mass surveillance for example interferences occurring outside the territory of the state may be attributable to that state under the ordinary principles of state responsibility however we are concerned exclusively with states obligations in relation to interferences with the right to privacy when communications are collected stored or processed occurring within the physical territory of that state the right to privacy of communications the right to privacy is an internationally recognized right article 17 1 of the international covenant on civil and political rights provides one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy family home or correspondence nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation according to the united nations human rights committee in its general comment 16 compliance with article 17 requires that the integrity and confidentiality of correspondence should be guaranteed jure and facto correspondence should be delivered to the addressee without interception and without being opened or otherwise read surveillance whether electronic or otherwise interceptions of telephonic telegraphic and other forms of communication wiretapping and recording of conversations should be prohibited109 article 8 of the european convention on human rights provides right to respect for ones private and family life his home and his correspondence subject to certain restrictions that are in accordance with law and necessary in democratic society the european court of human rights has consistently held that the interception of telephone communications as well as facsimile and email communications content110 are covered by notions of private life and correspondence and thus constitute an interference with article 8111 importantly the european court has found112 the interception andor storage of communication constitutes the violation and that the subsequent use of the stored 109 ccpr general comment 16 article 17 right to privacy 8 110 liberty ors v united kingdom 2008 application 5824300 111 see malone v united kingdom 1985 7 ehrr 14 64 weber v germany 2008 46

bearing on that finding113 nor does it matter whether the information gathered on the applicant was sensitive or not or as to whether the applicant had been inconvenienced in any way114 it is argued that the same reasoning applies to the processing of communications therefore the right to privacy extending as it does to the privacy of communications is relatively unusual right in the sense that its realization can occur remotely from the physical location of the individual when an individual sends letter email or textmessage or makes phone call that communication leaves their physical proximity and travels to its destination in the course of its transmission the communication may pass through multiple other states and therefore multiple jurisdictions the right to privacy of the communication remains intact subject only to the permissible limitations set out under human rights law115 mass surveillance as breach of the right to privacy of communications the special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of expression and opinion has described the invasiveness of mass interception of fibre optic cables116 by placing taps on the fibre optic cables through which the majority of digital communication information flows and applying word voice and speech recognition states can achieve almost complete control of tele and online communications the special rapporteur reasons that mass interception technology eradicates any considerations of proportionality enabling indiscriminate surveillance it enables the state to copy and monitor every single act of communication in particular country or area without gaining authorization for each individual case of interception117 mass surveillance has also been found to be an interference with the right to privacy under european human rights law in weber and saravia v germany 2006 application 5493400 the court reiterated that the mere existence of legislation which allows system for the 113 amann v switzerland 2000 application 2779895 69 114 amann v switzerland 2000 application 2779895 70 115 comprehensive account of the permissible limitations on the right to privacy is presented in the report

threat of surveillance for all those to whom the legislation may be applied this threat necessarily strikes at freedom of communication between users of the telecommunications services and thereby amounts in itself to an interference with the exercise of the applicants rights under article 8 irrespective of any measures actually taken against them the collection and storage of data that relates to an individuals private life is so invasive and brings with it such risk of abuse that it alone amounts to an interference with the right to privacy according to european court of human rights jurisprudence118 accordingly mass surveillance programmes must violate international law jurisdiction and human rights obligations traditional conceptions of state human rights obligations focus on nexus between the territory where the obligation is owed and an individuals connection with that territory by virtue of nationality residence or physical location within it in the context of obligations under international human rights treaties jurisdiction has traditionally served as doctrinal bar to the recognition and realization of human rights obligations extraterritorially although as noted by milanovic questions as to when state owes obligations under human rights treaty towards an individual located outside its territory are being brought more and more frequently before courts both international and domestic victims of aerial bombardment119 inhabitants of territories under military occupation120 including deposed dictators121 suspected terrorists detained in guantanamo by the united states122 and the family of former kgb spy who was assassinated in london through the use of radioactive toxin allegedly at the orders or with the collusion of the russian government123 all of these people have claimed protection from human rights law against state affecting their lives while acting outside its territory the jurisdiction clauses in two of the most relevant human rights instruments the european convention on human rights echr and the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr are notably different in their construction and numerous 118 s and marper v

being applicable outside the strict territorial boundaries of the state article 1 of the echr holds the high contracting parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in section i of this convention in alskeini v united kingdom124 the european court of human rights moulded if not departed from its earlier jurisprudence in banković 125 to issue decision that affirms extraterritorial jurisdiction stating whenever the state through its agents exercises control and authority over an individual and thus jurisdiction the state is under an obligation under article 1 to secure to that individual the rights and freedoms under section 1 of the convention that are relevant to the situation of that individual in this sense therefore the convention rights can be divided and tailored compare banković cited above 75126 while milanovic 2011 notes127 some inconsistencies in the courts reasoning particularly vis vis banković crucially the case stands as authority that although the jurisdictional competence of state is primarily territorial it is not limited by territory it can also extend to those over whom the state exercises authority or control in contrast article 21 of the iccpr holds each state party to the present covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present covenant in 1966 the international law commission in its draft articles on the law of treaties subsequently the vienna convention on the law of treaties noted that certain types of treaty by reason of their subject matter are hardly susceptible of territorial application in the ordinary sense most treaties however have application to territory and question may arise as to what is their precise scope territorially128 for the purpose of defining the conditions of applicability of the covenant the notion of jurisdiction refers to the relationship between the individual and the state in connection with violation of human rights wherever it occurred so that acts of states that take 124 application 5572107 7 july 2011 125 application

international law commission 187 at 213 35place or produce effects outside the national territory may be deemed to fall under the jurisdiction of the state concerned129 as noted above the right to privacy extends to the privacy of crossborder communications so that the physical location of the individual may be in different jurisdiction to that where the interference with the right occurs this distinction is examined by milanovic 2011 who asserts that extraterritorial application can take one of two forms it will most frequently arise from an extraterritorial state act ie conduct attributable to the state either of commission or of omission performed outside its sovereign borders however and this is crucial point extraterritorial application does not require an extraterritorial state act but solely that the individual concerned is located outside the states territory while the injury to his rights may as well take place inside it130 with regard to the right to privacy many violations are not due to extraterritorial acts but jurisdictional acts with extraterritorial effects the instances in which jurisdictional acts have extraterritorial effects are infrequent but not without precedent one example provided by milanovic is the question of property rights of foreigners or those absent from the territory person may have property rights in the uk by virtue of owning property in the territory but may be temporarily or permanently located outside the uk if the property were to be searched or seized without adherence to legal standards there would be violation of the individuals right to privacy regardless of their location at the time of the interference this is an example of interferencebased jurisdiction second example is that of enjoyment of article 6 echr fair trial rights during trials in absentia where the individual in question has absconded outside the states territory the european court of human rights has repeatedly upheld the right of defendants to enjoy the protections of article 6 even when they are absent from their trial and outside the territory of the state in sejdovic v italy131 for example the court held at 91 although not absolute the right of everyone charged with criminal offence to be effectively defended by lawyer assigned officially if need be is one of the fundamental features of fair trial see poitrimol cited above 34 person charged with criminal offence does not lose the benefit of this right merely on account of not being present at the trial see mariani v france 4364098 40 31 march 2005

anonim sirketi v ireland 2005 42 ehrr 1 where irish authorities at dublin airport impounded an aircraft that had been leased by turkish company from the national airline of the former yugoslavia the company argued that the irish authorities had acted in way that was incompatible with the european convention on human rights in considering the issue of jurisdiction the court noted the territorial basis of jurisdiction in international law and observed132 in the present case it is not disputed that the act about which the applicant company complained the detention of the aircraft leased by it for period of time was implemented by the authorities of the respondent state on its territory following decision made by the irish minister for transport in such circumstances the applicant company as the addressee of the impugned act fell within the jurisdiction of the irish state with the consequence that its complaint about that act is compatible ratione loci personae and materiae with the provisions of the convention with respect to the right to privacy the european court has considered at least two cases133 in which surveillance has involved the interference with the right to privacy of those outside of the respective states territory in neither has the court directly considered the issue of whether obligations owed are extended to individuals outside the territory application to interferences with the right to privacy in the digital age with the advent of the internet and new digital forms of communication now most digital communications take the fastest and cheapest route to their destination rather than the most direct this infrastructure means that the sender has ability to choose nor immediate knowledge of the route that their communication will take even when digital communication is being sent to recipient within the same country as the sender it may travel around the world to reach its destination this shift in communications infrastructure means that communications travel through many more countries are stored in variety of countries particularly through the growing popularity of cloud computing and are thus vulnerable to inception by multiple intelligence agencies from their bases within the territory of each country each respective intelligence agency collects and analyses communications that traverse their territory and beyond while there are many methods used by intelligence agencies to intercept communications one of the consistent techniques is to exploit the 132 137 133 in weber and saravia v germany application 5493400 29 june 2006 the court found that the application was inadmissible by other means in liberty and ors v united kingdom application 5824300 1 july 2008 the government proceeded on the basis that the applicants could claim to be victims of an interference with their communications sent to or from their offices in the uk and ireland 37communications infrastructure itself often in the form of the transnational cables that carry the worlds communications for more than 50 years the security agencies have intercepted these transnational links from 1945 onwards the us intelligence agencies systematically intercepted telegraphic data entering or exiting the united states under the codename project shamrock as technology developed newer fibre optic cables were laid that could carry many more communications these links were also intercepted by intelligence agencies within their territory investigative journalist duncan campbell explained in 2000 how the nsa was intercepting the foreign communications within us territory internet traffic can be accessed either from international communications links entering the united states or when it reaches major internet exchanges both methods have advantages access to communications systems is likely to be remain clandestine whereas access to internet exchanges might be more detectable according to former employee nsa had by 1995 installed sniffer software to collect such traffic at nine major internet exchange points ixps134 the uk is using more modern versions of this technique to intercept store and process communications that enter and exit the country in the form of their mass surveillance program tempora while these undersea fibreoptic cables will land in multiple different countries due to the uks geographical position disproportionate number of undersea cables land in the uk before they cross the atlantic ocean the guardian135 reported that by the summer of 2011 gchq had attached probes to more than 200 links within their territory including at main network switches and undersea cable landing stations similar capabilities exist allowing intelligence agencies to intercept satellite communications136137 crucially by intercepting communications in this way the communication is being interfered with within the territory of the intercepting state this amounts to an interference with the right to privacy and must be justified according to the restrictions of human rights law such an interference invokes the negative obligation and responsibility of the interfering state not to violate fundamental rights 134 nsa slides explain the prism datacollection program the washington post june 6 2013 updated july 10 2013 available at

their location or nationality all individuals are entitled to have their right to privacy respected not only by the state upon whose territory they stand but by the state within whose territory their rights are exercised if their communications pass through the territory of another state and that state interferes with the communications it will activate that states jurisdiction under international human rights law accordingly the us and uk owe the same obligation to each individual whose communications pass through their territory not to interfere with those communications subject to permissible limitations established under international law such interferencebased jurisdiction obligations extend globally regardless of boundaries five eyes legal frameworks that circumvent human rights obligations each of the five eyes members have complex legal frameworks governing the interception monitoring and retention of communications content and data this paper does not attempt to comprehensively outline such frameworks and only excerpts some relevant provisions to illustrate the obfuscatory nature of legal frameworks that enable the rights of nonnationals or those outside the territory to be diminished united states fisa section 1881a is entitled procedures for targeting certain persons outside the united states other than united states persons section 1881a ss provides the attorney general and the director of national intelligence may authorize jointly for period of up to 1 year from the effective date of the authorization the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states to acquire foreign intelligence information an authorisation pursuant to fisa section 1881a permits foreign intelligence information to be obtained both by directly intercepting communications during transmission and by making request to an electronic service provider that stores the information to make it available to the authorities united kingdom the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 distinguishes between internal and external surveillance where the communication is internal ie neither sent nor received outside the british islands see ripa s 20 warrant to permit lawful interception must describe one person as the interception subject s 81a or identify single set of premises for which the interception is to take place s 81b the warrant must set out the addresses numbers apparatus or other factors or combination of factors that are to be used for identifying the communications that may be or are to be intercepted s 82 where the communication is external that is either sent or received outside the british islands ripa s 81 and 82 do not apply there is need to identify any particular person who is to be subject of the interception or particular address that will be 39targeted new zealand the government security communications bureau gcsb is permitted to conduct interception by applying for an interception warrant under s15a of the government communications security bureau act 2003 amended 2013 however s14 of the act as amended states that in performing the function of intelligence gathering and analysis the gscb cannot authorise or do anything for the purpose of intercepting the private communications of person who is new zealand citizen or permanent resident of new zealand unless and to the extent that the person comes within the definition of foreign person or foreign organisation however this limitation does not apply to the gcsbs two other functions surveillance of new zealanders related to cybersecurity and assisting other agencies such as the police and the definition of private communications could be interpret to exclude metadata australia under the intelligence services act 2001 the australian intelligence agencies can conduct any activity connected with their functions138 provided they have the authorisation of the relevant minister s8 however where there is an australian person involved the minister must be satisfied of the following before making an authorisation s9 any activities which may be done in reliance on the authorisation will be necessary for the proper performance of function of the agency concerned and b there are satisfactory arrangements in place to ensure that nothing will be done in reliance on the authorisation beyond what is necessary for the proper performance of function of the agency and c there are satisfactory arrangements in place to ensure that the nature and consequences of acts done in reliance on the authorisation will be

involved in one or more of the following activities i activities that present significant risk to persons safety ii acting for or on behalf of foreign power iii activities that are or are likely to be threat to security iv activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or the movement of goods listed from time to time in the defence and 138 which include to obtain foreign

and b if the australian person is or is likely to be involved in an activity or activities that are or are likely to be threat to security whether or not covered by another subparagraph of paragraph in addition to subparagraph aiiiobtain the agreement of the minister responsible for administering the australian security intelligence organisation act 1979 there are separate rules to protect the privacy of australians for each of the intelligence agencies stating that where it is not clear whether person is an australian it is presumed that person within australia is australian and outside of australia is not australian rule 11 where an intelligence agency does retain intelligence information concerning an australian person the agency must ensure the information is protected by security safeguards and access to the information is only to be provided to persons who require it rule 22 canada the national defence act pertains to the communications security establishment canada csec and establishes that the mandate of csec is s27364 1 to acquire and use information from the global information infrastructure for the purpose of providing foreign intelligence in accordance with government of canada intelligence priorities b to provide advice guidance and services to help ensure the protection of electronic information and of information infrastructures of importance to the government of canada 2 of the section provides that activities shall not be directed at canadians or any person in canada and b shall be subject to measures to protect the privacy of canadians in the use and retention of intercepted information it is evident that the legal frameworks of the five eyes states currently distinguish between the obligations owed to nationals or those within the states territories and nonnationals and those outside in doing so these legal frameworks infringe upon the rights of all individuals within the respective states jurisdiction ie anyone whose communications pass through and are interfered with within the territory of that state to enjoy human rights protections equally and without discrimination in human rights law discrimination constitutes any distinction exclusion restriction or preference or other differential treatment based on any ground including national or social origin or other status and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition enjoyment or exercise by all persons on an equal footing of 41all rights and freedoms the human rights committee has deemed nationality ground of other status with respect of article 21 of the iccpr in gueye and ors v france139 it is both irrational and contrary to the spirit and purpose of international human rights norms to suppose that the privacy of persons communications could be accorded different legal weight according to their nationality or residence an equivalent distinction on the basis of ethnicity or gender would be deemed to be manifestly incompatible with human rights law why then should states be able to purport to offer varying protections based on an individuals nationality or location if an individual within states jurisdiction is granted lower or diminished human rights protections or indeed is deprived of such protections solely on the basis of their nationality or location this will not only lead to violation of the right they seek to enjoy but will amounts to an interference with their right to be free from discrimination towards an understanding of interferencebased jurisdiction individuals have legitimate expectation that their human rights will be respected not only by the state upon whose territory they stand but by the state within whose territory their rights are exercised the current legal frameworks of the five eyes states purport to discriminate between the rights and obligations owed to nationals or those physically within their territory and those outside of it or nonnationals yet the concept of jurisdiction under human rights law is not rigid one states have interferencebased jurisdiction for particular negative human rights obligations when the interference with the right occurs within their territory the way the global communications infrastructure is built requires that the right to privacy of communications can be exercised globally and communications can be monitored in place far from the location of the individual to whom they belong accordingly the states parties to the five eyes arrangement have jurisdiction over and thus owe obligations to individuals whose communications they monitor which jurisdiction is invoked when the state interferes with the communication of an individual thus infringing upon their right to privacy this understanding of jurisdiction and human rights obligations pertaining to the right to privacy is key to ensuring that individuals can seek redress against global surveillance arrangements that are threatening their rights to privacy and free expression 139 gueye and others v france comm 1961985
