shsgp and uasi in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 on december 26 2007 the appropriations act states that shsgp and uasi funding including funding for law enforcement terrorism prevention activities will be allocated by the methods enacted in pl 110 53 both the fy2007 overview and pl 11053 distribution methods1 are similar in that shsgp letpp and uasi grants are 100 based on risk and anticipated effectiveness the primary differences between the two distribution methods described in the fy2007 overview and pl 11053 are as follows the fy2007 overview states that dhs first allocated 100 of shsgp letpp and uasi funding based on risk and anticipated effectiveness then dhs ensured each applicant was allocated guaranteed minimum of 075 as required by section 1014 of the usa patriot act pl 10756 of total shsgp and letpp appropriations to each state the district of columbia dc and puerto rico also each us insular area is guaranteed 025 1 the distribution method enacted in

overview for fy2007 provides among other things information on eligible applicants authorized expenditures funding availability program application requirements award and reporting requirements grant allocation methods and final grant awards the overview also discusses the role of risk and effectiveness in the grant award allocations risk and effectiveness were the primary factors considered in the distribution of hsgp funds to states and us insular areas in fy2007 risk dhs determined state and urban area risk by using risk and anticipated effectiveness formula developed by the office of grant programs ogp in conjunction with other dhs and federal entities distribution of shsgp letpp and uasi funding was based on this risk and effectiveness formula the specific formula however was not made publicly available and may not be available in the future due to security concerns more generally dhs indicated that the risk calculations were based upon consideration of the following factors threat the likelihood of an attack occurring and vulnerability and consequence the relative exposure and expected impact of an attack14 the risk score generated by dhs for the hsgp in fy2007 was based on 100 point scale where threat could contribute maximum of 20 points and vulnerabilityconsequence could contribute up to 80 points thus most of the variation across jurisdictions likely arose from variation in the vulnerability and consequence factor 12 pl 110161 div title iii 13 ibid 14 us department of homeland security office of grant program fy2007 homeland security grant program final awards overview p 3 crs5 the risk evaluation incorporated the potential impact of terrorism on people critical infrastructure and the economy generally more specifically for each jurisdiction dhs used total population at risk population density and location of specific characteristics that might contribute to risk when quantifying threat dhs used the us intelligence communitys threat assessments for identifying potential targets risk assessments of individual applicants were worth twothirds of their application score15 effectiveness and peer review grant applicants were required to submit an investment justification that identified how their homeland security activities programs and initiatives supported the national preparedness goal relevant applicant homeland security strategies and targeted capabilities enhancement plans individual applicant investment justifications were evaluated on the anticipated effectiveness of the applicants homeland security priorities priorities identified in dhss fy2007 homeland security grant program program guidance and application kit and the national preparedness goal dhs stated that the evaluation of investment justifications would identify which applicants had effective plans to reduce overall terrorism risks16 the fy2007 grant allocation methods for all of the component programs are discussed in more detail below shsgp and

appropriated amounts for fy2007 as well as the authorized shsgp and uasi appropriation amounts for fy2008 through fy2012 with corresponding guaranteed shsgp and letpp in fy2007 minimum amounts for each state dc and puerto rico calculation of the result of the authorized appropriations times the percent guaranteed state minimum both specified in the statute indicates that the minimum amount would increase over the fy2008 to fy2012 time frame even though the minimum percentage declines this result occurs because the percentage is applied to the total authorized appropriations for both shsgp and uasi and the uasi authorized appropriation increases by 53 over the fy2008 to fy2012 time frame28 for example in fy2008 the shsgp guaranteed state minimum 0375 of total shsgp and uasi authorized appropriations of 18 billion will be 675 million and in fy2012 the shsgp guaranteed state minimum 035 of total shsgp and uasi authorized appropriations of 225 billion will be 7875 million

statutorily required inclusion of uasi amounts in the determination of guaranteed shsgp minimums from fy2008 through fy2012 911 commission recommendation since pl 11053 requires dhs to guarantee minimum amount of shsgp funding to states it could be argued that the law does not meet the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states 911 commission recommendation to allocate homeland security funding based solely on risk if congress were to appropriate the authorized shsgp and uasi amounts in pl 11053 it could be argued that this issue might be further noticeable since guaranteed minimum dollar amounts increase based on the statutes authorized appropriations even though the guaranteed minimum percentage decreases from fy2008 through fy2012 30 continued dakota utah vermont west virginia and wyoming us department of homeland security office of grant programs fy2007 homeland security grant program final awards overview pp 1113 crs11 others might contend that the statute is consistent with the 911 commissions recommendation while the 911 commission criticized the allocation of federal homeland security assistance and recommended that the distribution not remain program for general revenue sharing31 commissioners acknowledged that every state and city needs to have some minimum infrastructure for emergency response32 the 911 commission also recommended that state and local homeland security assistance should supplement state and local resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that merit additional support and offered two highrisk vulnerable cities as examples saying now in 2004 washington dc and new york city are certainly at the top of any such list33 it could be argued however that if dhs were to determine during its risk and effectiveness analysis that all grant recipients scored above the guaranteed minimum then the increase in guaranteed minimum dollar amounts would not affect the overall allocation this could result in dhs not having to reallocate funding to ensure applicants meet the guaranteed minimum amount 31 national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission report washington gpo
