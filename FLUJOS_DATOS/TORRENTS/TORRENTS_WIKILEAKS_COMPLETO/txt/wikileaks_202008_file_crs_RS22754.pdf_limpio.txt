reimburse state and local law enforcement entities for nsse security costs13 federal funding for national special s ecurity events nsse costs incurred by federal state and local entities is one i ssue congress may wish to address in fy2008 congress appropriated 1 million for nsse costs within the secret service14 in addition the 110th congress appropriated total of 100 million for the 2008 presidential nominating conventions security this 100 million is to be administered through department of justices doj office of jus tice programs and this appropriation is to be used for security and related costs incurre d by state and local governments including overtime associated with these two nsses15 some might argue that the 1 million congress has appropriated for nsses in fy2008 may not be adequate to fund unexpected nsse expenditures such as the funeral of former president the amount ppropriated could be dditionally problematic considering that the secret service is not authorized to reimburse state and local law enforcement entities overtime costs associated with nsses any security costs incurred by the secret service could be funded with appropriations specifically designated for the agency whereas federal reimbursement of any security costs incurred by state and local jurisdictions would have to be appropriated thr ough other federal assistance programs such as the 100 million appropriated for th 2008 presidential nominating conventions through dojs office of justice programs congress might consider establishing program within secret service that not only provides the agency with additional funds for unexpected nsse security costs but also authorizes the secret service to reimburse state and local law enforcement entities for security costs presently state and local jurisdictions can use dhs grants such as the state homeland security grant program shsgp and the urban area security initiative uasi for nsse security activities the grant approval process for these programs however is not flexible so the programs have limited application to nsses states and localities would need to plan shsgp and uas i funding for nsse security annually in their grant applications for unexpected nsses which may be the result of an unexpected death of president or change in location of planned nsse states and localities are unable to plan use shsgp or uas i funds to in advance for security costs dhs does authorize states and localities to reprogram shsgp and uas i funding with the dhs secretarys approval however that may result in states and localities not funding other planned homeland security activities
