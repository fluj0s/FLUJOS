that msbs as well as most socalled nonbank fina ncial institutions comply with bsa reporting requirements25 primary responsibility for this duty rests with the irss small business and selfemployed taxpayers division sbse there are four aspects of the irss bsa program 1 identif ying nonbanks subject to th law 2 educating nonbanks on their reporting and recordkeeping responsib ilities 3 conducting ex aminations of the nonbanks compliance with the bsa reporting re quirements and 4 referring to fincen for possible assessment of penalties26 internal audits have been critical of the irs with regard specifically to msbs leading some to doubt the irss ability to effectively enforce th bsa against msbs27 the controversy surrounds the large number of msbs operating in this country estimated at over 160000 licensed and unlicen sed compared to the irss limited resources in december 2000 the treasury departments inspector general for tax administration conducted an inte rnal audit and found that th irs had identified less than half of the msbs subject to the bsa28 the findings were part of an audit critical of the irss bsa compliance program for all nonbanks not just msbs some of the major faults found in the audit included inadequate resources for educating nonbanks as to applicable bsa requirements not enough compliance examinations overall neglect of entire geographic regions by the irs in administering compliance examinations not enough referrals made to fincen for possible assessment of penalties29 the primary reason cited in the audit for the deficiencies in the irss bsa program was that the irs had not placed responsibility fo r achieving its bsa goals with local field managers in essence the audit found th at the bsa compliance program was not uniform priority for most agents in the field and that bsa compliance was somehow seen as outside of the irss main mission ie tax enforcement30 the audit made nine recommendations for improving the irs bsa compliance program including establishinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22003crs5 31 id at 1314 32 see tigta final audit report additional efforts ar needed to improve the bank secrecy act compliance program audit 200330004 45 march 12 2004 33 id 34 id at 1011 relatedly the treasury auditor studi ed the violations reported in three different field offices and the results raise important ques tions for example ffice reported violations in 50 of closed cases while ffices b and c only reported viola tions in 10 and 11 of closed cases respectively if the irs had more effective monitoring program in place and conducted this study on its own the auditor argued this type of analysis might lead management to try to determine why more violations are not be ing identified in area offices b and c id at 89 35 id at 1113 significantly in its study the audit f ound that those area offices with more complete documentation reported more bsa violations overall 36 id at 1314 fincen which has legal custody of sars believes there are certain legal impediments preventing fincen from sharing sars with irs examiners although it appears that these two agencies are working out an agreement to coordinate irs access to sars id 37 id at 1617performancebased indicators and tracking achie vement of those indicators assigning more analysts to bsa responsibilities suring accountability of field managers31 subsequently the irs established nati onal program manager for bsa compliance and established dedicated groups of fiel d officers to focus exclusively on bsa compliance in addition field officers were given more extensive bsa training and the irs entered into an agreement with fincen to increase by 70 the number of irs bsa examiners to improve edu cation the irs contracted out an initiative to distribute an information package to roughly 10000 potential msbs32 on march 12 2004 the treasury department released its findings from second audit and found that although the irs s made some improve ments to its bsa compliance program significant problems persist33 first the 2004 audit found that the irs does not employ standardized riskbas ed criteria for choosing which nonbanks to inspect or which ones to visit for followup investigations similar to findings in the 2000 audit the 2004 audit found that the irs is lacking in its ability to respond to regions that become hot money laundering areas the audit concluded that given the irss limited resources compared to the mammo th task of monitoring nonbank bsa compliance the irs needs to use risk assessment and data collection to determine which regions and specific businesses need to be examined34 in addition the 2004 audit found that irs area offices frequently do not retain sufficient documentation to support their final compliance determinations35 perhaps most significantly the audit found that irs examin ers often do not have access to sars filed by nonbanks36 in fact the audit found general lack of coordination between fincen which has legal custody of sars and the irs on bsa matters and that the irs is not referring enough cases to fincen for assessment of possi ble civil penalties37 while the irs continues to implement reforms in response to the treasury department audit one being negotiations w ith fincen to secure access to sars some have questioned whether the irs alone can handle the responsibility of monitoring bsahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22003crs6 38 congress has shown interest in this question before in section 357 of the usa patriot act congress directed the treasury secretary to s ubmit report addressing among other things whether the irs should continue to be responsible for monitoring bsa compliance of msbs the secretary submitted this report on april 26 2002 finding that the irs has the expertise and resources to carry out this function but that as the irs internal audit concluded more of these resources need to be committed to the bsa enforcement program the report can be found at

committee held hearing focusing in part on this issue at the hearing diana l taylor the new york state banking superintendent urged congress to pass legislation allowing states to enforce the bsa against msbs39 in response the commissioner of sbse stified that the irs has recently created within sbse new office of fraudbsa with 310 field examiners divided into four territories that will work closely with fincen40 the commissioner also testified that the irs is negotiating model pact for c oordination between states and the irs with respect to the enforcement of the bsa against msbs41 in addition the pact would offer federal training to state regulators to assist in bsa examination of msbs42 conclusion while the irs has made significant strides in improving its bsa compliance program internal audits reveal that important questions remain as to whether the irs is stretched too thin with regard to 1 monitoring bsa compliance and 2 analyzing data collected in examinations and drawing conclusions from that data both of these problems stem from the larg number of nonbank fi nancial institutions nationwide and attention s focused largely on msbs msbs are believed to number over 160000 the majority of which are not regi stered and are hard to track because of their traditionally small size
