declared on december 1 2008 that the us economy is now in recession that began in december 2007 during that quarter the fourth quarter of 2007 gdp contracted at an annual rate of 02 it then grew at annual rates of 09 and 28 during the first and second quarters of 2008 during the third quarter gdp again contracted at an annual rate of 05 employment has reflected the slowdown in the economy the unemployment rate rose to 65 in october from 48 year earlier and since peaking in december 2007 payroll employment has fallen by some 12 million inflation is also on the rise the headline inflation rate measured by the cpi rose 37 for the 12 months ending in october 2008 this is higher than the core inflation rate which excludes food and energy of 22 however for the three mont hs ending in october 2008 the headline cpi fell at an annual rate of 44 this was largely driven by the fall in the price of oil excluding food and energy the cpi rose at an annualized rate of 11 the consensus among economists is that gdp growth for 2008 will over the entire year be positive it is expected that fourth quarter will see further contraction of gdp during 2009 gdp growth is expected to range between 11 and 03 the unemployment rate is expected to average between 64 and 67 during the fourth quarter of 2008 rising to between 71 and 80 during the fourth quarter of 2009 inflation is expected to moderate over 2009 while the international trade deficit is large it has declined and the decline is expected to continue during the first three quarters of 2008 this decline and the increase in government expenditures have been the two positive sources of support for gdp growth in the economy they have not however been sufficiently large to offset the decline in consumer and business spending to contain the economic contraction and to ease the stress in national financial markets the federal reserve has eased monetary policy over the past fifteen months between september 18 2007 and october 29 2008 the target for the federal funds rate has been incrementally reduced to 10 from 525 this has involved an unprecedented increase in the reserves of depository institutions in addition the federal reserve has created number of new means for injecting additional reserves and liquidity into the financial system including making loans to nonfinancial firms additional fiscal stimulus has also been forthcoming the structural measure of the budget deficit has increased from 11 of potential gdp in fy 2007 to 24 in fy2008 new fiscal initiatives are expected to raise the structural deficit even higher during fy2009 this report will be updated monthly

nonpartisan nonprofit research institute that dates the business cycle for the united states declared on december 1 2008 that the us economy has been in recession since last december in support of this decision gdp growth in the us has been negative during two of the last four quarters during the fourth quarter of 2007 gdp contracted at an annual rate of 02 and duri ng the third quarter of 2008 at an annual rate of 05 during both the first and second quarters of 2008 gdp growth was positive at annual rates of 09 and 28 respectively 1 the rise in payroll employment peaked in december 2007 since then it has dropped by some 12 million the unemployment rate is also on the rise and in october stood at 65 compared with 48 year earlier these rates are above the 38 low during the 1990s expansion measured or headline inflation remains high as measured by the consumer price index cpi it rose 37 for the 12 months ended in october 2008 compared with 41 during 2007 and 25 in 2006 the rise in the core rate for the 12 months ending in october which excludes food and energy prices was 22 the broadest measure of inflation for the economy the gdp price index rose at an annual rate of 26 over the first three quarters of 2008 compared with 27 over 2007 the federal reserve has responded to both the slowdown in economic activity and the financial crisis that began during the summer of 2007 in two ways first it reduced the target rate for federal funds to 10 from 525 this has involved unprecedented increases in the reserves of depository institutions mainly commercial banks second it has exploited little used provision of the federal reserves act to create number of new means for expanding the reserves and liquidity of the nations financial system including lending to financial firms that were not previously eligible for such loans and making loan s directly to nonfinancial firms in the process the assets of the federal reserve have more than doubled over the past year from 900 billion to 22 trillion midnovember 2007 to midnovember 2008 fiscal policy has also shifted from contraction to expansion as result of such measures as tax cuts and tax rebates the structural measure of the budget deficit rose from 11 of potential gdp in fy2007 to 24 in fy2008 additional fiscal measures to stimulate the economy should further increase the structural deficit during the current fiscal year g6g142g157g138g146g149g156g561 g9g6g18g561 the longer run perspective on gdp growth can be gleaned from table 1 even during the contraction year 2001 gdp growth on the whole was positive but low the annual data 1 the gdp data for the third quarter of 2008 come from the second or preliminary estimates

federal budget deficit or surplus to full employment gdp also called potential gdp when that is done as shown in table 7 fiscal policy was contractionary between fy2003 and fy2007 as the structural budget deficit declined to 11 of potential gdp from 26 fiscal countercyclical initiatives undertaken during fy2008 such as the tax cuts and rebates reversed this trend and the projected structural deficit is expected to rise to 24 of potential gdp wh the actual budget deficit and actual gdp are used the conclusion is similar in direction to that obtained when the structural measures are used

primarily commercial banks buy and sell reserves to ensure that the target prevails the fed must be prepared to buy and sell seasoned or already issued us treasury securities when it buys these securities in support of lower target it supplies reserves to this market and when it sells these securities to support target increase it reduces reserves6 as shown in figure 2 other shortterm interest rates tend to mimic the federal funds rate this is not usually true for longer term rates their changes as well as the magnitude of their changes are often different due in part to the fact that they respond to the longer term outlook for inflation the financing requirements of the federal budget and the international flow of capital an examination of figure 2 reveals that over the past eight years the federal funds target has been on sort of roller coaster pathdown up and down the initial decline in the target was to set in motion recovery from the 2001 recession and to deal with

years because of the slowness of the economy to recover and expand and because of fear that the us might experience price deflation similar to that experienced by japan this policy may have had serious unintended consequences the shift in housing finance in the us from fixed rate to variable rate mortgages meant that the housing sector was now far more vulnerable to shortterm interest rates number of analysts now believe that consequence of keeping the target rate low for three years was to set in motion housing price bubble bubble that began to burst as the fed tightened monetary policy between june 2004 and june 2006 the target was raised incrementally 17 times to 5¼ from 1 during the summer of 2007 the bubble burst and the economy began to slump as noted above the fed responded with substantial easing of monetary policy between october 2007 and midnovember 2008 the reserves of depository institutions increased from 424 billion to 6529 billion an unprecedented expansion over such short period still this was not enough to deal with the financial crisis the fed initiated number of new way to supply additional reserves and liquidity to the financial system and to some nonfinancial firms as well 7 the magnitude of this is also unprecedented during october 2007 total borrowing from the federal reserve was 254 million by midnovember 2008 it had grown to 7252 billion

over the longer run the economic wellbeing of nation depends on the growth of potential output or gdp per capita crucial to this growth is the fraction of nations resources devoted to capital formation the ability to add to the capital stock through investment depends on nations saving rate saving comes from several sources in the private sector individuals households and businesses are responsible for saving the former save when all of their after tax income is not used for consumption businesses save through retained earnings and capital consumption allowances the public sector can also be source of national saving and this occurs when government revenues are larger than expenditures budget surpluses then can be viewed as source of national saving table 10 shows the sources of saving for the united states during the past 45 years there are several things to note about these data first except for the decade of the 1990s and 20002007 the gross private sector savings rate has averaged remarkably stable 1719 of gdp with httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30329g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g5g152g151g141g146g157g146g152g151g156g561

however the private sector saving rate net of depreciation representing saving available for additions to capital declined considerably beginning in the 1990s the drop in the household personal savings rate has been the major factor in the decline in the private sector saving rate thus even without federal budget deficit the united states would have had saving problem second over this 45year period the saving done by the public sector as whole has declined there is however diversity as to the contribution made by the level of government the large negative contribution made by the federal government during the 1980s and 20022005 reflects the widely publicized budget deficit even though state and local governments have been running budget surpluses they have not been large enough to offset the federal deficits this was reversed during the period 19932001 the improved budget position of the federal government during this period added to national saving third the data show that for 20 of these 45 years the united states exported small fraction of its savings to the rest of the world ie was net exporter of capital this changed during the 1980s when the united states began to import the savings of the rest of the world the united states has been able to sustain its growth and standard of living since the 1980s because we have been able so far to attract suffic ient capital saving from international investors without these savings the united states would have had financing gap in view of its domestic saving shortfall relative to its demand for investment capital in the absence of sufficient capital us interest rates would have had to rise in order to restore balance between investment and now smaller amount of saving higher intere st rates would have choked off investment and dampened us growth 9 should efforts to correct the international trade deficit prove fruitful the net inflow of foreign saving will diminish or perhaps on net cease that is stabilize should this occur without significant improvement in either the private sector saving rate or the negative saving rate of the public sector the rate of new investment will fall to very low level in the united states and with it the means for improving the wellbeing of future generations of americans sudden increase in the national saving rate is however not without some possible adverse consequences in the short run sudden increase in the saving rate means decreased consumption or lower public sector net spending both of which depress aggregate demand moreover in either case the demand for some types of output would decline to be replaced by an increased demand for other types of output as result some industries and firms would have to contract while others expand resources would have to transit from declining to growing industries these shortrun dislocations should be borne in mind if higher national saving rate becomes the object of public policy 9 see also crs report
