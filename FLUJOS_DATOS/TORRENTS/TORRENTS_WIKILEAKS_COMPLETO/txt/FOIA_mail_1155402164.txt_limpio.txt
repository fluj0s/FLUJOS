from wahl eugene r wahlealfrededu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re confidential date sat 12 aug 2006 130244 0400 hi keith thanks so much for the chance to look over this section i think the long section you added on pp 65 and 66 reads well and makes good sense according to what i know indeed reading the whole section is good review for i suggested addition of phrase in lines 3233 on page 63 regarding mm 2003 and analysis of it by wahlammann 2006 i also suggest logically useful change from singular to plural in line 42 of that page the changes are in redbold font i should note that aw 2006 is still in in press status and its exact publication date will be affected by publication of an editorial designed to go with it that caspar and i are submitting this weekend thus i cannot say it is certain this article will come out in 2006 but its final acceptance for publication as of 22806 remains completely solid also i added the full information for the wahlritsonammann 2006 science article in the references section also in redbold font by the way is the ajs ncarcsm model in fig 613 the one caspar did i couldnt tell this for sure from the information in the text if it is perfect if not is there way to include his millenium run thanks to you and all the authors for you painstaking work peace gene dr eugene r wahl asst professor of environmental studies alfred university

that i never intended that you should spend so much time on this though i really appreciate your take on these points the one you highlight here correctly warns that in succumbing to the temptation to be lazy in the sense of the brief answer that i have provided i do give an implied endorsement of the sense of the whole comment this is not of course what i intended i simply meant to agree that some reference to the divergence issue was necessitated i will revise the reply to say briefly that i do not agree with the interpretation of the reviewer i am attaching what i have done see blue highlighting to the section in response to comments including the addition of the needed extra section on the treering issues called for by several people i have had feedback yet on this as it has not been generally circulated but thought you might like to see it please remember that this is for your eyes only please do not feel that i am asking expecting you to go through this in any detail but given the trouble you have takeni thought it reasonable to give you private look cheers keith at 0716 27072006 you wrote hi keith here is the text with my comments i will go over the stolen parts highlighted in blue outline for final time tomorrow morning but i wanted to get this to you asap the main new point i have to make is added in boldblue font on pp 101103 i question the way the response to the comment there is currently worded as it seems to imply that the divergence issue really does invalidate any dendrobased reconstructions before about 1850which i imagine is not what you would like to say i give series of arguments against this as general conclusion maybe i got overbold in doing so as in my point 1 im examining issues that are at the very core of your expertise excuse that one but i decided to jump in anyway let know if i got it wrong in any way there are other quite minor suggestions mostly focused on referencing other responses in few places that are also in boldblue these go on into the 120s in terms of page numbers this is really lot of work youve taken on and i really appreciate what you and the others are doing ive also been lot involved with helping to get person from the pew center for global climate change ready to testify in front of the house energy and environment committee tomorrow that is why i couldnt get this done and sent to you earlier today send mike mann and jay gulledge pew center all good thoughts for strength and clarity nb r towards the end of the filename stands for my middle initial peace gene dr eugene r wahl asst professor

subject re confidential gene here is where i am up to now with my responses still load to do you can see that i have borrowed stolen from 2 of your responses in significant degree please assure that this ok and will not later be obvious hopefully you will get the whole textconfidentially again soon you could also see that i hope to be fair to mike but he can be little unbalanced in his remarks sometime and i have had to disagree with his interpretations of some issues also please do not pass these on to anyone at all keith will pass all comments to you before they are fixed in stone nothing from review article will be mentioned really grateful to you thanks keith at 0508 22072006 you wrote hi keith glad to help if i could get chance to look over the sections of my text you would post to the comments before you do i would appreciate it if this is burdenproblem let know and well work it out if it is anything from the wahlammann paper of course that is fine to use at once since it is publicly available there will only be exceedingly minorfew changes in the galleys including footnote pointing to the extended re benchmarking analysis contained in the ammannwahl review article what i am concerned about for the time being is that nothing in the review article shows up anywhere it is just going in and confidentiality is important the only exception to this are the points i make in my blue comments in the big review file on page 104 concerning the mm way of benchmarking the re statistic those comments are fine to repeat at this point please excuse my hesitance in this way actually all the other blue comments i made in the big review file are also fine to use at once again if this request is in any way problem let know and well figure out something peace gene dr eugene

confidential gene your comments have been really useful and reassuring that i am not doing mm disservice i will use some sections of your text in my comments that will be eventually archived so hope this is ok with you i will keep the section in the chapter very brief but will cite all the papers to avoid claims of bias i really would like to discuss the whole issue of the reconstruction differences at later less stressful time i completely accept the arguments about the limitation in the r2 and the value of capturing longerterm variance i think i will have to stop now as the temp and humidity are killing here thanks lot again keith at 1839 21072006 you wrote hi keith im sorry that there is bit to digestalthough i know it is just result of the nature of things by the way copied below is synopsis that i sent this morning to person in dc who is working on all this with regard to the house of representative hearings evidently there is to be at least one more hearing next week and mike mann will go the person i sent this to is trying to understand the importance of the proxy pc issues especially how matter what way the pc extraction is done the reconstructions converge if the structures actually present in the data are not tossed out by truncating the number retained pcs at too low level what ive copied is this synopsis i think it is straightforward maybe bit dense but at least brief also let know if i can help on the issue of re vs r2 i could write few brief sentences as something for you to look at if you would like wahlammann show very clearly that there is objectively demonstrated skill at the lowfrequency level of the verification period mean for all the mbh segments although the earlier mbh segments do have really low r2 values indicating very little skill at the interannual level our argument that to throw out the reconstruction completely based on the fastest varying frequency when it has objectively demonstrable meaning at lower frequencies is to quite reasonable that it is some how entirely ad hoc as mcintyre claims in one more of his comments is neither logical nor factual in my perspective the idea of frequency dependent skillnonskill is not new to the literature and the independent rereviewer that steve schneider had look over wahlammann said she had experienced this issue in hisher work g copied text what it boils down to in the end is as follows 1 the different reference periods used to calculate proxy pcs from n america calibration only for mbh full period for mm only have the effect of rearranging how the hockey stick shape appears across the rank ordering of pcs in mbh it is concentrated in pc1 in the fullperiod method it is spread over pcs 1 and 2 if one adds pcs 1 and 2 either arithmetically or as vectors from either convention you get an essentially identical time series only the amplitudes are bit different note that the input data were centered and standardized before being put into the pc calculation algorithm this is important as shown below when actually used in the reconstruction the difference is miniscule mbh is colder over 14001449 by 005 degrees 2 if the data are centered but not standardized and are input into in pca algorithm using the variancecovariance matrix and not the correlation matrix the way mm did it then the hockey stick shape shows up in pc4 mm in fact reported this first in their 2005 energy and environment article in effect the first two pcs are are acting to do the standardizing of the data not done as preprocessing step when the correlation matrix is used instead in the pca algorithm then the standardization is in effect done by the algorithm because all the correlations are standardized by constructionthey all range between 0 and 1 when 4 pcs from this calculation method are used rather than 2 pcs calculated as above then the reconstruction converges to the same as above 3 thus all the different flavors for pc extraction have essentially effect on reconstruction when one does the exercise of adding pcs sequentially from 2 to 5 for any flavor in the case of 1 the reconstructions converge by the second pc in the case of 2 they converge by pc4 they dont change with higher order pcs added this should be expected from first principles that is the same underlying information is there in all cases it is only how the structures present in these data are spread across the rank order of pcs as explained the simple exercise of taking the reconstructions to convergence across the number of pcs used shows this clearly 4 in fact mm essentially say all this in the 2005 ee articleincluding about the reconstruction results but they strongly claim that the movement of the hockey stick shape to the 4th pc shows it is not leading pattern of variance as mbh claim and thus should not be used this might be logical if their analysis was an applesapples comparison but it is not due to the pca method they use and applying it on nonstandardized data these two differences which one can only fully get from their actual code not in the articles published drive their entire argument on this particular issue what they do not say is that convergence to something like the mbh result is expectable and indeed must happen given the data used because the hockey stick shape is actually in the data it is not an artifact of pc calculation procedure 5 finally note that all of this rests on the foundation that keeping the bristlecone pine records in the data is appropriate which caspar and i find can be reasonable presumption if one believes that the bristlecone data should be removed then the 14001449 reconstruction does not pass verification testing with the re statistic and the mbh reconstruction should commence from 1450 on out although there are number of reasons to keep the bristlecone data in maybe the most compelling reason they are nonissue is that over the common period of overlap 14501980 the reconstruction based on using them from 14001980 is very close to the reconstruction based on omitting them from 14501980 since the issues about the bristlecone response to climate are primarily about 1850 onwards especially 1900 onwards keith please let know if i am not accurate in this there is reason to expect that their behavior during 14001449 is in any way anomalous to their behavior from 14501850 thus there is reason to think that the bristlecones are somehow making the 14001449 segment of the mbh reconstruction be inappropriately skewed end of copied text peace gene dr eugene r wahl asst professor of environmental
