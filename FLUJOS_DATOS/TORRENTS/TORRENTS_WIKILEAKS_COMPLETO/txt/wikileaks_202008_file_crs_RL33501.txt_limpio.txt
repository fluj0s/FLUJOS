july 7 2006 nonna noto specialist in public finance government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress indexing the estate tax exemption for inflation summary the estate tax exemption has not previously been indexed for inflation rather congress has acted from time to time to raise the statutory amount exempt from tax even with the increases legislated by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 the estate tax exemption remained below what it would have been if the exemption of 600000 in 1987 had simply been indexed for inflation over the 19882006 period in contrast the increases made by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra overshot the inflationadjusted level by increasingly large margins once the exemption rose above 1 million in 2002 and 2003 to 15 million in 2004 and 2005 2 million in 20062008 and 35 million in 2009 this is reflected in substantial decline in the projected number of taxable estate tax returns measured as percentage of adult deaths over the years 20042009 to well below the common historical range of 1 to 2 hr 5638 approved by the house on june 22 2006 would extend the estate tax with an exemption of 5 million effective in 2010 and indexed for inflation thereafter according to projections by the urbanbrookings tax policy center with this indexed exemption the number of taxable estates would still rise from 4100 or 015 of deaths in 2011 to 5400 or 019 of deaths in 2016 if the 5 million exemption were not indexed the number of taxable returns is projected at 7000 or 025 of deaths in 2016 under 2009 law with 35 million exemption the number of taxable returns is projected at 14100 or 050 of deaths in 2016 under current law with an exemption of 1 million in 2011 and beyond the number of taxable returns is projected at 67700 or 238 of deaths in 2016 hr 5638 would tax taxable estate values up to 25 million at the longterm capital gains tax rate it would tax amounts of 25 million or over at twice the capital gains rate the longterm capital gains rate is currently 15 through 2010 but is scheduled to return to 20 in 2011 hr 5638 would index the applicable exclusion exemption amount of 5 million per decedent for inflation after 2010 rounded each year to the nearest 100000 but the bill would not index the 25 million amount that marks the beginning of the second rate bracket that means that over time the range of values subject to tax at the capital gains rate would shrink as the lower bound marked in effect by the applicable exclusion amount rose to reflect inflation while the upper bound of 25 million remained unchanged for example if the 5 million exemption increased by 22 per year after 2010 the exemption would reach 6 million by 2018 oppositely as inflation and economic growth increased asset values greater amount of very large estates would be taxed at twice the capital gains rate than if the 25 million rate threshold were also indexed for inflation hr 5638 would not change the method of indexing the annual gift tax exclusion enacted in 1997 the bill would undo some changes made by egtrra and reunify the estate and gift taxes the same total exclusion of 5 million indexed per decedent would apply whether the assets were transferred by bequest at death or as lifetime gifts this report will be updated if legislative activity warrants

table 3 estimated effect of indexing and level of exemption on taxable estate tax returns as percentage of total deaths 2011 and 2016 10 indexing the estate tax exemption for inflation background the estate tax exemption is the term commonly used for the amount of any estate that is automatically free from tax without regard to other deductions claimed1 the exemption amount also serves as the filing threshold for the estate tax that is an estate tax return must be filed for any estate with gross assets exceeding the exemption for the year of death the level of the estate tax exemption interacts with the value of assets held by decedents to determine both the number of estate tax returns that must be filed and the number of those returns that are liable for tax2 the number of taxable estate tax returns expressed as percentage of adult deaths is commonly used measure of the incidence of the estate tax on the population over time when taxable returns as percentage of deaths rises substantially it suggests that the level of the estate tax exemption has not kept pace with the growth of assets held by wealthy individuals oppositely if that percentage falls substantially especially when the exemption is increased it suggests that the growth of the exemption has outpaced the growth of assets it may also reflect purposeful decision by congress to reduce the fraction of the population liable for the estate tax hr 5638 the permanent estate tax relief act of 2006 was passed by the house of representatives on june 22 2006 among the changes it would make are raising the level of the exemption under the unified estate and gift taxes to 5 million per decedent in 2010 and indexing that amount for inflation in the years thereafter the inflationadjusted amount of the exemption for year would be rounded to the nearest multiple of 1000003 1 under current law the exemption is formally known as the applicable exclusion amount internal revenue code sec 2010c it was previously known as the exemption equivalent of the unified credit hr 5638 calls it the applicable exclusion amount or the basic exclusion in practice it takes the form of nonrefundable tax credit equal to what the tax on the exempt amount would be the tax credit has the same value regardless of the size of an estate this is in contrast to deduction or true exemption which could have higher value for larger estates taxed at higher marginal tax rates 2 typically just under half 48 of estate tax returns filed are taxable for further information see crs report rl32768 estate and gift tax revenues several measurements by nonna noto 3 four other bills addressing the estate tax also would index the exemption for inflation hr 1568 leach hr 1574 dennis moore hr 1614 lowey and s 3626 landrieu continued crs2 the most recent previous changes to the estate tax were made by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 this report considers in historical perspective the changes made to the estate tax exemption by egtrra in 2001 and the changes that would be made by hr 5638 historical levels of the estate tax exemption the estate tax exemption has not previously been indexed for inflation rather it has required an act of congress to raise the exemption amount these adjustments have been made from time to time over the life of the estate tax which began in 1916 as shown in the last column of table 1 there were long periods when the exemption level remained unchanged notably the exempt amount remained at 60000 from late 1942 through 1976 nearly 35 years it remained at 600000 from 1987 through 1997 or 11 years the economic recovery tax act of 1981 pl 9734 raised the exemption equivalent from 175625 in 1981 to 600000 in 1987 where it was to remain until further changes were enacted the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra pl 10534 scheduled relatively gradual increases in the estate tax exemption from the level of 600000 that had prevailed from 1987 through 1997 under tra the exemption was scheduled to rise initially in 25000 increments to 625000 in 1998 650000 in 1999 675000 in 2000 and 2001 and 700000 in 2002 and 2003 then 850000 in 2004 950000 in 2005 and finally 1 million in 2006 where it would remain before even half of that scheduled phasein had occurred the provisions of tra were superseded by egtrra in 2001 the exemption amount was immediately increased to 1 million effective in 2002 and 2003 the exemption was scheduled to rise in large increments to 15 million in 2004 and 2005 2 million in 2006 through 2008 and 35 million in 2009 the estate tax was scheduled to be repealed in 2010 after which the estate tax provisions of egtrra would sunset the exemption would return to 1 million under tras provision of 1 million exemption for the years 2006 and beyond4 3 continued for further description of hr 5638 and these other bills see crs report rl32818 estate tax legislation in the 109th congress

department washington dc december 1998 table 1 available at httpwwwtreasgovotaota80pdf notes prior to 1982 the year of death figures for the number of taxable returns were approximated by using data from returns filed in the next calendar year for 1982 through 2002 the data are by year of death reported on the estate tax return they may encompass estate tax returns filed over period of at least three successive calendar years b total adult deaths include deaths of individuals age 20 and over plus deaths for which age was unavailable na data not provided by irs for 1977 through 1981 and other years not listed what if the estate tax exemption had been indexed for inflation after 1987 the introduction of indexing by hr 5638 prompts the question of how the legislated changes in the level of the estate tax exemption over the past three decades compare to what the level would have been if the exemption had been indexed for inflation the results are illustrated in figure 1 the front row of dark bars in figure 1 shows the statutory level of the estate tax exemption from 1987 through 2011 under the laws in effect prior to egtrra the exemption remained at 600000 from 1987 through 1997 it then rose gradually to 675000 in 2000 and 2001 it was scheduled to rise in steps to 1 million in 2006 where it would remain unless adjusted by future legislation the second row of light bars with gradual upward slope shows what the estate tax exemption would have been if the estate tax exemption of 600000 had simply been indexed for inflation starting in 1988 comparing these two sets of bars shows that according to the laws in effect prior to egtrra the estate tax exemption remained below what the inflation adjusted level would have been over the period from 1988 through 2006 this would be expected for the years 19881997 when the exemption remained unchanged at 600000 but even the increases scheduled by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 would not have approached the inflationadjusted level until 2006 at that time the exemption was due to reach 1 million and the inflationadjusted level would have been 106 million if the statutory exemption had remained at 1 million beyond 2006 it would have again continued to fall behind an inflationadjusted level the effects of egtrra of 2001 are shown by the back row of gray bars with stair step pattern at the right side of figure 1 egtrra of 2001 increased the exemption to 1 million effective immediately in 2002 and 2003 this change alone caught up with the inflation since 1987 the inflationadjusted levels would have been only slightly lower at 967000 and 982000 for those two years when egtrra then raised the exemption in large increments to 15 million for 2004 and 2005 2 million for 20062008 and 35 million for 2009 the statutory exemption overshot the inflationadjusted level by increasingly large margins under egtrra the estate tax is repealed in 2010 if egtrra sunsets in 2011 and the exemption crs6 returns to 1 million it would be 16 below the estimated inflationadjusted level 1192058 figure 1 statutory estate tax exemption compared with an inflationadjusted level 19872011 3500000 3000000 2500000 2000000 1500000

washington cbo jan 2006 table e1 p 136 available at httpwwwcbogov crs7 extent of the decedent population subject to the estate tax historical range one measure of the reach of the estate tax that has been calculated over time is the number of taxable estate tax returns expressed as percentage of adult deaths the middle column of table 1 above presents the percentages for most years from 19342002 as calculated by the internal revenue service these numbers suggest that there may have been target albeit unstated of keeping that percentage in the range of 1 to 2 the percentage rose above 2 over the years 1956 through 1976 when the exemption remained at 60000 where it had been since 1942 the percentage also rose above 2 from 1997 through 2001 as previously explained this was the period when the tax reform act of 1997 was increasing the exemption level but not enough to keep pace with inflation or the growth in assets projected under egtrra 20022009 the urbanbrookings tax policy center tpc has developed microsimulation model which enables it to project the effects of alternative estate tax reform proposals this includes the number of taxable returns in future years table 2 shows that under the changes in the exemption level legislated by egtrra the number of taxable estate tax returns was estimated at 111 and 119 of adult deaths when the exemption was 1 million in 2002 and 2003 the percentage was projected to fall below 1 to 071 and 079 when the exemption amount rose to 15 million for 2004 and 2005 the percentage was projected to fall further to 051 055 and 062 when the exemption rose to 2 million for 2006 2007 and 2008 the percentage was forecast to fall again by half to 028 or only 7200 taxable returns when the exemption rose to 35 million in 2009 the percentages starting in 2006 when the exemption reached 2 million are far below any of the levels experienced over the entire period from 1934 through 2002 shown in table 1 crs8 table 2 projected taxable estate

side of table 3 presents the tax policy centers estimates of the number of taxable estate tax returns under four policy alternatives for calendar year 2011 and five years later for 2016 the right side of the table presents crs crs9 calculations of the number of taxable returns as percentage of total deaths6 table 3 compares hr 5638 as amended and passed by the house with its exemption of 5 million to take effect in 2010 and be indexed for inflation thereafter to three alternatives under which the exemption is not indexed the first is hr 5638 as originally introduced with 5 million exemption but without indexing the second is an extension of 2009 law with 35 million exemption the third is current law with 1 million exemption for 2011 and beyond for each of the proposals the estimates indicate that both the number of taxable returns and taxable returns as percentage of deaths would increase over the forecast period the increases would be lowest under hr 5638 with indexing the increases would be larger the lower the exemption amount that is because more estates are likely to be able to cross lower threshold indexing any exemption amount would be expected to restrain taxable returns as percentage of deaths from rising over time unless the value of assets held by the wealthiest decedents increased by more than the rate of inflation even with the 5 million exemption indexed for inflation starting in 2011 the number of taxable returns is projected by tpc to increase under hr 5638 from 4100 in 2011 to 5400 in 2016 an increase of 1300 returns as percentage of deaths the increase is 004 percentage points from 015 to 019 the estimated increases under hr 5638 before it was indexed for inflation are slightly over twice as much as under indexing though still quite low the number of taxable returns is projected to increase by 2800 from 4200 in 2011 to 7000 in 2016 compared to 1300 with indexing as percentage of deaths the increase is 009 percentage points from 016 to 025 compared to 004 with indexing without indexing there would be 100 more taxable returns in 2011 4200 compared to 4100 in the first year of indexing and 1600 more taxable returns by 2016 7000 compared to 5400 both the levels and the projected increases are considerably larger under the other two proposals with lower exemptions included in table 3 the number of taxable estates is estimated to be approximately twice as large under an extension of 2009 law with an exemption of 35 million as under 5 million unindexed exemption 8200 versus 4200 in 2011 and 14100 versus 7000 in 2016 with fixed exemption of 35 million the number of taxable returns is projected to grow by 5900 from 8200 in 2011 to 14100 in 2016 this is an increase of 020 percentage points from 030 to 050 of total deaths under return to current law with an exemption of 1 million in 2011 and beyond the number of taxable returns is projected to be roughly five to six times higher than under 35 million exemption 50500 versus 8200 in 2011 and 67700 versus 14100 in 2016 the number of taxable returns is projected to increase by 17200 from 50500 in 2011 to 67700 in 2016 this is an increase of 051 percentage points from 187 to 238 of total deaths 6 see note to table 3 regarding the use of total deaths rather than adult deaths as the denominator crs10 thus with an exemption fixed at 1 million taxable estate tax returns as percentage of deaths are projected to rise over the 20062011 period to above the 2 upper bound of the common historical range shown in table 1 for the period 1934 2002 in contrast under either 35 million or 5 million fixed exemption taxable estate tax returns as percentage of deaths are projected to be far below the 1 lower bound of the common historical range with the 5 million exemption indexed for inflation the percentage is projected to remain below 020 or two taxable returns per thousand deaths through 2016 table 3 estimated effect of indexing and level of exemption on

for 2009 law and current law and for estimates of total deaths the tables are available at httpwwwtaxpolicycenterorg taxable returns as percentage of deaths and changes between 2011 and 2016 were calculated by crs note total deaths were estimated by the tax policy center at 2694300 for 2011 and 2844600 for 2016 the measure of total deaths is slightly larger than adult deaths for example the center on budget and policy priorities estimated the number of adult deaths at 2629999 in 2011 the last year for which their estimates are available this is 978 of the tpc estimate for total deaths consequently using total deaths as the denominator lowers the absolute percentages slightly relative to those shown in tables 1 and 2 which are based on adult deaths but it does not change the trend over time for the 2011 to 2016 estimates crs11 exemption indexed but not the rate bracket hr 5638 would tax taxable estate values up to 25 million at the longterm capital gains tax rate it would tax amounts of 25 million or more at twice the capital gains rate the longterm capital gains tax rate is currently 15 through 2010 but is scheduled to return to 20 in 2011 hr 5638 would index the applicable exclusion exemption amount of 5 million for inflation after 2010 it would not however index the 25 million amount that marks the beginning of the second rate bracket that means that over time the range of values subject to tax at the capital gains rate would shrink as the lower bound marked in effect by the applicable exclusion amount rose to reflect inflation while the upper bound of 25 million remained unchanged oppositely as inflation and economic growth increased asset values greater amount of very large estates would be taxed at twice the capital gains rate than if the 25 million rate threshold was also indexed for inflation for purposes of the internal revenue code irc the consumer price index cpi for any calendar year is defined as the average of the monthly cpi for all urban consumers published by the department of labor as of the close of the 12month period ending on august 31 of that calendar year the cost of living adjustment for particular calendar year is based on the cpi for the prior calendar year relative to the cpi for base year7 using the september 1 august 31 prior year measurement enables the cost of living adjustment to be calculated and announced in advance of the next calendar year when it will take effect for adjustments to the individual income tax the base year is 19928 for the annual gift tax exclusion the base year is 19979 under hr 5638 the base year for the estate tax exclusion would be 200910 most inflation adjustments under the income tax are rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5011 inflation adjustments to the annual gift tax exclusion are rounded down to the nearest 100012 in contrast under hr 5638 the applicable exclusion exemption amount under the estate and gift taxes would be rounded up or down to the nearest 100000 this means that indexed amounts of 50000 or above would be rounded up to the next 100000 7 internal revenue code irc sec 1f35 8 irc sec 1f3 elements of the individual income tax have
