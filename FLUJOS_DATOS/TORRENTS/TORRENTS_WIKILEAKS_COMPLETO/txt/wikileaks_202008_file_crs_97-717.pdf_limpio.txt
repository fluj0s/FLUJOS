function this study will not be updated article v collective security organization settles disputes among its members in contrast collective defense organization assists member state under attack by an outside country nato is collective defense organization article v states that nato members must consider coming to the aid of an ally under attack however it does not guarante assistance article v is the treatys key provision and the linchpin binding the united states to its nato allies it states in part that an armed attack against one or mor allies shall be considered an attack against them all additional language makes clear that th commitment to assist an ally is not unconditional rather each signa tory will assist the ally under attack with such action it deems necessary including the use of armed force1 since the early 1990s nato has begun to adopt new missions such as crisis managemen t and peacekeeping sometimes referred to as nonarticle v missions current members and candidate states however believe collective defense as expressed in article v remains the core of the alliance view likely to endure as long as the possibility of nationalistic aggressive russia

engage the united states in either world war in eac h conflict strong presidential advoca cy and growing threats to broader us interests led to eventual involvement after world war i the us senate voted down the versailles treat and with it involvement in the ague of nations because opposition remained strong to entangling alliances the protection offered by the atlantic and pacific oceans contribute d to the view that the united states still enjoyed relatively unbridgeable barrier against attack the league of nations covenant embedded in the versai lles treaty allowed but did not require signatories to us military force and economic sanctions against an aggressor the league embodied the idea of collective security under which an internationa l organization might seek to settle disputes among its members president wilson and other league supporters emphasized the condemnation of public opinion and moral force as key instruments in international affairs hitlers manipulation of public opinion and his intimidation of neighboring states mad mockery of such notions churchill who urged military force against germany from the early 1930s taunted supporters of collective securit and the league as guilty of longsuffering and inexhaustible gullibility us abs ence from2 the league left the institution without the strongest economic and military power afte r world war i and therefore without effective leadership collective defense evolution of an idea the global depression of the 1930s and the second world war made c lear that events in europe greatly affected us economic and political interests from desire to bring global stability there was considerable support in congress for creation of the united nation s in 1945 article 1 of the charter outlined resolve to maintain international peace and security and take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace and for the suppression of acts of aggression article 51 stated the inheren t right of individual or collective selfdefense if an armed attack occurs unanimous vote in the security council was necessary for collective response and the soviet union blocked meaningful action in the early years in the late 1940s continuing instability in europe led co ngress and president truman to move towards clear engagement in europ ean security the soviet unions blockade of berlin sovietbacked coup in czechoslovakia and civil war in greece wit h communists pitted against democratic government were key events rousing us efforts to construct security edifice in 1948 sen vande nberg previously an isolationist sponsored resolution stating that the uni ted states should pursue the progressive development of regional and other collective defense arrangements for individual and collective selfdefense in accordance with the charter the senate foreign relations committee approved the resolution which passed and issued report on the proposed north atlantic treaty

the senate approved the treaty which went into force augus t 24 19493 the foreign relations committee report recommended us association wit h arrangements for collective defense but laid down three conditions for us involvement first us contributions to collective defense must supplement rather than replace the efforts of the other participants on their behalf t his condition frequently noted in senate debate in succeeding years meant that allies must contribute s ignificant forces to their own defense so that the united states would not bear the brunt of the burden second president must follow constitutional processes for the united states to become involved in any security arrangement or conflict sig nal that the senate wished to exercise its duty to give advice and consent to defense arrangements that might commit us forces to war third for the united states to fulfill collective defense commitment us national interest s must clearly be affected4 from natos ea rly days the role and size of us forces in europe were keys t ensuring the viability of article v only small contingents of us conventiona l forces were in europe at natos origins in 1949 the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 and wester n europes tinuing economic weakness and political instability led president truman to send more us forces to the continent in the early 1950s there was strong opposition in congress to the policy of sending largescale us forces to europe given the long expressed sentiment that the united stat should supplement rather than replace allied forces presidents truman and eisenhower eventu ally prevailed in their desire to maintain sizeable us force in the european theater us officials seeing growing soviet threat desired contribution of west german economic and military potential to the alliance wes t germany joined the alliance in 1955 nuclear weapons and flexible response the development of nuclear arsenals by both the united states and the soviet union complicated the debate over collective defense from the 1950s through the end of the cold war through the mid1950s the united states had larger and more sophisticated nuclea r arsenal than the soviet union while the warsaw pact was thought to maintain conventi onal superiority however by 1960 the soviets successful space program and their developmen t of large bomber fleet and missile force clearly signalled that the continental united states was vulnerable to nuclear attack in any conflict originating in europe the european allies sought reassurances that the united states would trade washington for moscow if war again came to europe in 1967 under us leadership the alliance formulated the doctrine of flexibl response by which nato would use whatever means necessary to deter or repel soviet attack conventional forces would be initially engag ed but the united states pledged that it would use its strategic nuc lear arsenal to defeat the warsaw pact if conventional forces failed in the defense of western europe succeeding us administrations and congress consistently urged the allies to increas their conventional forces as the principal means tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97717crs4 lawrence freedman nato myths in geor ge thibault ed the art and practice of military5 strategy washington ndu press 1984 p 692defeat soviet attack and avoid the calamity of nuclear conflict in 1978 for example the alliance agreed u pon nonbinding pledge to increase defense spending by 3 year in order to strengthen conventional forces this commitment was only irregularly met by the allies several factors contributed to the europeans failure to strengthen thei r conventional f orces the presence of significant political groupings that viewed increased defense expenditures as provocative in an already tense international atmos phere economic strictures and the stationing by 1980 of over 300000 us forces that carri ed significant part of the burden conventional forces were expensive to maintain and nuclear forces were relatively inexpensive both france and britain had nuclear arsenals which thei r political leaders believed contributed to deterrence some observers continue to believe that flexible response was essentially myth in the vie w of one prominent analyst the attempt to deter conventional aggression i n europe with nuclear arsenal controlled by noneuropean power the ited states that is itself subject to nuclear retaliation has never appeared to be an example of political or military rationality nonetheless in the view of many strategists the us threat to use5 nuclear we apons served to create sufficient doubt in the minds of soviet leaders to deter an attack the united states deployed some of its nucle ar weapons in forward areas such as west g erman territory to signal the warsaw pact that they might be used early in conflict the presence of significant us conventional forces was itself component of the philosophy of deterrence was hington in this view would never allow us troops to be overrun and would ultimately defend them with nuclear systems if the need arose us nuclear systems in europe were step on the ladder of flexible response strategically the united states and its allies sought to enhance the link betwe us forces in europe and the us strategic nuclear arsenal with the 1979 alliance decision to bas us intermediate nuclear forces inf in europe the forward deployment in germany and elsewhere of these mobile and highly accurate missiles was meant to sig nal moscow and reassure the allies that these systems controlled by the united st ates could be employed to defeat soviet invasion doubts over the us commitment to article v endured throughout the cold war the strategic defense initiative sdi proposed in 1984 provoked criticism that the reaga n administration wished to create system that could shield the united states but not its allies against nuclear attack in the language of the era europeans viewed sdi s decoupling the link between the united states and western europe reagan administratio n officials countered that sdi by protecting the united states from nuclear attack made easie r any necessary decision in conflict to use nuclear systems against the soviets article v after the cold war the collapse of the ussr and the current disarray of the russian military hav eliminated any significant threat to western europe and the united states nato s developed new missions relating to crisis management virtually all u s nuclear systems have been removed from europe only few hundred nuclear gravity bombs of limite d military utility remain official nato doctrine does not describe russia as an enemy nuclear systems are longer targeted on russia and nuclear weapons are now for usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97717crs5 see library of congress crs nato nuclear strategy issues for us policy by stanley r6 sloan crs report 96653 july 25 1996 germany reluctant to

nato enlargement senate armed services committee april 23 199 7 unpaginated8 manuscriptonly in last resort different formulation from flexible response where such weapons were strategically mixed with conventional forces and might be used where appropriat to defeat soviet attack6 the soviet threat bo und the allies together the risks that have replaced that threat have given rise in the view of s ome observers to regionalization in nato that could undermine the viability of article v countries in one region of the alliance are concerned about dangers inherent in their geographic neighborhoods that ma not directly affect allies in distant corner of europe in 1991 there was concrete example of regionalization when turkey agreed to lend its bases as staging area for airstrikes against iraq in th persian gulf war turkish officials indicated that they might invoke article v if ira q retaliated initially the german government was sharply critical of us efforts to expel iraqi forces from kuwait otto von lambsdorff the n key figure in the german coalition government said in response to the turkish inquiry we are convinced that missile at tack on turkish t erritory does not require nato response some members of the german bundestag contended th at it was turkey by allowing us aircraft to attack targets from turkish bases that had acted provocatively and that germ any must not honor any request from ankara for assistance7 nato expansion and article v the administration continues to describe collective defense as the core of the alliance before the senate armed services committee on april 23 1997 sen kempthorne asked if nato is not antirussian then what is it who is the alliance defending against secretary of state albright responded the threat is basicallythe instability within the region and which has in fact created two world war s but there is also the possibility of an outside threat there is possibility of threats from various parts outside the region to the south we have to guard agai nst and on the off chance that in fact russia does not turn out the way we are hoping it will and its current leadership wants nato is there8 some observers believe that the impor tance of article v in the absence of russian threat is at least temporarily diminished they express concern that the growing importanc for nato of nonarticle v missions is making the alliance more collective security than collective defense organization regionalization in this view could dilute th effectiveness of the alliance natos mission in bosnia has not been undertaken to res pond to or prevent an attack n an ally but rather as crisis management reaching unanimity for the long term in bringing stability to bosnia is proving difficult some allies see an elemen t of

entry into nato of slovenia and romania as means to assure stability the nordic s opposed the candidacies of these two count ries and the danes urged the admission of the baltic states 9 nato remains an org anization geared for collective defense and leaders of nato states point out that the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce serve s the purpose of collective security through such actions as monitoring human rights arbitrating conflicts and overseeing elections in selective member states nato in contrast insists that candidate s for membership resolve ethnic and border conflicts before entering the alliance an exception to this rule has been natos effort to manage tensions between greece and turkey both alliance members agreeing upon cohesive response to threats short of war is difficult due to geography political traditions and economic need article v raises the possibility of range f responses to counter threat an ally may take such action as it deems necessary includin g the use of armed force to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area presumably such act ion could be an economic embargo or other steps short of force to compel state threatening an ally to adopt more benign policy some administration officials are discussing nuclear proliferation with candidate states as threat that could caus article v to be invoked it is not clear that all allies would agree that article v is appropriat for such threat at the same time the important difference from the era of collectiv security between the world wars is that the united states is clearly engaged in europe as natos leader and maintains the capacity to deter or defeat an adversary that threatens an allys survival
