wwwstatesgovgovpeurparisindexcfm classified by polmc josiah rosenblatt for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary and comment continuing violent unrest in france only now diminishing after thirteen intense days has very publicly brought to light the ugly reality of frances persistent failure to integrate its immigrant population importantly the violence has not taken on religious overtones nor have mainstream or as far as we can detect underground extremist muslim groups sought to manipulate the situation to their own advantage indeed the muslim establishment has been actively trying to calm the unrest the government response to reestablish order while exercising restraint and to promise to address the underlying issues of unemployment education and family breakdown seems to be working for the moment but any longerterm solutions will depend on successfully tackling the underlying issue of social exclusion in particular employment discrimination this is likely to prove difficult challenge for any government given frances slow economic growth and chronic unemployment problems changing deepseated attitudes will also be daunting challenge failure could push largely unpoliticized minority underclass to embrace the islamic political extremism the french fear most end summary and comment where we are now 2 sbu images of rampaging youth hurling molotov cocktails and defying french authorities have gripped france for the past thirteen days although france is accustomed to certain level of violence prior to the unrest the country averaged 80 car burnings daily the numbers to date are staggering some 300 towns affected since the onset of unrest more than 6600 cars burned nearly 1800 individuals taken in for questioning 11500 police and gendarmes deployed and over 100 security agents injured in response to the violence the gof has invoked emergency measures used only twice since their enactment fifty years ago during the war in algeria on the first night of the laws application curfews were implemented in parts of 25 different departments and appear to have had some success there were 617 cars reported burned 280 arrests and violence reported in 196 towns overnight as opposed to the 1173 vehicles attacked 330 people taken in for questioning and 226 communities reporting unrest the night before press reports indicate that the suburbs ringing paris were notably quieter november 8 in comparison with past nights what the violence is not 3 c the destruction of both public and private property has been enormous and often selfdefeating as the youths have targeted their own schools and gyms or their neighbors vehicles but it has fallen short of fullscale riots the perpetrators have generally not sought out open confrontations with state security agents with the notable exception of birdshot attack november 6 that wounded 10 police and hospitalized two similarly casualties have been relatively limited one youth lost hand in confrontation with police one bystander was killed after being punched by youth and there have been few instances of other injuries primarily during attacks on vehicles 4 c nor has the unrest taken on the tone of an intifada despite the fact that large portion of those responsible for the violence are of muslim background in fact muslim groups have played positive roles in trying to quell the violence during the first weekend of unrest tear gas canister landed in mosque sending some 700 worshipers fleeing while some of the perpetrators used the incident to justify their actions the leadership of the mosque and many of the worshippers there have downplayed the event in french and international media and actively circulated among the youth to act as mediators the fundamentalist union for islamic organizations in france uoif issued fatwa november 6 condemning the violence as unislamic 5 c for the moment the unrest is not viewed as specifically muslim the french media and french commentary generally and perhaps deliberately identify those involved as minority youth sometimes specified as arab north african or black subsaharan rarely are they classed as muslim the issue is seen as problem of disaffected ethnic minorities not local playing out of clash of civilizations between muslims and the west that said the gof has alluded to the potential that radical elements may yet seek to use the unrest to try to further nefarious aims some commentators see the mediating role being played by islamic organizations itself as possible cause for concern the french way questioned 6 c the recent upheaval has raised many questions within france about its unitary as opposed to multicultural integration model as well as the social inequalities and racism that exist in french society although many particularly on the left have been quick to blame the current government it is clear that the unrest playing out throughout france today is the result of decades of neglect by governments of both the left and right the role that frances generous social welfare system may have played in fueling the discontent has also come under scrutiny in many of the areas most affected by the violence there exist scores of statesubsidized longterm unemployed villepin cited 57000 in nationally televised interview november 7 who are provided enough money to survive but real incentive to seek gainful employment 7 c many of the youth are products of homes where the primary breadwinner is among the longterm unemployed for other young men there has been breakdown in the family structure but the real problem is the failure of white and christian france to view their darker muslim compatriots as real citizens the cumulative effect has been the creation of generation of young males lacking parental control and unequipped to secure and hold job even if they could break through the formidable barriers of prejudice faced by young arabs and young blacks in particular possible political ramifications 8 c nor did the french government do good job of managing the situation with an eye to the 2007 presidential elections prime minister villepin and interior minister sarkozy initially tried to manipulate the unrest to individual political advantage president chirac was conspicuous by his unusual silence only belatedly did villepin and sarkozy put their differences aside and present common front villepins decision to invoke curfew powers has been criticized by some in the opposition as an overreaction but an initial poll indicates that 73 percent of those polled agree with the hard line 9 c it is impossible at this time to predict with any precision the longterm political repercussions of the violence including with regard to the 2007 presidential elections it is also too early to know what effect if any the events will have on the political activism of the disaffected immigrant population or what steps the government is prepared to take to give minority groups more of political voice at present the immigrant community is vastly underrepresented in all parties and barely represented at all in official positions from the mayoral through parliamentary and ministerial ranks in the french political spectrum comment 10 c the dimensions and persistence of the unrest and the depth of the frustration reflected by it largely blindsided frances political class which is generally regarded as being farremoved from the lives and experiences of ordinary people that said the government response to focus on reestablishing order while scrupulously avoiding excessive police violence and to promise effective engagement to better social conditions appears initially to be working the nightly violence is decreasing both as police enforce newly authorized curfews in selected areas and as local government and citizens mobilize to defend their communities 11 c while this approach may prove successful in quelling the current wave of unrest sporadic incidents of car burnings and clashes with police are likely to persist the youths perpetrating the violence and vandalism and the criminal groups that in some cases are manipulating them are present in every poor suburb and amount of policing will preventively keep them completely in check while responsible leaders across the political spectrum agree that france must do more to integrate its more recent immigrants agreeing is not the same as doing the recent wave of unrest has publicly and embarrassingly exposed frances deep social inequalities reminding the broader public of the persistence of frances large probably growing underclass estimated at 47 million by social affairs minister borloo 12 c once calm returns the gof will be expected to follow through on promised reforms to address the underlying issues that have fueled the unrest but unless there is some measurable amelioration of the structural unemployment societal discrimination and widening gulf between mainstream french society and the people of the suburban projects the nightly violence will continue to simmer just below the surface and will recurrently boil over the challenge is enormous for the government given frances slow economic growth and chronic unemployment any job creation program is likely to focus on inefficient publicsector programs that do nothing to empower the private sector and provide incentives to the unemployed it will also be challenge to change deeply ingrained negative attitudes towards nonwhite immigrants however not to make the effort would squander crucial opportunity to significantly enhance the wellbeing and prospects of disaffected muslim underclass before it becomes politically radicalized end comment please visit paris classified website at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurparisindexc
