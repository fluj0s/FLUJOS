budget resolutions robert keith specialist in american national government government and finance division summary during the more than 30 years that the congressional budget process has been in effect the senate finance committee has been subject to revenue reconciliation directives in budget resolution on 18 occasions nine instances involved directives to reduce revenues while the remaining nine instructed the committee to increase revenues in all but three of the 18 instances revenue reconciliation directives to the committee were accompanied by spending reconciliation directives the revenue reconciliation directives varied in their time frame from singleyear coverage in the fy1976 fy1981 and fy1990 budget resolutions to 11year coverage in the fy2002 and fy2004 budget resolutions further the amount of required revenue changes ranged from less than 5 billion in single year to 1250 trillion over 11 years the eight budget resolutions agreed to by the house and senate over the 11 year period covering fy1996fy2007 budget resolution was agreed to for fy1999 fy2003 fy2005 or fy2007 all included reconciliation directives to reduce revenues this report will be updated as developments warrant for additional information see crs report rs21993 spending reconciliation directives to the senate finance committee in congressional budget resolutions by robert keith and bill heniff jr the budget reconciliation process is an optional procedure under the congressional budget act of 1974 pl 93344 as amended that operates as an adjunct to the annual budget resolution process the 1974 act first became effective for fy1976 and congress has completed action on at least one budget resolution each year except for fy1999 fy2003 and fy2005 the chief purpose of the reconciliation process is to enhance congresss ability to change current law in order to bring revenue spending and debtlimit levels into conformity with the policies of the budget resolution accordingly reconciliation probably is the most potent budget enforcement tool available to congress for large portion of the budget crs2 reconciliation is twostage process in which reconciliation directives are included in the budget resolution directing the appropriate committees to develop legislation achieving the desired budgetary outcomes and the resultant legislation usually incorporated into an omnibus bill is considered under expedited procedures in the house and senate reconciliation legislation can be developed or considered unless budget resolution containing reconciliation directives is adopted by both chambers1 each directive to committee is specified as discrete dollar amounts of spending budget authority outlays or both revenues deficit reduction any combination of spending and revenues or the debt limit to be increased or reduced for fiscal year or range of fiscal years reconciliation was first used by the house and senate in calendar year 1980 for fy19812 as an optional procedure it has not been used every year during the more than 30 years that the congressional budget process has been in effect 18 reconciliation measures were enacted into law and three were vetoed3 in recent years there has been heightened interest in the senate in several aspects of reconciliation procedure and precedents in particular there has been some public discussion regarding the appropriateness of including in budget resolution reconciliation directives intended to reduce rather than increase revenues4 in order to provide some background relevant to this issue table 1 sets forth information on revenue reconciliation directives to the senate finance committee in the budget resolutions adopted by congress 1 the house and senate sometimes have put budget enforcement procedures into effect in the absence of budget resolution by means of deeming resolution although deeming resolution has not been used to trigger action on reconciliation measure presumably this course of action remains an option for the house and senate if consensus did not exist to support budget resolution however it might likely not exist to support reconciliation legislation either for more information on deeming resolutions see crs report rl31443 the deeming resolution budget enforcement tool by robert keith 2 the senate considered revenuereduction bill for fy1976 hr 5559 under reconciliation procedures in december 1975 it was initiated under second budget resolution for that fiscal year and was not considered to be reconciliation bill in the house the bill did not become law 3 for an identification of individual reconciliation measures see crs report rl30458 the budget reconciliation process timing of legislative action by robert keith 4 see for example bureau of

daschle seeks to delay budget debate beyond recess by geoff earle and lisa caruso thursday mar 29 2001 p 1 in 1996 the senate considered parliamentary challenge to budget resolution on the ground that it included reconciliation directives to reduce revenues such that the deficit would increase the challenge was defeated see the remarks of senators daschle domenici and others in the congressional record of may 21 1996 at pp s5415s5431 crs3 since the inception of the congressional budget process the senate finance committee has been subject to revenue reconciliation directives in budget resolution on 18 occasions see table 1 nine of the resolutions directed the finance committee to reduce revenues while the remaining nine instructed the committee to increase revenues there has been an ongoing controversy as to whether the directive for fy1976 to reduce revenues by 64 billion properly constituted reconciliation directive but riddicks senate procedure indicates that the resultant legislation was considered under the reconciliation procedures set forth in the 1974 congressional budget act so the directive is listed in table 15 the nine instances in which reconciliation directives applied to revenue increases occurred between fy1981 and fy1994 when deficit reduction was the overriding focus of federal budget policy deficit estimates during this period generally ranged from little below 100 billion to nearly 300 billion per year in each instance the finance committee also was subject to reconciliation directives to reduce spending aside from the fy1976 experience the reconciliation directives that involved revenue decreases occurred during eight of the past 12 fiscal years excluding fy1999 fy2003 fy2005 and fy2007 when budget resolution was agreed to by the house and senate during this period the deficit first declined markedly in fy1996 and fy1997 compared to levels in immediately preceding years then the first surpluses in many years occurred in fy1998fy2001 and finally the budget returned to deficit for fy2000 and fy2001 unlike the practice for the preceding two decades the finance committee was subject only to revenue reconciliation directives spending reconciliation directives were included for the finance committee or any other committee for fy2002 the reconciliation directives included 100 billion increase in outlays as well as revenue reductions of 1250 trillion over the period covering fy2001fy2011 for fy2004 the reconciliation directives included 275 billion increase in outlays as well as revenue reductions of 5225 billion over the period covering fy2003fy2013 the reconciliation directives to increase outlays were intended to accommodate related tax policy changes the revenue reconciliation directives varied in their time frame from singleyear coverage in the fy1976 fy1981 and fy1990 budget resolutions to 11year coverage in the fy2002 and fy2004 budget resolutions further the amount of required revenue changes ranged from less than 5 billion in single year to 1250 trillion over 11 years 5 see riddicks senate procedure precedents and practices revised edition by floyd m riddick and alan s frumin
