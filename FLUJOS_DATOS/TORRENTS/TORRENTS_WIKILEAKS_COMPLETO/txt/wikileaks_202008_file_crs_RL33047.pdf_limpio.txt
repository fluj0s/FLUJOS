standards of official conduct nd the senate select committee on ethicsrestrictions on the acceptance of officially connected travel expenses from private sources under house and senate ethics rules this report discusses the statutory and congressional rule structure under which members of the house and senate under an exception to the gift rules may generally accept from some private sources other than registered lobbyists or registered foreign agents necessary travel expenses including transportation food and lodging for travel in connection with their official duties such as for fact finding trips conferences or symposia under certain circumstances and limitations statute and rules the receipt of gifts by members and staff of the house of representatives and of the senate including the receipt or acceptance of payment or reimbursement of travel expenses from outside private thir dparty sources is generally restricted by the operation of federal statutory law as applied by the hous and senate rules1 under these provisions members of congre ss and congressional st aff are prohibited from soliciting or accepting gifts from any private sources unless expressly permitted by an exception in the congressional rule s members and staff may generally not accept private gifts reimbursements or payments of their expenses other than from their relatives and certain longterm persona l friends when the value of gift is 50 or more or when multiple gifts of under 50 from the same source aggregate 100 or more in calendar year there do ex ist exceptions to the gifts prohibitions under both house and senate rules which allow for the acceptance of some travel expenses from outside third parties for what is char acterized as officially connected travel by members officers and employees of the house and senate in specifically defined and limited circumstances federal law provisions of federal law currently provide the general standard and prohibition on the receipt of gifts from certain pr ivate sources 5 usc 7353 states 7353 gifts to federal employees httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33047crs2 2 5 usc 7353 b1 each supervising ethics office is authorized to

from doing bus iness with or in the case of executive branch officers and employees conducting activities regulated by the individuals employing entity or 2 whose interests may be substantia lly affected by the performance or nonperformance of the individuals official duties while subsection of this law provides the general prohibition on the receipt of gifts from interested parties subsection b of the statute expressly allows the appropriate supervising ethics office to promulgate rules or regulations regarding the acceptance of gifts by officers and employees and to provide such reasonable exceptions as may be appropriate wher eby officers or employees may accept such gifts pursuant to those rules2 the gift rules of the house and the senate thus generally operate as the regulatory scheme setting out the standards for members officers and employees of the house and nate respectively as to the prohibitions and the exceptions to the restricti ons upon acceptan ce of private gifts and reimbursement congressional rules the rules of the house at house rule xxv clause 5 and of the senate at senate rule xxxv generally prohibit the r eceipt by members and staff of any gifts of 50 or more in value from any private source and those gifts of 10 or more aggregating 100 or more in year fro m the same source unless specifically permitted by one or more of the various exceptions specifically provided in the rules3 as noted above one of the more common exceptions is for gifts from relatives or from or exchanged between cer tain longterm personal friends of the member or congressional staffer additionally there are exceptions in the house and senate rules for the receipt but not the solicitation of certain travel expenses from private sources in specifically defined and limited circumstances under congressional rules the threshol d consideration in determining the propriety of accepting private reimbursement or payment of expenses for travel is the characterization of the purpose of the particular travel in question travel may be for strictly official congressional business may be for campaig n related or other political reasons may be to

be accepted from corporations labor unions na tional banks or government contractors under federal campaign laws and when and if paid fo r by other outside private parties must conform to federal cam paign finance laws5 some travel and certain expenses for charitable fundraisers may be accepted by members participating in such fund raising events for the charity under par ticular limitations of the house and senate rules6 reimbursement or payment for travel in relation to members or members spouses outside private busin ess endeavors may ge nerally be accepted subject to guidelines7 while the payment by outside private sources for travel for purely personal purposes such as recreati on vacation or pleasure would generally be prohibited as an impermissible persona l gift when 50 or more in value8 officially connected travel the travel that has recently raised veral questions has been the acceptance of private payment or reimbursement of officially connected travel by members and staff both the rules of the house of representatives and the rules of the senate expressly permit as an exception to the general gifts restriction the payment or reimbursement by certain outside

members could accept expenses when subs tantially participating or when engaged in factfinding related to ones official dutiessenate rules on this subject are substantially identical9 other than as to the permissible duration of such trips which is limited in the house to four days for domestic and seven days for foreign travel xcluding travel days and in the senate to three days for domestic travel and seve n days for foreign travel also excluding travel days background the exception to the gift prohibitions in the house and senate for the receipt of reimbursement or payment of expenses for factfinding and similar types of officiallyrelated or officiallyconnected activities has been one of fairly long standing under congressional rules the fi rst restrictions on gifts with specific monetary limitations and detailed guidelines were enacted in the house and senate in 197710 and under these rules provisions we re made for members and staff to accept certain travel expenses and reimbursement for such factfinding events in the house of representatives in the 95th congress select committee on ethics was established to provide advisory opinions and guidance on the new restrictions on gifts11 the select committee noted that alt hough there has been some criticism regarding abuses of fact finding tours in the past it would not be in the public interest to prohibit memb ers from ccepting necessa ry travel expenses for fact finding events or activities which have legitimate purpose directly related to the official duties of the congress12 the committee noted that although member of congress may render some pe rsonal services in the course of factfinding event the primary purpose of the trip is for the members officers or employees to become better informed regarding subject matters closely related to their official duties13 and found therefore the select committee holds that necessary expenses paid by an organization sponsoring factfinding event are exempted from the limitations of rule xliii clause 4 now xxv clause 5 provided that the factfinding event or activity is directly related to the official duties of the member officer or employee any such reimburseme nt or payment of travel expenses aggregating over 250 in value from one source would be subject to disclosurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33047crs5 14 house select committee on ethics of the 95th congress hr rpt 951837 supra 15 id 16 the house and senate gifts rules were again significantly amended after 1977 in 1991 pursuant to the ethics reform act of 1989 pl 101194 see also pl 10290 section 314 102nd cong 1992 and in 1995 sres 158 104th cong 1995 hres 250 104th cong 1995 17 house rule xxv cl 5b1a senate rule xxxv clause 2a1 this public disclosure will guard against the potential abuse of converting this kind of activity from an official business purpose to that of personal pleasure or entertainment gifts of that natu re exceeding 100 now 50 in value were clearly intended to be prohibited 14 to protect against potential abuses the select committee narrowly defined factfinding tours and activities to exclude reimbursements or provision to member of transportation by corporation to his home district on the grounds that he would tour the corporate facilities there and such things as shiplaunchings or inaugural airline flights which were considered more in the nature of promotional events the committee further empha sized that members may only accept necessary expenses incurred in factfinding activity and may not accept even entertainment or expenses or reimbursements for tertainment which among all other reimbursements expenses or things of value beyond necessary expenses would be considered gifts to the member subject to the specific dollar limitation on gifts additionally the select committee emphasi zes that the definition of fact finding event must be interpreted narrowly house rule xliii clause 2 now xxiii clause2 puts members on notice that not only the letter but also the spirit of house rules must be adhered to the intended definition of factfinding event would also not extend to expenses incurred during such an event which are unrelated to the specific factfinding activity similarly this exemption for factfinding activities applies only to necessary expenses transportation food lodging and not to entertainment thus member of congress whether tr aveling on factfinding tour or under any circumstances may not accept gifts of entertainment beyond the dollar limitation15 current rules the current house and senate rules now re flect in their language the traditional restrictions and limitations on this type of privately financed travel as well as other specific limitations restrictions and requirements16 because such events are intended to be restricted to those connected to ones offici duties and are ostensibly for the purpose of informing educating or broadening the knowledge of the member of certain issues and their factual backgr ounds relevant to matte rs coming before the member in an official capacity such expenses received by or reimbursed for the member are considered or deemed to be reimbursement to the house or to the senate as the case may be rather than personal gift to the member as long as such expenses are publicly disclosed with in 30 days of the end of the travel17

rules the following general limitations apply 1 officially connected purpose the underlying event for which expenses are accepted must be connected to or related to ones official duties that is in connection with membe rs duties as an officeholder19 activities or events such as meetings factfindings speaking engagements lectures classes conventions symposia or pr oduct or process monstrations may be those types of matters when the underlying subject is sufficiently related or connected to members official duties both the house and senate rules indicate that the underlying purpose and activities of the trip must be related sufficiently enough to ones official duties so that engaging in such privately paid travel would not create the appearance that the mber is usin g public office for private gain20 if the overall purpose of the trip is substantially recreational in nature the trip will not be considered officially connected21 2 lobbyists or foreign agents the expenses of officially connected travel may not be paid for by registered lobbyist or an agent of foreign principle registered under the foreign agents re gistration act while lobbyists and lobbying firms are prohibited fro m paying for such travel the clients or employers of the lobbyists or lobbying firms that is organizations or businesses which employ lobbyists either directly as employees or by contract with outside lobbyists are not considered lobbyists themselves and may sponsor and reimburse officiallyrelated travel22 in addition to the prohibition of lobbyists funding such factfinding trips the house committee on standards of official c onduct has expressly noted in an official publication issued in april of 2000 that the prohibition against accepting travel expenses from registered lobbyist an ag ent of foreign principal or lobbying firm applies even where the lobbyist agent or firm will later be reimbursed for those expenses by nonlobbyist client23 while the lobbyist may not pay for the travel expenses even if later reim bursed by client the rules do not expressly prohibit thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33047crs7 24 senate ethics manual supra at 44 25 gifts and

organization and the group 28 gifts and travel supra at 7576lobbyist from accompanying the members and attending such event paid for by the lobbyists clients or employers the senate provides that the lobby ist is not prohibited from assisting the organization in arranging the event for example by issuing the invitations on behalf of th organization or attending the event24 the discussion of the house rules notes that private entity paying for officially connected travel should both organize and conduct the trip rather than merely pay for trip that is in fact organized nd conducted by someone else but the house rules do not expressly prohibit lobbyis t either accompanying member on such event nor personally extending the spons oring organizations invitation to the member25 3 source of funds the source of the funds for factfinding event must be the sponsor of the event or an entity sufficiently connected to the event or sponsoring organization in some way th house notes that member may accept expenses for officially connected travel only from private source that has direct and immediate relationship with the event or the location being visited26 similarly the senate notes that the sponsor of the event may pay for travel and that other parties so closely connected to particular events and th eir sponsors as to render them permissible providers may so pay necessary expenses27 because the actual source of funds may not be readily evident the house committee on standards of official conduct expressly advi ses members to make inquiry on the source of the funds that will be used to pay for the trip the rule is concerned with the organizati ons or individuals that actually pay for travel thus for example where nonprofit organization pays for travel with donations that were earmarked either formally or informally for the trip each such donor is deemed private source for the trip and 1 must be publicly disclosed as trip sponsor on the applicable travel disclosure forms and 2 may itself be required to satisfy the above standards on proper source of travel expenses accordingly it is advisable for member or staff person who is invited on trip to make inquiry on the source of the funds that will be used to pay for the trip28 4 recreation and necessary expenses the permissible expenses that may be accepted for officiallyc onnected events are only for necessary expenses of travel including such things as food transportation lodging conference fees and conference or lecture materials the rules expressly define necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33047crs8 29

transportation lodging conference fees and materials and food and refreshments 29 the house and senate rules both clearly state that necessary expenses do not include expenditures for recreational activities30 that is the expenses for recreational activities even those during and incidental to otherwise legitimate officiallyconnected travel are not within this exception and are therefore subject to the 50 limitation on personal gifts to the mber and would include such things as expenses for jetskiing water skiing golf greenfees club guest fees and rentals and fishing expeditions as explained by the house committee on standards of official conduct for exampl during the course of trip entertainment or recreational activities may be accepted from private s ource only if their total value is less than 50 and the overall gift limit of less than 100 in any calendar year is complied with31 additionally entertainment expenses are not considered necessary expenses and may not be accepted unless the entertainment is provided to all attendees as an integral part of the event32 5 reasonable expenses the rules of the h ouse and senate provide that the necessary expenses which are and may be accepted in relation to officially connected travel must also be reasonable33 there appear to be however published guidelines or tabl delineating any specific monetary amounts considered within or outside of the range of reasona ble expenses for travel and lodging it should be noted that the house committee on standards of official conduct explains that the qualifiers necessary and reasonable may also limit the time frame for which expenses may be accepted depending on the nature of the event thus member officer or employee may accept only such expenses as are reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of the trip and thus it may not always be properhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33047crs9 34 gifts and travel supra at 78 35 house rule xxv cl 5b4a senate rule xxxv clause

members actual functions andor participation in any particular officially connected event or events 7 side trips and stopovers additional expenses for side trips and events unrelated to the purpose of the tr ip are not permitted in the house the house committee on standards of official conduct notes that member may not accept additional expenses for stopovers that are unrelated to the purpose of the trip36 and in the senate the senate select committee on ethics notes that necessary expenses do not include expenses which are associated with appearances or activities unrelat ed to the sponsors event37 if member wishes to extend trip after the event for which expenses may be accepted the member may still accept return transportation from the even t locale but if the extension causes higher airfare the member must pay the additional fare but any side trips or additional stopovers for unrelat ed activities must be paid for by the member or fit within the 50 limitation on gift from private

bribery illegal gratuities the preceding discussion has centered ar ound the language and interpretations of internal house and senate rules on the acceptance of gifts and things of value from outside private sources it should be noted that there are also criminal statutes that involve specifically the receipt of anything of value by public official while gift is generally understood to be gi ven and accepted with strings attached that is that the gift has the requisite dona tive intent and is not specifically connected to or related to any particular official act by the public officer the criminal laws are aimed at the receipt of things of value when the offer andor acceptance or receipt are connected in some way to an official act or forbearance by that public official the bribery provisions of federal law prohibit the corrupt receipt of something of value in return for being influenced in any official act while the illegal gratuities clause of that law requires merely the receipt of something of value with the knowledge that one is being compensated or rewarded for or because of any official act done or to be done40httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33047crs11 appendix house
