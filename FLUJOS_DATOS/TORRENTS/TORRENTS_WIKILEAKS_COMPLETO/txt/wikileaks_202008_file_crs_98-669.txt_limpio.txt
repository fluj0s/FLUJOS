this report will not be updated nato senate floor consideration of the accession of the czech republic hungary and poland summary the 1998 senate debate on the accession to the north atlantic treaty by the czech republic hungary and poland was spread across eight days from march 17 to april 30 enlargement of the north atlantic treaty organization nato was favored by the leadership of both parties and during the debate the resolution of ratification was widely expected to pass opponents of nato enlargement structured most of their arguments and amendments as expressions of concern about the future of the alliance as it moves into the 21st century the senate gave its advice and consent on april 30 voting 8019 in favor of ratification the central point of contention between supporters and opponents of nato enlargement was disagreement over if and how nato should change its strategic concept to fit the postcold war world supporters of enlargement generally believed the alliance should continue its evolution into versatile defender of western interests opponents viewed such evolution as not conforming to the terms of the 1949 washington treaty the american share of enlargement costs concerned senators on both sides of the debate supporters tended to accept lower cost estimates and to declare that enlargement was worthwhile expense opponents worried that the senate was signing blank check which could spiral out of control and sought to lower the us share of the natos common costs from the current level of around 25 percent two issues with openended implications played key roles in the debate the first was russia opponents were concerned that adding the three applicants would bolster extreme factions in russia and strain united statesrussia relations most supporters cited alliance efforts to engage russia and to aid its transition to democracy they argued that russia would eventually see natos defensive nature the second issue was how enlargement would affect european stability and us security supporters focused on the need to maintain us engagement in europe and its ability to meet new security threats opponents warned of russia becoming regional destabilizer and argued that adding three countries to those the united states is committed to defend would further stretch what many considered an already overburdened military little debate took place about any moral responsibility the west might have concerning the past injustices done to the three applicants these issues however were clearly important to many enlargement supporters many viewed enlargement as the fulfillment of american promises during the cold war and way by which the west could redeem itself for the abandonment of eastern europe in the wake of the second world war two conditions on ratification were also debated by the senate the first mandated three year pause before any future rounds of accession the second linked nato and european union membership the sponsors of the resolution of ratification argued that such conditions would limit natos effectiveness contents introduction 1 strategic concept 1 the future of the alliance 1 supporters 1 opponents 2

stipulated in the resolution of ratification passed by the senate on april 30 1998 41 nato senate floor consideration of the accession of the czech republic hungary and poland introduction on april 30 1998 the us senate by vote of 8019 gave its advice and consent to the accession of the czech republic hungary and poland to the north atlantic treaty the wideranging debate included consideration not only of the qualifications of the three candidates but perhaps more importantly of the quality of the alliance itself senators discussed natos evolving mission cost and questions of burdensharing relations with russia and other matters this report summarizes the main issues in the debate strategic concept the question of how if at all nato should adapt its mission to fit the security environment of the postcold war world sparked some of the senates most contentious debate from the outset of the debate enlargement was linked to the development of natos strategic concept and the degree to which it should focus on new missions beyond collective defense many supporters of enlargement believed broader mission profile would strengthen nato by ensuring its relevance in new european security structure others argued that the redefinition of the strategic concept amounted to treaty creep that is it would create nato organization beyond the scope of the north atlantic treaty senators john ashcroft rmissouri john kyl rarizona and jeff bingaman dnew mexico introduced amendments designed to give the senate voice concerning the alliances transition toward its new roles the future of the alliance supporters most senators who advocated adding the czech republic hungary and poland to the alliance also supported using nato to meet the new security challenges that have emerged since the end of the cold war senator john mccain rarizona entered into the congressional record cr statement by the new atlantic initiative an organization composed primarily of former government officials the statement declared that nato has rightfully closed the door on its successful mission to prevent soviet domination of western europe but that its larger purpose of ensuring peace and freedom in europe and the atlantic region endures it outlined new identity for nato as an alliance aiming to promote peace and stability in the atlantic region devoted to the spread and consolidation of democratic ways in europe and capable of protecting western interests against such crs2 future threats as may emerge the statement tied this vision of the future to the legislation at hand pronouncing crucial to this process of adaptation is natos willingness to admit new members otherwise it will remain relic of the cold war of diminishing relevance to the contemporary world cr 18 march 1998 s2200 senator john kerry dmassachusetts said that nato has already begun kind of transition expanding its mission to include other tasks the alliance he said has an expanded vision of the range of potential rivalries within europe to global threats such as terrorism or nuclear proliferation but also greater willingness to undertake certain kinds of missions to cope with those threats cr 30 april 1998 s3848 supporters of enlargement and an expanded role for the alliance contended that the original text of the north atlantic treaty provided for the new missions being proposed for nato these missions are often referred to as nonarticle 5 missions because they would not be in response to direct attack on members territory which under article 5 of the washington treaty would be considered an attack against all members specifically they cited article 4 of the treaty which reads the parties will consult together whenever in the opinion of any of them the territorial integrity political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened senator william roth rdelaware spoke about the flexibility of the 1949 treaty some fifty years ago the drafters of the washington treaty included provisions not only to provide for the territorial defense of the north atlantic region but also for the possibility of common action to protect other interests of the north atlantic community it was the united states that insisted upon this provision article 4 of the charter and construction of the charter that would permit actions beyond the narrow scope of territorial defense cr 30 april 1998 s3861 senator roth went on to cite memorandum recounting press conference given by secretary of state dean acheson on march 18 1949 asked if there was limiting clause the secretary stated that there was limiting clause asked if the treaty stipulated that if armed attack should originate outside of the area action might be taken the secretary replied in the negative cr 30 april 1998 s3862 yet while they argued that nonarticle 5 missions are acceptable under the terms of the washington treaty proponents of enlargement reaffirmed the centrality of article 5 to the mission of the alliance senator roth said the resolution makes crystal clear that the senate firmly believes that natos first priority must be the mission of collective defense cr 30 april 1998 s3861 he pointed out that section 3bi of the protocols on accession states that in order for nato to serve the security interests of the united states the core purpose of nato must continue to be the collective defense of the territory of all nato members opponents senators against enlarging the alliance and broadening its operational purview argued that nato is straying from its original mission and that the washington treaty is far more limited than supporters of enlargement claim crs3 senator ashcroft began by questioning natos transition from cold war institution to its current security role he said we have to ask ourselves at this juncture what is the purpose of the treaty is it appropriate or possible to change the treaty without amending the treaty just by beginning to lean everyone in one direction to turn the treaty to one side or another or begin to assert that there are new things to be considered because the treaty is evolving i have to tell you i dont believe in treaty evolution any more than i believe in the evolution of the constitution cr 27 april 1998 s3627 senator larry craig ridaho also expressed concern that the proposed evolution of natos mission would create an institution different from what the founders of the alliance envisioned it is my concern that the presidents vision of new nato will signal the end of nato as defensive alliance and begin its role as regional peacekeeping organization cr 23 march 1998 s2446 senator warner said we are in danger of turning this fine alliance into miniun cr 19 march 1998 s2275 senator daniel patrick moynihan dnew york entered into the congressional record an address he gave to meeting of the associated press in celebration of its 150th anniversary his remarks surveyed the resolution of ratifications mention of article 4based missions section 3bii and asked does this not read suspiciously like license to get into fight just about anywhere cr 27 april 1998 s3612 challenging the notion that article 4 of the north atlantic treaty allows the type of changes to natos mission being proposed senator ashcroft asked is this what was intended when this nato agreement came into existence was it designed to have this kind of elasticity not according to the folks who presided in the us senate in 1949 when this great treaty organization was ratified he then quoted senator tom connally dtexas chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations in 1949 let us not forget that this treaty is limited in scope its main purpose is to maintain the peace and security of the north atlantic area we do not propose to stretch its terms to cover the entire globe cr 27 march 1998 s3628 senator ashcroft argued that article 4 of the north atlantic treaty was designed to play supporting role to articles 5 and 6 the latter of which specifies what is to be considered an attack on member of the alliance limits nato to actions of collective defense the geographic scope of the article v commitment was defined explicitly in article vi to make sure there was not any confusion it said the united states would defend the territory of nato members not the interests not the commercial transactions but the territory of the nato members undergirding natos collective defense mission was the purpose of article iv article iv was not loophole for any military operation the north atlantic council could dream up cr 27 april 1998 s3628 ashcroft amendment senator ashcroft introduced an amendment 2318 designed to prevent nato from taking on missions he believed would require amendment of the crs4 washington treaty he said his amendment would make sure that the senate will not be endorsing what i call treaty creep where we just allow creeping mission to get us to the place where we are longer able to sustain those things which ought to be sustained cr 27 april 1998 s3629 the amendment stipulated that the united states would oppose all nato military operations unless the operation is intended for the purpose of collective selfdefense in response to an armed attack on the territory of an alliance member or the operation is in response to threat to the territorial integrity political independence or security of nato member senator ashcroft described the purpose of his amendment my amendment is tailored not to constrain natos effectiveness in the future nor is it intended to micromanage natos military planning from the senate floor the central portion of the amendment is taken directly from the north atlantic treaty itself my amendment states that any military operation outside article v must be based on the principle of collective defense namely the territorial integrity political independence or security of nato member cr 19 march 1998 s2284 the amendment faced strong opposition led by senator roth from supporters of nato enlargement senator roth argued against the amendment saying at its best this amendment is unnecessary to achieve the goals of its sponsors at its worst the amendment would undercut the alliances will and capability to defend the security interests of the north atlantic community of democracies the fact that nato acts only by consensus made the amendment unnecessary he said because the united states can never be forced to participate in nato operation he argued that the authors of the washington treaty did envision nonarticle 5 missions and that the united states should not set the precedent of unilaterally reinterpreting the washington treaty an action which he said runs counter to the spirit and traditions of the alliance and would encourage the other members of the alliance to do the same senator roth closed by asking in world of rogue states with biological chemical and nuclear weapons increasingly at their disposal why would we want to discard one of the best vehicles through which to prompt allied support for us security interests cr 30 april 1998 s3861 in the closing hours of the debate on april 30 senator joseph biden d delaware made motion to table the amendment the roll call vote succeeded with 82 yeas and 18 nays and the amendment was tabled1 kyl amendment on april 28th prior to the vote on the ashcroft amendment senator kyl introduced amendment 2310 which added to the resolution of ratification statement of the senates understanding of us policy toward natos strategic 1 the tally of votes can be found in the congressional record of 30 april 1998 p s3862 the text of the amendment can be found in appendix 2 crs5 concept senator kyl argued that the senate should have voice in the revision of the strategic concept in my view the current resolution focuses too much on what nato should not be and should not do the resolution does not attempt to lay out comprehensive set of principles to guide development of the strategic concept and so this proposed amendment will establish the senates vision of the future of nato and i hope help to lay the foundation for american positions on the strategic concept cr 28 april 1998 s3695 he went on to say our principal objective here is to ensure that nato remains an arm of us power and influence nato must remain the principal foundation for the security interests of its members this means nato must be prepared to defend against range of common threats to our vital interests cr 28 april 1998 s3695 the amendment identified postcold war concerns like weapons of mass destruction and access to natural resources as legitimate however the amendment tempered its recognition of the threats of ethnic or religious rivalries and historic disputes with statement that only threats of this type occurring in the north atlantic area should be within natos purview senator kyls amendment faced little opposition senators warner and moynihan asked for several points of clarification but both eventually voted in favor of the amendment the senate approved the amendment by vote of 90 yeas to 9 nays2 bingaman amendment senator bingamans amendment 2324 sought to set condition on future rounds of accession senator bingaman said that his amendment would withhold inviting additional countries other than poland hungary and the czech republic for nato membership until after nato has approved revised strategic concept cr 27 april 1998 s3631 he said right now we in the senate are being called upon to sign up to policy of enlarging the alliance without clear coherent explanation of how expansion of nato will serve natos strategic interests i am concerned because nato itself does not seem to have an agreed upon strategic military mission cr 27 april 1998 s3630s3631 with new strategic concept due to be approved at the 1999 washington summit the senator argued that his amendment was not likely to cause delay in future enlargement processes despite senator bingamans statement that he had great difficulty seeing why anyone would object to this senator biden asked his colleagues to reject the amendment cr 30 april 1998 s3854 senator biden argued that if implemented the amendment could be tool for those wishing to slow down or stop the process of enlargement by refusing to agree to new strategic concept any nato member could quietly stop enlargement the amendment senator biden said would provide 2 the tally of votes can be found in the congressional record of april 28 1998 p s3698 the text of the amendment can be found in appendix 2 crs6 pocket veto for country opposed to enlargement but unwilling to make its case publicly senator bingamans amendment failed by vote of 23 yeas to 76 nays3 costs burdensharing senators on both sides of the debate were concerned with how much the enlargement of nato would cost the alliance generally and the united states in particular estimates of the total cost of enlargement cited in the debate ranged from 15 billion to 125 billion the cost would be shared among the 19 members of an enlarged alliance senators who questioned the costs of the process focused on the potential for enlargement to become an openended financial commitment in general supporters concentrated on the nonmonetary benefits of enlargement and expressed confidence in the lower cost estimates opponents critics of the figures given by the administration and by nato complained that accurate estimate of the cost involved in admitting the czech republic hungary and poland was available for them to examine the estimates that were available prepared by the us government nato itself and several nongovernmental organizations all made assumptions of force size and strategic posture that were highly debatable in the rapidly changing european security environment senator tom harkin diowa said i have seen projections range from 125 billion down to 15 billion when you have that wide variance something is very strange cr 17 march 1998 s2145 senator harkin went on to mention problem with current cost estimates another piece of the puzzle we are missing is how new members are to address their military shortfalls although the shortfalls were to be identified in december 1997 the countries force goals will not be set until this spring in other words we are without plan to address the force goals and the price tag associated with it i am very uncomfortable signing the american taxpayers name to potentially ballooning blank check cr 17 march 1998 s2145 senator larry craig ridaho expressed similar concerns all of this cost related information will be made available to congress only after the senates advice and consent to expansion is final and irrevocable that means if the information is not satisfactory to the senate we will have recourse cr 23 march 1998 s2446 historian john lewis gaddis in new york times opinion piece inserted into the congressional record identified another source of ambiguity what will expansion cost the administrations estimate sounds like bargain but the estimate assumes change in the current security environment has it occurred to the administration that the act of expanding nato especially if former soviet states are included could itself alter the current security environment cr 28 april 1998 s3704 3 the tally of votes can be found in the congressional record of april 30 1998 p s3863 the text of the amendment can be found in appendix 2 crs7 senator harkin was also vocal on the issue of burdensharing currently the united states pays approximately 25 percent of natos common operational costs opponents of enlargement worried that the addition of the czech republic hungary and poland would create upward pressure on the us share of costs these fears were exacerbated by the recent trend among european countries toward reducing defense spending and conflicting reports of whether or not the french had agreed to help pay the cost of enlargement senator harkin introduced an amendment 2312 stipulating that the united states would be limited to paying more than 25 percent of the expenditures involved in integrating the czech republic hungary and poland into the alliance he stated what my amendment says is what is good for one side ought to be good for another if 25 percent is good for the common budgets it ought to be good for the national budgets the amendment was defeated by roll call vote of 76 nays to 24 yeas4 senator ted stevens ralaska introduced two amendments designed to reduce the us share of the alliances common budget and to impose tighter congressional control over expenses incurred in the process of integrating the czech republic hungary and poland into natos command structure senator stevens originally introduced both amendments 2065 and 2066 on march 23 1998 cr s2437 s2438 and later said my original intent in proposing these amendments was to bring some greatly needed accountability to the critical issue of recognizing and clarifying all the costs to the united states to enlarge the nato alliance cr 30 april 1998 s3845 amendment 2065 stipulated that none of the costs involved in admitting new members to the alliance could be paid by the united states unless congress specifically authorized the funds amendment 2066 would have cut off all us funding to nato beyond the current fiscal year unless the secretaries of state and defense certified to the congress that the united states would contribute more than 20 percent of the total common budget the effect of this second amendment would be an immediate 5 percent cut in the share of natos common budget paid by the united states both of senator stevens amendments were significantly modified through negotiation with the supporters of ratification inserted into amendment 2065 was the language other than through the commonfunded budgets of nato which left intact the existing channels of authorization for common budget funding but asserted congressional control over any additional assistance given to new alliance members the second amendment 2066 was broken into two parts over the course of the debate the first section of the revised amendment was nonbinding statement of the sense of the senate which declared that the president should every year for five years beginning in fiscal year 1999 propose to nato one percent reduction in the share of the common budget paid by the united states the second section of the amendment carried the force of law and stipulated that the total us commitment to the nato common budget in any fiscal year after october 1 1998 may not exceed the total of all such payments made in fiscal year 1998 unless specifically authorized by the congress 4 the tally of votes can be found in the congressional record of april 28 1998 p s3687 the text of the amendment can be found in appendix 3 crs8 in their original forms both of senator stevens amendments were opposed by the sponsors of the resolution of ratification upon further negotiation however both were accepted as friendly amendments and passed by voice votes senator stevens voted in favor of the final text of the resolution of ratification5 supporters many senators who advocated enlargement also expressed concern about the financial burden that would be borne by the united states they differed from their opponents however in that they were generally satisfied with the studies that produced lower cost estimates enlargement supporters also proposed that the united states would reap moneysaving benefits from the stability they expected an enlarged alliance to create advocates balked at some of the estimates of the cost of enlargement senator biden called the highend figures bizarre cr 27 april 1998 s3638 the department of defense dod in february 1997 provided the congress with report projecting the cost of enlargement to be between 27 and 35 billion the dod study encompassed both costs to all 19 national defense budgets as well as nato common budget funds nato itself studied the issue after the july 1997 invitations to join had been made to the czech republic hungary and poland natos december 1997 figure which was restricted to increases in the common budget was approximately 15 billion this estimate subsequently was accepted by both the dod and the general accounting office gao senator carl levin dmichigan argued that the nato study should be accepted by the senate as reliable because it was conducted with the knowledge of which countries had been invited earlier estimates had planned for the possible inclusion of fourth country and more precise information regarding the state of the polish hungarian and czech military establishments than had previously been available senator levin said that original estimate of the administration was way off and it was way high and the revised estimate done by nato after onsite visits and looking only at the direct costs resulting from the increase in the size of nato that assessment has been approved by the gao and by the dod cr 19 march 1998 s2254 other senators chose to focus on the nonmonetary benefits of nato enlargement senator barbara mikulski dmaryland spoke on this point opponents of enlargement point to the cost but what is the cost of not enlarging nato i believe the cost of not enlarging nato will be far higher what will be the cost to european security what will be the cost to the new democracies of eastern europe what would be the longrange cost to america of failing to prepare nato for the 21st century the cost would be instability in europe and the increased chance of being pulled into yet another conflict the cost of preventive security is always less than the cost of war cr 18 march 1998 s2197 5 acceptance of amendment 2065 can be found in the congressional record of april 28 1998 p s3859 acceptance of amendment 2066 can be found in the record of the same day p s3847 the texts of both amendments can be found in appendix 3 crs9 senator max cleland dgeorgia concurred for long time i have asked myself the question can we afford it i now ask myself can we afford not to do it cr 29 april 1998 s3748 many supporters of accession also noted that while the dollarvalue of us contributions to the common budget might increase in an enlarged nato the percentage contribution would decrease slightly from the current level of around 25 percent nonetheless advocates of enlargement fought to defeat senator harkins amendment requiring percentage spending cap senator biden argued that the amendment was hamstringing of our national defense budget unrelated to nato cr 28 april 1998 s3670 he claimed it would hinder us interests by prohibiting bilateral weapons sales or other defense assistance to the new alliance member countries unless the other nations of the alliance were willing to pay 75 percent of the cost russia concerns key point in the senates debate was the issue of how russia would respond to having nato member state abutting its westernmost border kaliningrad russias isolated piece of territory on the baltic sea given the history of the alliance as deterrent against soviet expansionism during the cold war several senators worried that nato expansion would poison the usrussia relationship at time when the nurturing and engagement of the newly democratic regime in moscow are widely viewed as critical to its longevity opponents of enlargement argued that having spent much of the past fifty years fighting the cold war in part to break through the iron curtain imposed on europe after world war ii nato should not take actions which might simply replace the old lines with new ones senator paul wellstone dminnesota said there is peace between states in europe between nations in europe for the first time in centuries we do not have divided europe and i worry about nato expansion which could redivide europe and again poison relations with russia cr 19 march 1998 s2257 opponents said that the accession to the alliance of the czech republic hungary and poland three invitees in field of twelve hopefuls would create an us versus them atmosphere instead of fostering the idea of unified europe the current danger to alliance members it was argued is not the threat of attack by the oncepowerful russian military but instead its continued deterioration as competent fighting force senator wellstone said the russian military has collapsed the russian armys ability to quell tiny illequipped chechen forces raises doubts about russias capability to threaten its former eastern bloc allies in the foreseeable future cr 19 march 1998 s2257 security measures designed for the proper storage of russias arsenal of weapons of mass destruction are breaking down increasing the likelihood of proliferation of such weapons among rogue states nato enlargement opponents argued makes russian cooperation on initiatives such as the nunnlugar program to safeguard nuclear weapons less likely and therefore exacerbates the threat of proliferation crs10 lastly there was the contention that nato enlargement was simply the wrong way to treat the former soviet union in the wake of its defeat in the cold war the concern was voiced that nato expansion would strengthen nationalistic and anti democratic forces in russia and that it would as former ambassador george f kennan stated in an oftencited new york times opinion piece impel russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking cr 19 march 1998 s2259 senator bob smith rnew hampshire said that enlargement is basically kicking the russians for reason history tells us that this is unwise cr 17 march 1998 s2108 senator pat roberts rkansas entered into the congressional record an opinion piece by historian john lewis gaddis that compared the current russian situation to that of postwar germany and argued that the west should not make the same mistakes it made with the weimar republic after world war i although in the end he voted in favor of ratification senator roberts said that by enlarging nato we are poking the russian bear cr 28 april 1998 s3703 opponents of enlargement argued that western policy should strive to strengthen democratic forces in russia enlargement they argued will only bolster hardline nationalist and communist elements in the russian political arena and weaken democratic forces by wounding national pride and creating sense of insecurity among the russian public senator wellstone argued european security and stability is greatly dependent on russias successful transition to democracy that i think is the central point democratic russia is unlikely to threaten its neighbors i am worried i am terribly worried i think this is profound mistake i think this nato expansion could threaten that democracy in russia and i think if we do not have successful transition to democracy in russia that in turn threatens european security and stability cr 19 march 1998 s2257 with the rise of such antidemocratic forces opponents argued will come increasing intransigence in the area of arms reduction the communistdominated russian duma has yet to follow the senate in ratifying the second strategic arms reduction treaty start ii and kennan believed that it might make it much more difficult if not impossible to secure ratification of this treaty and others including the comprehensive test ban treaty cr 19 march 1998 s2259 responses proponents of nato enlargement led by senators roth and biden countered each objection raised by the opposition with contrasting interpretations of russian behavior in the face of accession by the czech republic hungary and poland responding specifically to the notion advanced chiefly by senator moynihan that tensions along the polandrussia border would be increased by polands membership in the alliance senator biden noted that since natos inception in 1949 norway has bordered russias heavily fortified kola peninsula without incident in the same speech on april 30 senator biden reasserted the position that was central to the proponents stance on the issue of russia the alliance is defensive in nature and thus nato simply does not threaten russia never did never will cr 30 april 1998 s3870 he cited evidence that american troop levels as part of nato deployments have declined from peak of over 300000 during the cold war to around 100000 today and that the trend is toward still crs11 smaller numbers nato at the end of the cold war abandoned forwarddeployed stationary defenses for less obtrusive rapid deployment forces senator biden further noted that the alliance publicly stated in december 1996 that it had intention plan and reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members and in march 1997 it stated that there was need to deploy combat troops in the new member countries cr 30 april 1998 s3870 senator roth characterized as dead wrong the argument that nato enlargement punishes russia when it is weak just as the versailles treaty punished defeated germany he cited the natorussia founding act signed on 27 may 1997 which provided the foundation for not only enhanced consultation but also unprecedented defense cooperation cr 17 march 1998 s2111 russian troops today serve with nato forces in bosnia and herzegovina and since 1991 the west has contributed nearly 100 billion to aid democratic and economic reforms in russia senator biden noted us support for russian efforts to join the organization for economic cooperation and development and the world trade organization and for the inclusion of russia in what has become the g8 conference of leading industrial nations advocates of enlargement argued that an expanded nato should not poison relations with russia senator biden expressed hope that over time moscow can come to realize that enlargement of nato by moving the zone of stability eastward to central europe will increase her own security not diminish it cr 18 march 1998 s21812 senator jesse helms rnorth carolina chairman of the foreign relations committee advanced another view of russian behavior as reason for enlargement saying some have said that nato expansion is unnecessarily provocative to russia if anything it will make it easier for us to maintain friendly relations with russia because an expanded nato will shut off russias avenue to more destructive patterns of behavior cr 27 april 1998 s3604 conceding that differences exist with russia over such issues as its failure to ratify start ii and its policies in the middle east proponents of ratification insisted that these disagreements were not caused by the prospect of nato enlargement senator biden offered an explanation of the dumas opposition to start ii russian communists and ultranationalists were against ratifying start ii before nato enlargement was even gleam in the eyes of lech walesa and havel let alone us policy why were the russian communists and ultranationalists against it because american arms control negotiators did heck of job and russia knew it cr 27 april 1998 s3640 as evidence of russian cooperation with the west he cited the dumas ratification of the chemical weapons convention and the conventional forces in europe treaty and president boris yeltsins pledge to ratify start ii senator biden also cited data from march 14 1998 gallup poll which showed the russian public to be in favor of allowing the three candidate states to join the alliance he said 53 percent say poland should be allowed to join nato 57 percent say the czech republic should be allowed to join nato 54 percent say hungary should be allowed to join nato and 25 percent had view on the matter cr 27 april 1998 s3639 senator biden argued that the polling data confirmed that most russians had accepted nato enlargement dont you kind of crs12 find it fascinating that majority of the russian people say these countries should be able to join so lets give the russians little credit for being intelligent thinking people who are not captives of outdated ideological propaganda from the gallup poll i read you clearly they are not cr 27 april 1998 s3640 in response to the contention that enlargement will damage the prospects of democracys success in russia proponents argued that refusing to expand nato would in fact be more detrimental than enlargement might be because it would give hardline nationalists and communists victory over democrats who had tacitly accepted enlargement as reality senator roth declared moscow will always have its own independent motivations unfortunately there are still those in moscow who reject nato enlargement out of desire to preserve russias sphere of influence let us not give credibility to the likes of vladimir zhirinovsky by acceding to these demands there was further concern that by changing course because of russian misgivings nato would effectively give veto to russia over what ostensibly are internal decisions several senators reacted strongly against giving russia undue influence including senator christopher bond rmissouri who stated do not let the russians run our foreign policy cr 19 march 1998 s2259 nato enlargement was also put forth as hedge against the possibility that russia will be resurgent or that its experiment with democracy might fail at some point in the future senator gordon smith roregon said we cannot be certain what the european security environment will look like in three five or ten years but if we act now we will be better prepared for any outcome cr 19 march 1998 s2261 if russia does attempt to regain parts of its empire an enlarged nato will be ready according to senator roth the bottom line is that if russia cannot accept the legitimate right of its neighbors to choose their own defensive security arrangements then natos role in central and eastern europe is even more important cr 17 march 1998 s2111 european stability american security stability and security were frequently cited among the many reasons for natos creation in 1949 and its continued endurance today the preamble of the washington treaty states that members of the alliance seek to promote stability and wellbeing in the north atlantic area they are resolved to unite their efforts for collective defense and for the preservation of peace and security thus central to the senates debate on enlargement were questions of if and how stability and security would be enhanced if the czech republic hungary and poland were to join the alliance the senate was divided supporters of the resolution of ratification felt that enlargement would create safer and more stable europe while opponents of ratification believed the process would instead create dangerous instability in the european security environment supporters advocates of nato enlargement looked to the past performance of the alliance as an indicator of the stable environment they expected to exist in europe if the czech republic hungary and poland were to become members of nato noting the relative tranquility and wellbeing of the north atlantic area since the creation of the alliance senator frank murkowski ralaska said crs13 enlargement ensures and enhances the prospects for peace prosperity and harmony throughout europe an expanded nato will make the world safer simply because we are expanding the area where wars will not happen i think this will bind these countries closer together and ensure stability throughout the continent cr 19 march 1998 s2250 senator richard lugar rindiana agreed what is at stake here and now is order and stability in europe as whole and that is why american interests are involved cr 27 march 1998 s3617 senator john kerry d massachusetts said that nato membership would heighten the sense of security within those three countries not only through the extension of natos military guarantee but also through the psychological benefits of being member of the nato club and interactions within the alliance will clearly help to strengthen the new democracies and their abilities to assimilate themselves into europe both economically and politically and obviously militarily within natos integrated force structure cr 30 april 1998 s3848 many senators cited the historical ties between european stability and american security and promoted nato enlargement as way to maintain us engagement in europe senator william roth spoke about this link the vote before the senate is about americas role in europe and the ability of the transatlantic community to respond to challenges of the future both of which hinge on whether the united states wishes to remain european power and whether we desire unified democratic and larger europe to remain linked to america throughout its history europe has been landscape of many insecure small powers few imperialistic great powers and too many conflicting nationalist policies each creating friction with the other twice in this century these dynamics pulled america into wars on the european continent and the potential for them to create conflict in the future is all too real unless we seize opportunities like the one before us as czech republic president vaclav havel put it if the west does not stabilize the east the east will destabilize the west every time america has withdrawn its influence from europe trouble has followed this we cannot afford cr 17 march 1998 s2111 senator joseph biden offered similar thoughts saying for political economic strategic and cultural reasons europe remains an area of vital interest to the united states of america we are european power and for our own safetys sake in my view we must remain european power stability on that continent is fundamental to the wellbeing of our country cr 18 march 1998 s2176 senator dianne feinstein dcalifornia viewed us commitment to nato enlargement as small price to pay to avoid being drawn into another european war she said it has often been said that vigilance is the price of freedom nato remains form of vigilance cr 19 march 1998 s2256 enlargement was linked to natos ongoing transition from purely collective defense alliance to one with broader agenda for action senator kerry said the three applicants membership will enhance stability in central europe and strengthen nato itself through the acquisition of additional forces and personnel crs14 to cope with future threats and missions cr 30 april 1998 s3848 senator barbara mikulski dmaryland delineated some of these new threats we have civil wars we have hot spots caused by ethnic and regional tensions we have international crime drugs and terrorism and we have the very real threat of the spread of weapons of mass destruction nato must meet the needs of these new threats and i believe it will do so by changing and expanding europes new democracies will help us meet these challenges these new democracies will contribute to americas security by making nato stronger they are adding troops and equipment they will provide additional strategic depth to nato cr 18 march 1998 s2196 s2197 opponents the senators arguing against nato enlargement were joined by several of their colleagues who favored enlargement in general but expressed concerns about enlargements affect on stability and security this group worried that admitting the czech republic hungary and poland to the alliance would create unnecessary instability in an already volatile eastern european security environment several senators were concerned that enlargement would replace europes old iron curtain dividing line with new one further east senator patrick leahy d vermont asked would enlargement result in more united and secure europe more united probably yes but what if expansion does not extend to the republics of the former soviet union or even to certain other eastern european countries then we have simply created new dividing line between those inside nato and those that are excluded cr 30 april 1998 s3858 senator wellstone argued that rather than bringing the nations of europe closer together as many supporters claimed it would nato expansion would recreate dividing line in europe only further to the east than the original cold war dividing line and i do not consider that to be progress for the world cr 19 march 1998 s2257 many of the concerns of senators opposed to enlargement focused on the wests relationship with russia these concerns are dealt with in detail in separate section of this report but some aspects of the debate may be mentioned here as well senator bob smith said i cannot imagine worse longterm strategy for european security than jeopardizing united statesrussian relations cr 17 march 1998 s2108 the deteriorating state of the russian nuclear arsenal was at the forefront of several senators minds during the debate in his previously cited address to meeting of the associated press senator moynihan said allow to suggest that wandering in this void we may stumble into the catastrophe of nuclear war with russia this would come about not from russian strength but from russian weakness this is an idea we find difficult to absorb and understandably so but we had better do russians have been trying to tell us this cr 27 april 1998 s3613 senator moynihan also entered into the record letter from former ambassador paul nitze the openended expansion being proposed for the alliance points toward increasing friction with postcommunist russia for years to come driving russia into corner plays into the arguments of those most hostile to forging productive relationship with the united states and its allies it is not crs15 sound basis for future stability in europe particularly when current or projected threats warrant extending the alliance cr 27 april 1998 s3611 senator bingaman although supporter of the final resolution thought that other national security problems should have higher priority than nato enlargement the question of whether we admit poland hungary and the czech republic to nato needs to be judged in the overall context of our security needs in this postcold war period new threats dominate our national security agenda they are the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction terrorism and regional instability created by rogue states the specter of accidental nuclear launch and other high priority military threats those are the immediate security concerns we have it does not strike that enlarging nato is likely to help us meet those threats i am concerned that this nearsighted emphasis on nato enlargement may increase rather than decrease our threat to security interest in europe at best nato enlargement is distraction in that it diverts our attention from other higher priority concerns and alternative solutions and at worst it could undermine our ability to address these more immediate threats cr 27 april 1998 s3630 senator leahy ratification opponent conceded that nato would probably not suffer it might even benefit from the proposed round of expansion he worried however that the current round would create pressure for future enlargements the prospect of such pressure concerned him because he believed that adding all of the proposed twelve new participants to the alliances system of consensus among members would make nato unwieldy even less decisive and weakened thereby reducing european stability cr 30 april 1998 s3858 moral responsibility historical injustices most of the debate in the senate focused on the strategic and policy implications of nato enlargement several senators advocating the accession of the czech republic hungary and poland suggested that the united states had responsibility as the principal defender of democracy in the world and as key player in deciding the structure of the postworld war ii world to admit these three nations to the alliance several senators made specific references to the ties between the people of united states and the populations of the three candidate states opponents of nato enlargement generally chose to concentrate on some of the less emotional issues of accession instead of moral responsibility but some senators did express concern for the candidate nations that were left out of this round of enlargement and for russia senator john warner said i do believe this replaces symbolically the iron curtain that was established in the late forties which faced west with now an iron ring of nations that face east to russia cr 19 march 1998 s2271 crs16 moral responsibility having fashioned itself as bastion of freedom during the period of oppression of central and eastern europe by nazi and communist regimes some senators viewed enlargement as way in which the united states could fulfill the rhetorical promises made to these oppressed countries senator carl levin argued that if the senate were to reject enlargement we will be effectively dimming the flame of liberty that sustained these courageous peoples through decades of first nazi and then communist darkness cr 30 april 1998 s3814 senator john mccain said protecting freedom was the beacon of our policy in europe during the cold war it would be an incomprehensible tragedy for us to abandon that stance now when the opportunities for freedom in central europe are greater than ever and the risks are far lower than at any time during the cold war cr 18 march 1998 s2199 senator gordon smith spoke of the american dream in america we often talk about the american dream but really it isnt americas dream it is human dream it is dream that all people aspire to it is just that we enjoy it in great abundance life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and we must continue to defend it in the world for our sakes not just for theirs cr 19 march 1998 s2260 senator joseph lieberman dconnecticut viewed enlargement as an extension of the original purpose of the nato alliance which he described as military alliance in defense of principle he asked his fellow senators will we now turn our backs on the czech republic hungary and poland and the principle the idea the value of freedom that motivated us throughout the cold war and motivates them today i hope not i do not think so i do not believe we will cr 27 april 1998 s3625 historical injustices the circumstances of the coerced inclusion of the czech republic hungary and poland in the communist bloc at the end of the second world war often was cited in the arguments made by proponents of accession the big three conference at yalta in 1945 was widely viewed as the moment at which central and eastern europe were lost to communist domination but perceptions of blame differed among senators some faulted soviet leader josef stalin while others said that these conquered nations were sold out by the west senator mccain espoused the first view let us be clear these countries were forced into communism against their will by an occupying power while the united states and nato staunchly defended freedom in the west we could do little in the east other than offer our moral support because the risk of nuclear war was too great cr 18 march 1998 s2198 senator smith of oregon said i suggest one of many reasons that we should expand nato is that we have moral obligation to live up to the terms that were made at yalta but went unfulfilled cr 19 march 1998 s2260 other senators chose to focus on the mistakes made by the west following world war ii senator helms spoke about what he perceived as the wests mistakes at yalta half of the 20th century ago poland hungary and the czech republic were consigned to communist domination because of expedient and short crs17 sighted policies of the west in approving this resolution the senate has the opportunity to remedy this historical injustice of yalta by accepting poland hungary and the czech republic into nato we reconnect them to the democratic west union that was severed by first hitler then stalin cr 17 march 1998 s2106s2107 senator barbara mikulski dmaryland mentioned her own polish heritage and said i know that the polish people did not choose to live behind the iron curtain they were forced there by the yalta agreement by potsdam and because they and the baltic states and the other captive nations were sold out by the free world cr 18 march 1998 s2196 mandated pause senator john warner sponsored an amendment to the resolution of ratification 2322 which would have mandated three year pause to considering additional states for membership after the accession of the czech republic hungary and poland to the alliance this amendment garnered more support than others proposed by opponents to nato enlargement but it was rejected by vote of 59 nays to 41 yeas6 arguments in favor those senators in favor of mandating three year pause after the current round of enlargement centered their argument around some uncertainties involved in the current round of accession the cost of enlargement and the difficulty of integrating the new members militaries into the nato command structure the current state of natos strategic concept and the pressure future presidents may face to enlarge the alliance further senator warner based much of his argument on the presupposition that the protocols of accession would at the end of the day be approved by the senate he proposed three year pause as period of time during which the costs and challenges of the first round of enlargement could be analyzed he declared that he offered the amendment because we dont know what the costs are of this first round we dont know how quickly these three new nations can bring themselves up in terms of military interoperability with nato forces today and how long it will take them to be positive full partner with nato and not what i would regard as user of nato security cr 19 march 1998 s2272 senator byron dorgan d north dakota concurred saying lets wait for three years before we admit any more nations into nato lets pause and try to understand what all of this will cost what exactly is the threat and what our response should be cr 30 april 1998 s3835 senator warner later went on to say i say to my colleagues think of the american taxpayer we do not have firm estimate of the costs and therefore in all probability there will be an expense to the american taxpayer associated with including these three countries cr 30 april 1998 s3844 6 the tally of votes can be found in the congressional record of april 30 1998 p s3844 the text of the amendment can be found in appendix 4 crs18 senator warner also noted that nato will not approve an updated strategic concept until the 1999 washington summit he and other senators critical of the timing of enlargement argued that natos guiding strategic document should logically first be agreed upon with enlargement to follow senator warner said we are also asked to approve this measure without full knowledge as to the strategic concept of what nato is and is not going to do in the years to come we are operating under 1991 doctrine today ironically it is not until the summit at which these three nations will be admitted when nato will finalize the doctrine for the future i ask you is that the way to do business not in my judgment and that is why i say if three are reality then we should stop and study reasonable period of time let another president let the american people have careful examination of what nato brings forth year from today as to the new mission and adoption cr 30 april 1998 s3827s3828 senator warner believed that the current round of accession would create pressure for the united states and other nato governments to move quickly toward another period of enlargement he argued that by mandating three year pause before the next round of accession his amendment would alleviate this pressure and allow for careful analysis of issues of enlargement he said i think the next president should be given the opportunity to assess the merits and such disadvantages as may arise by virtue of the accession of three more nations before we leap forward under pressure which will be unrelenting that pressure will begin the day 1 year from now when these three nations will be accessed the march will begin to bring in other nations perhaps numbering as many as nine i say to my colleagues should not the next president be given the opportunity to study the record make an assessment and then give his advice or her advice to the people of the united states cr 30 april 1998 s3827 arguments in opposition supporters of the accession of the czech republic hungary and poland most of whom opposed senator warners amendment argued that mandating three year pause was both unnecessary and impractical senator biden tried to reassure those senators advocating pause that the first round of enlargement would not instigate flood of new alliance members he declared there is urgency to move to the next round and offered his own opinion that we should say that there will be second round until all these three nations are fully integrated into natos integrated command structure using parenting analogy to make his point senator biden said lets not argue about what college our daughter is going to when she is only two years old cr 18 march 1998 s2186 senator john mccain argued that mandated pause was scarcely necessary given there will be facto pause as the alliance absorbs the first round of new members cr 18 march 1998 s2202 in response to senator warners contention that three year pause would shield future president from pressure for second round opponents of the amendment contended that the measure instead would tie our own hands and those of future crs19 president cr 18 march 1998 s2202 senator charles robb dvirginia argued that legislating required pause would limit the options of future administrations critical national decisions based on carefully reasoned and supported judgements are subjugated to an artificial time line that could actually end up proving harmful to our military interests we need to be flexible rather than arbitrary about future entrants into nato if the first round goes well the partnership for peace program will keep the door open for new members present and future security considerations will then dictate the pace and scope of enlargement cr 30 april 1998 s3837 senator roth declared that nato enlargement is driven by moral imperatives strategic selfinterest and objective criteria concerning military readiness and political and economic reform he said any proposal to freeze enlargement subordinates these factors to an arbitrary timeline cr 30 april 1998 s3839 several senators stated that the amendment would contravene article 10 of the north atlantic treaty which states that membership is open to any other european state in position to further the principles of this treaty and to contribute to the security of the north atlantic area thereby removing an incentive for other european nations to prepare for nato accession senator roth said that the amendment would send dangerous message to the reformist governments of central europe they would suppose and not incorrectly that the united states is slamming the door shut concerning their possible accession into the alliance cr 30 april 1998 s3839 senator spencer abraham rmichigan said that mandating three year pause would send exactly the wrong signal at this critical point in history and will only lead to further feelings of abandonment and exclusion by nations wanting to join the west cr 30 april 1998 s3836 lastly opponents of the amendment worried that requiring pause before the next round of enlargement would further strain already tenuous relations with the nations of central and eastern europe and strengthen nationalist forces in russia senator richard lugar rindiana praised natos opendoor entrance policy to retract the opendoor policy would risk undermining tremendous gains that have been made for peace throughout the region the result of closeddoor policy would be the creation of new dividing lines across europe those nations outside might become disillusioned and insecure and thus inclined to adopt the competitive and destabilizing security policies of europes past cr 27 april 1998 s3618 senator roth expressed concerns about russia saying an arbitrary freeze on nato enlargement would harm russias historic reconciliation with nato and the united states freeze would appear to give moscow veto over enlargement it certainly would be interpreted as victory by those who still advocate russian sphere of influence cr 30 april 1998 s3839 crs20 linking nato and european union membership opponents of enlargement argued during the senates debate that the czech republic hungary and poland should not be admitted to the alliance until they have secured membership in the european union eu this position was taken by senators moynihan and warner who cosponsored an amendment to the protocols of accession stipulating such natoeu link advocates of enlargement countered that making prior eu membership condition for nato membership was unwise given the differing missions of the two organizations and the relevant interests of the united states arguments in favor senator moynihan the amendments lead sponsor argued that the risks of nato enlargement specifically involving russia outweigh the costs ambassador richard holbrooke said what because brussels wont expand the european union nato expansion must fill void is it filling void because they cannot agree on common agricultural policy in europe so filling void to bring back the prospect of nuclear war is that worth it give them access to global market they have never been allowed into give them common agricultural policy that will give their farmers living this is what they deserve poland has had enough in this 20th century we do not want another period of hostilities that could lead not just to war but to annihilation cr 27 april 1998 s3616s3617 senator wellstone buttressed senator moynihans argument with the contention that many of the declared goals of nato expansion democracy stability open markets could be achieved by pressuring the european union to admit the newly democratic states of eastern europe he said the european union that is where we should be using our leverage as nation expand the european union that is about markets that is about democracy cr 27 april 1998 s3616 senator warner focused on the costs involved in the integration into the nato command of the militaries of the czech republic hungary and poland he cited the wide divergence among the various estimates of these costs and argued that eu membership would be signal that the three countries economies are prepared to handle the economic burdens of nato membership there is blank check involved in these votes today eu membership would be way to evaluate the economic ability of these three countries to meet their financial obligations to nato should those financial obligations fall short guess who is going to pick it up the united states of america in participation with nations and other countries by virtue of the eu giving their imprimatur on these countries will be further assurance that they will have economic productivity and the like to generate the dollars to meet their requirements to pay the bill to upgrade their militaries all of that is going to be very very hefty bill i would like to see the eu pronounce their economic viability as nations which gives us certain amount of assurance in return that the american crs21 taxpayer will not be picking up greater and greater portion of their obligation to modernize their forces cr 30 april 1998 s3823 arguments in opposition advocates of nato enlargement fought to defeat senator moynihans amendment most senators concentrated on the contrasting missions of the two entities and on what type of voice the united states would have if link between nato and eu accession were to be established senator roth spoke about the proposed natoeu link he began by mentioning key difference between nato military alliance and the european union the eu is strictly politicaleconomic organization of which the united states is not member and has say he agreed that eu enlargement is highly desirable and noted that the resolution of ratification before the senate stated that the official policy of the united states is to encourage eu enlargement the moynihan amendment senator roth argued is inconsistent with the washington treaty article 10 of the treaty states that membership in nato is open to any european state in position to further the principles of this treaty and to contribute to the security of the north atlantic area senator roth pointed out that five current natomember nations the united states canada iceland norway and turkey are not members of the eu are they any less effective members of the alliance because they are not part of the eu he asked the answer is unambiguously requiring eu membership of natocandidate countries would create an artificial second tier for noneu countries he argued norway has in fact chosen not to join the eu based on an assessment of its own interests as could the czech republic hungary and poland even if they were to be invited according to senator roth requiring them to join would create an arbitrary standard that is not necessarily reflection of nato aspirants state of economic and political wellbeing cr 30 april 1998 s3825 several senators objected to the prospect of basing nato accession on membership in an organization of which the united states is not member senator biden called it sheer folly and asked why would we want to place such key element of our national security decisionmaking in the hands of the european union an organization to which we do not belong cr 30 april 1998 s3825 senator gordon smith said the european union may be many things but it is certainly not substitute for us leadership in europe cr 30 april 1998 s3822 senator roth spoke on this issue as well by conditioning nato membership on attainment of eu membership this amendment would strip the alliance of control over its own future specifically its decisions over future membership and transfer it over to the european union the eu is not transatlantic organization it has effective security or defense capability or policy for that matter do we really want the eu to have such significant influence over nato cr 30 april 1998 s3825 senator roth closed his remarks by summarizing the arguments of those opposed to the amendment in one fell swoop this amendment would impose an unprecedented restriction upon the washington treaty transfer key decisions over natos future to the eu demote the united states to new secondclass tier of crs22 alliance members and thereby weaken us leadership of nato cr 30 april 1998 s3825 on april 30 1998 the moynihan amendment was defeated 83177 the final vote the resolution of ratification as amended during the senates consideration came to vote late in the evening of april 30 at the request of senate majority leader trent lott rmississippi all 99 senators present and voting took their assigned seats in the chamber rising to cast their vote when called by the clerk of the senate the final tally found 80 senators in favor 19 against one senator had left washington earlier in the day on official business8 7 the tally of votes can be found in the congressional record of april 30 1998 p s3844 the text of the amendment can be found in appendix 5 8 the final tally of votes can be found in the congressional record of april 30 1998 p s3907 crs23 appendix 1 protocols to the north atlantic treaty of 1949 on the accession of poland hungary and the czech republic congressional record 4 may 1998 s4217s4220 the text of resolution of ratification to the protocols to the north atlantic treaty of 1949 on the accession of poland hungary and the czech republic as agreed to by the senate on april 30 1998 reads as follows resolved twothirds of the senators present concurring therein section 1 senate advice and consent subject to declarations and conditions the senate advises and consents to the ratification of the protocols to the north atlantic treaty of 1949 on the accession of poland hungary and the

1949 on the accession of poland hungary and the czech republic is subject to the following declarations 1 reaffirmation that united states membership in nato remains vital national security interest of the united statesthe senate declares that for nearly 50 years the north atlantic treaty organization nato has served as the preeminent organization to defend the territory of the countries in the north atlantic area against all external threats b through common action the established democracies of north america and europe that were joined in nato persevered and prevailed in the task of ensuring the survival of democratic government in europe and north america throughout the cold war c nato enhances the security of the united states by embedding european states in process of cooperative security planning by preventing the destabilizing renationalization of european military policies and by ensuring an ongoing and direct leadership role for the united states in european security affairs d the responsibility and financial burden of defending the democracies of europe and north america can be more equitably shared through an alliance in which specific obligations and force goals are met by its members the security and prosperity of the united states is enhanced by natos collective defense against aggression that may threaten the territory of nato members and crs24 f united states membership in nato remains vital national security interest of the united states 2 strategic rationale for nato enlargementthe senate finds that notwithstanding the collapse of communism in most of europe and the dissolution of the soviet union the united states and its nato allies face threats to their stability and territorial integrity including those common threats described in section 31av b the invasion of poland hungary or the czech republic or their destabilization arising from external subversion would threaten the stability of europe and jeopardize vital united states national security interests c poland hungary and the czech republic having established democratic governments and having demonstrated willingness to meet all requirements of membership including those necessary to contribute to the territorial defense of all nato members are in position to further the principles of the north atlantic treaty and to contribute to the security of the north atlantic area and d extending nato membership to poland hungary and the czech republic will strengthen nato enhance security and stability in central europe deter potential aggressors and thereby advance the interests of the united states and its nato allies 3 supremacy of the north atlantic council in nato decisionmakingthe senate understands that as the north atlantic council is the supreme decisionmaking body of nato the north atlantic council will not subject its decisions to review challenge or veto by any forum affiliated with nato including the permanent joint council or the euroatlantic partnership council or by any nonmember state participating in any such forum b the north atlantic council does not require the consent of the united nations the organization for security and cooperation in europe or any other international organization in order to take any action pursuant to the north atlantic treaty in defense of the north atlantic area including the deployment operation or stationing of forces and c the north atlantic council has direct responsibility for matters relating to the basic policies of nato including development of the strategic concept of nato as defined in section 31f and consensus position of the north atlantic council will precede any negotiation between nato and nonnato members that affects natos relationship with nonnato members participating in fora such as the permanent joint council 4 full membership for new members in generalthe senate understands that poland hungary and the czech republic in becoming nato members will have all the rights obligations responsibilities and protections that are afforded to all other nato members b political commitmentsthe senate endorses the political commitments made by nato to the russian federation in the natorussia founding act which are not legally binding and do not in any way preclude any future decisions by the north atlantic council to preserve the security of nato members crs25 5 natorussia relationship the senate finds that it is in the interest of the united states for nato to develop new and constructive relationship with the russian federation as the russian federation pursues democratization market reforms and peaceful relations with its neighbors 6 the importance of european integration sense of the senate it is the sense of the senate that i the central purpose of nato is to provide for the collective defense of its members ii the organization for security and cooperation in europe is fundamental institution for the promotion of democracy

states and iii the european union is an essential organization for the economic political and social integration of all qualified european countries into an undivided europe b policy of the united states the policy of the united states is i to utilize fully the institutions of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to reach political solutions for disputes in europe and ii to encourage actively the efforts of the european union to expand its membership which will help to stabilize the democracies of central and eastern europe 7 future consideration of candidates for membership in nato senate findings the senate finds that i article 10 of the north atlantic treaty provides that nato members by unanimous agreement may invite the accession to the north atlantic treaty of any other european state in position to further the principles of the north atlantic treaty and to contribute to the security of the north atlantic area ii in its madrid summit declaration of july 8 1997 nato pledged to maintain an open door to the admission of additional alliance members in the future if those countries satisfy the requirements of article 10 of the north atlantic

member including in the case of the united states the requirements of article ii section 2 crs26 clause 2 of the constitution of the united states relating to the advice and consent of the senate to
