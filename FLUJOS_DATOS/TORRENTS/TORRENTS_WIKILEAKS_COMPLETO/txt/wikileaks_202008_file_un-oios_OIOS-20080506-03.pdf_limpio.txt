framework to facilitate understanding and communicating common processes or functions within the organization common language they are based on categorization of objectives using hierarchy that begins with highlevel objectives and then cascades down to objectives relevant to organizational units functions or business processes the iad risk assessment framework has identified eleven focus areas as follows 1strategic management and governance 2financial management 3human resources management 4procurement and contract administration 5logistics management 6information technology management

assessment framework evaluates the likelihood of the risk occurring and the impact it will have if it occurs based on the assessment of the two factors an overall risk rating is derived indicating whether the risk of focus area is hig h moderate or low the ratings used is show below risk likelihood likely conditions within our environment indicate that an event is expected to occur in most circumstances possible conditions within our enviroment indicate that an event will probably occur in many circumstances remote conditions within our environment indicate that an event may occur at
