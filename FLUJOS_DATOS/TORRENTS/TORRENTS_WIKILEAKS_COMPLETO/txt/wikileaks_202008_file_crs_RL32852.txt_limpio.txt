damagerelated emergency funding and 400 million from hurricane katrina supplemental pl 10962 b formerly utilized sites remedial action program key policy issues corps of engineers financial management reprogramming and contracting the conference report included compromise language between the house and senate appropriations committees which had expressed in their respective reports different levels of dissatisfaction with the corps financial management particularly the reprogramming of funds across projects and the use of multiyear continuing contracts for projects language in hr 2419 after conference would change the corps ability to reprogram to use continuing contracts and to allocate project funds on quarterly rather than an annual basis2 corps budget and the agencys backlog of projects the corps civil works program has been criticized by some observers as an agglomeration of projects with underlying design these observers see the corps backlog of authorized activities as one example of this lack of focus estimates of the backlogs size vary from 11 billion to more than 50 billion depending on which projects are included although some observers view the backlog as nothing more than to do list for the corps others are concerned that projects are facing construction delays and related cost overruns because of the spread of available appropriations across an increasing portfolio of projects 2 for example it would restrict the corps ability to increase or decrease the funding for project to more than 2 million or 50 of that years appropriation whichever is less another change in the approach to corps appropriations is the decision not to use the savings and slippage convention in previous years since not all corps activities are accomplished as planned appropriations for the principal corps accounts included reduction for savings and slippage to account for the slip of spending eg due to delays caused by weather nonfederal sponsor financing or decision not to proceed and the savings from project costing less than estimated application of the ss contributed to the quantity of the reprogramming being performed by the corps the approach taken in the conference report is to stop applying ss and reduce the need for reprogrammings by requiring the agency to provide quarterly rather than annual allocations to projects crs6 the conferees requested from the corps list of its 10 priority flood damage reduction and navigation projects following hurricanes katrina and rita based on the agencys professional engineering judgement however according to the conference report the conferees have largely provided the budget request for individual water resources projects because of the agencys inability to provide congress with the requested prioritysetting information many corps policy proposals in the presidents fy2006 budget request were aimed at reducing the construction backlog while making progress on corps projects within current fiscal constraints and national priorities the request attempted this largely by starting new projects and distributing funds across projects based on performance measures although the house bill adopted some of the changes proposed by the administration the house appropriations committee expressed view of how to structure the corps portfolio that would go beyond the changes proposed by the administration hrept 10986 stated the civil works program needs to be managed as program and not as collection of individual projects to respond to what the committee sees as little or systematic approach to the nations water and coastal infrastructure underlying the selection of which projects received funding the house appropriations committee reiterated in its report the value of fiveyear plan and strategic vision to guide budget requests the report by the senate appropriations committee approached the corps budget from perspective distinct from that of the house and the administration the senate report referred to the benefits of the previous big tent budgeting approach where all aspects of water resources were jointly developed and discussed the senate report however was critical of the lack of leadership at the agency performancebased budgeting the fy2006 request tackled the corps construction backlog on number of fronts one way the fy2006 request tried to address the corps backlog of projects was to develop the budget request using performancebased budgeting approach for determining which projects to fund for construction and to lesser extent maintenance the performance measures were based on their economic and environmental returns the construction projects selected for funding were chosen largely on their having either high ratio of remaining benefits to remaining costs or for environmental projects high cost effectiveness the house appropriations committee noted in its report that it supports the concept of focusing limited resources on completing highvalue projects already under construction and the committee recommendation is based in large part on the administrations performancebased approach in its report the senate appropriations committee in contrast largely rejected the administrations performancebased budgeting and suggested that the agency seriously reexamine its budget model the report argues that the approach used in the fy2006 budget request promotes discord among various water resources interests led to skewed set of results with few strong winners and many losers and is very unbalanced among planning construction and maintenance the senate report includes funds for numerous projects funded in neither the house bill nor the administrations requests crs7 the conference report acknowledged the administrations efforts but recognized the limitations of the administrations metrics accordingly the conference report directs the corps to contract with the national academy of public administration to study and recommend metrics for allocating corps construction appropriations across projects priorities and new starts to address the budget backlog the administrations request limited the number of new activities started to only one construction project and three planning activities the presidents request would fund construction projects that could be completed in fy2006 and projects considered by the administration to be priorities similar to the presidents fy2005 request the nine national priority projects for fy2006 included the new york and new jersey harbor deepening project restoration projects in the florida everglades and the upper mississippi river system and projects to meet environmental requirements in the columbia river basin and the missouri river basin hrept 10986 for the most part adopts the new starts of the presidents request however not all of the presidents priority projects receive the full amount requested and some appropriations were added to some ongoing construction projects srept 10984 rejected the decimated planning program commented on the importance of planning for the agency and would fund much larger set of projects than the administrations request and the housepassed bill the senate and conference reports did not comment on new construction starts project suspensions using the performancebased budgeting criteria the administration identified 35 active construction projects to be studied for possible suspension ie to buy out current construction contracts rather than to complete them the fy2006 request would provide an 80 million fund with which to cancel contacts for these projects most of the projects proposed for suspension were included in the fy2005 request and have local project sponsors that have made investments and raised funds for their share of construction costs the house chose not to restore funding for about half of the projects on the suspension list rather than funding suspension account the committee requested more information on the cost of suspending these projects the senate and conference bills restored funding for more than twothirds of the projects proposed for suspension ecosystem restoration significant addition to the corps mission in recent years is role in large environmental restoration programs raising concerns that funding for these programs could displace funding for other traditional water resources activities many largescale ecosystem restorations are in the planning phases or are awaiting congressional authorization these will require additional funds as they move into the more costintensive construction and implementation phases other restoration activities are taking place in the context of addressing the environmental and species impacts of previously constructed projects the fy2006 request would provide 510 million for aquatic ecosystem restoration coastal louisiana the conference report provides 10 million for coastal louisiana ecosystem restoration studies which is less than the 20 million requested by the administration the conference report provides 8 million for comprehensive coastal hurricane protection study which had not been included in the presidents request crs8 funding for the investments needed to restore hurricane storm damage protection to coastal louisiana for the 2006 hurricane season is being pursued through reallocation of 16 billion of the 623 billion in supplemental appropriations provided by congress for emergency hurricane response 250 million of the 16 billion would be for gulf coastal ecosystem projects that help reduce storm damage risk for more information on appropriations for the corps work related to hurricanes katrina and rita see crs report rs22239 emergency supplemental appropriations for hurricane katrina relief by jennifer lake and ralph m chite everglades the corps plays significant coordination role in the restoration of the central and southern florida ecosystem the presidents request for fy2006 includes 137 million for the corps construction projects in the region up from 130 million in the fy2005 request and 12125 in the enacted fy2004 appropriations in pl 108447 the fy2006 budget request supports the state of floridas efforts to accelerate work on certain projects the house appropriations committee has provided 137 million for the south florida ecosystem everglades restoration program the 137 million in the housepassed bill would fund everglades activities that were previously budgeted separately the central and southern florida project the kissimmee river restoration project and the everglades and south florida restoration projects and the modified water deliveries project 35 million in corps appropriations for fy2006 the addition of the modified water deliveries project followed the presidents budget proposal that the project longer be funded solely through department of interior appropriations3 the budget request called for the corps to broaden its role in the project by having the agency jointly fund it with the department of the interior the administrations position is that the corps should pay for 124 million of the remaining 191 million required to complete the project during fy2006 through fy2009 this proposal has raised question is the corps authorized to receive appropriations to work on the project according to the hrept 10986 the corps has sufficient authority to receive and expend funds to proceed with project construction but according to srept 10984 the senate appropriations committee did not fund the modified waters project because it does not believe sufficient current authorization exists for the corps to fund the work the senate bill also rejects the consolidation of the everglades projects together in one lineitem instead it provides 77 million for the central and southern florida project 13 million for the kissimmee river project and 12 million for the everglades and south florida project it also provides 3 million for florida keys water quality improvement project these projects total 105 million the conference report also rejects the consolidation of the everglades projects

whereas the army corps of engineers built hundreds of flood control and navigation projects bors mission was to develop water supplies primarily for irrigation to reclaim arid lands in the west today bor manages hundreds of dams and diversion projects including more than 300 storage reservoirs in 17 western states these projects provide water to approximately 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people bor is the largest wholesale supplier of water in the 17 western states and the secondlargest hydroelectric power producer in the nation bor facilities also provide substantial flood control recreation and fish and wildlife benefits at the same time operations of bor facilities are often controversial particularly for their effect on sensitive fish and wildlife species and conflicts among competing water users calfed the administration requested 35 million for the california bay delta restoration account baydelta or calfed for fy2006 according to bor the requested funds will be used for implementation of stage 1 activities including the environmental water account water use efficiency conveyance ecosystem restoration storage studies and program administration the

infrastructure sector by claudia copeland and betsy cody beginning in fy2005 and continuing for fy2006 bor has planned to assign portion of site security costs to water users for repayment based on existing project cost allocations for operations and maintenance activities the house appropriations committee for fy2006 acknowledged the longheld practice of assigning annual om costs to project beneficiaries and estimated the collection of 10 million in site security reimbursement payments it provided 40 million for site security which together with the 10 million in expected collections equals the administrations budget request the senate appropriations committee provided 50 million for site security but directed bor to provide report to the committee by may 2007 detailing planned reimbursable and nonreimbursable costs the committee further directed the commissioner not to begin the reimbursement process until congress directs him to do so crs12 the conference bill adopted the house position including 10 million in security reimbursements but the conferees directed bor to report on planned reimbursements within 60 days after enactment other issues the final bill also included language section 205 authorizing bor to enter into grants cooperative agreements etc for improvements that will conserve water increase water use efficiency or enhance water management through measurement or automation at existing projects the language essentially authorizes the bureaus water 2025 program grantmaking program for water conservation and innovative water management activities the general provisions also include sections directing 95 million to be spent for water flow and restoration efforts related to the walker river basin in nevada section 208 and study

to the energy and water development bill including the transferred programs the total request for title iii for fy2006 was 24213 billion compared to 24419 billion appropriated for fy2005 excluding the adjustments noted in table 3 the house appropriations committee recommended 24318 billion and the house approved that amount in passing hr 2419 the senate version of hr 2419 would have appropriated 25077 billion the conference bill pl 109103 appropriated 24290 billion in reporting out hr 2419 the house appropriations committee listed the transferred programs in title iii so as to integrate them with the existing programs in particular the energy efficiency programs transferred from the interior bill were combined with the renewable energy programs in the energy and water bill into single

and missions in the following pages the programs are described and major issues identified in approximately the order in which they appear in the budget tables as listed in table 7 energy efficiency and renewable energy the fy2006 budget request noted that the administrations energy efficiency and renewable energy programs have the potential to produce substantial benefits for the nation both now and in the future in terms of economic growth increased energy security and cleaner environment in particular the request aimed to accelerate the development of crs15 hydrogenpowered fuel cell vehicles the hydrogen program aims to facilitate industry commercialization of infrastructure for those vehicles by 2015 goals for other energy enduse and production technologies generally seek to improve energy efficiency and performance while reducing costs the administrations fy2006 request sought 12004 million for does energy efficiency and renewable energy eere programs which was 485 million or 4 less than the fy2005 appropriation the main increases were for fuel cells 87 million hydrogen 51 million and facilities 49 million the main cuts were for industrial programs 183 million

tribal energy 15 million further at least 759 million in congressional earmarks were to be reprogrammed or eliminated including hydrogen 376 million biomass 353 and intergovernmental 30 million see table 8 below for fy2006 the house approved 12368 million for eere programs this is 364 million or 3 more than the fy2006 request subsequently the senate bill included 12538 million which is 170

from eere to oe policy directions in congressional reports the fy2006 house appropriations committees report noted that doe delayed in meeting legal deadlines for issuing approximately twenty new and updated appliance efficiency standards thus the committee strongly urges the secretary to expedite the process and requests that the secretary report to the committee by december 1 2005 on plans to accelerate standards rulemakings including timeline for work on issuing the three highest priority standards with an explanation for the additional delays announced in december 2004 crs17 plan for addressing the backlog of standards rulemakings that have missed legal or internal deadlines including list of the affected products and deadlines timelines for action on each product and funding requirements to complete each rulemaking and description of how the department will meet the timeframe goals of the process improvement rule4 or of how the process should be changed so that the department can meet the goals additionally the fy2006 senate appropriations committees report gave four administrative directions first the committee noted its support for the national academy of sciences recommendations for hydrogen programs and requests that the department integrate their recommendations into the program second the committee recommends that the department not expend any funds to support offshore wind energy research until the federal rules and permitting requirements are implemented through legislation third the committee directed that the energy secretary consider transferring certain demandside management activities from the building technologies program to the office of electricity delivery and energy reliability oe at minimum the committee calls for report to show that activities under the two programs do not duplicate each other fourth the committee directs that the six regional offices be consolidated into two locations the golden field office and the

of congressionally directed projects and specifies that if these project totals exceed 20 of subaccount doe is given discretion to fund these projects within other energy supply and conservation subaccountsp 138 the rapid growth in earmarks has raised concerns about staffing at national laboratories impacts on certain programs and the possible need to scale back government performance and results act gpra performance targets for some rd programs second the report says that full funding is provided for does six regional offices but acknowledging that the administration does not plan to request funding for these offices in fy2007 it directs that the regional offices be consolidated into the project management center at the golden colorado field office and the national energy technology laboratory west virginia not later than september 30 2006 third the report calls for report on appliance efficiency standards as directed in the house report table 9 congressionally

provides 5576 million 576 million above the fy2005 appropriation of that funding 1374 million would come from the other defense activities and naval reactors appropriations accounts reducing the nuclear energy programs net appropriation in the energy supply and conservation account to 4202 million the administration had requested 5138 million for fy2006 of which 1239 million was from other defense activities the house raised the administrations total request slightly to 5151 million 52 million above the fy2005 appropriation an additional reimbursement of 135 million from the naval reactors account would have left net appropriation of 3777 million under energy supply and conservation much of the defense and naval reactors reimbursement covers defenserelated management and security at the idaho national laboratory inl which has been transferred to the nuclear energy program from does environmental management program the nuclear energy program is run by does office of nuclear energy science and technology the house shifted an 187 million uranium disposal program from the nuclear energy office to the national nuclear security administration move agreed to by the conferees an amendment adopted at the house appropriations committee markup transferred 10 million from the nuclear power 2010 program discussed below to the weatherization assistance program the senate bill included 60 million boost from the administration request to total of 5738 million the panel approved the proposed 1239 million under crs19 other defense activities leaving 4499 million for nuclear energy under energy supply and conservation the final appropriation of 5576 million includes 10 million in the advanced fuel cycle initiative to accelerate design work on an engineeringscale demonstration of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing technology the benefits of nuclear power as an emissions free reliable and affordable source of energy are an essential element in the nations energy and environmental future according to does budget justification however opponents have criticized does nuclear research program as providing wasteful subsidies to an industry that they believe should be phased out as unacceptably hazardous and economically uncompetitive nuclear power 2010 president bushs specific mention of safe clean nuclear energy in his 2005 state of the union address indicated the administrations interest in encouraging construction of new commercial reactors for which there have been us orders since 1978 does efforts to restart the nuclear construction pipeline are focused on the nuclear power 2010 program which will pay up to half of the nuclear industrys costs of seeking regulatory approval for new reactor sites applying for new reactor licenses and preparing detailed plant designs the program is intended to provide assistance for advanced versions of existing commercial nuclear plants that could be ordered within the next few years the nuclear power 2010 program is helping three utilities seek nrc approval for potential nuclear reactor sites in illinois mississippi and virginia in addition three industry consortia in 2004 applied for total of 650 million over the next several years to design and license new nuclear power plants and conduct feasibility study doe awarded an initial 13 million to the consortia in 2004 the fy2006 budget request included 560 million for the program 129 boost over fy2005 after the 10 million transfer adopted during committee markup the house approved 460 million for nuclear power 2010 the senate bill includes 20 million increase from the budget request to 760 million the conference agreement provides 660 million the nuclear license applications under the nuclear power 2010 program would test the one step licensing process established by the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 even if the licenses are granted by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc the industry consortia funded by doe have not committed to building new reactors loan guarantees and tax credits to encourage construction of new reactors are included in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 generation iv advanced commercial reactor technologies that are not yet close to deployment are the focus of does generation iv nuclear energy systems initiative for which 450 million was requested for fy2006 about 125 above fy2005 the house approved the same amount and the senate bill included 150 million increase from the request to 60 million the conference agreement provides 55 million of which 40 million is for the next generation nuclear plant discussed below crs20 the generation iv program is focusing on six advanced designs that could be commercially available around 20202030 two gascooled one watercooled two liquidmetalcooled and one moltensalt concept some of these reactors would use plutonium recovered through reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel the administrations may 2001 national energy policy report contends that plutonium recovery could reduce the longterm environmental impact of nuclear waste disposal and increase domestic energy supplies however opponents contend that the separation of plutonium from spent fuel poses unacceptable environmental risks and because of plutoniums potential use in nuclear bombs undermines us policy on nuclear weapons proliferation advanced fuel cycle initiative the development of plutoniumfueled reactors in the generation iv program is closely related to the nuclear energy programs advanced fuel cycle initiative afci for which the administration requested 700 million 38 above the fy2005 level according to the budget justification afci will develop and demonstrate nuclear fuel cycles that could reduce the longterm hazard of spent nuclear fuel and recover additional energy such technologies would involve separation of plutonium uranium and other long lived radioactive materials from spent fuel for reuse in nuclear reactor or for transmutation in particle accelerator the program includes longstanding doe work on electrometallurgical treatment of spent fuel from the experimental breeder reactor ii ebrii at inl the house added 55 million to the afci budget request to accelerate the development and selection of separations technology later than the end of fy2007 that can address the current inventories of commercial spent nuclear fuel and prepare an integrated spent nuclear fuel recycling plan according to the appropriations committee report the senate voted to add 15 million to the budget request with 10 million for design of an engineering scale demonstration of uranium extraction technology urex being developed by does savannah river technology center the conference agreement provides 80 million for afci including 10 million for the engineeringscale demonstration project doe is directed to submit spent nuclear fuel recycling technology plan to the appropriations committees by next march 1 and select preferred reprocessing technology by the end of fy2007 nuclear hydrogen initiative in support of president bushs program to develop hydrogenfueled vehicles doe requested 200 million in fy2006 for the nuclear hydrogen initiative an increase of 124 from the fy2005 level the house approved the same amount and the senate appropriations committee recommended 300 million the conferees approved 250 million according to does fy2005 budget justification preliminary estimates indicate that hydrogen produced using nucleardriven thermochemical or hightemperature electrolysis processes would be only slightly more expensive than gasoline and result in far less air pollution an advanced reactor that would demonstrate coproduction of hydrogen and electricity the next generation nuclear plant ngnp was allocated 250 million from does generation iv program by the fy2005 omnibus appropriations conference report the senate bill directed that 40 million of the fy2006 crs21 generation iv allocation be used for the ngnp program in particular the senate appropriations committee urged that doe complete design competition for the ngnp by the end of fy2006 so that the reactor could begin operating at inl by 2017 as noted above the conferees agreed with the senates 40 million allotment for ngnp from the generation iv program other reactor research doe again requested new funding specifically for the nuclear energy research initiative neri which provides grants for research on innovative nuclear energy technologies according to the doe budget justification neri projects will instead be pursued at the discretion of individual nuclear rd programs neri received an appropriation of 25 million for fy2005 new funding also was not requested for the nuclear energy plant optimization program nepo which received 25 million in fy2005 nepo supports cost shared research by the nuclear power industry on ways to improve the productivity of existing nuclear plants the house agreed to eliminate the funding for both programs the senate bill also provided separate funding for neri and nepo but it allocated specific funding for neri projects within other nuclear energy programs the programs are not specifically mentioned in the conference report fossil energy research development and demonstration the bush administrations fy2006 budget request of 4915 million for fossil energy research and development was 141 less than the amount enacted for fy2005 5719 million and 254 less than the enacted amount for fy2004 659 million major funding categories and amounts included coal and other power systems 3510 million natural gas technologies 100 million oil technology 100 million and program direction and management support 980 million the conference agreement supported funding fossil energy programs at 598 million 45 greater than fy2005 and 22 more than the administrations request funding was higher in all major funding categories coal and other power systems 380 million natural gas technologies 33 million oil technology 32 million and program direction and management support 107 million the use of prior year balances 20 million in the house and senate reports was rescinded by the conference agreement doe proposed to terminate both the natural gas and oil technology programs based on program assessment rating tool review which rated both programs ineffective congressional support of natural gas and oil technology programs has been significantly higher than the bush administrations request in previous years the house would direct the administration to report to the house and senate appropriation committees on strategic plan that will better articulate its investment strategy and the successes of the natural gas and petroleum technology programs the conference agreement does not support the termination of either program the administration requested 68 million for its clean coal power initiative ccpi which included 18 million for futuregen project to demonstrate co production of electricity and hydrogen from coal with emissions according to does budget justification ccpi is costshared program between the government and industry to rapidly demonstrate emerging technologies in coalbased power generation and to accelerate their commercialization nearly 400 million has been appropriated since fy2002 ccpi is along the lines of the clean coal technology program cctp which began in the late 1980s it has completed most of its projects crs22 and has been subject to rescissions and deferrals since the mid1990s cctp eventually is to be phased out the conference supported funding ccpi and futuregen at the levels requested by the administration however while both agree that there is an unused previously appropriated balance of 257 million from the clean coal technology program the administration requested to rescind the money and incorporate the funds into the fossil fuel account for futuregen activities as an advanced appropriation to be used in fy2007 and beyond instead the conference agreement supports deferring the 257 million while acknowledging that the funds will be used for the futuregen program in fiscal years 2007 and beyond see futuregen funding schedule in table 10 below the conference report also acknowledges that the administrations request for ccpi was woefully short of its stated 200 million annual commitment the senate version would have supported 100 million for ccpi programs in fy2006 the administrations goal was to increase coal rd other than ccpi and futuregen by 59 to 218 million whereas nearly all other fossil fuel programs were slated to be cut within the coal rd the administration requested 564 million for gasification research in fy2006 the conference funded coal rd other than ccpi and future gen at 250 million and supported the administrations request for gasification research this level of increase indicates greater commitment by the administration and congress to the integrated gasification combined cycle igcc technology aimed at commercialization there is sustained investment in igcc because of its potential benefits from reduced nox sox mercury and fine particulate matter emissions moreover lower co2 emissions through greater plant efficiencies andor potential sequestration could be substantial funding for does carbon sequestration program will increase significantly from 454 million in fy2005 to 67 million in fy2006 nearly the same level as the administrations request the house would have funded the carbon sequestration program at 50 million whereas the senate bill supported the carbon sequestration program at 74 million the senate bill included spending for plant and equipment 23 million primarily for infrastructure improvements at the national energy technology lab and congressionally directed projects 251 million neither included in the housepassed bill or the administration request the conference agreement supported 20 million for plant and equipment in its report on the fy2005 funding bill the house appropriations committee expressed disappointment with the emphasis of the administrations request on funding new longterm energy research efforts such as futuregen at the expense of ongoing energy programs that could yield energy savings and emissions reductions over the next decade the committee recommended restoring many of the proposed reductions for research to improve fossil energy technologies contending that it would be fiscally irresponsible to discontinue research in which major investments have been made before that research is concluded crs23 table 10 futuregen funding profile millions other cash fy doe direct total flows 20042005 27 2 11 2006 18 7 25 2007 50 25 75 2008 100 44 144 2009 89

research initiative march 2004 strategic petroleum reserve the strategic petroleum reserve spr authorized by the energy policy and conservation act pl 94163 in late 1975 consists of caverns formed out of naturally occurring salt domes in louisiana and texas in which roughly 685 million barrels of crude oil are stored5 the purpose of the spr is to provide an emergency source of crude oil which may be tapped in the event of presidential finding that an interruption in oil supply or an interruption threatening adverse economic effects warrants drawdown from the reserve northeast heating oil reserve nhor was established during the clinton administration nhor houses 2 million barrels of home heating oil in aboveground facilities in connecticut new jersey and rhode island in midnovember 2001 president bush ordered that the spr be filled to capacity then 700 million barrels using royaltyinkind rik oil this is oil turned over to the federal government as payment for production from federal leases acquiring oil for the spr by rik avoids the necessity for congress to make outlays to finance direct purchase of oil however it also means loss of revenues to the treasury in so far as the royalties are paid in wet barrels rather than in cash deliveries of rik oil began in the spring of 2002 and ended in august 2005 when the spr reached 700 million barrels6 some policymakers objected to rik fill arguing that this oil should have instead be released to tight markets the administration argued that the volumes involved varying between 65000200000 barrels per day of deliveries to the spr were too small to have any discernible effect on crude and product prices the current program costs for the spr are almost exclusively dedicated to maintaining spr facilities and keeping the spr in readiness should it be needed 5 in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita modest amounts of spr crude were loaned or sold the borrowed oil will be fully restored by may 2006 and the oil sold was 11 million barrels at the conclusion of these transactions the spr should be restored to roughly 690 million barrels 6 the capacity of the spr is measured at 727 million barrels however the presidents order was issued when the capacity was 700 million barrels and it specified fill to that level crs24 congress agreed to funding level of 1746 million for the program in fy2005 including 49 million for the nhor the administration request for fy2006 for the spr was 1660 million reduction of nearly 4 million from the fy2005 appropriation new money was requested for the nhor in fy2006 owing to the use of prioryear balances of 53 million both the house and senate bills funded the spr at the requested level and this level was adopted by the conferees in their final bill for

areas basic energy sciences highenergy physics biological and environmental research nuclear physics fusion energy sciences and advanced scientific computing research through these programs doe is the thirdlargest federal funder of basic research and the largest federal funder of research in the physical sciences7 for fy2006 doe requested 3463 billion for science decrease of 4 from the fy2005 appropriation of 3600 billion the house provided 3666 billion the senate 3703 billion and the final bill 3633 billion the final figure is 170 million more than the request and an increase of 1 from fy2005 the requested funding for the largest program basic energy sciences was 1146 billion 4 increase above fy2005 construction of the spallation neutron source is expected to be completed in the third quarter of fy2006 so the request for this facility included less funding for construction but for the first time included the cost of operations operations will also begin at four of the five new nanoscale science research centers the fifth is still under construction and is expected to begin operations in fy2008 some have expressed concern that operations funding for these facilities will result in reduced grant funding for other research in the basic energy sciences program the house provided an increase of 27 million more than the request and the senate provided an increase of 95 million but the final bill provided the requested amount the request for fusion energy sciences was 291 million 6 increase in 2003 the united states rejoined negotiations on construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor iter fusion facility whose other participants include china the european union japan russia and south korea the requested fy2006 budget for fusion energy sciences included 50 million related to iter and estimated that the total us share of the project will be 11 billion through fy2013 when the fy2006 budget was released the international partners remained split on where iter should be located decision that was originally expected in november 2003 agreement on site in france was officially announced on june 28 2005 which was after the house passed hr 2419 and after the senate committee reported it but three days before the bill was passed by the senate 7 based on 2004 data from tables c29 and c22 of national science foundation division of science resources statistics federal funds for research and development fiscal years 2002 2003 and 2004 nsf 05307 february 2005 crs25 the house provided an increase of 6 million over the request and directed that this 6 million plus 29 million of the funding requested for iter should be devoted to usbased fusion research as in previous years the house report directed doe to fund iter out of additional resources not through reductions in the domestic program and expressed its preparedness to eliminate future us funding for iter if this is not done floor amendment by representative boehlert chairman of the house science committee added provision sec 504 that would have delayed an international agreement on us funding for iter until march 1 2006 the senate bill included the requested amount for fusion energy sciences but reduced iter funding by 28 million to pay for increased facility operating time see below the conference agreement provided the requested amount included language similar to that of the house report regarding funding iter out of additional resources and called for study of the program by the government accountability office but it did not include the language of the boehlert amendment during house debate on the conference report representative boehlert stated i will do everything in my power to kill the iter project if there is not an agreement by march that the domestic fusion program has to be scaled back to pay for iter all four of the other office of science programs were reduced in the fy2006 request the request for highenergy physics was 714 million down 3 biological and environmental research was 456 million down 22 nuclear physics was 371 million down 8 advanced scientific computing research was 207 million down 11 most of the decrease for biological and environmental research corresponded to the completion of congressionally directed onetime projects the house restored highenergy physics to its fy2005 level of 736 million increased biological and environmental research by 70 million including 35 million for congressionally directed university and hospital earmarks restored nuclear physics to 408 million slightly above the fy2005 level and increased advanced scientific computing research by 39 million to support development of leadershipclass supercomputer the senate bill increased highenergy physics and nuclear physics by 3 million and 49 million respectively to increase facility operating time see below increased biological and environmental research by 48 million mostly to accelerate the genomes to life program total of 51 million for 48 congressionally directed projects would come from within available funds and provided the requested amount for advanced scientific computing research the conference agreement provided 724 million for highenergy physics 586 million for biological and environmental research including 130 million for 161 congressionally directed projects which superseded the ones in the house and senate reports 371 million for nuclear physics and 237 million for advanced scientific computing research the fy2005 appropriations conference report hrept 108792 encouraged doe to request sufficient funds for the office of science in fy2006 to operate user facilities for as much time as possible for the facilities funded by four of the six science programs the fy2006 budget request included reduction in operating hours due to funding limitations the major facilities of the basic energy sciences program will be capable of operating for users for total of 32200 hours in fy2006 but the budget request stated that only total of 28800 hours are scheduled the tevatron complex at fermilab funded by the highenergy physics program will be capable of operating for 4800 hours but is scheduled for only 4560 the four crs26 facilities of the nuclear physics program will be capable of operating for total of 22765 hours but are scheduled for only total of 14695 the three fusion energy sciences facilities will be capable of operating for total of 3000 hours but are scheduled for only 680 in each of these cases the difference between optimal hours and scheduled hours was less in fy2005 than was requested in the fy2006 budget the house increases for basic energy sciences fusion energy sciences and nuclear physics included 20 million 14 million and 32 million respectively for maintaining facility operating time at fy2005 levels the senate bill provided total of 100 million to restore operating time to optimal levels 20 million in basic energy sciences 28 million in fusion energy sciences 49 million in nuclear physics and 3 million in highenergy physics the conference agreement did not mention the operating time issue nuclear waste disposal does office of civilian radioactive waste management ocrwm is responsible for developing nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain nevada for disposal of nuclear reactor spent fuel and defense related highlevel radioactive waste ocrwms funding comes from two appropriations accounts the nuclear waste disposal account for which doe requested 300 million and defense nuclear waste disposal with request of 3514 million appropriations under the nuclear waste disposal account come from the nuclear waste fund which holds disposal fees paid by nuclear utilities ocrwms total budget request of 6514 million was about 14 above the fy2005 level but only about half the amount that the fy2005 budget justification said would have been needed to open the yucca mountain repository by does previous goal of 2010 upon releasing the budget request program officials announced that the repositorys opening would be delayed at least two years and that yucca mountain license application to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc would be delayed as well because of those delays the house raised the waste programs funding by 10 million to 6614 million so that ocrwm could begin moving spent fuel from nuclear reactor sites to centralized interim storage at one or more doe sites within fy2006 according to the house appropriations committee report possible sites named by the committee include hanford wa idaho national laboratory and savannah river sc members from states named as potential nuclear waste storage sites raised concerns about the report language during the floor debate representative hobson chairman of the subcommittee on energy and water development assured representative otter that the report language would not affect doe agreement with the state of idaho prohibiting commercial spent fuel storage at idaho national laboratory the chairman also entered into colloquy with representative spratt to clarify that the report language would not modify provisions in the nuclear waste policy act that limit doe interim storage facilities the senate bill provided 300 million under nuclear waste disposal and 277 million under defense nuclear waste disposal for total of 577 million nearly the same as the previous two fiscal years the senate panels report did not include crs27 any language on interim storage of spent fuel and several senators reportedly criticized the house report language during committee markup8 the conference agreement provides 500 million for nuclear waste disposal 150 million from the nuclear waste fund and 350 million from the defense nuclear waste disposal account of the defense waste funding 50 million is provided for doe to develop spent nuclear fuel recycling plan in conjunction with the technology development plan required under the advanced fuel cycle initiative the detailed program plan is to be submitted by march 31 2006 and site selection competition for an integrated reprocessing facility is to begin by june 30 2006 reprocessing site is to be selected in fy2007 and construction to begin in fy2010 the site competition should not be limited to doe sites but should be open to wide range of other possible federal and nonfederal sites on strictly voluntary basis according to the conference report applicants for reprocessing facility can receive up to 5 million per site up to total of 20 million to prepare detailed proposals for fy2005 the administrations budget request for the nuclear waste program had assumed that congress would enact legislation to offset most of the programs spending with revenue from the waste fees paid by nuclear power plants as result the fy2005 net appropriation request was only 131 million significantly less than the previous years appropriation however congress did not approve the funding offset proposal and congressional appropriators then had to work to find additional appropriations for the nuclear waste program to prevent large budget cut for fy2006 the administration again proposed that nuclear waste funding be offset by fees but the budget request did not assume the proposal would be enacted and therefore included full funding through appropriations the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 nwpa pl 97425 as amended names yucca mountain as the sole candidate site for national geologic repository congress passed an approval resolution in july 2000 hjres 87 pl 107200 that authorized the yucca mountain project to proceed to the licensing phase if the repository opened in 2012 which currently appears unlikely doe would begin taking waste from plant sites nearly 15 years later than the nuclear waste policy act deadline of january 31 1998 nuclear utilities and state utility regulators upset over does failure to meet the 1998 disposal deadline have won two federal court decisions upholding the departments obligation to meet the deadline and to compensate utilities for any resulting damages utilities have also won several cases in the us court of federal claims the nations largest nuclear utility exelon corporation reached breachofcontract settlement with the federal government in august 2004 that may total 600 million if doe does not begin taking spent fuel before 2015 further delays in the yucca mountain program could result from july 2004 court decision that overturned key aspect of the environmental protection agencys epas regulations for the repository threejudge panel of the us court of 8 hiruo elaine senate fy06 bill report takes technical view of waste management nuclearfuel june 20 2005 p 1 crs28 appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled that epas 10000year compliance period was too short but it rejected several other challenges to the standards more controversy erupted in march 2005 with the release of email messages from yucca mountain scientists that indicated that some of their data and documentation may have been fabricated the house appropriations committee report cited all those problems as reasons for establishing doe interim storage program for more information see crs report rl33461 civilian nuclear waste disposal by mark holt nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship congress established

stockpile such as monitoring their condition maintaining them through repairs refurbishment life extension and modifications rd in support of specific warheads and dismantlement the fy2006 dsw request would support life extension programs for three nuclear warheads b61 gravity bomb w76 for trident i and ii submarinelaunched ballistic missiles and w80 for cruise missiles it would fund surveillance and maintenance for nine warhead types some work on retired warheads and some management and technology work not linked to specific warhead the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act reduced dsw to 13461 million from 14064 million requested probably the most noticed provisions were elimination of the 276 million request for the robust nuclear earth penetrator rnep and transfer of the 90 million request for the advanced concepts initiative aci to new program reliable replacement warhead congress debated rnep and aci in the fy2004 and fy2005 budget cycles in addition the senate debated rnep in the fy2006 budget cycle rnep is study of the cost and feasibility of modifying existing nuclear bombs to enable them to penetrate into the ground before detonating thereby magnifying their effect on buried target see crs report rl32130 nuclear weapon initiatives lowyield rd advanced concepts earth penetrators test readiness by jonathan medalia and crs report rl32347 bunker busters robust nuclear earth penetrator issues fy2005 and fy2006 by jonathan medalia rneps supporters argue that it is needed to attack hard and deeply buried targets such as crs30 leadership bunkers or chemical weapons production facilities in countries of concern thereby deterring or defeating such nations critics reply that rnep would lower the threshold for use of nuclear weapons and prompt other nations to develop nuclear weapons to deter us attack congressional concern about rnep arose in part because the fy2005 nnsa request projected 4847 million for the program for fy2005fy2009 while rnep was study this figure was provided in response to congressional requirement that fiveyear costs be included in the budget request the figure represented projection based on experience with other programs doe indicated it was not possible to provide more precise number until the cost and feasibility study was completed further the figure projected the cost based as if the program were to progress beyond study into development although moving the program beyond the study stage would have required an administration decision and congressional approval for fy2006 nnsa requests 40 million for the rnep study projects another 140 million for fy2007 and then projects further funds the department of defense dod budget includes an additional 45 million for rnep for fy2006 mainly for linking rnep to the b2 bomber the energy and water bill does not deal with dod programs so it does not address dods rnep request nnsa funds would be used to complete the study hr 2419 as passed by the house deletes all nnsa funds for rnep the bill as reported by the senate appropriations committee recommends 40 million on june 30 the senate rejected an amendment by senator feinstein to delete all rnep funds from the energy and water bill 4353 and subsequently passed the bill 923 in late october while the energy and water conference was underway nnsa dropped its request for rnep funding in response the conference report provides funds for that program aci was controversial in the fy2005 budget cycle critics claimed that its purpose was to develop lowyield mininuke that would make nuclear weapons more usable supporters responded that nnsa was not working on mininuke and that aci would help develop and maintain weapons design expertise the administration requested 90 million for aci for fy2005 the omnibus bill provided funds for aci instead the conference report stated that the same amount is made available for the reliable replacement warhead rrw program to improve the reliability longevity and certifiability of existing weapons and their components the administration requested funds for aci for fy2006 nnsa requested 94 million for rrw for fy2006 it stated that the program is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing reliable replacement components that are producible and certifiable for the existing stockpile and to initially provide replacement pits firststage cores that can be certified without underground tests it projected these amounts fy2007 148 million fy2008 144 million fy2009 296 million and fy2010 290 million the outyear figures simply transfer the funds planned for aci to rrw the short time less than two months between enactment of the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act and the submission of the fy2006 budget request did not allow preparation of detailed fiveyear budget for rrw hr 2419 as passed by the house included 250 million for rrw the bill as passed by the senate included 254 million the conference bill provides 250 million see crs report rl32929 nuclear weapons the reliable replacement warhead program by jonathan medalia crs31 although rrw is small program in relation to the total nnsa budget the house appropriations committee in its report views it as enabling many large changes transitioning the nuclear weapons complex from large expensive cold war relic into smaller more efficient modern complex allowing longterm savings by phasing out the multiple redundant cold war warhead designs that require maintaining multiple obsolete production technologies obviating any reason to move to provocative 18month test readiness posture by increasing warhead reliability and reducing the need to test permitting reduction in advanced simulation and computing funds by redirecting them to current warhead maintenance programs pending initiation of rrw and supporting other changes and budget decisions as well the senate appropriations committees report srept 10984 states that the recommended funding increase for rrw is to accelerate the planning development and design for comprehensive rrw strategy that improves the reliability longevity and certifiability of existing weapons and their components the conference report emphasizes that rrw design work must stay within the military requirements of the existing deployed stockpile and any design must stay within the design parameters validated by past nuclear tests other goals that the conference report sets for rrw are improving manufacturing practices reducing cost and increasing performance margins to support reduction in stockpile size in other actions on dsw hr 2419 as passed by the house includes sustainable stockpile initiative that would include an rrw implementation plan nuclear weapons complex reconfiguration consolidation of fissile material that might be used in weapons and accelerated warhead dismantlement the bill raises funding for dismantlement by 750 million to 1103 million the bill as passed by the senate provides 150 million for dismantlement the conference bill provides 600 million for dismantlement under dsw campaigns these are multiyear multifunctional efforts that provide specialized scientific knowledge and technical support to the directed stockpile work on the nuclear weapons stockpile for fy2006 there are six campaigns each of which has multiple components science engineering inertial confinement fusion and high yield advanced simulation and computing pit manufacturing and certification and readiness the fy2005 omnibus bill contained 23048 million for campaigns vs 23938 million requested conferees expressed concern over slip in the target date from 2010 to 2014 for achieving ignition with the national ignition facility nif see below and directed several studies on this topic conferees also focused on the pit manufacturing and certification campaign which is working to produce pits the fissile core of the primary stage of nuclear weapons and to certify them for use in the stockpile congress provided 1309 million vs 1320 million requested for w88 pit manufacturing congress reduced funds for the modern pit facility mpf proposed manufacturing facility to become operational around 2021 from 298 million requested to 69 million and barred use of funds to select construction site for mpf in fy2005 for fy2006 nnsa requested 20804 million for campaigns vs 23048 million appropriated for fy2005 many items within campaigns have significance for policy decisions as one example the science campaigns goals include improving the ability to assess warhead performance without nuclear testing crs32 improving readiness to conduct tests should the need arise and maintaining the scientific infrastructure of the nuclear weapons laboratories hr 2419 as passed by the house reduces funds for campaigns the bill as passed by the senate provides slight net increase the conference bill contains 21446 million hr 2419 as passed by the house eliminates mpf funds until capacity requirements tied to the longterm stockpile size are determined and until the long term strategy for the physical infrastructure of the weapons complex has incorporated the reliable replacement warhead strategy the bill as passed by the senate provides the amount requested for mpf 77 million the conference bill provides funds for mpf conferees directed nnsa to focus on improving manufacturing capability at facility ta55 at alamos national laboratory currently used to produce pits on small scale the test readiness posture the time between presidential order to resume testing and the conduct of the test has been controversial in fy2004 the defense authorization conference report called for posture of at most 18 months while the energy and water conference report called for nnsa to focus on restoring rigorous test readiness program that is capable of meeting the current 24month requirement before requesting significant additional funds to pursue more aggressive goal of an 18month readiness posture the fy2005 omnibus conference report did not address the topic and for fy2006 nnsa requested 250 million for test readiness part of the science campaign to continue improving the state of readiness to reach an 18month testreadiness posture in fy2006 hr 2419 as passed by the house reduces test readiness from 250 million to 150 million the committee continues to oppose the 18month readiness posture and added rrw to its rationale for that position the bill as passed by the senate provides 250 million for test readiness the conference bill provides 200 million for test readiness reduction of 50 million at the same time it increases by 50 million the funds for subcritical experiments experiments using high explosives and fissile material configured so as not to support nuclear chain reaction which are held only at nevada test site the engineering campaign includes the enhanced surveillance program esp for which nnsa requests 962 million for fy2006 this program seeks to develop predictive capabilities for early identification and assessment of stockpile aging concerns to give nnsa firm basis for determining when systems must be refurbished it is of interest to congress because it is conducting experiments to determine the service life of pits based on plutonium aging characteristics the result will bear on decision to build mpf hr 2419 as passed by the house reduces esp to 760 million the bill as passed by the senate provides 1112 million for esp funding increases will enable the development and implementation of these new surveillance techniques and improving their readiness for rrw and the sustainable stockpile the conference bill provides 1002 million for esp according to nnsa the inertial confinement fusion and high yield campaign is to develop laboratory capabilities to create and measure extreme conditions approaching those in nuclear explosion and conduct weaponsrelated research in these environments key part of this campaign is the national ignition facility nif partly completed facility at lawrence livermore national laboratory that is already the worlds most powerful laser for fy2006 nnsa requests 1419 million for nif construction and hr 2419 as passed by the house contains that crs33 sum the senate appropriations committee notes that the planned fiveyear budget projection for weapons activities in the fy2006 request is reduced by 30 billion compared to the fy2005 request and directs that funds be expended on nif construction in order to focus on supporting comprehensive stewardship program the conference bill provides the requested amount for nif construction readiness in technical base and facilities rtbf this program provides infrastructure and operations at the nuclear weapons complex sites the fy2005 omnibus bill provided 16571 million for rtbf vs 14745 million requested rtbf has six subprograms by far the largest is operations of facilities 11126 million appropriated for fy2005 11608 million requested for fy2006 others include program readiness which supports activities occurring at multiple sites or in multiple programs 1054 million appropriated for fy2005 1057 million requested for fy2006 and material recycle and recovery which recovers plutonium enriched uranium and tritium from weapons production and disassembly 863 million appropriated for fy2005 727 million requested for fy2006 construction is separate category within rtbf the fy2005 appropriation was 2751 million and the fy2006 request is 2430 million hr 2419 as passed by the house reduces rtbf to 16109 million from an fy2006 request of 16314 million it increases operations of facilities by 440 million adding funds to maintain the y12 and pantex plants the bill funds most other rtbf elements at the level requested key exception was eliminating 550 million requested for chemistry and metallurgy research facility replacement cmrr at alamos to delay construction until doe determines the longterm plan for developing the responsive infrastructure required to maintain the nations existing nuclear stockpile and support replacement production anticipated for the rrw initiative the bill as passed by the senate provides 16963 million for rtbf the largest change is an increase of 397 million in operations of facilities the senate bill provides 650 million for cmrr the conference bill provides 16479 million for rtbf including 550 million for cmrr other programs weapons activities includes four smaller programs in addition to dsw campaigns and rtbf secure transportation asset provides for the transport of nuclear weapons components and materials safely and securely it includes special vehicles used for this purpose communications and other supporting infrastructure and threat response the fy2005 appropriation was 1997 million and the fy2006 request is 2121 million hr 2419 as passed by the house and by the senate provides the amount requested as does the conference bill nuclear weapons incident response provides for use of doe assets to manage and respond to nuclear or radiological emergency within doe in the united states or abroad the fy2005 appropriation was 984 million and the fy2006 request is 1188 million hr 2419 as passed by the house and by the senate provides the amount requested as does the conference bill crs34 facilities and infrastructure recapitalization program provides for deferred maintenance and infrastructure improvements for the nuclear weapons complex in contrast rtbf ensures that facilities necessary for immediate programmatic workload activities are maintained sufficiently according to nnsa the fy2005 appropriation was 3137 million and the fy2006 request is 2835 million hr 2419 as passed by the house provides 2505 million the bill as passed by the senate provides 2618 million the conference bill provides 1509 million with explanation of the reduction safeguards and security provides operations and maintenance funds for physical and cyber security and related construction to protect nnsa personnel and assets from terrorist and other threats safeguards and security is major concern for nnsa ambassador linton brooks administrator of nnsa stated to the senate armed services committee on april 4 2005 we must now consider the distinct possibility of wellarmed and competent terrorist suicide teams seeking to gain access to warhead in order to detonate it in place this has driven our site security posture from one of containment and recovery of stolen warheads to one of denial of any access to warheads this change has dramatically increased security costs for gates guns guards at our nuclear weapons sites the fy2005 appropriation was 7516 million the fy2006 request was 7405 million hr 2419 as passed by the house provided 8255 million the bill as passed by the senate provided the requested amount and the conference bill provides 8055 million nonproliferation and national security programs does nonproliferation and national security programs provide technical capabilities to support us efforts to prevent detect and counter the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide these nonproliferation and national security programs are included in the national nuclear security administration nnsa funding for these programs in fy2005 was 1422 billion for fy2006 the administration requested 1637 billion hr 2419 as passed by the house contained 1501 billion the senate version of hr 2419 would have appropriated 1729 billion pl 109103 appropriated 1631 billion in may 2004 doe consolidated number of programs those aimed at

million in the administrations fy2006 request the housepassed hr 2419 raised the level to 3352 million the senate bill included 3102 million the final bill appropriated 3270 million nonproliferation and international security programs would have received 802 million in the request compared with 913 million in fy2005 the house bill included 758 million the senate bill 900 million the final bill appropriated 750 million these programs include international safeguards export controls and treaties and agreements major part of funding for the new gtri came from the nonproliferation and international security programs international materials protection control and accounting mpca which is concerned with reducing the threat posed by unsecured russian weapons and weaponsusable material would have received 3434 million under the presidents request compared to 2947 million appropriated for fy2005 hr 2419 as passed by the house included 4284 million the senate bill would have appropriated 3434 million p l 109103 funds mpca at 4220 million two programs in the former soviet union initiatives for proliferation prevention ipp and the nuclear cities initiatives nci were combined for fy2005 into single program called russian transition initiative aimed at finding nonweapons employment for roughly 35000 underemployed nuclear scientists from crs36 the former soviet weapons complex the fy2005 appropriation for the program was 407 million for fy2006 379 million was requested doe renamed the program global initiatives for proliferation prevention to reflect expansion of the work to include retraining and redirection of scientists and technicians from other than the former soviet union the house appropriations committee did not agree with the name change and reduced funding to 303 million the senate appropriations committee went along with the name change raised funding to 509 million and urged doe to continue the program in russia and expand it beyond the former soviet union the conference bill appropriated 400 million and retained the former name requested funding for the fissile materials disposition program for fy2006 was 6531 million compared with 6131 million in appropriated for fy2005 the programs goal is disposal of us surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors including construction of facility to convert the plutonium to reactor fuel at savannah river sc and similar program in russia the house appropriations committee cut funding for the savannah river facility sharply citing delays in agreement with russia over the program total funding for fissile materials disposition in hr 2419 as passed by the house would have been 3017 million the senate version of the bill would have funded the program at the requested 6531 million level pl 109103 appropriated 4735 million environmental management and cleanup the environmental management program is the largest single function within doe in terms of funding representing approximately onethird of the departments total budget the primary purpose of the program is to manage radioactive and hazardous wastes and to remediate contamination from such wastes at former nuclear weapons sites across the country the program also addresses waste management and remediation at sites where the federal government conducted civilian nuclear energy research as such does environmental management program is the largest waste management and environmental cleanup program throughout the federal government with an annual budget of around 7 billion in recent years in comparison annual funding for the cleanup of contamination at department of defense sites has been less than 2 billion in recent years and annual funding for the environmental protection agencys cleanup of the nations most hazardous private sector sites under the superfund program has been around 125 billion as signed into law the conference agreement on hr 2419 provides total of 666 billion in fy2006 for does environmental management program the fy2006 appropriation is 627 million less than the 728 billion enacted for fy2005 although funding is reduced relative to fy2005 the conference amount is 151 million more than the administrations request of 651 billion defense sites have traditionally received most of the funding within the environmental management program of the amount provided for fy2006 619 billion is allocated to new defense environmental cleanup account 353 million to new nondefense environmental cleanup account and 562 million to the existing uranium enrichment decontamination and decommissioning dd fund although the total appropriation for these three accounts is 711 billion this amount is offset by 451 million from the federal contribution to the uranium enrichment dd fund provided within the defense environmental cleanup account yielding total crs37 fy2006 program appropriation of 666 billion see the table below for appropriations by account as proposed by the house and the senate the conference agreement merges certain accounts that fund the environmental management program to form the new defense and nondefense accounts noted above the accounts for defense site acceleration completion and defense environmental services are merged into one defense environmental cleanup account to provide single source of funding for cleanup at former nuclear weapons sites most of the 627 million reduction relative to fy2005 is within this new account discussed below the accounts for non defense site acceleration completion and nondefense environmental services are merged into one nondefense environmental cleanup account to provide single source of funding for the cleanup of civilian nuclear energy research sites as in past years the conference agreement continues separate account for the uranium enrichment dd fund which supports the cleanup of uranium enrichment plants and uranium and thorium processing sites the administration had requested funding for fy2006 under the existing account structure and did not propose any accounting changes similar to that in the conference agreement most of the 627 million reduction below the fy2005 appropriation is within the defense environmental cleanup account as noted in the table below overall funding for cleanup at four major sites is reduced including the savannah river site in south carolina the idaho national laboratory and the hanford site in the state of washington the decline in funding for sites scheduled for closure in 2006 is mostly due to the completion of physical cleanup at rocky flats9 the conference report indicates that portion of the reduction at the savannah river site is because of unresolved seismic issues that have delayed construction of salt waste processing facility to treat highlevel radioactive waste removed from underground storage tanks the conference report also reduces prior year balances for this project by 20 million because of these construction delays table 14 environmental management program appropriations millions fy2006 environmental management fy2005 fy2006 pl program accounts

environmental management 72836 65055 66568 dd decontamination and decommissioning b the reduction in the administrations request for this activity was due to the proposed transfer of seven sites from does environmental management program to nnsa the conferees rejected the administrations proposal and reinstated the funding for these sites within does environmental management program however the conferees did approve the administrations proposal to fund the disposal of newly generated waste at two sites within the nnsas accounts c traditionally the annual federal payment to the uranium dd fund within the defense environmental cleanup account is treated as an offset with respect to the total environmental management program funding level the conference report attributes portion of the decrease at the hanford site to delays in construction of the waste treatment plant wtp the purpose of this facility is to vitrify highlevel radioactive waste removed from underground storage tanks vitrification involves the solidification of this waste and encasing it in glass logs for permanent storage in geologic repository such as yucca mountain although fy2006 funding for the wtp is less than appropriated for fy2005 as noted in the table above the conference report indicates that 98 million remains available from fy2005 that could be used in fy2006 in reference to construction delays the conferees commented that doe needs better control and oversight of the scope cost and schedule of this project and directed doe to report to the appropriations committees by december 1 2005 on the actions taken to rectify the management failures of this project and to report quarterly on the status of this project beginning in 2006 crs39 regarding hanford the conferees also noted their concern about does efforts to prevent contaminants from migrating through groundwater into the columbia river which is source for drinking water and agricultural irrigation across the pacific northwest doe reports that more than 270 billion gallons of groundwater covering an underground area of over 80 square miles at hanford is contaminated at levels that exceed federal drinking water standards members of congress states and communities have expressed ongoing concern regarding the risk to human health and the environment posed by the migration of this contamination into the river the conferees noted that current technology used in several remedies is not performing satisfactorily and there is lack of new technologies to address contamination issues in response to this concern the conference agreement provides 10 million for assessing the migration of groundwater contamination into the columbia river and for introducing new technologies to protect water quality the conferees did not approve does proposed transfer of seven sites within the environmental management program to the national nuclear security administration nnsa10 instead the conferees increased funding above the request to continue support for these responsibilities within the existing programmatic structure however as the administration proposed the conference agreement does not provide funding within the environmental management program for the continued disposal of waste at lawrence livermore national laboratory in california and at the y12 site in tennessee which is newly generated as result of activities conducted by the nnsa rather funding for the disposal of newly generated waste at these two sites is provided in the nnsas accounts cleanup status in addition to debate over annual appropriations there have been many longstanding issues associated with does environmental management program much attention has focused on the resources and time needed to clean up environmental contamination and to manage and dispose of radioactive and other hazardous wastes to date there are 114 geographic sites within the environmental management program including the seven sites that doe proposed for transfer to the nnsa which were contaminated from nuclear weapons production or civilian nuclear energy research according to doe all response actions were complete at 76 of these sites as of the end of fy2003 congress had appropriated approximately 70 billion through fy2003 for cleanup and site closure since the environmental management program was established in fy1989 doe expects cleanup to be complete at three additional sites by the end of fy2005 and at seven additional sites by the end of cy2006 yielding total of 86 of the 114 sites with cleanup complete efforts to accelerate cleanup although cleanup is projected to be complete at many of the remaining sites within decade cleanup at the most contaminated sites is not expected to be complete until 2035 does most recent estimate of future costs to complete its planned waste disposal and cleanup activities 10 these sites include 1 nevada test site 2 sandia national laboratory 3 separation process research unit 4 kansas city plant 5 lawrence livermore national laboratory livermore site 6 lawrence livermore laboratory site 300 and 7 pantex in addition operation of the lowlevel waste disposal site at the nevada test site and newly generated waste management at lawrence livermore national laboratory and the y12 site were also proposed for transfer from the environmental management program to the national nuclear security administration within doe crs40 is 95 billion from fy2004 through final site closure in 2035 this is substantially lower estimate than in past years as result of cost and time savings doe expects from its cleanup reform initiative doe launched this initiative in fy2003 and signed letters of intent with the environmental protection agency and the states to accelerate cleanup at its major sites doe also prepared performance management plans for many of its sites which outlined how cleanup would be accelerated and costs reduced in developing its plans to accelerate cleanup doe established baselines for the completion of its planned waste disposal and remedial actions reflecting defined scope costs and schedules according to doe its goals of faster and less costly cleanup are being accomplished through awarding competitive contracts renegotiating existing contracts with performancebased incentives working with regulators on more efficient technical and regulatory approaches deploying innovative technologies and coordinating with stakeholders and regulators to better define end states ie the intended condition or use of each site once cleanup is complete however the reductions in costs and time frames resulting from does planned acceleration of cleanup are merely estimates actual costs and time frames could differ depending on numerous factors such as the regulatory approval of actions that doe wishes to take in the future and the adequacy of these actions to protect human health and the environment over the long term questions have been raised as to how doe would accomplish its goals of faster and less costly cleanup without weakening environmental protection some have contended that more contamination may be left on site rather than removed because of the substantial amount of time required for certain types of radioactivity to decay arguments have been raised that contamination left in place may migrate in unexpected ways over the long term and result in pathways of exposure that could not have been predicted when the remedy was originally selected others counter that completely removing radioactive contamination from all sites to permit unrestricted future land use and eliminate all future pathways of exposure would not be economically feasible and in some cases would be beyond the capabilities of current cleanup technologies the conferees noted their continued interest in does cleanup acceleration efforts specifically whether doe is meeting its cleanup goals at sites scheduled for completion by 2006 2012 and 2035 respectively the conferees requested that doe submit milestone report twice year to the house and senate appropriations committees by march 1 and september 1 of each year milestones typically are individual cleanup actions to be completed by specific date which doe epa and the states have agreed would fulfill applicable regulatory requirements as described by the conferees this new report would track accelerated cleanup milestones at individual sites indicate whether milestones are being met and include estimates of annual funding needs and total lifecycle costs to complete cleanup the house appropriations committee had requested similar milestone report in its report on hr 2419 the senate appropriations committee did not request such report but commented that doe has succeeded in making significant progress in accelerating cleanup and encouraged doe to continue to keep the remaining sites on track in addition to language in committee reports on the fy2006 appropriations bills members also expressed concern about cleanup progress at hearing held by the crs41 senate energy and natural resources committee on november 15 2005 although members complimented doe for its efforts to accelerate cleanup at certain sites such as rocky flats they also commented that improvements could be made in increasing the pace of cleanup and lowering costs at other sites such as hanford disposal of tank wastes one of the more controversial issues regarding does cleanup acceleration initiative has been how to dispose of radioactive and chemical wastes stored in underground tanks at the hanford site the savannah river site and the idaho national laboratory for fy2005 doe requested 350 million for highlevel waste proposal account to prepare for the classification and treatment of some of the tank wastes as incidental to reprocessing and to eventually dispose of it as lowlevel waste or transuranic waste of the 350 million request 249 million would have been for operating expenses mostly associated with removal of the liquid tank waste the remaining 101 million would have been for the construction of three facilities to treat the liquid waste that would be removed from the storage tanks and to process it to separate out the highlevel waste for permanent storage the most contentious element of does proposal was to leave some of the waste in the tanks and to dispose of it as lowlevel waste by mixing and immobilizing it with cementlike grout to seal it in place some members of congress states environmental organizations and communities opposed does proposal arguing that none of the tank wastes should be allowed to remain in place among the chief concerns was the possibility that the grout might not mix thoroughly with the residual waste to contain it safely and prevent leaks however others asserted that there would be limited environmental and public health risk benefit to be gained by removing all of the waste from the tanks there also were concerns that removal of all of the waste would be technically difficult pose significant health and safety risk to the workers and be very costly after considerable debate the 108th congress included authority in the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 pl 108375 for doe to classify some of the tank wastes at the savannah river site and the idaho national laboratory as other than highlevel waste and to dispose of some of the tank waste by grouting it in place if certain conditions are met however the authority was not extended to washington state where most of the tank waste is located at the hanford site for further discussion see crs report rs21988 radioactive tank wastes disposal authority in the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 coordinated by david bearden congress did not create separate account for does highlevel waste proposal in fy2005 however with the above authority congress appropriated 292 million out of the former defense site acceleration completion account for activities needed to reclassify and treat tank wastes at the savannah river site and the idaho national laboratory in preparation of grouting the residual wastes in place congress did not allocate any of this funding for tank waste reclassification at hanford as the above authority was not extended to washington state instead other funds were allocated for ongoing tank waste activities at hanford the administrations fy2006 request did not include lineitem for high level waste proposal account as it did for fy2005 although doe planned to close crs42 one tank at the idaho national laboratory in fy2006 with the new waste reclassification authority the administrations request did not specify the amount of funding for the closure of this tank it also did not specify the amount of waste in the tank that may be reclassified and grouted in place the conference agreement did not specify the amount of funding for the closure of this tank either the fy2006 request did specify nearly 84 million for the construction of three waste treatment facilities at the idaho national laboratory and the savannah river site which were included in does original request for the highlevel waste proposal account in fy2005 these facilities would be necessary for doe to process the waste removed from the tanks prior to grouting any residual waste that may remain upon closure the conference agreement provides 45 million for these three construction projects including 92 million for project engineering and design for the sodium bearing waste treatment facility at the idaho national laboratory the same as the administration requested 353 million for project engineering and design for the salt waste processing facility at the savannah river site 31 million more than the administrations request of 43 million and 500000 for construction of the salt waste processing facility at the savannah river site 695 million less than the administrations request of 70 million as noted earlier the significant reduction in funding is due to construction delays as result of unresolved seismic issues office of legacy management related to the environmental management program the conference agreement provides almost 79 million for does office of legacy management about the same as requested and slightly more than the enacted fy2005 amount of 77 million of the fy2006 appropriation 45 million is allocated to former defense sites and related activities and nearly 34 million is allocated to nondefense sites congress provided the funding for doe to establish this office in the energy and water development appropriations act for fy2004 pl 108137 the primary functions of the office of legacy management are to monitor and maintain remedial actions over the longterm once cleanup is complete to ensure protection of human health and the environment and to manage the pensions and benefits of former contractor personnel who performed the cleanup doe previously administered these responsibilities under multiple elements of its environmental management program power marketing administrations does four power marketing

including irrigation flood control recreation or other objectives were the primary purpose of federal projects however these crs43 facilities often generated electricity to meet project needs pmas were established to market the excess power priority for pma power is extended to preference customers which include municipal utilities coops and other public bodies the pmas sell power to these entities at the lowest possible rates consistent with what they describe as sound business practice the pmas are responsible for covering their expenses and for repaying debt and the federal investment in the generating facilities their rates are the focus of considerable discussion and the fy2006 administration request included recommendation that congress raise pma rates to market rates the house rejected this proposal in its energy and water appropriations bill it is not mentioned in the conference report and related legislation has been introduced in the 109th congress for more information see crs report rl32798 power marketing administrations proposals for marketbased rates by kyna powers the fy2006 administration request for the pmas 571 million was sharply down from fy2005 levels 2088 million reduction of 726 this reflects reduction of 1178 million for wapa and 260 million for southwestern net appropriations for southeastern budgeted at roughly 52 million in fy2005 would be eliminated altogether however the administrations request offset these reductions by allowing sepa swpa and wapa to credit portion of their revenues to their appropriation accounts as offsetting collections for program and operating expenses the house and senate both rejected this proposal and instead provide appropriations for these activities the housepassed bill included 2655 million for pmas 567 million increase from fy2005 appropriations this appropriation includes 56 million for sepa 302 for swpa and 2270 million for wapa the senate bill included 2792 million for pmas
