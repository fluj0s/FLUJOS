communication gradient on duplication lecture given on 15 december 1964 aw you just set out to please thats all and just for fun i am pleased whatwhats the date audience december 15th december the 15th ad 14 ad 14 is fading away today i had nothing to talk to you about at all i just wanted to come out and see you its fact its fact been lot of things happen but i forgot my notes and bulletins and laid out level 0 laid out level 0 weve now got level 0 laid out and level i laid out and we know the substances and the materials exist for ii iii iv and vi they also exist for v but were not teaching them i should probably introduce little piece of news here has has become an academy course with very strict curriculum as per hcob i think 8 december now that is good news because it gives sliding scale of courses but it also shoves the pe course back down below 0 which is all right because it is usually taught at that temperature anyway but it leaves the old pe just the same sort of messaround pe it always was and it probably needs some improvement and ive got new design for the thing such as written book that ive already talked to you about and so forth and i will still go ahead and put that out one of the main reasons why the has became an academy course was demand from minutes of national committees that were appointed to decide on pricing all of which have now met and pricing is all finalized and shocking new figures emerged lot of things happened that would be of considerable interest to the franchise auditors the main advance along this course line was brought about by the fact that in the us and some other places theyve apparently had considerable amount of success in having lowprice academy course which was the hqs dont you see and then bringing people on up into the upper course from there well now the hqs is really just the oldtime hpa what actually happenedyou cant teach an oldtime hpa you see dirt cheap and still have it quality course because youve got to have some instructors and youve got to have some people paying attention to this thing so it cant be just thrown away otherwise youre going to ruin every auditor youve got you see so hqs being the oldtime academy course of hcahpa now when we move these on up the line youll remember that in an hpahca you had yourself an awful time with axioms and things of that character all those odd bits and pieces that everybody forgot until the last moment and gave you as extra reading and all those catastrophic occurrences and so forth well i just took up the whole kit and caboodle of those and shoved them into has so theyre studied all by themselves do you see so hqs is little bit of auditing listenstyle with certain definite and finite results and its all this odd bit theory work and so forth it actually done all by itself without the pressure of other things is fairly easy hill to climb but what you found it hard hill to climb is you had to sandwich it in amongst everything else most scientologists when you get right down to it have trouble with just that little section and areajust axioms and definitions and vocabulary and little things like thatand they miss something back there somewhere so im just making it easier to grasp at that level but they wanted course that somebody could buy book and then theyd come in you see and have course that didnt kill them that they could sell for lower amount of money and so on so the has course was all that was left to give them and so there it was and that isnt terribly dear to teach and if its taught pretty well why people come along very well but that still puts pe still there and puts it below there and although i dont think central orgs will really go on teaching lot of pe pe is then relegated to field franchisetype course and im still going ahead and write the book for it and that sort of thing if i get around to it we seem to be going downhill not uphill you see but thats because things are so well trimmed up on the upper realm of this activity when you went all the way to the top you see why then it was very easy to see what lay between it and the bottom now the funnythe very funny thing you stand down in the valley and you cant see the mountains for the trees and theres barns in the road and everything and you dont get very good view and you might think youre in the middle of desert and youre not dont you see you might think youre in the middle of maine and youre in wisconsin you know but you get up to the top of the hill why you can take look back across the countryside and see where all the little ripples and barns and trees and everything else are and thats essentially what has happened here and its pretty easy to say where an auditor has to go and what his road has to be in order to make it through to the top and ive just been dropping things like mad that are nonessential to that particular progress but at the same time theres danger in dropping too much and you get too much dropped out of the lineup and you leave some gap that somebody will fall into so itshence the gradation program is fixed up so that wont happen now some of you are going out of here and youre going to say to yourself well now im going to just do myself up royally and what im going to do is im going to get lot of people and run them on r6 and im going to get them right up there see and boy theyre really going to sail and youre going to get one of these people by the scruff of the neck you know raw meat and youre going to sit them down in the chair and youre going to say all right now lets start on the first end word and thats absence andand which it is and youre going to look at the meter and its just going to sit there and youll chant this end wordill have pity on your colds and sneezes and i wont chant it at youbut youll chant it at this pc see and youll say blank blank and wha wha wha and your meter just sits there and so forth and youre going to say what are you thinking aboutwhat are you thinking about in desperation you know and the pc is going to say well i wasnt you know i seldom do and then youre going to find out that he has perfectly open mind about it and perfectly willing to sit there while you work after you have done this few times why you will say what did ron say about gradient for pcs and then youll get sensible and youll start them right in at the bottom and roll them on up toward the top because theres certain number of things which humanoid is going to have to be able to do to make it and there are certain things which humanoids cant do very well and until you get them so that they can make an orderly forward progress over these particular barriers and bumps why youre not going to be able to do anything with r6 now you see you yourself as you get up toward the top of the barrel and youve been through lots of processing and so on you forget how much auditing youve had and you tend to discount it you know and so forth and you make an immediate comparison between yourself and this guy who is walking down the street bumping into the trees and fire hydrants you know and you say well iall i have to do is take him from where i am see on up only hes not where you are you see and that is the basic error so we want to get him up the line you can rather rapidly were not talking about hundreds of thousands of hours but itll vary from case to ease of course because the various cases are in worse shape than others and this variability will pronounce itself and stick its neck out at the least expected intervals for instance youre going to find out as you are processing along youre going to find this dear nice old lady and yousnap see nothing to it and you run your communication processes and mmmmruns fair gets little tone arm action and you jump her up along the line you get her into duplication well its fair but its not too good and then you get her into ptps which is situated there at level ii and you find out she doesnt have any present time problems and got everything all solved and youll be starting to get little bit desperate about this timeyou suddenly realize this case has gone place and then you suddenly find you had the continuing overt case youve got the one that almost has to be manhandled you know shes got it all solved because all she does is cut somebodys throat anytime she has present time problem or something like this you see you could still be prepared dont you see to be tripped up on your forward progress because of course the unsolvable case unless you can get them aside and corral their mad impulses to commit overts or something of the sort is this person who is just going to be solidly dramatizing some overt you probably never looked at it this way but you realize that most solutions to problems of desperate nature are overts people solve their desperate problems with overts and if youve got somebody who has lot of problems you have somebody who is committing lot of overts thats why that pair belongs so intimately together there at ii youre not going to find somebody who has problems at all youre going to find gradient that goes fromwell he has problems perfectly normal yeah hes got problems down to his problems are absolutely desperate oooh oh my god nobody had problems like these dont you see down to problems at all see theyre going downhill its the reverse order to the way the guy goes uphill too and in other words the fellow who has problems at all is the one you should be worried about because this persons got it all solved he solves it with this great big overt every morning dont you see has perfectly quiet house now he hits the baby on the head every morning you know and youll run into theyoull run into the caseyoull run into the case that doesnt have anything to improve you wonder ifafter while you get curious as an auditor as to why this person is sitting in the pcs chair you look at these goals that are set and they all seem to just be nothing and nowhere nothing important and so on youll say to the person well whatwhatwhat happens i mean whwhwhywhy do you want auditing is there anything about you that youre trying to improve or anything like that even though thats iv you see your curiosity will get the best of you and the person will tell you quite surprisinglythis case is not infrequent these cases i give you somejust vague idea maybe one in thirty or something like that ias matter of fact im perfect well why is he being audited if hes perfect well how come you see well of course he has never confronted any frailty you have to handle that case very delicately because if that casethat case is on this borderline if at any moment that case found he was doing something wrong that would give him the last little push of personal degradation necessary to tip him right over the cliff see if this person is down to such point on service facs and all the rest of itdown to such point that if this person admitted that there was one tiny error that he committed in his life it would finish him and when you see these psychiatrists ranting and raving around trying to get somebody to admit that theyre guilty or something like that you realize that theyre dealing almost exclusively with the insane case who cant admit whose insanity is an affirmation of an error in other words theyre confirming this error all the time you ever see little kid do this see hes just busted glass you know or hes busted little piece of glass or something like this and you say johnny you shouldnt bust that glass and he busts another piece of glass you know and then he just goes on busting more and more glass and you just seem to have nothing but strewn glass all over the place and so forth hes trying to assert that its right to break glass dont you see he feels to himself that if he admitted it was wrong to break glass and if he himself realized that he was doing something wrong he would be finished that would be the final degradation and there he would be on his way south with parachute you see and therefore murderer repetitive murderer or something like thisi was listening to copper yesterday on the subject of murder and it was quite entertaining how theyve got it figured out murder is familial crime and therefore is really not crime and it doesnt belong with the rest of crime and is its own particular thing which is entirely different and thats why theyre passing law against hanging people for murder in england well go ahead you try to follow it through well of course if youre following it through youre making the same mistake that everybody else makes when he tries to follow pattern of aberrated logic you cant turn that many corners too quickbecause it isnt that quick because it isnt logical thats simple and of course its noncomprehensible piece of balderdash into which somebody has argued himself and so forth in other words we have guardian of the law arguing that murder is somehow not much of crime and is right but this boy himself was not arguing from his viewpoint he was arguing from the parliamentarian viewpoint he said this is what they think and of course he receives his reports all the time explaining what they think and so forth and so hes probably quite authoritative on the line i thought that was very interestingthat murder is not crime its usually familial affair and i dont know where they got their statistics therere lot of murder statistics they dont have such as the fact that only 3 percent of the murders committed are ever proven guiltyanyone ever proven guilty is something like 3 percent and i have even seen figure adventured of what percentage of murders were detected now thats just about the most adventurous figure to release i have ever heard of imagine somebody releasing such figure what percentage of murders were detected now you get society figuring that way you get an individual figuring that way see and hes got it all figured out how something or other isnt crime and yet it is crime and he does it and he gets the full recoil from itall mental mechanisms are operatingand yet at the same time hes got this thing totally suppressed because its all right to do this dont you see its all right to do this except it kills him to do it dont you see its all mixed up one way or the other youre going to be sitting there as an auditor looking at case thats this snarled up along some particular line and youll probably say why didnt i take up some other line of activity after while of this because it can get very very confusing if you didnt have pattern with which to track this case up along the line to sufficient responsibility to improve or any one of the cases i have mentionedif you didnt have series of steps to walk up why youd just never get these cases up and that would be the end of that now the only trouble youve had as an auditor is actually not walking cases up those steps when you didnt when youwhen you grabbed the guy on the fourth step when he was on the first step then the pc was not on the same step you were on and therefore you and the pc were in disagreement his state of case and your estimate of the case were in conflict and therefore to get any gain for that pc became impossible and you began to think that it was all unreal and auditing didnt work or something was weird was going on yes the type of auditing you were doing the type of approach you had to that case yes absolutely correct wouldnt work it would work on the ease later after the case had been pulled up to step three but at the time that you were doing it on the case then its perfectly true to say that auditing wouldnt work on that ease if auditing means exactly what you were doing with the case if the case isnt advancing auditing isnt working so the problem of how to make auditing work is the discovery of an orderly generalized step that can be taken with any case that will bring them up to the next step where generalized step can be taken with the case dont you see look at thelook at the brain strain this saves you after all you dont want to strain your brains too much because they ought to beought to be preserved carefully psychologist and so forth has got to have something to work with and the strain which you would get into in this case is very horrible just what do i do now you say you know whatwhat do i do now you see very desperate case isnt advancing and that sort of thing well what ive tried to do is give you series of generalized steps that if you can get this case over this hurdle at this particular timeif you can get the case over the hurdle why then you can now approach the case with this next activity which will get the ease over that hurdle and now youve got the case there and now you can get him over the next one without in actual fact costing you too much particularization now theres one exception to thisthe book of case remedies is the totality of one step in actual fact the second level which is devoted to overts and present time problems and at that level the individual being in better communication with the auditor being in better communication with life then is able to face up to some of these actions and you can take these actions and solve little things like hidden standards and so forth but the trick is how do you get him up to being run on the book of remedies i know theres some of those remedies apply all the way south but in general how do you get him up to being worked on the book of remedies well thats totality of level you might say well fortunately there are things which thetan can do which are above his bank in other words thetan is always really senior to his bank he always is there are certain things on which thetan would become aberrated whether he had bank or not the presence of the bank makes it difficult if not impossible for him to recover in the absence of auditing and if he didnt have bank he would come out of it eventually do youdo you understand if he didnt have any bank at all he wouldnt then go into permanent spin on this particular subject but would come out of it later in other words hed walk in and out of aberrated conditions he wouldnt just become more and more and more and more aberrated he wouldnt be in dwindling spiral because the bank is designed to give the person dwindling spiral now the design of the bank is what makes the dwindling spiral but of course thetan has to be capable of supporting bank and giving himself dwindling spiral too dont you see but at the same time hes gotten this worked in so much that you can say its designed dwindling spiral from which he cannot recover and that was beyond his basic planning but there are certain thingsthere are certain things which thetan would become aberrated about whether they are in the bank or not lets take thetan who isnt aberrated and lets examine now what would happen to this individual what would happen to him if he didnt have designed reactive mind of course the reactive mind is total design now what would happen to him what would he become aberrated on well he could determine to become totally aberrated and go into dwindling spiral and spin in he could determine to do this and he probably could make this stick with great deal of ramification and so forth mostly because he has done so in the past we know for sure that he has that skill but when we look at how complex and how calculated it must bewhen we look this over and know the amount of trouble that he had to go to in order to get himself into this and also realize that he could not possibly have realized how much trouble he was getting intootherwise he would not now be trying to get out of it follow so hes also then capable of miscalculation hes capable of miscalculation of how much trouble he can get into see i think thats quite fascinating thats obviously one of his basic talents of getting into more trouble than he can foresee and we look over several of these points and we can trace out just paralleling what he has done regardless of the particularities and peculiarities of his peculiar particular bankwe see then that he is capable of having these things happen not necessarily done to him but hes capable of having these things happen to himself hes also capable of making things happen to himself hes capable of setting up time but hes also capable of setting up masses that suspend in time as the gpm and that hang timelessly when i first figured that out i figured it out little bit in reverse the masses that are hanging up endlessly in time are the masses that create time i think thats marvelous but anyhow thats figured out both ways from the middle you see now therefore thetan is capable of certain amount of aberration but its very difficult for him to aberrate himself to such degree that he cant recover and the only way he succeeds in doing this is blocking out duplication thats the only way he can totally booby trap himself on dwindling spiral now that probably you think requires just little bit of amplification and yes it certainly does because it was considerable discovery when made you cant brush it off lightly with sentence but it goes back into our axioms on asisness those axioms are all senior to the reactive bank and it goes back to asisness and of course that which thetan cannot asis is going to endure you get it if he cant look it over and erase it by inspection its going to last forever if hes totally unwilling to erase it it would last forever and also the only way he can erase it is by being willing to duplicate it do you follow you have to make perfect duplicate in the spot where it is thats demonstrable so he has to be able to duplicate it in other words youll just get madder and madder and madder at somebody that youre unwilling to be like lets take it at that mild state youre unwilling to be like this person so youre just going to be madder and madder and madder at this person you see and more and more standoffish and this person will eventually disappear but not because hes gone but because you cant see him anymore you follow that in other words erasure or knocking something out or making something cease to exist depends then on duplicationa willingness to duplicate it so thetan can become unwilling to duplicate something and cause it to endure and now were dealing with native thetan ability this he can do with malice aforethought but apparently its quite natural for the beast to do this hes quite happy to do this he likes to have things like bricks so all hes got to do to have brick is say ill never be bricktheres bricks do you see hes got modus operandi by which he proceeds do you see you therefore have universe well thetan is nothing and hes unwilling to be something in terms of mass so therefore of course he then gets an endurance of masses its the trick by which he makes mass endure but he can be caught in this trick and the way he caught himselfit took this amount of action to catch himselfis he made up bank which told him what he should be willing to duplicate and what he shouldnt be willing to duplicate and he made that bank up in two halves he made it with the cowboys in the white hats which he must be willing to duplicate and the cowboys with the black hats that he must not be willing to duplicate and therefore you would find all the cowboys in the white hats duplicatable and thus disappearing and all the cowboys in the black hats becoming more and more real and solid and i frankly dont think thetan ever figured this out at the beginning because hes for sure going to go on dwindling spiral and it depends on this one factor of duplication now the gradient scale that leads to duplication is communication communication is gradient scale toward duplication i know you think it might work the other way to and sure it does but you might not be willing to duplicatewell lets say bum on skid row but you would say here my man heres quarter or something like that you see youd communicate to that degree in the process of communication you might also get over without obsessively duplicating him the obsession not to duplicate him and so then feel perfectly comfortable about talking to bum on skid row do you understand you can talk to bum on skid row without being afraid of becoming bum on skid row well thats done by communication not only do you knock out the nonduplication see by mere communication you not only knock out this ferocity of dont ever be that see but also knock out the dont ever be that see both sides of that thing can get knocked out and you suddenly find yourself able to talk to bums on skid row without feeling like bum you follow this so obviously then the thing in the bank which is the rough rough rough point is duplication willingness tounwillingness to thats the rough point of the bank and the gradient scale to that is communication because thats causedistanceeffect with duplication and intention now because its broader formula you can take part of that formula called communication and oddly enough by practicing it knock the duplication factor back into some kind of shape you might not knock it into totality so the bum on skid row disappears simply because youre making perfect duplicate where he is because thats not part of the intention do you see but youll knock it out to point of where whenever you even vaguely come near bum on skid row you dont have to say to yourself oh i must never become bum on skid row i must never become bumoooh im never never never see by the process of communication with this bum that i must never you see gets knocked out and one longer is upset about becoming him or not becoming him do you see and so therefore he can talk to bums on skid row thats it blah now the fellow says im never going to be in an automobile accident im telling you now why your assist works were right at that level of action but it actually is much more subtly pervasive process than we ever imagined it goes all the waysuch thing as touch assist or communication with the object and so forth thats terrific stuffvery powerful and that doesnt always work because the guy doesnt always get flattened on it you know it might be lot longer than you would ordinarily think in starting process you say well im going to audit him for fifteen minutes and his gout ought to disappear you see well if you said im going to audit him for hundred and fifty hours and his gout would disappear you might have made it you see and just how much does it take all right welets get this person and he says ohh i never want to be in an automobile accident ooooh horribleblood all over the place you know dont want to be anywhere near an automobile accident next thing you know hes driving down the road and the steering wheel just apparently all by itself turns around and runs him into tree well what has to happen in order for that to happen hes gotten to point where he cant duplicate car so therefore he cant communicate to ear so obviously he cant control car so we get that which you resist you become we could rephrase that thats perfectly true as it is but we could also make more fundamental observation of that which were unwilling to duplicate will persist and eventually overwhelm and the road out is not to go around obsessively duplicating it as the youngyoung actor does he says ive got to live all parts of life in order to be good boy in life ive got to be good actor ive got to live all parts youve seen artists go this route ive got to make bum out of myself lets see ive got it on my schedule here ive got to become pervert dope addict and so forth in other words ive got to live exclamation point you see ive got to experience well ive already gone this whole study ive looked this whole study over gone right down the line on studying it very carefully and i find out that the single action of experience is nontherapeutic thats fascinating thing experiencing something is not therapeutic there is something however which is and thats communicating with it guys worried about becoming an alcoholic he doesnt have to drink and experience alcoholism to get himself out of it hell more likely go the route and hell wind up down there with alcoholics anonymous you know embezzling their treasury or something the thing to dothe thing to do if hes got this and so forth well he actually could communicate in some fashion and with something with relationship to this subject and all of sudden that duplication factor would click out see the refusal to duplicate would click out by the process of communicating so that opens the door to lot of think you see you can figure case out here very nicely you want to get case over some kind of an obsession or something like that well set this alcoholic down give him bottle give him glass now what he mustnt do is experience it see thats whatthats the only thing you as an auditor have got to make sure he doesnt do its nontherapeutic but communication yes hes got to communicate with it and you just run reach and withdraw from the bottle from the glass get photographs of alcoholics on skid row or something of the sort and have him reach and withdraw from the photographs anything you want to do any way you could figure it out and the guy all of sudden would not be able to become an alcoholic if he worked at it thats what i mean by its very hard to hold psychosis or neurosis in place well that makes sense if you realize that the simple communication will unbalance it and knock it out but what does it knock out it knocks out the ferocity that one isnt going to duplicate the oh my god i would never be psychiatrist never never never be psychiatrist theyre bunch of dogs bums see watch it there he is down there at the registrars office at the local university signing himself up well i guess id better take this course next twelve years ill be studying awayi dont like itdont seem to have any aptitude for it but i gotta be it do you see whats happening its very interesting theres very very very notable personality in the world today very notable newly ushered upon the stage of politics and nations who has 48hour comm lag on wontgot to knowing that you could destroy that man just like snapping your fingers hes near nut hes only got 48hour comm lag between saying i will not under any circumstances to doing it and hes got tremendous number of these i will not under any circumstances and if you very carefully examine the record youll find out that the comm lag is about averaging 48 hours sometimes its more sometimes its less i think thats fascinating its the wildest thing you ever saw48hour comm lag of course forgive him he knows not what he does and hes just humanoid but i dont think he should be that pigbrained he never notices this about himself i will not under any circumstances increase the bank rate increase the bank rate i wont have anything to do with the multilateral force us were with you why can you detect it on this man if you followed it very closely and you knew these mechanisms how could you detect it well he just happens to be in the public presence he just happens to be humanoid and hes so much in the public presence and he happens at the moment to be in lot of trouble that it would take superman to figure out youd have to be at least level 0 to figure him out hes spectacular you see merely because the spotlights on him how many people are like this see hes not single and solitary and alone so you have to watch this very carefully and wherever you see these i will not and they shall not and you see that bird up in that pulpit you know and boy hes talking about hellfire and damnation hes talking about and he talking about whoooooo watch him brother watch him dont be caught alone in that vestry you girls or you boys hes agin it and hes saying at that moment i refuse to duplicate it hes immediately forecasting this that hes not going to observe it or its consequences in very short space of time its going to sort of cease to exist its where was it why was i so angry about it yesterday im it dont you see its horrible to behold i didnt mean to enter english politics that violently but i dont think that i have entered it any more briefly than he has i usually abstain from politics and he should have but theres what you tune your observation up to ive shown it to you out in the public sphere you can watch this it would be good stunt to go back and look in the papers of just the last few weeks and find the i will nots followed by the more or less 48hour lag fascinating well you look at your pcs now registrar is probably used to this mechanism probably has never figured it outthe guy who comes in and says i will never under any circumstances ever be processed by this organization because youve got nothing but bums tramps and boobs for auditors and you people are terrible and youre awful and so forth and then the following week have him come in and sign up and im sure that registrars have noticed that but it happened every now and then all you had to do is make the guy little more vehement and it would happen the next day not next week do you follow this which he isof course by doing such thing would make bit of mess for staff auditor it isnt really very orthodox selling but heresheres the point its this duplication factor that is the bug in the ease and the reactive bank says that 50 percent of existence must be shunned theres some communication mentioned in it but its mostly just not have nothing whatsoever to do with it nohow and the other 50 percent is love it gotta be it cherish it so of course the universe will eventually become the 50 percent you mustnt have anything to do with and then would become quite unreal and would be all around you and that practically is the only secret there is of life if you feel you have to experience something in order to prove that you can duplicate it of course youre really not going on any gradient that anybody can attack and you simply collapse terminals with itbang dont you see well all right ive often said i was never going to be operated on but they say the operation is necessaryall right cut my guts out see see thats sort of communicating without communicating you know thats not communicatingso how are you going to hold anything off if you cant communicate with it and the things which bother you in your bank as you wake up in the dark and miserable hours with the wind howling outside is something you mustnt be or have anything to do with and of course if its something you mustnt be and have anything to do with of course what is there up there that keeps it from falling in on you whats going to hold it out there there isnt anything there to hold it its like trying to hold small boat away from the side of ship with boathook you say well i must never use boathook and i must never touch rope why is it that every wave that comes along smashes the cutter against the side of the ship i must never use boathook i must never use rope smash ohhhh i dont know how to get out of this problem mustnt ever use life preserver either because i would be communicating with that ship well how do i solve it then well of course there is way to solve it then because you have already said that the two or three available solutions mustnt be employed its like saying to somebody its perfectly all right for you to work with mathematics so long as you never use arithmetic or formulas he might work with mathematics without arithmetic but you certainly couldnt work with it without formulas well lets throw away arithmetic and formulas and then set ourselves the problem of working now with mathematics well it cant be done lets say well ive got to gain weight but i mustnt have anything to do with any food or use any other means of adding mass to the body why dont i gain weight you see its as silly as this it has to be that kind of idiocy and that is the basic idiocy of thetan hes laid out bank 50 percent of which says he mustnt duplicate it the other 50 percent thats fine to duplicate it if he can get there yes but if he can duplicate the 50 percent of it its not very aberrative is it and furthermore it will tend to weaken as time goes on and be less and less forbidding ah then that remains the only part of the bank which is really tough even though the good cowboys in the white hats are all there toocowboys in the white hats are missing their hats and pistols and chaps and left feet you know by this time thosethose cowboys in the black hats are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and tougher and tougher and tougher and tougher and theres nothing to hold them off withnonduplication communicationcommunication therefore is the key which unlocks duplication duplication itself as practice is very steep gradient as youve found it from time to time that also has some workability you practically cant do any duplication on somebody without having something happen to his case he doesnt even respond or cognite or anything else but maybebut something happens now duplication could also have scale its almost impossible to divorce duplication unless we say experience from communication you could be inside of something experiencing it without communicating with it pulling in all differenttrying not to communicate with it while experiencing it you get the idea but you could just have pc lay down piece of chalk as duplicative action and eventually hed get the idea he was doing that the funny part of it is its liable to be totally over his head the whole way but still something happened to him by reason of doing that do you understand might be not detectablebe detectable by him nor immediately detectable by you but something would happen youthere are gradients then in the field of duplication itself i dont want to tell you there are not because there are gradients theres duplicating something little and duplicating something lot you know theres making drawings on piece of paper to represent something if you want to make little kid come up the line use drawingnot hobby therapy now dont everybody misinterpret thisits not what they do its what accidentally happens sometime in hobby therapy that makes it suddenly get gain and they look at these isolated unexplained gains and then they havent bothered to find out what in hobby therapydrawing or weaving or basket making or something like that or modelingwhat in that you see gives us resurgence nobody ever bothered to investigate it they just said well youweve got it all explained it keeps the guy out of mischief something like that some brushoff but there was something there those hobby therapies which work are those hobby therapies which serve as duplication exercises only they must be pretty remote if we took little boy who was having hard time in school and simply had him draw for us and explain what he was drawingdont evenyou understanddont even tell him what to draw see say draw something and tell what it is this is the game you see draw something tell what it is draw something tell what it is let him draw something else he starts to come right on up scale hell eventually bother you to death every evening why he comes in and he wants to draw you something to tell you what it is well that is an effort see to remotely duplicate something and all you have to do is encourage this effort i dont care how sloppily you do it or not now of course you could directionalize what he was supposed to draw you see thatwere getting steeper see thats steeper up littlelittle bit higher now lets see draw what you dont like about school got the idea ah its good and steep but the funny part of it is he would eventually come up to being able to do that see now lets make school in three dimensions see duplication as such see well of course the end product is all right take glance at school asis it thank you very much wouldnt be appreciated by the state but it would be by the politicians who make their votes through contractors the point here is that you could follow along line of duplication it wouldnt necessarily be fruitful because it would be too difficult here and there to assess where the gradients were but it would not beits not barred route you see its perfectly acceptable route its just that to take somebody all the way along this particular line hes liable to fall over these toosteepa gradient here or there and interrupt his forward progressbang you know and then he doesnt want anything to do with that and he doesnt want anything to do with you and he doesnt want anything to do with drawing dont you see because hell come off of it awfully quick because its already steep in other words he could have failure on it that would throw him all the way back now you could however approach the whole thing the whole way on the single factor of communication that wouldnt be steep gradient in fact it would be so unsteep that occasionally youd wonder if he was getting anyplace but he would be getting someplace now communication as word is in the reactive bank to make my earlier point its part of the reactive bank but that is not what makes it therapeutic or not therapeutic that it also is part of the reactive bank has bearing on it because in the reactive bank it has equal value with tremendous number of other things but in actual fact native thetan has this as one of the top points of his makeup see it doesnt matter that lot of the things which you have in scientology are in the bank they are also in the bank and with what glee your pc will suddenly discover some end word like communication or music or something see hell say oh wow is that why and so forth and clear up on the situation and everything will be fine you see and theyll feel much betteror understanding you see gawd thats obviously all these variousthese things are in the bank but they also come under the heading of something that would get wrong with thetan whether he had bank or not they could get right with him they could get wrong with him do you understand so if you took his whole bank away he could still get into mess but the difference is unless he had created brandnew bank and had weighted it in some peculiar way and had gone around and then forgotten what he was doing some other way and then pretended he was somebody else you see messed himself up he just had to work on it for weeks months years not unconsciously you know but knowingly now lets see i am going to wreck myself now lets see how do i go about this if he wasnt that interested having now experienced being wrecked i dont think hed be that enthusiastic now as he comes along this line then hes going toin the process of livingness hes going to hit some slump spots see hes going to hit some dips and those will be centered around communication and duplication making things unmaking things you see persistence any value that time might be you see any value there is to experience on track see hell do all these things anyhow hell make up pictures of things and unmake them and so on and hell go in and out and upside down and around and coast along in life in other words but hes going to have certain aberratable pattern that isnt particularized or planned anyway hell be able to go out here one day and hes looking at something and he says oh he says what beautifulwhat beautiful red flower that is down on that planet there isnt that beautiful red flower and he looks little bit closer and its burning school and all the kids are burning alive in it oh he says that sort of thing shouldnt go on well of course hes denied himself and denied his observation hasnt he and he says that sort of thing shouldnt have gone on dont you see he may make hobby of it for awhile going around fireproofing schools or something you know and everybodyall his friends think hes little rocky you know they think erwhater dududu instead of him sitting around here playing yupyup with us hes around fireproofing schools gone but hell get tired of the game and he looks over this span of time hes been fireproofing schools and he goes back and he sights this lock originally and he decides its not very important and the whole thing asises and doesnt stay suspended in time and thats the end of that aberration and thats all the processing it would have it would have to be locked into an endless amount of time on the track which would have to be pushed into tremendous amount of reactive bank you see for him to be in state where he couldnt approach it and asis it now therefore you do have however certain factors with which you are working in person regardless of what is in restimulation and regardless of what the experiential track of that person has been its been my job to isolate what those were so then youd get uniform case advance communicationthat is one of your first and foremost leaders marvelous because it knocks out refusals to duplicate if you ran it long enough and put down all the pcs thoughts and cognitions you would find great many of them add up to refusals to duplicate in other words thats whats running off the case his cognitions consist of you know i saidjust said i would never be fireman now i wonder why you know if youif he was running and you had record of everything he thought these nonduplication decisions would go off along with his communication actions now how is it that you can take somebody then who cant drive car and you ask him to touch the fenders and touch the wheel and touch the top of the car and touch the back end of the car you see and touch the pedals and touch the motor and touch the switches and touch the knobs and touch the seat and touch the wheel and you go on and work on it the trouble with you is you dont give it enough seniority as process so youre liable not to do it long enough dont you see or not liable to do it often enough or liable not to do it in regular session or something of the sortscant it you see and then marvel of marvels we find this guy really my hes quite rocket jockey he couldnt drive and now man can he drive you know if you carried it out to its fullest extent because you would have knocked out his unwillingnesses to have been wrecked or his unwillingnesses to be carried or some such unwillingness would have gotten knocked out in the process of your reach and withdraw see thats why you take pc and run him for little while and on 8c something like this itswell obviously thats very steep because youre asking him to communicate with mest and that is the one thing he will not be see he wont bereally doesnt want to be solid so youre making him communicate with solid and mest and he doesnt want anything to do with that and he doesnt want to duplicate anyhow and the commands are duplicative so between those two it really catches him in crossfire and it makes quite process and thats why you get such results with it when its run with some intelligence now thereforetherefore communication is the keynote of case and its what you monitor case by and its what you try to solve first not only with regard to levels but at the beginning of every session youve got to realize that just because youve got the guy past level 0 you havent gotten rid of his reactive bank it is still sitting there man and you havent gotten rid of his peculiarities as native thetan and you never will which is the fact that he can communicate and he can create and he can do these sort of things he has certain abilities dont you see and he also has the ability to say he wont duplicate things and so just because you got him by level 0 is reason why this problem ceases you very often at level iv will find yourself sitting down at the beginning of session with pc who is out of communication with you and with the universe and with the room and with the meter and everything else and you just cant get any place you say he was perfectly all right yesterday now what the dickens is this all about well clever auditor always reestablishes the pcs communication where it ought to be before he does and goes on with something else i see pc sitting there in sort of an abstracted crosseyed fashion and i dont go on running yesterdays representation i want to know why this pc is not in communication that is my burning question and that is what i set out to solve and i solve it on the basis of just finding out whats going on now we can call this hes got ptp you see hes committed an overt hes got withhold from hes done this we know these key points but notice that these are all pointsan overt is ausually regretted communication ptp is partial and thereafter refused communication he communicated little bit and then he found out he couldnt go on any further he couldnt get solution to this thing dont you see so much so that if you ask somebody who has present time problem well what communications are incomplete with regard to this problem and he says brrrmp brrump brrump and it wont even register on the meter well its very magical see communication is woof and warp of this pt problem withhold is of course just an unwillingness to communicate now communicating with an unwillingness to communicate if half done creates problem so you get missed withhold you see you partially communicated with an unwillingness to communicate without carrying it all the way through and of course you found yourself having little bit of trouble here which you in this case brought out but you get the persons withhold and you do these various things you straighten these cases out you find out theres somethingnow lets get broader look theyve got ptp because they were unwilling to duplicate something so you could run it this way well whod you meet since i audited you last you didnt like or what situation occurred that you didnt want anything to do with this would be very unungradient but its with thud you see whod you run into you wouldnt duplicate for nothing and youre liable to get right back in the teeth from the pc my old man i got letter from him and errrrrrrr boy that was fast but also very ungradient because hes quitebeing quite misemotional about it so you must have approached it too rapidly to get it to blow easily because hes experiencing something you want him to communicate with something so if youre too clever for your own britches this sort of thing can happen you can throw the pc into it with gradient of communication with it thats about the only mistake that an auditor can makethrow somebody into his bank now how does he go about that he just finds noduplication decision and gradient of communication with that and poweee the guy interiorizes into that very point and you occasionally youas an auditor youve probably seen this happen and it may have happened to you you all of sudden were saying i dont know if we should continue this list something tells that we are off on the wrong steer here bow there you went the auditor asked that one more question well just give few more before we end it off you know or somethingsomething happened there you see you found yourself in communication with something which you figured you better not communicate with any further and then there was bit of an insistence persuasion and of course with modern processes this is all very easybluhh in he went head over heels into the asphalt nothing showing but wingfoot on his heels and he isnt flying thatsthat was the end of him and he bails out gradually and you straighten him out gradually and somebody runs overts off against that particular auditor because of course that mechanism works out too if he got an overt then he had to have it didnt he from somebody so hes got his motivator its all very complex what happens isbut in actual fact isit was just too steep duplication when nonduplication decision existed all of that is complicated by the fact that there is reactive bank and you can throw him also into the gpms and end words of duplication and communication and also they have their negatives all of which is very interesting because you could not onlyhes not only natively aberratedaberratable in this way but theres also whole great big mansized bank thats got those very words to boobytrap him in so that if he ran for while any pc thats run on what would you be willing to communicate with has run through some portion of the reactive bank it hasnt killed him but there it is he would inevitably go into some quarter of the reactive bank all of which i find very interesting because as long as we process this at first i looked at it with considerable horror i said oh oh my god weve been running people up against the reactive bank yeah in some instances manysome of the words weve used have had to do with the reactive bank but on the other side of the picture further study on the thing would have delineated which of these words were also capable of becoming aberrated bank or bank and it happens that communication and duplication are there now therefore as you look over the scene of auditing pc youve got destimulative factor youre putting him more thoroughly in communication with his bank without throwing him into it in other words he communicates it without experiencing it sometime if you run pc through an end word or into new series lets say it waslets say it was roofs in view of the fact that isnt in the bank and he instantly arched himself on 45 degree angle and lay out flat and pattern of shingles appeared on his back you could assume that he was dramatizing the end word and you could also assume instantly that there hadnt been enough of communication gradient there in other words if you skipped the communication youre going to get the obsessive duplicationcrack crack dont you see if you dont sneak up on it with some comm why itll experience and thats when pc dramatizes in session or dramatizes in life and so forth immediately after being audited it isnt necessarily true the auditing threw him into that particular dramatization because he might have been doing it for long time but as general thing if he ran into dramatization he ordinarily didnt do then what happened was is without gradient withoutwithout sneaking up on it with some communication the auditor simply had picked him up threw him around in couple of circles and threw him straight into the bank thud and there he was you see now you couldyou could develop process that would do this to pc and its very very good thing to know that process could exist that would do this to pc because it puts it in your hands as something that doesnt happen accidentally for instance the egyptian had the right idea with doctors any doctor had the right to cure or kill see because they were going to run both sides of the bank you see it isnt that you should run people in this particular direction but you should know the process that would and youve had one process for very very long timewhat wouldnt you mind going out of arc with and thatthe pc will run that and so forth now the other process the most direct onethe most direct one is what dont you like good duplicate it well thatd be good thatd work on some pcs also oddly enough it would work therapeutically on some pcs all right now what have you decided not to be in life all right thank you very much all right i notice however that although you have decided not to be an entomologist you have couple of hairs that you grow up here as antennae that would do it too you see prove to the guy conclusively that he is now duplicating something he said he would never duplicate be another processyou have to be careful of some of these scientology processapproaches to that because you see that really isnt scientology approachthatd be psychiatric approach you say you never wanted to be bug what are you doing with antennae you know i mean thatd the scientology approaches are hard to think of because they might work see you might get an asis such assuch as this all right decide not to duplicate anything thank you very much decide not to duplicate anything thank you very much decide not to duplicate anything thank you very much itd spin some people and put some people in their banks and make them dramatize like crazy but at the same time on some others it just might asis bunch of decisions not to duplicate and the guy would get well so that wouldnt be safe process for psychiatry you get the idea then demanding that the pc experience or demanding that he decide not to duplicate such as scolding punishmentall that comes under the same heading you see you mustnt do that again you know dont duplicate itits synonymous all of that dramatization would occur in other words if youif you forced fellow by scolding and so on to promise he would never under any circumstances something or other something or other something or other why then you are actually running nonduplication on him you see so the less an auditor evaluates for the pc and so forth why thats pretty bad funny part of it is an auditor sometimes has to do this you just take one more drink while im processing you buster im going to bust your skull is that understood well he isnt being very original because if the pc is sinning by drinking before every session you know youre not going to get anyplace with the pc and we know the pc must have been souse anyhow and that he must have been told ten thousand times this so if you tell him one more time what does it matter do you follow but its still heading him in the direction of nonduplication perhaps the problem would get so much in your road that you decide without any further gradient to process that thing which is getting in your road as an auditor when its that magnitude and that messed up sometimes you win at this and this makes you stupidly brave the next time you dont win you get some guy that cant talk to you as an auditor and you force him to run some wayup processall right lets make list of the bad habits youve got now were going to get you over these bad habits because theyre getting in the road of my auditing you theyd get in the road thats for sure so the solvent of nonduplication is communication and therefore as youre bringing pc on up the scale you are on very very safe ground if you improve his ability to communicate with you with his environment you could even go on little shallower gradient you could say communicate with you with the auditing room with his current environment in life communicate with his bank communicate with people their activities you could figure out an expanding line of communication which would all carry with it certain unwillingness to duplicate you see and wash it out as you went therefore hed become more relaxed hed become less and less nervous and he would of course be easier and easier to audit wouldnt he and youd eventually bring him up to point of communication where he was frankly doing quite all right and then you could run something toward his bank but do you understand the reason you couldnt run him all the way through clear to ot with such processes of merely increasing his communication even though it is the top solvent that sits above bank is because of the complexity of the bank itself hes sooner or later going to run into some fringe or corner of this bank and youre going to have to pay some attention to that bank you are going to have to pay some attention to his peculiarities youre going to have to pay some attention to his physical peculiarities as hisin healing youre going to have someto pay some attention to clearing him upcertain buttons that hes got in wild restimulation of course that first goes along the line of service fac hes got something there that he just wouldnt get rid of man thats too good the way to make mama guilty is to have these splitting headaches thatll fix her for rapping him on the head with thimble when he was two anyway hes got some of these things that have reversed and so theyve got survival values youin other words these are bank considerations and the bank is taken apart by you knowing what the bank is all about and walking the guy into portions of it that can be asised but your auditing in general is not all addressed to bank you are not just auditing the pc versus his bank because theres wide wide world out there and that is surrounded by wide wide universe and therere an awful lot of other beings in it who are perfectly willing to surround themselves and everybody else and there are tremendous number of banks walking around that are in collision and when you get all this added up you see that your pc is actually piloting his way through trap to get out of the trap of his own bank see in other words youve already got him in an environment which is sort of trap environment do you see he can walk out of the sessionafter youve given him this session he can just go out and walk out the door and run into his bête noire to end all bêtes noires black dog black beast all over his back you see oh johnny i was looking for you heres telegram from your exwife youve been arrested in wyoming for not paying alimony theyve got warrant out for you rather i think it says this is shoveled off on guy who is already halfway through service fac well now if the coincidence is too deadly for words itll be service fac how to make women wrong and self right and this sort of thing will get all confused and messed up because in actuality theres more than one bank that hes up against hes up against his own bank thats for sure and he wouldnt be having trouble with these other banks if he wasnt mixed up with his own bank thats for sure but at the same time that he is getting extricated from his own bank he is also mixed up with all these other banks joe pete bill and the rest of them and hes mixed up with all these round objects that go around these flaming round objects called suns and planets and hes tripping across an awful lot of space and stardust you know hes still eating remember he can get piece of bad fish thatll throw him for an awful loop fish decided that it was crime to eat all those herrings so it decided to make people sick the upshot of the situation then is that your piloting of the pc through his bank also involves piloting him through his contacts with all these other banks so therefore you have to make fast gain on the pc which is still sufficiently gradient for the pc to know that he is gaining and this has to be done so that when youve got hold of him and are auditing him you can make enough gain so that what will hit him immediately afterwards and so forth wont make enough of an impression on him to bar out his being audited the next session do you follow very nice adjudication fortunately you dont have to worryworry too much because its built into the subject but all these are the considerations of the subject itself and gradient and how you bring pc on forward and so on youve got all these things that are possibilities of strewn wreckage youve got pc hes already walking too steep gradient just breathing hey somebodys asking him to breathe see hummm sounds pretty grim and your best processing for the guy might be just to let him rest why dont you go out to farm in the country someplace and get room and sit down for month or two and not communicate with anybody well you say well thats noncommunication well yes thats right thats noncommunication but i havent really told you that noncommunication was that aberrative id say soldier standing up being shot would be much better off without that communication and if lifeif life looked to this individual like series of shell splinters flying through the air and if you said well why dont you crawl in foxhole for while joe i thinki think hed be better off for crawling in foxhole do you understand so that you say well then theres too much of that the fellows now gone the other way and he is now withdrawn from life and hes this and hes that i would not advise him as the medico advises him what you want to do now is retire and take rest because you shouldnt be in active life youre telling him something entirely different why dont you catch your breath for short time and sort of get unspun with the quietness of the countryside and so forth and then thee and will have at this thing hammer and tongs and we will clear it up and get you back into the realm of the living you see itd have to be that kind of plan but i would never advise the pc to experience life now what you want to do mr jones is make up your mind that there are spiders on your wall in your office and just go to work and thats the best that you should do just go to work and sit there and do your job and grit your teeth and pretty soon you will get used to it i think thats the best thing for you to do mr jones fortyeight hours later of course theyre issuing him ticket at the local spinbin you see for one padded cell that was the thing he couldnt duplicate anymore he couldnt even duplicate the idea of being there so its all question of gradients all question of communication its all question of how fast can you bring this fellow up and if you find some guy whos awful slow to bring up why dont blame yourself hes had plenty of time to do himself in and some people have simply done better job of it than others thank you
