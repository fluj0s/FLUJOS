overall system of internal control prompt corrective action is required by management to sign ificantly improve the application of key controls programme management the key function of project control was not effecti ve the designated project control officer for the most part acted as an administrative officer under vacant posts considering the significant activitie s and funds delegated to implementing partners the bsence of this key function had detrimental effect on the internal controls serious weaknesses were identified both in the programme activities managed by unhcr and those delegated to partners for only four of the eight partners reviewed could reasonable assurance be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accord ance with the sub agreements for other partners reliance could not be placed on the information rec eived and oios had serious concerns of the effectiveness of their accounting and internal cont rol systems and procedures supply management the systems and procedures in supply management wer partially established and in cases found ineffective andor deficient reasonable assurance could not be taken that all goods and assets procured were received appropriately safeguarded nd properly distributed local purchases of standard relief items were not c ost effective with prices exceeding by far the allowable limit of 15 per cent above prices for com parable products purchased internationally oios calculated that expenditure of about us 500000 co uld have been avoided if such items had been procured internationally through sms inadequate p rocurement planning contributed to these additional costs the representation agreed to minimize local procure ment in an 18month period gtz purchased locally spare parts costing us 750000 due to delayed funding the spare parts were of an inferior quali ty but with prices between 30 to 50 per cent highe r than international prices oios calculated that wi th proper procurement planning and timely conclusion of subagreements international procurem ent could have resulted in saving of about us 330000 procurement for 2005 activities would be placed i n the last quarter of 2004 for 20022003 over us 800000 was spent for repat riating refugees by boat from liberia the supporting payment documents were incomplete and s tandard information such as number of voyages and passengers was absent review of the transactions with this company was warranted assettrak data maintained at the representation was incomplete and the method of recording the status of assets was not satisfactory due to this items procured by sms including alm ost half valued about us 1 million of the 77 vehicles purchased i n 2002 and 2003 could not be traced in assettrak nor could their existence be confirmed measures have been instituted to address the weakn esses security and safety after the end of the long civil war in sierra leone unamsil took the lead for agencies with regard to security and safety matters newly post ed unhcr field safety adviser based in kenema had already identified enhancements required for mo ss compliance administration in the areas of administration and finance the lev of compliance with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures had improved during 2004 h owever further improvements were needed the operational exchange rate was always lower t han the bank rate and as result substantial us 14 million but artificial gains on exchange were recorded in unhcrs accounting records as these gains are treated as global income they w ere lost to the sierra leone operation oios recommended that the exchange rate fluctuations be closely monitored and in case of serious shortfall of funds some of the gains should revert to the sierra leone operation number of payment and adjustment vouchers process ed between december 2003 and may 2004 at the kenema suboffice were neither authorized nor pproved but still recorded in fmis due to this very serious weakness in internal controls oios re commended that an indepth review be conducted to assess the validity of the transactions repor t should be submitted to dfsm after the 2003 investigation into fraudulent medica l claims staff members have not been reimbursed claims even though they continued to contribute to mip the representation explained that they lacked the necessary expertise to survey the local market to ensure the amounts reimbursed were reasonable and customary oios encouraged the repre sentation to expedite this process and seek assistance from dhrm as necessary staff received solar payments of us 3450 per mont h but for those residing in unhcr guesthouses deduction for accommodation was mad action was being taken to rectify the situation

of unhcrs operations in sierra leone the audit was conducted in accordanc with the standards for the professional practice of internal auditing promulgated by the i nstitute of internal auditors and adopted by the internal audit services of the united nations rganizations oios reviewed the activities of the unhcr representation in sierra one and its suboffice so in kenema and eight of its implementing partners 2 oios previous audit of unhcr in sierra leo ne was conducted in june 2002 and it focused on 2000 and 2001 projects covering expendit ure of us 98 million the 2002 audit found that for some of the partners reviewed reaso nable assurance could not be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disburs ed in accordance with the sub agreements oios recommended strengthening of the project financial monitoring and improvement of internal controls over procurement nd asset management the representation had agreed to implement 3 unhcr estimated that of the 320000 sierra leoneans living abroad some 200000 returned in 2001 and 2002 unhcrs principal objec tive within the region in 2003 was to repatriate 42000 sierra leonean refugees and provi basic services in the returnee areas further unhcr provided care and maintenance to 60 000 refugees in eight camps most of them from liberia as well as 7000 liberians under local settlement programme 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activitie s during the exit conference held on 5 july 2004 audit observations detailing the audit findi ngs and recommendations were shared with the representative in july and august 2004 the co mments which were received in september and october 2004 are reflected in this report the representative in sierra leone accepted most of the audit recommendations made and is in th process of implementing them ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subagreements iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on 2002 and 2003 programm activities under projects 02 and 03abslerp350 02sbsleem130 02 and 03absle ls401 and 03abslecm200 with expenditure of us 43 million our review concentrated on the activities implemented by gesellschaft fur technisc he zusammenarbeit gtz expenditure of us 12 million international rescue committee expenditure of us 25 million peace winds japan expenditure of us 2 million america n rescue committee expenditure of us 1 million africa concern expenditure of us 09 million national commission for social action nacsa expenditure of us 12 mill ion caritas kenema expenditure of 2 us 05 million and bopujehun development associa tes expenditure of us 13 we also reviewed activities directly implemented by hcr with expenditure of us 5 million and us 5 million in assets and relief items procur ed and shipped by the supply management service sms to sierra leone in 2002 and 2003 7 the audit reviewed the administration of th representation in freetown and the sub office in kenema with administrative budgets totalling us 62 milli on for the years 2002 and 2003 the value of assets covered under the audit could not be reliably established as some of them were grossly overvalued for example some f the vehicles were listed as over us 2 million in value while other assets had not been r ecorded at all at the time of the audit the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in sierra leone was about 130 this included staff on regular posts united nations vol unteers and staff on mission 8 the audit followed up on findings and recom mendations made in the 2002 oios audit regarding supply management and project financial m onitoring there was little evidence that the representation had addressed these concerns 9 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations general programme matters 10 systems and procedures to monitor the effe ctiveness of programme implementation were deficient in particular activities implemente d by partners project control 11 the function of the project control office r was ineffective during 2003 and 2004 for extended periods to cover vacant positions the in cumbent acted as the administrative officer in the representation office and at so kene ma consequently very few visits to implementing partners were made considering the si gnificant activities and funds delegated to partners the absence of this key function had detrimental effect on the internal controls over programme activities the serious weaknesses i dentified by the audit could have been corrected earlier if this key function had been wor king effectively 12 many of the issues and weaknesses found d already been highlighted by oios after the 2002 audit the representation had responded po sitively to oios recommendations and indicated that improvements were being instigated however this was found not to be the case and not much progress or improvement had been made oios appreciates the staffing constraints but would reiterate the requirement to strengthen the project control function and to provide more handson training and capacity buil ding to local and government partners the representation stated that calendar for proje ct monitoring until the end of 2004 had been established and that the normal spmr reviews w ould be performed given the importance of this function and the serious concern s raised oios needs assurance that positive action has been taken copy of the monit oring schedule of partners should be 3 submitted as well as sample of the monitoring too ls and reports prepared by the designated staff now responsible for this function recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone should ens ure that proper and systematic project financial monitoring procedures are introduced and the necessary guidance is provided t partners to enable them to enhance their systems and procedures evidence that effective procedures have been adopted should be forwarded to oios for review rec 01 b audit certificates 13 number of local implementing partners n amely nacsa bpda and caritas kenema did not submit audit certificates as require d by the subagreements oios recommended that the representation arrange for an independent audit of these ngos and also of those national ngos which had been contrac ted by gtz to manage unhcr community empowerment projects cep these projec ts exceeded the threshold of us 100000 and therefore required an audit certificate oios also recommended that an independent audit be conducted of the unhcr subpro jects with africa concern although it is an international ngo oios was concerned with th management of the subproject and was unable to place any reliance on the information received from them the representation stated that steps were being taken to select an aud it firm to perform local audits including audits of international partners when needed oios is pleased to note the initial action taken by the representation but urges the representation to speed up the selection and engagement of an audit firm to ensure audit certificates for t he 2002 and 2003 are forthcoming recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone should eng age an audit firm to carry out audits at the relevant impl ementing partners rec 02 c community empowerment projects 14 in 2003 unhcr provided us 11 million to implement over 300 small cep projects with an average expenditure of us 4000 per project gtz implemented almost half of them by contracting two national ngos many of the ceps were only funded in late 2003 and therefore not completed by the end of the year it was therefore too early to assess the overall impact of the projects and consequently comprehensive review of them was not conducted 15 oios noted however that consolidated dat was not kept on individual ceps implemented by partners nor did the representation maintain an adequate central database oios recommended that standardised reporting form at be introduced to facilitate the 4 compilation of data and improve the monitoring proc ess the representation stated that it was in the process of improving and expanding its d ata collection on ceps b review of implementing partners 16 for four of the eight partners reviewed n amely irc arc caritas kenema and peace winds japan reasonable assurance could be taken th at unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements for the other partners reliance could not always be placed on the informat ion received and oios raised concerns as to the effectiveness of their accounting and intern control systems and procedures deutsche gesellschaft fur technische zusammenar beit gtz 17 although the accounting and internal contr ol systems established by gtz were assessed as satisfactory oios was unable to fully verify the us dollar subprojects due to the absence of supporting documents as this was mate rial amount of us 6 million oios recommended that gtz sierra leone obtain copies of the relevant documents these should be reviewed by the representation to determine if u nhcr was appropriately charged for the activities reported as implemented gtz has agreed to implement this effective from the current year b bopujehun development associates bpda 18 the audit confirmed recent improvements in accounting and financial reporting however it also identified weaknesses in procureme nt and project management particularly in keeping relevant data on the implementation of c ommunity empowerment projects cep the representation has requested bpda to follow est ablished procurement and project management procedures c national commission for social actions nacsa 19 nacsa had proper accounting system oio s attempted to collate and summarize the vouchers supporting the expenditures reported however it was impossible to obtain any reliance as to the completeness and accuracy of the spmrs submitted to unhcr internal controls were absent or weak banking transactio ns were recorded or reconciliations made and expenditure was not properly authorised or appr oved oios recommended that significant improvements be made and requested tha t proper accounts be prepared for the 2002 and 2003 subprojects the subprojects should be independently audited oios also recommended that the spmrs not be accepted until th representation is satisfied that the expenditure reported in the spmrs is bona fide unhc r subproject costs the representation has worked with nacsa to resolve the issues raised by oios independent audits of 2002 and 2003 spmrs will be made before f inal acceptance oios appreciates the efforts being made and would like to be kept inform ed of the result of the external audit 20 due to the serious shortcomings identified by the audit but at the same time recognising the need to work with this governmental partner oios recommended that the representation scale down the activities and respon sibilities delegated to them the 5 representation responded that it was obliged to ass ist and support nacsa as part of their capacity building strategy qualified finance off icer has been employed and is assisting in the installation of proper accounting system as w ell as ensuring internal controls are strengthened if this fails to be effective the re presentation will curtail the activities delegated to them oios understands the representations role in capaci ty building but would reemphasize that nacsa activities should be closely monitored recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone consideri ng the serious weakness identified during the audit shoul d monitor closely the activities of nacsa this should includ visits to their premises to review their books of account assess w hether internal controls and procedures have improved and obtain as surance that unhcr funds are appropriately disbursed rec 03 d africa concern 21 oios was unable to audit the unhcr subpro jects implemented by africa concern meaningful information was forthcoming to the qu eries made or the details requested it was assessed that the management of the partner was weak oios recommended therefore that the partner be closely monitored to ensure the programme was not adversely affected oios also recommended that the books of account be independently audited to obtain assurance that the expenditures reported can be rel ied on the representation noted oios observation and recommendations but did not indica which action would be taken to address the shortcomings oios considers it necessary to reiterate this reco mmendation as not only the general well being of refugees may hav been at risk but also the proper use and correct reporting on unhcr resources further the future partnership with this international ngo may depend on how they dealt with this matter recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone should mon itor closely the management situation at africa concern and arrange for an audit of their 2002 and 2003 subpro jects if significant improvements are not forthcoming the partnership with africa concern should be discontin ued rec 04 other issues with the implementing partners 22 the quality of the narrative spmrs needed to be improved they did not clearly outline the project achievements of planned activit ies reasons for delays or nonachievement of project objectives it was difficult to assess t he overall impact of the subproject for example staff housing was still under construction in july 2004 costing us 250000 however it was not reported as in progress by gt z in 2003 moreover narrative reports 6 were not consistently submitted to unhcr nor were they systematically requested by the representation the representation informed oios that action had be taken 23 the contributions from the partners were n ot documented in the subagreements oios recommended that this be done and highlighted that the contribution should be at least comparable to the 5 per cent headquarter support co st this is prerequisite for unhcr to contribute to such cost also without disclosure f the contribution there is risk that the provision of assistance is not properly harmonized and could result in some duplication of activities the representation informed oios that action had be taken and they had requested partners to the required information c supply management 24 the systems and procedures in supply manag ement were only partially established and in many instances found to be ineffective andor ficient reasonable assurance could not be taken that all goods and assets procured were recei ved appropriately safeguarded and properly distributed moreover limited trail exi sted of the procurement transactions and therefore it was difficult to assess the effective ness of the internal controls due to the poor andor absent documentation some improvements were noted at the end of 2003 nevertheless deficiencies still remained at the of the audit 25 the workload of the logistics unit was sig nificant as in addition to the regular supply functions they managed small aircraft until 30 j une 2004 and the transportation of sierra leonean returnees by boat from monrovia to freetown considering this in oios opinion the activities could have been more effectively man aged if the representation had sought assistance from the regional supply officer or from sms systems and procedures 26 from january 2002 to march 2004 the repre sentation and so kenema spent over us 44 million on local procurement adequate int ernal controls were not in place to track these transactions from the approval of the purchas to the payment of the invoice register for local procurement was available and some basic data was recorded but this was not found to be fully effective references to purchase orders and payment vouchers were absent and therefore assurance could not be provided as to the completeness and accuracy of the procurement data similarly for international procu rement there was mechanism in place to track procurement requests submitted to sms conse quently the logistics unit was not equipped to detect possible discrepancies and follo wup on delays in the receipt of goods oios recommended that proper tracking system be i ntroduced to enable the monitoring of procurement activities and to ensure the completene ss and accuracy of data the representation informed oios that action had been t aken as recommended oios is pleased to note the positive action taken but woul d like to obtain more information on the new systems and procedures developed recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone should dev elop an adequate tracking system to ensure the completeness and accuracy 7 of procurement data and to allow effective monitori ng of these activities the system should include details of pr ocurement requests the bidding process and approval from the relevant authority the system should enable proper followu p on delivery of goods and the matching of quantities ordered and received against the amounts paid rec 05 27 oios found that goods were not always proc ured competitively the roster of local vendors was incomplete and it was not clear how pro spective suppliers were identified or contacted the local committee on contracts lcc m eeting minutes were not always sufficiently comprehensive oios recommended that all goods be purchased competitively unless properly justified in writing the vendors roster be properly established and lcc minutes be complete and comprehensive the representation informed oios that action had been taken suppliers lists were regularly updated and proper market surveys were being conducted local procurement 28 the representation purchased large quantit ies of standard relief items locally such local procurement was not cost effective as prices paid locally were considerably higher than those available for international procurement throu gh sms unhcrs policy for the promotion of local economies allows local purchases if local item costs up to 15 per cent more of the landed cost of comparable imported it em however prices paid by unhcr sierra leone by far exceeded this 15 per cent limit oios estimated that if standard relief items procured for the sierra leone programme kitc hen sets lamps sanitary kits and plastic mats had been purchased under unhcr frame agreemen ts or other international procurement savings of some us 500000 could have been achieved the bulk of them from sanitary kits us 300000 and plastic mats us 1 40000 29 since the programme was longer operati ng under an emergency situation oios considers that inadequate procurement planning cont ributed to such additional cost the representation explained that forward planning was difficult due to piecemeal increases in obligation levels while oios appreciates that th is can sometimes be problem the preparatory work for international procurement coul d have been conducted in the intervening period while waiting for adequate funds also unde r sms frame agreements the volumes could have been gradually increased with the availa bility of funds oios recommended that local procurement be severely curtailed and the rep resentation make more use of sms when purchasing major relief items the representation explained that they would endeav our to avoid local purchases if not costeffective 30 similarly gtz was delegated significant p rocurement responsibilities for the logistics operation local procurement of vehicle spare parts between january 2003 and june 2004 amounted to some us 750000 gtz explained that i t was necessary to procure locally due to the delay in finalising subagreements orders c ould not be timely placed on the international market meaning economies of scale wer lost 31 the local spare parts were frequently of n inferior quality but at the same time considerably more costly oios estimated that the l ocal prices were between 30 to 50 per cent 8 higher than international prices oios calculated that with proper procurement planning and timely conclusion of the subagreements internatio nal procurement could have resulted in saving of about us 330000 the representation stated that orders for interna tional procurement for 2005 activities would be placed in the last quarter of 2004 appropriate budgetary provisions would be sought to implement t his measure oios would like to be informed of the present implementation status of th is issue recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone should lim it the local procurement of standard relief items and of vehicle spare parts to cases where the price of local goods does not excee d the price of comparable imported goods by more than 15 per cent oios estimates that international procurement of the afo rementioned items could save over us 600000 in 2005 alone re c 06 32 the representation spent some us 23 mill ion on fuel which was procured from local vendor the sierra leone national petroleum c ltd the contract for fuel was approved by the committee on contracts coc in 200 0 and was valid only up to 2001 further submissions to coc were made albeit the c ontract continued considering that unhcr in sierra leone procured over 3 million litre s of fuel in 2003 oios was of the opinion that if new procurement exercise had been conducted possible savings could have resulted subsequent to the audit the representation request ed and obtained from the coc bid waiver for 2004 to avoid any disruption in the fuel supply 33 for fuel management oios assessed that gt z had established adequate procedures and had put in place the necessary infrastructure f or its storage and distribution this was not the case however for so kenema and fo bo which t ogether procured about 600000 litres of fuel for administrative vehicles costing us 269 000 the systems and procedures both over the procurement of fuel and management of its consumption needed to be strengthened oios review noted that the consumption of about 120 000 litres costing us 53000 did not appear to be properly justified or supported an i nquiry was made whether some staff members were involved in unethical practices in the use of fuel and staff member was separated although oios reviewed this activity d ue to lax controls and poor documentation oios was unable to quantify the loss or assign responsibility oios recommended that the management of fuel be handed ver to gtz the representation agreed 34 so kenema spent us 42000 in 2003 on the procurement of vehicle spare parts the rationale for the procurement was not evident consi dering that gtz was already operating workshop for unhcr in kenema the supporting docum entation was poor and unhcrs procurement procedures were not adhered to oios r ecommended that so kenema discontinue buying its own spare parts since this r esponsibility was delegated to gtz the representation agreed b vessel charter 35 on behalf of unhcr liberia the representa tion entered into contracts with kamtech 9 ltd for the transportation of sierra leoneans by s ea from monrovia to freetown for 2002 2003 some us 13 million was paid to kamtech th payments for the vessel alone were us 646000 in 2003 and us 178000 in 2002 given the nature of the services the complexities and the financial volume it was oios opinion that sms should have been consulted on the contracting process this was not done and despite its value it was not submitted to the coc for approval the cost of this activity was charged to the liberia programme by sierra leone 36 our review disclosed that about us 37300 0 related to the payment of advances albeit it was charged directly as expenditure the re were details on how the advances were controlled against the actual costs incurred the d ocuments supporting the transactions were incomplete and standard information such as number of voyages and the dates and the number of passengers was absent the representation did t always have on file proper invoices to support the payments made one payment of us 4100 0 made on 18 august 2003 appeared to be excessive 37 due to these shortcomings and the lack of supporting documents oios could not provide any assurance that all the payments made to kamtech were justified oios recommended that the representation obtain all the relevant documents to substantiate the total payments made the representation explained that it was in the pro cess of compiling the documents needed to reconcile and substantiate the relevant payments to kamtech oios is pleased to note that work has started and w ould like to be kept informed of the results of the exercise recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone in order to obtain reasonable assurance that the services contracted f rom kamtech ltd were delivered and correctly paid should collect ll relevant documents to substantiate the total payments made mounting to some us 824000 and to exclude any double payments or excess payment of advances rec 07 c receiving warehousing and distribution 38 oios was generally satisfied with stock an d warehouse management which was carried out by gtz oios recommended however tha t consolidated distribution data be maintained to have an overview on the receipt stoc kholding and distribution of inventory countrywide action will be taken including the requirement to btain distribution reports from partners d asset management 39 assettrak data maintained at the represent ation was incomplete and the method of recording the status of the assets was not satisfac tory procurement requests from sms for vehicles and other assets were not tracked for exa mple in 2002 and 2003 sms shipped 77 vehicles valued at us 2 million of these only 40 vehicles valued at us 1 million were recorded in assettrak the whereabouts of the other 37 vehicles could not be traced on this 10 asset category alone about us 1 million was not pr operly recorded the logistics unit did not detect this discrepancy and cited the absence f staff with assettrak experience as the cause of the backlog 40 there was evidence that in recent years proper physical verification of assets had been done local asset management board lamb wa s said to exist but it had not met since 2002 oios was informed that it was being revived 41 the representation spent about us 47000 in 2003 for vehicle insurance premiums in addition funded by unhcr further us 15000 w as paid by gtz to insure unhcrs light vehicles double coverage and double charges cannot be excluded as there was comprehensive list of vehicles including their bar code numbers registration plates and insurance details also there was regular veri fication or documented relationship between assettrak and vehicle management 42 due to the various system weaknesses and l ack of compliance with standard procedures significant improvement was warranted the representation replied that number of measures had been instituted to address t he weaknesses raised by oios oios is pleased to note that action has been taken but wou ld like to be kept informed of the progress made ie whether complete physical verification of assets has been conducted and the status of the updating of assettrak and any other administrative procedures that are required completion of gs45s and submissions to the headqu arters asset management board recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone should ens ure proper controls are implemented over the safeguarding of ssets complete physical verification should be conducted before the end of 2005 to confirm the existence of assets on the basis of the results appropriate administrative procedures shou ld be taken and assettrak should be updated accordingly rec 08 d security and safety 43 after the end of the long civil war in sie rra leone unamsil took the lead for agencies with regard to security and safety matters and unhcr followed their suggestions also the newly posted unhcr field safety adviser b ased in kenema had already identified some additional enhancements required for moss comp liance oios considers that the representation was complying with the moss requirem ents and that general security and safety precautions had been put in place administration 44 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr offices in sierra leone complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under revie w however some improvement was warranted the post of senior administrative office r in freetown was vacant for most of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004 also there wa s administrative officer at so kenema 11 between september 2003 and july 2004 although sta ff members on mission and temporary replacements were used to fill these gaps certain concrete procedures and controls had not been put in place exchange fluctuations 45 the banks offered low exchange rates whic h in january 2003 was leones 2100 to one us dollar the leone gradually weakened against the us dollar to about leones 2700 to the us dollar in may 2004 depreciating by 30 pe r cent unhcr had successfully negotiated favourable rate of exchange since the operational exchange rate did not always coincide with the bank rate substantial but artificial gains on exchange were recorded in unhcrs accounting records for example unhcr converted over us 16 million to leones between january 2003 and may 2004 which res ulted in exchange gains of us 14 million representing the difference between the operational exchange rate and the bank rate 46 according to unhcrs accounting policy ch gains are treated as global income which means they are lost to the sierra leone opera tion resulting in reduced funds for programme implementation oios recommended that th representation closely monitor the exchange rate fluctuation and ensure in case of serious shortfall of funds access some of the gains generated by the sierra leone programme d ue to this unusual situation the representation agreed and has started to compile re lated information and would expect to be in favourable position if additional funds are required due to this exceptional situation b accounting 47 number of payment and adjustment voucher s processed at so kenema between december 2003 and may 2004 were neither authorized nor approved but was nevertheless recorded in fmisfield the finance assistant expla ined that temporary supervisorsstaff had departed before signing the related vouchers thei r successors did not want to be held accountable for the transactions as they were not involved in the decisionmaking process due to the volume oios was unable to determine the overall impact of this very serious weakness in internal controls oios recommended tha t the representation conduct an in depth review to assess the validity of the transact ions which were never approved the representation confirmed that new administrative finance officer had been posted to kenema and the matter would be investigated and app ropriately dealt with oios appreciates the commitment made to do this work bu t would request that summary of the review be documented and forwarded to the finance s ection dfsm for review they need to be satisfied as to the appropriateness of the expen diture processed in fmisfield copy of the report should be submitted to oios recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone should as priority conduct an indepth review of the payment and adjus tment vouchers processed between december 2003 and may 20 04 that were neither authorized nor approved summary rep ort of the review should be submitted to the division of finan cial and supply 12 management with copy to oios rec 09 c medical insurance plan 48 after the 2003 investigation into fraudule nt medical claims the representation suspended the reimbursement of medical claims at t he time of the audit claims processing was still suspended even though staff continued to contribute to mip without interruption the representation explained that it lacked the nec essary expertise to survey the local market to ensure the amounts reimbursed were on the basis of the reasonable and customary charges applicable at the duty station oios encouraged the representation to expedite this process it is important that appropriate control mechanisms ar established and staff members are reimbursed their medical expenses the representation reiterated that outside expertis was needed to assist them in this work they indicated that suggestions and support were expected from dhrm but this matter was still unres olved in the view of oios it is not acceptable that staff
