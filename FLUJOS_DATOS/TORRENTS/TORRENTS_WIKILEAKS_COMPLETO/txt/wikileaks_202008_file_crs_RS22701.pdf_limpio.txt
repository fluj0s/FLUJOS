itizenorgthe spp and member economies the spp is not trade agreement nor form of economic integration and goes only as far as leading to some measure of regulatory harmonization among the united states canada and mexico the spp working groups are not contemplating further market integration in north america such move would require govern ment approval process within each of the three countries in the united states such an agreement would require the approval of the us congress free trade agreement fta such as nafta is the most common form of regional economic integr ation generally in an ft member countries agree to eliminate tariffs and nontariff barriers on trade and investment within the specified free trade area under an fta each country main tains its own trade policies including tariffs on trade outside the region in addition to ftas other forms of economic integration are customs unions common markets and economic unions such agreements sometimes imply greater loss of autonomy over the parties commercial policies nd require longer and more complex negotiations and implementati on periods than ftas cust oms unions are agreements in which members conduct free trade among them selves and maintain common trade policy towards nonmembers these agreemen ts require the establishment of common external tariff and harmonizati on of external trade policies common markets are those in which member countries go beyond cu stoms union by eliminating barriers to labor and capital flows across national borders within the market the european union is the most prominent example of common mark et in economic unions member countries merge their economies even further than common markets by establishing common currency and therefore unified monetary policy along with other common economic institutions the 12 members of the european union that have adopted the euro as common currency is the most significant exam ple of group of countries that has moved forward from customs union to an economic union some proponents of economic integration in north america have maintained that the emergence of china and india in the global marketplace may be pu tting north america at competitive disa dvantage with other countries and that nafta should go beyond free trade agreement some observe rs have written policy papers proposing that the us government consider the possibility of forming naftaplus north american union or even co mmon currency called the amero6 critics of this level of economic integration believe that nafta has already gone too far and that it has harmed the us economy and undermined democratic control of domestic policy making7 others suggest that the spp may be more than an initiative to increase cooperation and that it could

goods between the three countries the majority of trade between the united states canada and mexico is transported by land modes tru ck rail and pipeline us freight trade with canada and mexico more than doubled in value between 1996 and 2006 growing from 419 billion in 1996 to 866 b illion in 20069 trucks are the dominant mode for transporting goods between the united states and its nafta partners accounting for 62 534 billion of th value and 26 of the weight of total trade in 200610 this growth in the volume of freig ht is placing and increasing burden on transportation systems and par ticularly the road network some observers contend that the spp may ultimately lead to socalled nafta superhighway that would link the united st ates canada and mexico with super corridor11 the federal government however has stated that there are plans to build nafta superhighway and that supercorridor initiative of any sort is part of the spp12 further legal authority exists and funds have been appr opriated to construct such superhighway nor are there current plans to seek such authority or funding13 states regularly undertake highway c onstruction and impr ovement projects independently of the spp as noted above the nations freight transportation system is being exposed to an increasing burden from crossborder trade14 states and localities undertake highway projects to address the impacts of this increasing burden on the roadways particularly in border states pla nning for these projects along the border often requires consultation with th neighboring nafta partner

that facilitate the efficient entry of legitimate cargo while simultaneously ensuring that sufficient level of security and scrutiny is applied to deny the entry of illegitimate cargo two of the ten spp security working gr oups are devoted to cargo security and border facilitation since 911 the us government has undertaken number of initiatives aimed at improving cargo security and the facilitation of legitimate or lowrisk cargo programs such as the free and secure trade fast program joint us canada and usmexico pr ogram and the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat program publicprivate supply chain security initiative are two wellknown examples of post911 initiatives that seek to provide increased security while also providing expedited customscl earance to prevetted shipments one initiative being considered under the spp is known as preclearance which has long been in place at airports but which has remained difficult to implement at the land border related concept is known as reve rse inspections which is essentially pre clearance conducted on both sides of the border under the reverse inspection scenario us customs officials would be stationed in canada to process and clear cargo enroute to the us before the cargo reaches the us border similarly canadian customs officials would be stationed in the us to process cargo enroute to canada from the united states proponents of re verse inspections maintain that this process offers increased security because it would allow for example us customs officers the opportunity to intercept highrisk cargo before the truck reaches the bridge or the booth at the on the us side of the border critics of the reverse inspection proposal cite sovereignty issues as primary obstacle but there are host of other issues including the different authorities held by each countrys customs agencies and variety of different legal issues15 progress was made under the uscanada shared border accord and the spp towards developing pilot prog ram to test reverse inspections at two different land border ports along the uscanada border16 to date however the pilots have not gone forward17 and it is unclear whether or not the obstacles to reverse inspections can be overcome in the future
