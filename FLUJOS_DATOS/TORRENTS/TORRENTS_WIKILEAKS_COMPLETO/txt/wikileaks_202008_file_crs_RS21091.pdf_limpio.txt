court handling an interstate child custody dispute must consider whether it has jurisdiction to decide the custody case three laws provide the answer as to whether particular court has jurisdiction the parental kidnapping prevention act pkpa1 the uniform child jurisdiction and enforcement act ucjea2 and the uniform child custody jurisdiction act uccja3 which has been enacted in some form in all fifty states and the district of columbia4 the pkpa gives priority to the childs home state the state where the child lived with at least one parent for six months before the custody petition was filed5 if one parent moves with the child to live in new state the original state continues to be the home state for an additional six months after the move the child need not be physically present in the original state for the child custody proceeding to be initiated there by the parent who remained behind

the best interests of the child usually the parent requesting the modification must convince judge that substantial change in circumstances affecting the childs welfare has occurred since the original custody order was entered 6 1 28 usc 1738a 2 9 ula 649 1999 supp 2001 the uccja and uccjea are only effective to the extent that states adopt them the uccjea has been adopted in some form in 27 states

congresss authority to legisl ate on domestic relations questions by alison m smith 5 it must be noted that the pkpa does not confer jurisdiction on the federal courts this act merely delineates which jurisdiction may modify child support and custody orders as such the pkpa is inapplicable to intrastate disputes and only relevant in interstate disputes when the jurisdictions have conflicting laws the jurisdictional guidelines set forth in the pkpa supersede any conflicting state law as such parents are bound by state court decisions regarding custody visitation and support 6 see eg ward v ward

g140g138g156g142g501g561 under the pkpa the court that issued the initial custody decree has continuing jurisdiction over custody matters provided that the first state meets three preconditions 1 it entered its initial custody order in accordance with the parental kidnapping prevention act 2 the child or one parent continues to live in the state and 3 the states own law allows continuing jurisdiction 7 if these conditions are met parent living in another state who wants to modify the initial custody arrangement must file the modification petition in the first state the uccja provides that dismissal is mandatory where the noncustodial parent violates an existing custody order by refusing to return the child to the custodial parent at the end of the childs period of visitation and then asks the outofstate court to modify custody 8 neither the pkpa ucjea nor the uccja totally precludes the second state from ever modifying the initial custody order the pkpa permits the second state to modify the initial custody provision if 1 the second state has jurisdiction to make child custody determination and 2 the first state longer has jurisdiction or has declined to exercise jurisdiction 9

parent is unable to find the abducting parent and the child for this reason the pkpa makes the federal parent locator service available to assist local police in locating the abductor the pkpa also provides that any state that treats parental kidnapping as felony may enlist the fbis assistance under the federal fugitive felon act in locating the abducting parent provided he or she has left the state 10 g11g156g561g146g157g561g138g561g140g155g146g150g142g561g143g152g155g561g138g561g153g138g155g142g151g157g561g157g152g561g148g146g141g151g138g153g561g138g561g140g145g146g149g141g501g561 in many

an existing custody order that the parent has intentionally violated because many parental kidnappings take place before final custody decree is entered few states have extended criminal sanctions to kidnappings that occur before the final custody decree13 several states also permit the court to assess expenses incurred in returning the child against any person convicted of violating the states criminal custodial interference law14 parents although they are subject to the pkpa remain exempt from criminal sanctions under the general federal kidnapping statute15 international parental kidnapping is federal crime punishable by fine andor imprisonment for up to three years16

once the child has been located possible solution to the abduction may be provided by the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction the convention is in force in approximately 40 countries including the united states17 mexico canada and most of europe the countries that have signed the hague convention have agreed that child who is habitually resident in one country and who is removed to or retained in another country in breach of the leftbehind parents custody rights must be promptly returned to the country of the childs habitual residence 18 however the convention is inapplicable if the child has been abducted to country that has not signed the convention or the child is sixteen or older although there need not be custody decree to invoke the convention the leftbehind parent must be able to prove that he or she is exercising right of custody19 at the time of abduction and that he or she had not given permission for the child to be removed or to be retained in the foreign country beyond specified agreedupon time in the absence of formal custody order custodial rights are determined by state law 12 see eg mo stat 565150 classifying

custody case at hearing under the hague convention the judges job is to determine only where the custody hearing should take place not who is entitled to custody of the child20 the goal of the hague convention is the childs swift return to his or her original country where the custody dispute can then be resolved if necessary in that countrys courts

not they were ever married parents also have an obligation to support all of their children not just the children who reside with them thus although the noncustodial parent is married to someone else

automatically withholding chil d support payments from the obligated parents paycheck regardless of whether or not support payments are late22 federal law permits an exception to immediate wit hholding if the court finds good cause or if the parents both agree to another arrangement23 however parent who falls at least one month behind in support payments is subject to withholding even in these cases24 withholding may be used to collect current support payments as well as arrearages states have the option under federal law to apply withholding to income other than wages and to order
