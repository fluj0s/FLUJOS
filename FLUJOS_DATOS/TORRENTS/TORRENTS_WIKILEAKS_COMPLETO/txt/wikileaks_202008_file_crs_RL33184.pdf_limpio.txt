structure of california agriculture pove rty in rural mexico the demand for low wage labor in californias fruit vegetable and horticultural sectors and the existence of family and village networks that grew from history of migration to the united states help sustain stream of immigration to the fields of the sjv this combination of push pull and n etwork effects appears to make both immigration and the expansion of farm jobs on which immigrants depend selfperpetuating18 agricultural immigration immigration plays significant role in the demographic characteristics of the sjv and california and this is likely to continue since 1995 the central valley as whole s received substantia lly more migrants from other parts of california than it sends to the rest of california the counties of madera fresno kings tulare and kern have received the most international migrants of any area of the central valley19 economically dominated by industrial agriculture these counties also are characterized by very high rates of poverty among immigrants this presents challenges to the regions social services especially for health care and education providers the growth in immigration in rural california is generally regarded as phenomenon direc tly related to the changing structure of agriculture20 greater integration of farms unde r the control of agribusiness the increased use of immigrant farm labor hired through contractors and continuing shift from owneroperated farms to hiredlabor co rporations characterize contemporary agricultural production in the sjv21 because the

dominated by large operations relying on mobile labor force agricultural production in the sjv is accordingly at the center of changes in the structure of agriculture continuing immigration into the sjv reflects these changing patterns since the early 1990s there has been shift away from migrant labor towards residentbased labor unlike many other farming regions of the united states the extended growing season in the sjv permits many workers the opportunity for year round farm labor while harves ting may be seasonal the great variety of crops in the region makes it possible for farm workers to reside in one area and find work for much of the year report on farm workers in kern county cites 1995 kern county consolidated plan that count ed 10240 resident farm workers and 19570 migrant workers during peak season23 this study noted that the number of permanent farm workers had steadily increased and is expected to continue some permanent residents with blished networks may move out of farm labor and into industries such as food packing processing transportation or re tail trade other residents may provide food or housing services to newl arrived farm workers the young hispanic migrant workers especia lly those without established networks in the communities continue to meet much of the demand for lowskilled labor intensive agriculture24 if present trends continue the newly arrived will become residents and move out of farm labor to provide opport unities for yet another wave of agricultural immigrants for the communities where many farm workers reside however low farmworker earnings limit the potential for significant economic growth because agriculture in the sjv is so reliant on lowwage lowskilled farm labor and because lowwage lowsk illed labor is attracted

as agriculture dominates the economies of the small towns in the sjv farm labor will continue to regard the area as an employment destination this can encourage the expansion of agriculture and with it the expansion of lowwage lowskilled workforce as discussed be low there are countervailing forces on an everexpanding agriculture these forces include an increasing substitution of labor by technology as well as longer standing pressures on smaller less efficient farming operations still the many farm workers who immigrate from mexico to the sjv are seeking seasonal minimum wage agricultural jobs the concern of some observers is that as poor immigrant farmworkers move to the sjv as well as other agriculturally significant areas rural pove rty may be recreated rather than agriculture being temporary employment stop for newly arrived immigrants before moving on to better paying jobs the ru ral farmworkers may have opportunities beyond lowpaying agricultural work in part this may occur because there are so few employment alternatives and the fa rmworkers themselves are generally poorly prepared for jobs requiring more educated employee migrant and resident farmworkers comp rise distinct populations whose needs differ migrant workers without networks at least those studied in the kern county case experience the worst employment job security and housing conditions

countys hispanic population that has acquired some economic success and increased english fluency begins to identify less with newly arrived immigrants26 second important distinction within the

the arc was established as unique organization with governing board comprised of federal cochair appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate and the governors of the 13 member states the regional development program requires the consensus of both th federal cochair and the majority of governors to set programs and policies the federal cochair and the governors must vote each year to allocate funds fo r various arc programs between 1965 and 1975 the arc emphasized environmental and natural resource issues eg timbering and mining as well as basic infrastructure vocational education facilities and health facilities and services between 1965 nd 2002 congress appropriated total of 92 billion for appalachian prog rams with 62 billion allocated for the appalachian development highway sy stem adhs and 30 billion for arcs economic and human velopment programs39 the adhs was critical component for the development program of appalachia for two reasons first the new interstate highway system had largely bypassed appalachia second system of reliable roads would link more isolated parts of appal achia to potential economic growth centers40 the appalachian regional development act has been amended over the years to expand the number of counties in the program today there are 410 counties which are classified into four categories of economic development distressed transitional competitive and attainment each category is based on three indicators of economic viability per cap ita income poverty and unemployment since 1983 the arc has designated the most distressed counties for special funding consideration in 2002 arc incorporated into its strategic plan an enhanced program for meeting the needs of distre ssed counties in fy2002 there were 118 distressed counties in 10

governed by local government officials and leaders from the member counties typically assist with grant applications consistent with state and regional priorities throughout its 40 years the arc has veloped record of helping small distressed communities move closer to th economic mainstream key element of the arc model is the network of 72 multi county development districts that are responsible for helping local officials and communities assess plan and implement socioeconomic development initiatives the arc structure is unique because it is an intergovernmental partnership that while preserving direct federal role in investment decisions also maintains strong emphasis on state priorities and decision making in 2002 congress reauthorized the rc through the appalachian regional development act amendments of 2002 pl 107149 in addition to adding four counties to the region the reauthoriza tion also included veral new provisions regarding the arcs activities among them were the

poverty and limited economic development opportunities have persisted for decades when the appalachian regional commission was created in 1965 appalachia especially central appalachia was practically synonymous with us white rural poverty forty years and billions of public and private dollars later the region has changed appalachia has cut poverty among its population of 23 million by approxima tely half and increased high school graduation rates by 70 while socioeconomic indicators still show the region lagging behind the united st ates as whole the deepest poverty isolation and underdevelopment th at characterized much of the region in the past has lessened over the past 40 years like central appalachia with its hist oric dependence on coal mining the san joaquin is historically tied to tr aditional extractive economy extractive economies whether based on timber mining or agriculture may pr oduce trajectories of development that differ from industria l forms of economic growth and change how that shapes the sjvs opportunities for creating new competitive advantage is central to an understanding of the regions future some researchers have suggested that the effects on the appalachian region of decades of mining created its own dynamic of developmen t and underdevelopment43 research on the central valley has also suggested that agriculture is pr oducing landscape of inequality there that will become even more pronounced in the fu ture without concerted efforts to create new paths of economic mobility for all sjv residents44 high unemployment and low per capita incomes have long characterized many appalachian counties as data in this chapter show table 1 similar patterns are observable in the sjv the geographic isol ation of appalachia however is one of the major factors in its development histor while appalachia saw an outflow of residents as they searched for economic oppor tunities that did not exist there the sjv has an inflow of residents due to very high rate of immigration however that immigration is characterized by relatively large numbers of poorly educated unskilled workers many of whom are drawn to the area by the availability of farm employment even those immigrating to the sjv from coastal areas of the state are not necessarily bringing good jobs with th em as much as they may be seeking the more affordable housing in the

general empirical overview of the appalachian region relative to the sjv we also provide more focused comparison between the sjv and subregion of appal achia central appalachia across range of socioeconomic indicators this exercise shows socioeconomic similarities and differences between two regions where pove rty and economic distress have long been in evidence data on variables of concer n here for the entire 410 county appalachian region as defined by the arc were in most cases not available at county level while the central appalachia n region is half the population size of the sjv 18 million versus 35 million people in 2003 for methodological reasons the scale between these two regions appears more appropriate than attempting comparison of the eight counties of the sjv with th 410 of the arc defined appalachian region there are counties within the 410 area that are so different across indicators from more economically distressed appalachian counties as well as the sjv that to include them in aggregate measures could introduce degree of bias that would weaken the validity of the comparison45 the appalachian regional commissi on categorizes its 410 counties by economic development criteria distressed transitional competitive and attainment based on three indicators of economic viability per capita market income poverty and unemployment distressed counties have poverty and unemployment rates that are at least 150 of the national averages and per capita market incomes that are more than twothirds of the national average counties are also considered distressed if they have poverty rates that are at least twice the national average and they qualify on either the unemployment or income indicator transitional counties are those arc counties that are neither distressed competitive nor attainment competitive counties have poverty and unemployment rates that are equal to or less than the national averages and they have per capita market incomes that are

ne t tax exporters first californias aboveaverage income creates aboveaverage federal inco tax receipts second the fastest growing portion of the federal budg et is in social security and medicare payments californias populati on is significantly younger than the us average and thus has fewer recipients of payments from these programs in contrast to appalachia with its higher proportion of

virginia kentucky tennessee north carolina georgia alabama and mississippi one county in ke ntucky and two in virginia were dropped from the list identified by bogue and beale because thes counties

are metro urban and 74 nonmetro rural counties in other words almost onethird 32 percent of counties in this region are urban counties nd thus this subregion is the most urbanized of the three subregions centra l appalachia includes 43 counties in kentucky 9 in tennessee 7 in virginia and 9 in west virginia of these only 6 9 counties are metro and the remaining 62 are nonmetro rural thus

the sjv and central appalachia in terms of poverty and une mployment the area is also heavily dependent on lowwage lowskilled service sector employment like the sjv central appalachia has long seen many of its better educated residents leave for more attractive economic opport unities elsewhere httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33184crs147 ers combined various cffr categories into 6 broa d functional categories of different types of federal funding ers data however provide somewhat different picture of federal funding because they categ orize the data differently the data for fy2000 covered 1165 programs but the data were not relia ble at the county level for every federal program ers excluded federal programs for which 25 or more of their funding went to state capitals b ecause the states may redistribute these funds to some or all counties and census data do not reveal the amount of this redistribution ers analysts also excluded programs for which most or all of the funding is reported only at the state or nati onal level thus most of the large block grant programs related to social services employment and training were excluded from their analyses relative to table 74 and table 75 below these exclusions understate the amount of fede ral funding received partic ularly for human resource programs for fy2000 ers determined that the data were reliable at the county level for 703 federal programs th programs accounted for 179 trillion natiowide or about 92 percen t of the total federal funds reported by the bureau of the census for fy2000 in the remainder of this chapter we present data on the sjv and central appalachia based on erss functional categories also provided are 10 maps figures 918 based on these ers data it should be emphasized that tables 74 and table 75 cannot be directly compared to tables 70 and 71 they provide different perspective on similar but not identical data for example unlike data in tables 70 and 71 the ers data exclude large block gran t programs interpretations of any of these tables should be made with cau tion because federal funds data are only as good as the information each agency supplies to the us bureau of the census in some cases as with medicaid the data are based not on actual outlays that go to places but on estimates based on other info rmation which may involve errors in other cases like procurement expenditure s may be reported only at the location of prime contractors or primary subcontract ors and ignore further subcontracting that disperses the impact of expenditures for example defense procurement which primarily benef itted appalachian metro areas nd governmentdependent nonmetro areas may involve subcontracting that disper ses the benefits broa dly to some other areas the ers functional categories fo r federal programs include agriculture and natural resources including agricultural assistance agricultural research and services forest and land management and waterrecreation resources community resources include business assistance community facilities community and regional development environmental protection housing native american programs and transportation defense and space including aeronautics and space defense contracts and payrolladministration human resources including elementary and secondary education food and nutrition health

948 billion with per capita rate of 2870 per capita rates varied slightly in this category with san joaquin county receiving the highest pe r capita rate in the sjv 3093 san joaquin county also had higher pe r capita rate of community resources expenditure 1018 than did the sjv 862 human resources programs received the lowest level of federa l expenditure in the sjv 6008 million with per capita

the other six sjv counties was 51 procurement contracts and wages and salaries asso ciated with edwards air force base and the naval petroleum reserve in kern county and lenmoore naval air station in kings county are the signifi cant factors in these high rates for kern and kings counties figure 14 per capita rates of federal expenditure among the six categories were somewhat lower in the sjv than

the state community resources rate per capita were nearly the same in the sjv as the state while national functions were 300 more per capita in the state than in the sjv the per capita federal

per capita inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33184crs149 mariposa county was nearly 1000 higher than the sjv and national functions brought mariposas per capita rate in that category to 1505 over three times the rate in the sjv the map in figure 14 shows the federally owned land in mariposa and tuolumne counties which contributes to high federa l expenditures for national functions in mariposa the per capita expenditure rate in tuolumne county was 116 higher than the sjvs rate like mariposa county tuolumne county had per capita rate of 4057 for income secur ity which was significantly higher than that of the sjv among other factors this reflects the higher proportion of those over 65 in both counties population per capita data for appalachia show dis tinct differences from those for the sjv table 75 data are provided for three subreg ions of appalachia north south and central these data also reveal distinc tive patterns among the three subregions the per capita rate for federal

nonmetropolitan counties had per capita rate of 5416 this is consiste nt with national patterns of federal expenditure which also show generally higher per capita rates in metro areas as opposed to nonmetro areas metro non metro and appalachia as whole each had per capita expenditure rates higher th an the rate for the sjv 4944 by significant margin the highest per capita rate of federal expenditure among the three appalachian subregions was in central appalachia per capita expenditure in that region was 7730 per capita rates in north appalachia and south appalachia were 5951 and 5305 respectively the high ra of central ppalachias metro counties accounts for the high rate overall central appalachia s metro rate per capita was 15455 compared to its nonmetr rate of 6292 th is nonmetro rate however is the highest among the three s ubregions and is 876 more per capita than the rate for the appalachian region as whole as was the case for the united states appa lachia and each of its subregions had the highest federal expenditures for income security programs the per capita rate for income security expenditures in ppalachia was 4239 compared to rate of 3276 in the united states in the sjv th income security per capita rate was 2870 central appalachias nonmetro counties had the hi ghest rate per capita rate of the three regions for this category 5135 substantially higher than the nonmetro rates in the other two regions as we ll as the regionwide rate of 4239 national functions located largely in central appalachias metrocounties account for the disproportionate per capita rate for that subregion the per capita rate for national functions in central appalachia was 7097 compared to regionwide per capita rate of 865 higher rate than th at of the united states 822 if central appalachias high rate is discounted appalachias na tional function per capita rate would fall to 784 west virginias universities and the 1995 completion of federal bureau of

and residents of the sjv projections of population growth presented earlier show the sjv as one of californias fastest growing regions migr ation from the coast is factor in this growth yet many of these residents continue to commute to jobs in angeles and the bay area international migration from asia and latin america is also significant factor in the population growt h although agriculture employment as proportion of the california economy continues to shrink wage and salary farm production employment in the state has grown between 1990 and 2002 from 172307 jobs in 1990 to 244525 jobs in 2002 agricultural service employment and agricultural processing and marketing em ployment have also grown between 1990 and 2000 although these categories decreased by approximately 29000 jobs between 2000 and 200281 agriculture remains the sjvs dominan t economic sector although hired farm labor has declined from 377853 workers in 1992 to 243079 workers in 2002 35682 between 1997 and 2002 only kings and tulare count ies saw small increases in number of hired farm workers yet agricultural development in the sjv may produce different effects in the sjv from the changes in commodity production seen in other parts of the united states eg the northern great plains and midwest as we discuss below the dynamic agricultural economy of the sjv is becoming increasingly specialized vertically integrated and expor toriented in globalized agrofood production system although these changes are occurring throughout largescale commercial agricu lture their scale and the existence of agricultural manufacturing and processing sectors in the sjv suggest that the model of integration is perhaps at its leading edge in the sjv agriculture unlike other economic sectors is also vulnerable to changes in water supply and the conversion of prime farmland to urban uses change in availability or cost of these inputs could significantly alter the role of agriculture in the sjv for the future for all its importance to the sjv today agricultural production will likely exist alongside an increasing diversification in the valleys economy while new economic sector has developed to

producers mostly within anima l production currently are joining supply chains87 supply chain is tightly organized production processing and marketing system formed by agribusiness firms that in its most coordinated form could potentially link each step of food pr oduction from proprietary genetic material to the grocery shelf like previous agricultural changes technology will play key role in the evolution of supply chains technology has been major force in driving the shift of farm activities off the farm and into the input industries advances in agricultural biotechnology can be expected to do the same but with distinct variation initial biotechnology development in agriculture focused on changes in bulk commodities eg herbicide resistant soybeans and pesticide resistant corn much current research in biotechnology is focused on th characteristics of farm products not just how the products are produced proprietary products lend themselves to the structure of supply chains as the c ontractor firms target new bioengineered products to particular market niches some farmer s in some regions may choose to continue producing bulk commodities other farm ers may choose to contract with an agribusiness firm to produce valu eadded bioengineered product some contract producers might find th emselves with decreasing power to negotiate the terms of their contracts as the relative power of large processors to determine the conditions of production increases88 although some states eg minnesota have adopted measures to pr otect contract producers some observers believe that because producers negotiate i ndividually with processor often with contract confidentiality clauses indivi dual producers can be at disadvantage89 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33184crs166 90 walter f

of particular significance if still poorly understood are the implications for areas such as the sjv where agriculture plays such central role in the regions economy historically agricultural pro duction was relatively widely distributed across the landscape supply chains appear to be redrawing the landscape of dispersed agricultural production pou ltry producti on and swine production were once widely dispersed across the country today broiler produc tion which is almost exclusively done under producer contracts is found mostly in the south and southeastern us and upper midwest p oultry processing plants are even more concentrated within those regions simila rly beef pr oducti on with larg feed lots and nearby meat packing plants suggests very different agricultural geography one with potentially significant social and environmental effects in regions where such production occurs given the sjvs st rong production in dairy fruits and vegetables the evolution of supply chain pr oduction in those sectors is likely to hold significant implications for agriculture in the valley agriculture and sjv communities some research has suggested that farm scale and other management characteristics are associated with certain community characteristics this resear ch has been controversial since walter goldschmidts pioneering 1944 research on two san joaquin farming communities conducted for the usdas bureau of agricultural economics90 substantial body of evidence has shown that communities characterized by largescale especially industrial farm structures are ofte n associated with adverse community socioeconomic conditions eg lower comm unity standards of living less economic diversity fewer community services less vibrant retail trade etc than communities with other types of farming enterprises91 the direction of that statistical association however remains unclear as does the stre ngth of the relationship and even more important the processe s that underlie it research conducted as part of the ffice of technology assessments ota 1986 report technology public policy and th changing structure of american agriculture supported the relationshi p reported by goldsch midt between industrial farming and community quality of life in its analysis of florida and several western states92 farms dominated by managerworke r relations and dependent on

regional nonfarm economy also exerts important effects on the surrounding area ggesting that newly created opportunities in the nonfarm economy may have signif icant impact on the farm economy and the

would invol ve another 25 million acres while the aft report recognized that nogrowth future was unrealistic the loss of prime farmland reduced agricultural production nd related income loss over the

single employment sector or full time in several sectors these data are quite stable over the 19802003 period showing that over threefourths of workers in the sjv usually worked fulltime in the

of combining resources in more efficient ways to make more effective use of public and private investments by acting in concert publicp rivate partnerships in the counties of the sjv may be able to

economic clusters deve loping medical school in the region establishing metropolitan area network among the regions cities and establishing capital fund for industrial developmen t centering on the fresnomadera metropolitan area the objective is to creat clusterbased economic development that will act as catalyst for economic dive rsification throughout the sjv region the rji has recognized that significant number of businesses in the region are in position to grow in the coming years if these firms conclude that the sjv can support their expansion they are more lik ely to expand from their current location rather than seek other areas for growing the rji is organized around the idea that cultivating these potentially expanding sectors is viable development strategy this regional effort to spur economic deve lopment through developing endogenous resources as opposed to recruiting businesse s through various incentives to relocate to the area recognizes that the historical patterns of economic change that every region has can be source of creating new competitive advantage the rji has already begun developing its first industr ial cluster based on water and irrigation technologies other clusters include f ood processing health care information processing agile manufacturing tourism advanced logistics and distribution construction innovative energy and tourism117 the strength of the cluster model is that it uses geographic proximity of key actors in production sector to further develop the sector by expanding resear ch that supports particular sector improving training and deve loping new infrastructure local cluster builds on the interactions from ancillary and supporting firms developi ng successful clusters in rural or impoverished areas however may f ace particular obstacles that better capitalized urban regions avoid historic underinvestment in lessfavored region stemming from weak infrastructure low educational levels lowskilled labor lack of access to capital

the san joaquin river is one of the states longest rivers extending 300 miles129 north from its beginnings in the sie rra nevada mountain range to its delta confluence with the sacramento river and san francisco bay baydelta the basin includes several large ri vers originating in the s outhern portion of the sierra nevada mountain range on the eastern edge of the sjv and smaller eastflowing

irrigators and users however the corps facilities are typically built to provide flood control benefits and as with reclamation use is an incidental project purpose 137 the cvp was initially authorized by finding of feasibility by the secretary of the interior under thenexisting reclamation w funds were first provided under the emergency relief appropriation act of 1935 49 stat 115 many of the cvp units were authorized under separate project unit specific statutesthe sierra nevada is approximately 35 inches however precipitation in the sjv itself ranges from 225 inches in the north ern portions and appr oximately 111 inches in the southern portion to 65 inches near the southwestern corner of the hydrologic region133 the san joaquin rivers natural fl ow is highly variable depending on snowfall in the northeastern mountain ranges and rainfall in the southeastern sierra nevada foothills however numerous fl ood control and water supply dams and reservoirs on san joaquin and tulare basi n tributaries regulate the rivers flow even so the observed discharge of the rive r ranged from low of 241 cubic feet per second cfs to 99900 cfs in the period fro m 1930 to 1983 the average discharge was 4783 cfs134 the sjv once supported vast tule ma rshes riparian corridors and other wetlands however development of the area largely for farming and the taming of rivers has changed the ecological character of the sjv dramatically not only has the land base been transformed but the hydrology of the river as well it is difficult to imagine river that is more hydrolog ically modified by humans than the san joaquin the basin has experienced l ong history of flow and capture and diversion almost all the surfacewater flow of the basin had been diverted by as early as 1910135 today most of the rivers suppl is diverted for agricultural and municipal and industrial uses c onsequently the san joaquin river has experienced significant decline in fi sh populations and

water for irrigation under the reclamation act of 1902 as amended136 under this authority and other specific project legislation togethe r known as reclamation law the bureau of reclamation in the department of the interior constructed the central valley project cvp137 the cvp provides water to farmers in 35 counties throughout th central valley of california from the upper reaches of the

fixed repayment rates significant portions of the repayment did not occur as originally scheduled and some contractors were incurring operations nd maintenance cost deficits this situation was addressed in the mid1990s however most of the project capital costs remain to be repaid and under current law must be repaid by 2030 cvp water deliveries typically range from six to seven million acrefeet maf annually it appears appr oximately 48 of these deliver ies are made to contractors in the sjv approximately 19 maf ar imported via the baydelta and cvp annually wh ile another 15 maf are diverted from the san joaquin river via the friantkern and madera canals139 in total approximately 44 of the san joaquin hydrologic regions deve loped supply came from local surface sources 23 from imported surface supplies cvp and the state water project and 33 from groundwater sources in 2000 an average water year the federal water supply infrastructure in the sjv has been the topic of many controversies because wa ter supplied by the federal facilities is sometimes used to raise cotton and other commodity crops environmental and taxpayer groups have accused sjv growers of double dipping in federal programs w ith subsidies for irrigation water as well as for agricultural commodities the most recent controversy stems from an august 2005 report of the environmental working group140

projects in the sjv such as friant dam have also been criticized for their impact on fisheries and water quality in the baydelta and in the san jo aquin river itself project operations have been the subject of numerous lawsuits and ultimately resulted in the development of the calfed program to address the wa ter quality water supply reliability and ecosystem needs of the california baydelta and its major tributaries calfed was started as way to forestall what many believed could have resulted in significantly reduced water supplies due to possible non compliance of the cvp and the parallel state water project swp with clean water act and endangered species act requirements implementation of these laws combined with the central valley project improvement act t itle 34 pl102575 which in cluded dedication of 08 maf of cvp water supplies to fish and wildlife have resulted in reduced water deliveries to agricultural contractors in some cases and remain an ongoing tension for water management and water supply reliability in the sjv numerous water supply issues have arisen in the sjv growing urbanization and population increases have resulted in new demand fo r water for purposes however even though the sjv enjoys significant natural and imported water supplies these supplies are already allocat ed and in some cases are overallocated making it difficult to accommodate new demands further this overallocation often via diversions from the san joaqui n river has resulted in reduced flows that have contributed to the dec line of natural fish species in the san joaquin river and the san joaquinsacramento baydelta some of which have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal esa142 to meet environmen tal requirements some water has been dedicated to environmenta l purposes that were not addressed when the cvp was constructed ot her water demands have been met with voluntary water transfers from agricultural to urban uses the extent to which water delivered via federal facilities is available to be used or chosen to be used by agriculture is an issue of utmost concern in the sjv and critical to the longterm development and vision for the valley generally speaking water allocation decisions water rights decisions are made by the state however significant quantities of water are governed by federal contracts and deliveries in certain circumstances might be reduced in cases where project operations must meet certain federal environmental regulations eg reductions in delta outflows during certain periods the contr actual obligations of the fe deral government to deliver water must be considered in contemplating any changes in project water usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33184crs248 143 see for example tulare lake basin water storage

term at least as practical matter is likely to occur only between willing sellers and willing buyers except for cases where project operations are found to violate state andor federal law how public and private entities plan for future growth and development when wate r rights are already allocated and owned by hundreds if not thousands of public and pr ivate parties is perhaps one of the most difficult challenges facing the region water quality issues in the sjv144 overview the sjv has experienced several significant environmental and natural resource challenges over the past two decades most notably issues surrounding water supply and quality air quality and growth and urban sprawl while significant progress has been achieved in addressing some of these issues the sjv continues to face major environmental issues that are closely related to existing economic sectors and can affect economic velopment planning for the future the geography and climate of the sjv make the basin vulnerable to air pollution from angeles and the areas rapid growth over the past decade has increased air pollution problems particulate pollution is significant concern with some sjv cities among the worst in the united states irrigated agriculture and water quality in 1991 the us geological survey usgs began an assessment of trends in quality of the nations water resources through series of intensive sampling and analytic projects within major river basins and aquifer systems one of the studied systems is the san joaquin tulare basins comprising the eightcounty area discussed in this report the sjv produces about 5 of the total value of agricultural production in the united states the valleys highly productive agricultural economy results from factors that include abundant water and the long growing season consequently agriculture is both the major user of the regions water resources 90 of the nearly 17 million acrefeet per year in offstream water use in this area is for irrigated agriculture and the major influence on the quality of those resources number of regulated point sources di scharge treated wastewater into the regions surface waters including municipal sewage treatment plants and food processing manufacturing and oil and gas facilities however changes in water quality in the san joaquintulare basins are primarily due to the large amount of irrigated agriculture which affects the qua lity of both surface and groundwater in the valley according to usgs145 large quantities of agricultural chemicals are usedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33184crs249 145

nitrogen and phos phorus fertilizers in 1990 and 79 million pounds active ingredient of pesticides in 1991 during the subsequent decade 1991 to 1999 pesticide use reportedly increased 43 to 114 m illion pounds in addition the livestock industry contributed 318 milli on pounds active ingredient of nitrogen and phosphorus from manure in 1987 an amount that has undoubtedly increased as result of more intensive livestock operations in the valley for example from 1987 to 1996 the number of dairy cattle in the sjv increased 46 from 582000 to 850000146 several water quality issues are of concern in the valley region147 increased salinity in the lower san joaquin river this issue is considered by most agencies to be the most serious water quality issue in the area the problem results from an increase in the volume of saline water from agricultural areas and decrease in the volume of lowsalinity runoff from the sierra nevada into the river elevated concentrations of naturally occurring trace elements including arsenic boron molybde num chromium and selenium accumulation of trace elements including selenium and mercury have been identified in wate rfowl and aquatic organisms increased pesticide contaminati on of both ground and surface water usgs sampling detected 49 pesticid in the san joaquin river and its tributaries some at concentr ations high enough to adversely impact aquatic life usgs also found longbanned organochlorine insecticides such as ddt in rive r and stream sediments and biota increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater fertilizers manure from livestock and septic system s throughout the valley are sources of nitrate in ground water usgs found nitrates at levels that violated drinking water standards in 25 of residential wells that were tested at high concentrations nitrates in drinking water can cause fatal lack of blood oxygen in infants called methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome148httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33184crs250 reduced concentrations of dissolv ed oxygen in the san joaquin river attributed to discharge of wastewater from municipal sewage treatment plants low dissolved oxygen is detrimental to fisheries and other aquatic resources in addition to impacts of degraded water quality waterfowl and aquatic resources are affected by reduced habitat including wetlands as agricultural activities expanded in the valley wetlands and riparian forests were drained cleared and converted to agricultural land the re mnant wetlands are less than 8 of the wetland acreage before settlement of the sjv in the 19th century wetland areas now include public lands managed by state and federal agencies as well as privately owned duck clubs the water quality of the san joaquin river is of critical interest because it flows to the sacramentosan joaquin delta both the deltamendota canal which supplies irrigation water to farms in the western sjv and th california aqueduct which supplies part of the drinking water for 15 million people in southern california originate in the delta actions to address impaired waters the federal clean water act cwa takes cooperative fe deralism approach in which states that have been approved by the federal g overnment to administer their own cwa programs including california take the lead in keep ing their own waters clean and the federal government serves in strong supervis ory capacity to ensure the job gets done properly section 303 of the act requires st ates to establish wa ter quality standards for the waters within their boundaries that are subject to cwa jurisdiction water quality standards consist of signated beneficial uses for waterbody for example recreation drinking water industrial use and criteria specifying how clean it must be to support the designated use while water quality standards by themselves do not clean up any water they are necessary pa rt of the process under section 303d waters that fail to meet standards after application of appropr iate pollution control technology are identified as impaire d and are prioritized for cleanup the total maximum daily load tmdl provisions in section 303d of the act provide the process for states to

necessary to achieve and maintain the applicable standards the tmdl is not selfenforcing document once wlaslas are quantified states are responsible for translating allocations among point sources through mo re stringent controls incorporated into discharge permits and nonpoint sources for waters impaired by nonpoint source runoff because there are federal controls over these sources under the clean water act the primary imp lementation measures are staterun nonpoint source management programs coupled with st ate local and fede ral land management programs and authorities and financial assistance programs for example farmers and ranchers may be asked to use alternative methods in their operations to prevent fertilizers and pesticides from reaching streams states may require c ities to manage or control runoff from streets the tmdl process allows for states to make point sourcenonpoint source control tradeoffs epa may approve or disapprove tmdls developed by the state if epa disapproves tmdl it is then required to establish tmdl in california the authority and respons ibility to develop tmdls rests with the regional water quality control boards rwqcb through the regional boards the state has identified and listed 687 impaire d water segments in the state since many waters are impaired by more than single pollutant the list identified 1774 total impairments for waters of the state the central valley regional water quality control board with jurisdiction over the tire sacramento san joaquin river and tulare lake basins stretching from the oregoncalifornia border to the tehachapi mountains in the south is responsible for developing and implementing tmdls to address these impairments within each of the eight counties disc ussed in this report the central valley rwqcb has identified impairments from number of pollutants including pesticides trace elements salinity bacteria and pathogens and has established phased schedule for the seve ral required tmdls one of the listed waters is the san joaquin river and according to the states analysis it is impaired for multiple pollutants including salinity boron selenium the pesticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos

region total maximum daily load for salinity and boron in the lower san joaquin river january 2002 text available at httpwwwswrcbcagovrwqcb5programstmdlsalt_boron saltandborontmdljan2002pdfa tmdl example the complexity of the tmdl process is illustrated in the lower san joaquin river sa linity and boron tmdl adopted by the regional board in september 2004 the tmdl describes th magnitude and location of the sources of salt and boron loading to the river and divides the watershed into seven component subareas to identify differences between geographic areas approximately 67 percent of the lsjrs total salt load and 85 percent of the boron load originates from the west side of the san joaquin river grasslands and northwest side subareas agricu ltural drainage discharge from managed wetlands and groundwater accretions are th principle sic sources of salt and boron loading to the river additionally largescale outofbasin water transfers have reduced the assimilative capacity of the river thereby exacerbating the salt and boron water quality problems at the same time imported irrigation water from the delta has increased salt loading to the basin salts in supply water from the delta account for almost half of the lsjrs mean annual salt load150 to address these problems the tmdl proposes salt waste load reductions for the city of turlock and the city of mode sto wastewater treatment plants the two point sources that discharge directly to the waterbody the analysis considers the many complexities of sources in the watershed with water being both imported and exported as well as the need to account for background salt loading and groundwater contributions plus accounting for consumptive use allocation due to evapoconcentration of salts in supply water the tmdl states that the rivers salinity problem is not conducive to establis hing simple fixed load allocation for nonpoint sources and the plan would divide required allocations among agricultural and other sources in the seven geographic s ubareas load allocations to the subareas are proportional to the quantity of nonpoint source land use which is the sum of agricultural lands and managed we tlands within the subarea the allocation includes giving responsibility to the us bureau of reclamation to reduce salt loadings in cvp water that is delivered to the project area of the tmdl because the cvp has had large impact on flow and salt loading and contributed to degradation of the ljsrs water quality wetland discharges from sources owned and managed by number of entities in two subareas grasslands and san joaquin river upstream of salt slough also are identified as one of the sources of salinity problems in the waters hed and consequently are included in the load reductions to implement the tmdl load allocations to nonpoint sources vary by month and wateryear type higher durin g wet months and years since they are dependent on background levels groundwater loads and wasteload allocations to point sources these complexities generated considerable controversy and debate during review of the plan regarding rge number of technical issues economics and timeline the tmdl proposes an 820 year

the central valley because of the importance of livestock operations to the regions agricultural economy in februa ry 2003 epa adopted final regulations for concentrated animal feeding operations cafos which now require all large animal feeding operations to apply for clean water act discharge permit151 the rules established performance expectations for existing and new sources to ensure they store manure and wastewater properly and utilize proper land applications at cafos under the rules which apply to about 15500 livestock operations acrosshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33184crs254 152 approximately 98 of the california dairy facilities impacted by the cafo rules are located in the central valley and santa ana re gions in addition approximately 250 dairies in the region are subject

stanislaus merced and tulare counties152 of these approximately 1000 are of sufficient size to meet the federal defin ition of large cafo based on threshold of 700 mature dairy cows thus requiring them to seek clean water act permit historically most dairies in the region operated under waiver of waste discharge requirements this waiver expired in january 2003 the central valley rwqcb is developing general permit to implement both the federal rules and state regulations which prescribe minimum standards for discharges of animal waste at confined animal facilities to protect both surface wa ter and groundwater including monitoring requirements153 the draft permit has been controversial and dairy farmers believe that the requirements will be too costly to implement putting their operations at competitive disadvantage compared with dairies in other states according to an analysis by western united dairymen wud the cost to comply with the permits will be 40000 initially and 30000 annually staff of the regional board acknowledge that the wuds overall estimate appears reas onable costs would be phased in over two to four ears depending on the herd si ze and roughly half of the costs are associated with installation of groundwater monitoring wells which in itially would apply only to dairies with 1300 or more mature dairy cows funding sources for cafos there are

1980s162 i n l s angeles by contrast concen trations of ozone and the number of days on which the standard is exceeded have both been cut in half since 1980163 in part the valleys lack of progress may be due to the importance of air pollutants transported into it from outside principally from the bay area another factor may be the more significant role of agriculture as an emissions source in the

californias total obligations this per centage varied from year to year from low of just 4 in 1995 to high of 155 in 1998 these variations reflect project c onstruction cycles based on statistics from

because as transporta tion costs decline the customer base of local businesses expands in other words local businesses can reach markets that were once unobtainable because the cost of transportation kept them from being price competitive transportation improvements can also lower the cost of inputs for local businesses conversely infrastructure c onstraints that cause congestion delays can be damaging to businesses pecially those that place high value on reliability and transit time in recent years many i ndustries have improve d their productivity by reducing inventory levels and increasing their reliance on justintime deliveries because economic development including job retainment and creation can be aided by freight transportation fac ilities public officials often express interest in using public funds to finance freight improveme nts particularly in distressed areas an issue policymakers confront is whet her it is appropriate to use public funds to assist largely private enterprise ca rgo owners trucking fi rms vessel operators port and rail terminal operato rs and railroads are all fo rprofit privately owned businesses in the case of railroads the rightofways

railroads face that is particularly re levant to the sjv is the tehachapi pass which connects the central valley and the angeles area the railroads would like to add second track over the pass to accommodate increased freight traffic but to do so will require building tunnels and bridges because of th difficult terrain short line railroads in the sjv face similar situation as do other s hort line railroads in other parts of the country they need to upgrade their track to handle the larger 286000 pound railcars that the main line railroads are increasin gly using short line railroads typically operate on routes that were formerly part of main line railr oads network but were abandoned by the main line ra ilroad due to low profitability on that route before abandonment the main line ra ilroad often deferre d maintenance on these sections of track focusing their resources on their trunk lines the federal role in funding rail infrastructure is limited largely b ecause the railroads are forprofit corporations with exclusive access to their privately owned rightofways congress has reaut horized program called the railroad rehabilitation and im provement financin g program rrif pl 10959 which provides loans and loan guarantees for ra il infrastructure improvements however funds have been appropriate d to the rrif program in recent years as part of the american jobs creation act pl 108357 wh ich was signed into law on october 22 2004 congress enacted the local railroa d rehabilitation and investment act which provides tax credits to short line railroads such as the sjv railroad for track rehabilitation or maintenance189 in the fy2001 consolidated appropriations act pl 106554 congress provided th sjv railroad 3 million economic development initiative grant to upgrade 45 mile section of track between huron and visalia warehouse and distribution employment improving the infrastructure that supports the perishables delivery networ k in the sjv would most directly benefit the producers of these goods increasing th value of their land but may do little to improve the economic welfar of nonlandowners in the area another issue is whether or how freight transportation might be used as means to diversify the employment base for example could the valley capitalize on its location next to two of the most prominent gateways for us trade the united states is the largest maritime trading nation and the marine container shipping business is growing from 1995 to 2001 merchandise imported and exported through us seaports

most efficient way to store container awaiting truck pick up is on chassis steel frame with wheels due to space constraints at many ports containers may be stacked up to six high requiring unstacking and restackin g when the trucker arrives for pick up the additional time required may cause truck back ups at the ports entrance gate 194 john buntin pier pressure ports are strugg ling to balance the

angeles it increased by 85 at long beach it increased by 50 and at oakland it increased by 5190 at the ports of angeles and long beach container trade is expected to triple over the next two decades191 combined the ports of oakland angeles and long beach handle more than 40 of the nations total marine container volume192 the inland port concept general cargo shippe d in marine containers requires large staging area at the port where containers can await transfer to ship for export or truck pickup for import193 however while container ports face pressing need for more waterfront land ot her interests in the port city may view waterfront property as more valuable for re sidential office or retail development194 the additional space requirements of container terminals led to the shift of cargo handling from san francisco to oakland with space crunch at the urban waterfront container ports are looking inland for more land195 they are looking beyond the immediate urban area in search of less expensive land in semirural or suburban areas beyond city limits these so called inland ports aka satellite or feeder ports could serve as container sorting facilities where local cargo moving by truck could be separa ted from longdistance cargo moving by rail the inland port could be connected with the waterfront port by rail link which would shuttle containers between the two ports to the ex tent that rail shuttle displaced container movement by truck it would have the potential to mitigate road congestion and air pollution in port community the downside of the inland port concept is that it inserts an extra link in the container s upply chain increasing transport costs and transit time compared to direct truck or rail move to the seaport whether the inland port concept is economically viable for given container port rgely depends on the spread between real estate costs and transportation costs in the area in essence the inland port concept substitutes expensive ur ban waterfront real estate with less expensive rural or suburban real estate plus the cost of shorthaul shuttle train the san pedro ports are examining the inland empire an area east of the city of

while both these areas already are clusters of cargo activity rail shuttle linking them to their respective seaports does not exist but is being studied by both ports while the inland empire is not located in the sjv the stockton area is located at the northern end of the valley and thus may have the potential for freight related employment as means of diversifying the employment base in the northern end of the valley the port of oakland has also entered into an arrangement with the city of shafter as an inland port location197 although shafter located near bakersfield is only about 100 miles from angeles it has teamed up w ith the port of oakland nearly 300 miles to the north the strategy is to route cont ainers of imported merc handise destined for the angeles market through the port of oakland and on to shafter by rail shuttle in shafter the imported c ontainers will be unloaded at retailers warehouses located in the area some large retailers have located their distribution centers in the shafter bakersfield area to supply the an geles market once unloaded the empty containers will then be available for the export of sjv produce back through the port of oakland as mentioned above the san pedro ports ar generally the first port of call for container ships arriving from asia but due to congestion at these ports the port of oakland believes it can capture some of the imported cargo bound for angeles northwest container services will provide the rail shuttling of marine containers between oakland and shafter198 the logistics park concept in the container shipping business it is often said that the commodity most often shipped is air merchandise imported in containers is heavily skewed toward cons umer products and thus destined for urban areas in contrast us goods exported in containers are heavily skewed toward agricultural products and thus originate in rural areas containe r shippers must pay for the cost of moving empt containers from urban surplu s areas to rural deficit areas locating importers where the exporters are in order to reduce empty container repositioning costs is strategy be ing pursued by at least one firm199 the concept of building logistics park as opposed to an industrial park is gaining attention as an economic development tool200 logistics park would facilitate the distribution of consumer goods to major retail markets the sjvs mid state location could offer big box retailers the option of locating one megasized warehouse to serve both angeles and san francisco rather than building separate warehouses on the fringes of these cities although trucking costs would be greater with one warehouse serving both markets overhead costs would be ss than operating two warehouses and land is less expensive in the central sjv than at the periphery of angeles and san francisco the cost equation would involve substituting more transportation for less expensive real estate however rising fuel prices rising

t of inland ports or logistics parks is one program administered by the fhwa th congestion mitiga tion and air quality improvement program cmaq can be used to improve rail links to ports where truck traffic and their emissions are redu ced and the region is in an air quality non attainment area in addition the public works and developm ent facilities program administered by the economic development administration of the department of commerce is also relevant to freight tran sportation projects this program can be used to improve access roads to industrial parks make port imp rovements and build business incubator facilities if they are located in distressed communities202 high speed rail and economic development california is studying the feasibility of building high speed rail line connecting the san francisco bay area through the central valley to angeles and san diego the network would be approximate ly 700 miles in length with exclusive tracks that are fully grade separated for most of the system and with trains capable of traveling up to speeds of 220 mph the pr ojected cost to construct the system is 33 to 37 billion in 2003 dollars203 california voters will decide on bond measure in 2006 to pay for part of the project if approved the economic growth potential of the train on the sjv will depend on whether and how often the train will stop in the valley reportedly at november 2004 meeting the california high speed rail authority is proposing only one stop in the sjv at fresno204 there would be stops along the 120 mile section between fresno and bakersfield the most direct economic development bene fits that could be linked to high speed rail line require station stops in the sjv station devel opment effects

property owners that could expect the value of their land to increase development around the station could also generate jobs and diversify the employme nt base however station development effects are probably most applicable to commuter rail line and could be minimal in the case of an intercity rail line in order for transportation improvements to generate economic activity economic velopers stress that something else must be happening by which they mean that the infrastructure improvement must facilitate connection to center of economic activity simply connecting nowhere to nowhere will not generate development205 increasing the number of station stops in the sjv greatly adds to travel time for the passengers traveling between the san francisco bay area and angeles or san diego thus as stops are added between these rail line end points the econo mic rationale for the additional cost of purchasing highspeed train sets and building and maintaining high speed track is greatly undermined stati on development aside ec onomic development impacts could also be linked to the construction nd maintenance of the track in the sjv as well as employment associated with runni ng the trains highspeed rail line may also stimulate train equipment and repa ir supply industry although these suppliers need not necessarily locate in the sjv perhaps the biggest potential economic impact that highspeed rail line could have on the sjv would be its impact on the california state budget the united states experience with amtrak and its predecessors as well as the experience of foreign countries that have built highspeed rail lines suggest that intercity passenger rail is almost always moneylosing ope ration although originally envisioned as forprofit corporation amtrak has failed to achieve profit or even operational selfsufficiency it has continued to rely on annual and increasin g federal subsidies to recoup its losses likewi in foreign countries that have built state of the art highspeed rail infrastructure namely japan and france it is the exception rather than the norm for given route to achieve operational selfsufficiency huge drain on government resources has prompted many countries to experiment with new ways of organizing and financing their intercity railroads in recent years to generate sufficient fare revenue to at least cover ope rating costs ie the cost of running the trains not building and maintaining the track intercity railroads require enough passengers to run nearly full trains repetitively put simply traffic density is key moreover the potential to reach sufficient traffic density has lot to do with factors external to the railway such as city landscape population densities distances between cities and their configuration with respect to one another and the prices of alternative modes to name just few rail passenger service can become significant drain on public resources thereb impacting other state programs that also have
