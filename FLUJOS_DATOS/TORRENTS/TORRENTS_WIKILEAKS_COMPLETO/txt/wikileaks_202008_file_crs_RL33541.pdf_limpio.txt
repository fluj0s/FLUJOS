updated july 26 2007 remy jurenas specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33541background on sugar policy issues summary the sugar program authorized by th 2002 farm bill pl 107171 is designed to protect the price received by growers of sugarcane and sugar beets and by firms that process these crops into sugar to accomplish this the us department of agriculture usda makes loans available at mandated price levels to processors limits the amount of sugar that processors can sell domestically and restricts imports in support of the program sugar crop grow ers and processors stress the industrys importance in providing jobs and income in rural areas food and beverage firms that use sugar argue that us sugar polic imposes costs on consumers and has led some food manufacturers to move jobs overseas where sugar is cheaper in major policy change the 2002 farm bill reactivated sugar marketing allotments that limit the amount of domestica lly produced sugar that processors can sell the level at which usda sets the national sugar allotment quantity in turn has implications for sugar prices accordingl sugar crop producers and processors on one side and sugar users on the other ve sought to advance their interests by influencing the decisions that usda ma kes on allotment and import quota levels the issue of additional sugar imports crowding out domestic production was divisive when congress debated the do minican republiccentral american free trade agreement drcafta in 2005 ce then attention on sugar trade issues has turned to the potential impact of free tr ade in sugar and highfructose corn syrup hfcs substitute and cheaper sweetener between the united states and mexico which takes effect on january 1 2008 unrestricted sugar imports from mexico are projected to result in budget outlays estimated at 14 billion over 10 years as us processors default on pri ce support loans this outlook conflicts with the current objective that the program operate at cost and has become key issue in crafting sugar provisions for the 2007 farm bill the house agriculture committeerepor ted farm bill hr 2419 would mandate sugarforethanol program intended to address any sugar surplus that arises as result of imports usda would be re quired to purchase as much usproduced sugar as necessary to maintain market pr ices above support leve ls purchased sugar would then be sold to bioenergy producer s for processing into ethanol the ccc would provide openended f unding for this program other provisions would increase minimum guaranteed prices for raw cane and refined beet sugar by almost 3 and tighten the rules that usda must follow to implement marketing allotments and administer import quotas ie remove di scretionary authority these provisions reflect recommendations made by gar crop producers and processors food and beverage manufacturers that use sugar oppose these provisions arguing that they would take sugar pr ogram from bad to worse would increase costs by 100 million annually to consumers and would restrict the availability of sugar for food use in the domestic market th ey have signaled their intent to offer amendments during house floor debate to strike some of the committeereported provisions andor to extend the current program this re port will be

domestic sugar producers and processors call for increasing sugar price support levels by almost 3 revising marketing allotment authority to guarantee the domestic sector minimum 85 share of the us marketplace and mandating that surplus sugar be purchased for resale for pr ocessing into ethanol as one way to meet the programs nocost objective suga r producers and processors support the measure appreciative that current sugar policy was not weakened domestic manufacturers of food and beve rage products that use sugar represented by the sweetener users association sua res ponded that the proposed program would take the us sugar program from bad to worse increase costs to consumers and result in sugar program costs of almost 2 billion during the farm bills five years history of and background on the sugar program governments of every sugarproducing nation intervene to protect their domestic industry from fluctuating world market prices such intervention is necessary it is argued because both sugar cane and sugar beets must be processed soon after harvest using costly processing machinery when farmers significantly reduce production because of low prices cane or beet processing plant typically shuts down usually never to reopen this close link between production and capital intensive processing makes price stab ility important to industry survival the united states has long history of protection and support for its sugar industry the sugar acts of 1934 1937 nd 1948 required the us department of agriculture usda to estimate domestic sugar consumption and divide this market by assigning quotas to us growers and fo reign countries these acts also authorized payments to growers when needed as an incentive to limit production and levied excise taxes on sugar processe d and refined in the united st ates this type of sugar program expired in 1974 for the next seve n years the us market was relatively open to foreign sugar imports with ma ndatory price support provided only in 1977 and 1978 and discretionary s upport in 1979 congress rein stated mandatory price support for sugar in the agriculture and food act of 1981 and the food security acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33541crs2 of 1985 subsequently the 1990 farm bill the 1993 budget reconciliation bill and the 1996 and 2002 farm bills extended sugar pr ogram authority the last bill extends it up through the 2007 crop year ie most of fy2008 even with price protection available to producers the united states historically has not produced enough sugar to satisfy domestic demand and t hus continues to be net sugar importer prior to the ear ly 1980s domestic sugar growers supplied roughly 55 of the us sugar market th is share has grown over the last 25 years reflecting the price protection provided by the sugar program in fy2006 domestic production f illed 73 of us sugar demand for food and beverage use as high fructose corn syrup hfcs displaced sugar in the united states during the early 1980s and domestic suga r production increased later in that decade foreign suppliers absorbed the entire adjustment and saw their share of the us market decline significantly the import share of us sugar food use in fy2006 was 27 current us sugar policy maintains domestic sugar prices above the world market price and is structured to prot ect the domestic sugar producing sector sugar beet and sugarcane producers and the pro cessors of their crops and to ensure sufficient supply during 2006 the us raw sugar domestic futures price averaged 221lb compared to the world raw sugar fu tures price of 155lb because of the price differential us consumers and manufacturers of foods and beverages pay more for sugar than they would if impor ts were allowed to enter without any restriction various studies show that ove r the last 15 years us sugar users paid between 400 million and 19 billion more for gar annually these cost to user estimates vary widely and largely reflect the extent of the difference between the higher us price and the lower world price for sugar in the time period examined and the differing assumptions and met hodology analysts use to develop such estimates the sugar program differs from grains ri ce peanut and cotton programs in that usda makes direct payments to beet and cane growers and processors structured this way taxpayers do not di rectly support the prog ram through federal government outlays this fact is highlighted as positive feature by the sugar production sector and progra m supporters the program s support level and import protection though keep the us sugar price above the price of sugar traded internationally and c onstitute an indirect subsidy to the production sector by way of higher costs paid by us sugar users and consumers pr ogram opponents frequently refer to this subsidy component to argue for changes to us sugar policy main features of us sugar policy us sugar policy uses three tools to ensure that domestic growers and sugar processors receive minimum price for their sugar this price is largely determined by the statutorilyset loan rate marketing allotments limit the amount of domesticallyproduced sugar that can be sold when imports are estimated below specified level import quotas restrict th amount of foreign sugar allowed to enter the us market usda decisions in administering these tools are intended to balance available sugar supply ie domes tic output plus imports with us foodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33541crs3 demand for sugar so that market prices do not fall below eff ective support levels the 2002 farm bill further requires usda to operate the sugar program on cost basis ie to result in federal government outlays price support loans usda extends nonrecourse price support loans to processors of sugarcane and sugar beets rather than directly to the farmers who harvest these crops loans are available only to processors who agree to pay growers for deliveries of sugar beets and sugarcane at usdaset minimum payment levels their nonrecourse feature means processor can exercise the legal right to hand over sugar it initially offered usda as collateral for the loan to meet its repayment obligation if the market price is below the effective support level when the loan comes due these loans at times can be attractive to sugar processors as source of shortterm credit at belowprime interest rates loan rates the 2002 farm bill freezes loan rates through the 2007 crop year at 18lb for raw cane sugar and 229lb for refined beet sugar these rates have not changed since 1995 the loan support for beet sugar is set higher than for raw sugar because it is available immediately afte r processing in refined form ready for industrial food and beve rage use and for human consum ption by contrast raw cane sugar must go through second stage of pro cessing at cane refinery to be converted into white refined sugar effective support levels the above loan rates do not serve as the intended price floor for sugar in prac tice usdas aim is to support the raw cane sugar price at not less than 2072 to 2146l b ie the states price support level plus an amount that covers processors co st to transport raw cane sugar to cane refinery plus the interest paid on any price support loan taken out plus location discounts similarly usda seeks to support the refined beet sugar price at not less than 235 to 2713lb ie the regional loan rate plus specified marketing costs plus interest paid on price support loan plus cash discount to ensure that market prices do not fall below these loa n forfeiture or effective price support levels usda administers sugar marketin g allotments and import quotas loan forfeiture turning over sugar pledged as loan collateral to usda occurs if processor concludes that the domestic market price when the loan comes due is below the effective sugar support level for its state or region it is this level not the loan rate that represents the minimum level of program benefits intended for sugar crop growers and processors marketing allotments the 2002 addition of marketing allotme nts to support domestic sugar prices reflected the sugar production sectors willingness to accept reduced sales in return for the assurance of price protection allo tments serve as tool to ensure that any growth in us sugar demand is first met by the us sugar sector and to guarantee both the beet and cane sectors specific share of the us market by regulating the amount of sugar that processors can sell usda is expected to meet the programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33541crs4 nocost objective by keeping market prices above effective s upport levels and thus not acquiring sugar as result of any loan forfeitures allotments required when suga r imports are below trigger level usda is required to announce marke ting allotments when it projects annual sugar imports will be below 1532 million short tons st referred to as the trigger level by limiting the amount of suga r that beet sugar refiners and raw cane mills can sell this mechanism ensures that the united states m eets its market access commitments for sugar imports under the world trade organization wto and nafta agreements see import quotas usda must weigh several factors to calcu late the amount of domestic sugar that can be sold the overall allotment quantity or oaq 1 estimated consumption 2 reasonable ending stocks 3 begi nning stocks and 4 imports for human consumption the formula that us da uses to determine the oaq must accommodate imports under both trade agr eements up to the 1532 million st level usda can further adjust the oaq if necessary to avoid loan forfeitures second the oaq must be split between the beet and cane sectors using 5435 and 4565 shares respectively separate rules specify how each sectors allotment is to be allocated ie distributed to each processing firm once detailed calculations are made each firm can sell only as much sugar as stated in its allotment notification received from usda sugar produced in exce ss of firms allotment must be held off the market referred to as blocked stocks figure 1 illustrates how usda implemented marketing allo tments for fy2006 the second year it activated some of the lessknown features of this authority allotments suspended when imports exceed trigger level i f usda estimates sugar imports will be above 1532 million st usda must suspend marketing allotments with the one exception noted below if allotments are triggered usda is still require d to make available price support loans to raw cane sugar processors and beet sugar refiners suspending allotments though would raise considerable uncertainty for domestic suga r prices depending upon the us sugar production and food use outlook at that point in time and estimate d imports of sugar for food consumption price scenarios could vary considerably if sugar processors use the suspension to release blocked stocks of sugar sugar prices depending upon the additional import amount and the amount of stocks released could decline to below loan forfeiture levels this would likely result in usda acquiring sugar from processors that decide not to repay their loans if us demand for sugar is higher than can be met by the domestic sugar s ector either from projected output andor blocked stocks prices as additional imports enter under suspension could very well rise and likely stay above loan forfeiture levelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33541crs5 the usda initial determination of the oaq by august 1 for the marketing year that begins october 1 and any subsequent adjustments are the most significant decisions made in implementing marketing allotment authority accordingly sugar processors and food manufacturers eg us ers of sugar weigh in to influence usdas decisionmaking process on this i ssue each group differs in how usda should define reasonable ending stocks key determinant of the level of domestic sugar prices in the last quarter of the marketing year july to september when price support loans come due ho wever usda must estimate year in advance even though market conditions can change significantly during this period an oaq level intended to result in market prices 12 months later that are above effective support levels sugar processors favor smaller

suspending allotments littlenoticed exception in the law allows usda not to suspend allotments when additional imports exceed the trigger level because the beet or cane s ector is unable to supply sugar against their allotment since the law does not allow for example cane sugar deficit to be met with any available surplus of b eet sugar usda can reassign such an allotment deficit or shortfall to im ports this occurred three times late in fy2005 and five times in fy2006 when us da reassigned allotment deficits to imports in order to alleviate tight supply situation see import quotas and figure 1 for more on the relationship between allotments and imports fy2006 and fy2007 allotment announcements on february 2 2006 usda increased the fy2006 oaq to 935 million st in order to respond to continuing tight sugar market caused largely by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma which reduced domestic supplies this decision allowed both the beet and cane sectors unlike previous years to sell all of their fy2006 sugar output against their allotment share of the oaq to meet the balance of us sugar demand that could not be met from domestic sources usda reassigned the large cane sectors and small beet sectors allotment shortfall to imports figure 1 earlier on september 30 2005 usda announced the in itial details of fy 2006 marketing allocations for beet processing companie s cane state allo tments and processor allocations were announced later on march 22 2006 after the companyspecific impacts from the 2005 seasons hu rricanes had become clear on july 27 2006 usda set the fy2007 oaq at 875 million st reflecting its assessment of the upcoming years gar supply and demand outlook projecting that 20062007 us sugar production and ca rryin stocks would not be enough to meet domestic needs and rebuild ending stocks to reasonable levels usda immediately announced supply shortfall of 350000 st this entire deficit was reassigned to imports reflected in th related sugar import quota announcement to help exporters facilitate shipping arrangements usda stated this was intended to ensure that sufficient sugar is available to the us market earlier than would otherwise occur usda also signaled that appropriate adjustments to the oaq would be made during fy2007 to ensure the domestic market is adequately supplied to avoid loan forfeitures and to prevent market disruptions import quotas usda restricts the quantity of foreign sugar allowed to enter the united states for refining and sale for domestic food nd beverage use by controlling the amount of sugar allowed to enter usda seeks to ensure that market prices do not fall below effective price support levels and thus not acquire sugar due to loan forfeitures ie meet the nocost requirement thoug h the sugar import quotas are not directly addressed by farm bill provisions usda and the office of the us trade representative ustr administer them as an integral part of the sugar program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33541crs7 1 trq combines two policy instruments used to restrict imports quotas and tariffs the quota component works together with specified tariff level to provide the desired degree of import protection imports entering under th quota portion of trq are usually subject to lower or sometimes zero tariff rate this inquota amount represents the minimum that country has committed to allow to ente r under multilateral or other trade agreements imports above the quotas quantitative threshold referred to as abovequota face much higher usually prohibitive tarifftariffrate quotas trqs are used to rest rict sugar imports to the extent needed to meet us sugar program objectives1 the us market access commitment made under wto rules means that minimum of 1256 million st of foreign sugar must be allowed to enter the domestic mark et each year although the wto commitment sets minimum import level policymaker s may allow additional amounts of sugar to enter if needed to meet domestic demand as occurred in fy2005 and fy2006 and announced for fy2007 in addition the ited states is committed to allow sugar to enter from mexico under nafta provisi ons the complex terms are detailed in schedule and controversial and disputed side letter which lay out the rules and the formula to calculate how much sugar mexico can sell to the us market through fy2008 the maximum amount that can enter from mexico is 276000 st see sweetener disputes with mexico mexicos terms of access to the us sugar market below under the wto agreement foreign sugar enters under two trqs one for raw cane another for small quantity of refined sugar under the nafta trq and the drcafta trq sugar can enter either in raw or refined form the ustr allocates the wto trqs among 41 eligible countries including mexico and canada the amount entering under the inquota portion is subject to zero or low duty sugar that enters in amounts above the wto quota is subject to prohibitive tariff 78 in 2003 according to the international trade commission serving to protect the us sugarproducing sector from the entry of additional foreign sugar the tariff on bove quota sugar ente ring from mexico under nafta equivalent to about 7 in 2007 will fall to zero on january 1 20 08 in addition other trqs limit the import of three categor ies of sugarcontaining products scps products containing more than 10 gar other articles containing

estimateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33541crs9 sugar imports in the first two years of current sugar program authority fy2003 and fy2004 were well below the trigger vel with significantly lower domestic sugar supplies caused by weatherrelated problems in fy2005 and fy2006 permitted sugar imports were bove this level however above average imports did not result in the suspension of allotment s because usda determined the additional imports were needed to meet us sugar demand see exception to suspending allotments above to explain furthe r usda decided late in fy2005 to allow additional imports to add to domestic supplies tightened by the effects of hurricane katrina this resulted in fy2005 impor ts of 16 million st 68000 st above the trigger level however because much of the lateyear increase in imports was due to the inability of the cane sugar sector to fully utilize its increased allotment these imports used to cover the cane allotment s hortfall did not count against the trigger level for fy2006 usda projected lower sugar output and reassigned increases in the cane and beet allotment deficits to im ports to boost the availability of both raw and refined sugar taken together thes decisions plus imports under drcafta equaled fy2006 sugar imports of 3095 million st 1563 million st above the trigger level but did not result in the suspension of allotments similarly usda currently projects fy2007 sugar imports at 1634 million st 102000 st above the trigger level allotments again were not suspended because of the need for additional imports for fy2008 usdas im port estimates plus the us commitment to allow at least 193000 st of mexican sugar to enter under nafta trq could total 1657 million st 125000 st bove the trigger level see figure 2 the issue of the potential impact of sugar imports on the us sugar program under drcafta has receded for now b ecause usda included these imports when setting the fy2006 and fy2007 oaqs looking ahead whether sugar imports in fy2008 the last year covered by current sugar program authority activate the trigger to suspend allotments will depend on the extent to which domestic sugar production particularly in the hurricanea ffected cane sector recovers and the degree that us commitments under existing trade agreements allow more sugar to enter than the us sugar market can absorb and still allow usda to administer the program at nocost the issue of whethe r allotments might be suspended if imports result in more sugar than the us market needs ie exceeds the trigger level though likely was made moot by pledge made by the secretary of agriculture during congressional debate on drcaf ta in june 29 2005 letter to the chairmen of the house and senate agriculture committees he specified the steps he will take to ensure the sugar program ope rates as authorized through fy2008 if he estimates imports under drc afta nafta and other trade agreements exceed the trigger level see sugar trade issues sugar in drcafta sugar deal

raw cane sugar and 216lb fo r refined beet sugar he argued that the sugar program artificially raises the price paid by consumers and food manufacturing firms most of the program be nefits go to large producers and that it causes environmental damage in the ever glades opponents countered that the program does not cost taxpayers is suppor ted by twothirds of those polled in recent survey and that any vote on pr oposed program change should occur when the 2007 farm bill is debated in june 2005 an identical amendment offered to the fy2006 agriculture appropriations bill hr 2744 was rejected by

bill the usdas undersecr etary stated that the sugar program operated relatively smoothly through july 2005 but characterized it as highly prescriptive containing many rigid and sometimes contradictory rules that increased the complexity of program admin istration he noted that the opening of the us and mexican sugar sectors afte r nafta takes full effect in january 2008 mean alternative sugar policy approaches will need to be explored anticipating upcoming debate on the next farm bill sugar crop growers processors and most cane refiners stated that they will seek an extension of the current program arguing that existing policy works well and has pr ovided supply stability sugar users food and beverage manufacturers called for ch anges that would allow the program to operate more flexibly and want to explore common ground with the sugar producing sector the president of the onl independent cane refinery expressed concern about two issues that in his view

foreign sugar on chronically oversupplie d us market but did not seek to discipline indirect sugar subsidies and w ould allow developing countries to escape reforms others though pointed out that modalities that are closer to the eu proposal would leave the us sugar program unchanged the sweetener users association as member of an agri businesscommodityfarm group coalition had called on other countries to match the u s proposal to reduce tradedistorting subsidies with equally ambitious tariff reductions and export competition commitments the ministerial declaration adopted in hong kong called for dutyfree quota free imports from ldcs for at least 97 of all of countrys products for the united states this could apply to suga r imported from these countries unless us negotiators decide to exempt sugar from this obligation ie to place sugar in the 3 category also what duties and quotas would apply to imports of sensitive agricultural products ie applicable to gar imports from all other countries could also affect us sugar policy sweetener disputes with mexico longstanding differences over the level of market access for mexican sugar to the us market and over mexican barrier s

market in light of increased imports of hfcs from the united states each governments filing of trade dispute cases before nafta and wto panels challenging the others handling of thes disputes and unsuccessful efforts by government and private industry negotia tors on both sides to arrive at some compromise resolution of both disputes appeared to be prompted by the us governments recognition that sugar imports will be needed anyway to meet domestic sugar demand and rebuild stocks in return for gaining access to mexicos market for us hfcs sales though the agreement in the short term settle

effectively placed lower cap on dutyfree imports of mexican sugar allowed to enter the us market than would have been the case under the original nafta agreem ent under the side letters provisions mexico can ship not more than 250000 mt of sugar dutyfree to the us market each year through fy2008 but only if mexico shows net production surplus defined as mexican sugar production minus mexican

duties us hfcs sales leveled off but c ontinued subsequent nafta and wto dispute panels ruled that these duties were not cons istent with mexicos trade commitments to comply with the wtos final ruling mexico created in may 2002 new trq for us hfcs equal to the nafta sugar trq under the sugar side letters provisions that the united states had announced for mexico for fy 2002 this policy also subjected overquota hfcs imports to prohibitive 156 or 210 tariff concurrently mexicos congress imposed 20 soda tax in 2002 applied to soft drinks sweetened with corn syrup but not sugar both actions

agreement puts both countri on path toward an open north american sweetener market in 2008 potential impact the extent to which increased mexican consumption of hfcs cheaper sweetener than sugar and primarily imported from the united states displaces mexicanp roduced sugar in that market will be the major factor influencing how much mexican sugar is actually shipped to the us market during the sweetener agreement period and be yond estimates vary on how much hfcs could displace the sugar consumed by mexi cos soft drink industry which would be the primary user of hfcs under free trade in 2004 the second year that the soda tax was in effect mexicos soft drink s ector used record 16 million mt of sugar an amount that theoretically could all be displaced by hfcs over time analysts though estimate that hfcs could displace sizeable but smaller portion of the sugar consumed by mexicos soft drink sector from 600000 mt to 1 million mt9 the low end of this range reflects the view that large portion of the soft drinkbottlers that are owned by mexican sugar processors will continue to use sugar rather than switch to hfcs the high end assume s that mexicos soft drink sector will substitute hfcs for sugar to the same extent as occurred in the us soft drink sector other factors will influence the quantity of sugar that mexican processors could export to the us market beginning in 2008 some of these could reduce the level of actual shipments few fact ors could raise that level also what transpires during the agreements implementation period th rough yearend 2007 will affect the climate in which congress considers the new gar program these factors include how much more usproduced hfcs is actually exported to mexican soft drink bottlers though there currently is excess

to take advantage of regained access to the mexican market will depend to some extent on whether firms find it more profitable to produce hfcs for export rather than produce ethanol to meet growing us demand with the high price of us corn raising hfcs prices above histor ical levels this alternative sweetener could become less competitive pricewise with mexican sugar and possibly reduce mexican bottler demand for hfcs how mexican wholesale sugar prices compare to comparable us raw sugar prices and how mexican sugar mills respond if they are higher the trend seen in much of the period since 2000 mexican mills may be more inclined to sell into their domestic market rather than export sugar to the us market though historically high us sugar prices in 20052006 encouraged mexican firms to export sugar to obtain better price than in their home market the us price already is falling back toward its historical range as the us market returns to more balanced supply and demand situation this could reduce the incentive for mexican sugar mills to export as much to the united states however if us hfcs exports to mexico increase substantially and contribute to fall in mexican sugar prices mexican mills would find selling sugar to the united states more lucrative option if us sugar policy and in turn us wholesale sugar prices stays the same the degree to which the mexican government intervenes directly or indirectly in the marketplace to ensure adequate domestic supplies and reduce sugar price increases the level of mexican sugar production while trending up does va ry from year to year since mexican government policy is to have sugar mills hold in reserve sugar equal to at least three m onths of domestic consumption10 lower output in some years coul d reduce the amount available for export for this reason the gove rnment can require mills to obtain permits before they are allowed to export sugar the government also does at times permit sugar imports to dampen price increases how the mexican government proceeds to handle number of seemingly intractable problems in its sugar sector the sector employs more than 2 million work ers many producing and cutting sugarcane on very small plots and is powerful political force in the countryside in 2005 mexicos supreme court reversed the governments expropriation of bout half of the countrys sugar mills in 2001

sugarcane as feedstock relatedly uncertainty remains over the legal status of 2005 law to reintroduce government involvement in the mexican sugar producing sector opposed by the government and sugar mills but supported by sugarcane associati ons and their political allies in congress ultimately the outcome of the debate over whether to introduce more marketoriented policies or to maintain the policy status quo will determine whether mexicos sugar sector contracts to primarily meet domes tic demand or survives to likely generate surplus of sugar that will seek an outlet in the us market whether mexican sugar mills invest in processing equipment to improve the quality of sugar sold to us sugar users reports indicate that shipments of mexi can refined sugar during fy2006 did not meet the standard that us food manufacturers are accustomed to procuring andor contained foreign material this required us importers to further process the sugar to remove impurities or for example to re

emphasizes such change would be cos tly and unworkable for the us sugar producing sector projecting cost of 13 billion annually11 asa further argues that problems would arise in implementing this type of program because the sugar industry is structured differently than other commodities large sugar producers would quickly hit current payment limits on farm subsidies bankruptcies and consolidations in the us sugar sector could occur and costly program would be politically difficult to approve and maintain in light of the current federal budget outlook given fixed or smaller budget for farm programs sugar producers state that other commodity producers would not want to reduce their subsidies to make room for subsidy program for the sugar producing sector separately recognizing that sugar im ports from mexico are inevitable under nafta asa wants sweetener trade with mexico to be managed once free trade takes effect in 2008 so that the current us sugar program can continue this would mean that mexico would control the quantity of sugar its sugar mills are allowed to sell eg by operating program similar to the us sugar marketing allotment program or agree to export its excess gar to other countries besides the united states mexican sugar company execu tive responded that ma rketing allotments would be very unpopular at this time with mexican sugar processors who would view such move as an effort to limit their access to the us market just as naftas sugar provisions take full effect12 in issuing its 2007 farm bill proposals on april 23 2007 the american farm bureau

position august 2006 available at http wwwcornorg continuedproduction and marketing progra m earlier at its nnual meeting held in early march the national farmers union another general farm organization called for continuing the current us sugar program the sweetener users association is calling for changes to the current sugar program in order to respond to external pressures primarily increased sugar imports from mexico and to achieve more wo rkable policy for the entire industry reflecting shift in position from what it advocated in the 2002 farm bill debate spokesmen emphasize that sugar users need steady reliable supply of sugar and healthy domestic production nd processing sector that is geographically dispersed enough to handle supply disruptions cau sed by hurricanes and quality problems associated with some imports initially food manufacturers advocated that the sugar program needs to be reformed to meet this objective and proposed that budget outlays for different type of sugar program can be acceptable and defensible if they help to make policies more marketoriented or help adjust to our trade commitments sua spokesman stated that the existing program cannot be sustained anyway on nocost basis pointing to estimates made by cbo which project that lower us prices due to increased sugar imports from mexico will result in loan forfeitures by sugar processors and accompanying usda outlays recognizing that its call for closer look at costly options to change the program would not be seriously considered by policymakers at this time the sua in midmay 2007 instead proposed scaledback set of recommendations it supports continuing the beet and raw cane sugar loan rates at current levels but wants to impose forfeiture penalty of about one cent per pound when processor hands over sugar to usda instead of paying off price support an it also favors abolishing marketing allotments recommends changes in how us sugar quotas are administered and calls for usda to collect and report prices for raw and refined sugar13 on april 23 2007 coalition of sweetener users and public in terest consumer and taxpayer advocacy groups announced they had formed the sugar policy alliance to seek reforms of the sugar pr ogram during 2007 fa rm bill debate14 the corn refiners association views sugar marketing allotments as barrier to sweetener trade with mexico because they cap sugar imports from mexico at 250000 mt and in effect do not allow us hfcs sales to mexico to increase above this level cra st ates it will not support the us sugar program in the 2007 farm bill if marketing allotments or any aspect of the sugar program jeopardizes full implementation of free trade in sweeteners under the nafta15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33541crs24 15
