introduction between the late 1970s and the mid1980s savings and loan institutions thrifts faced constellation of developments that would challenge their financial viability the developments included 1 high and volatile interest rates in the late 1970s and early 1980s which increased the thrifts interest rate risk1 2 the phase out and elimination of the federal reserves regulation q regulation that had placed limits on the interest 1 interest rate risk is the risk that an investments value will change due to change in the absolute level of the interest rates crs2 rates that banks and thrifts could pay which encouraged the emergence of new instruments such as money market funds that hurt thrift industry profitability 3 state and federal deregulation of depository institutions which enabled thrifts to get involved in new but potentially riskier markets and 4 reductions in regulatory capital requirements which allowed thrifts to use alternative accounting procedures that increased their reported levels of capital collectively the developments had negative impact on the thrift industry by 1986 441 thrifts with 113 billion in assets were found to be insolvent2 the enactment of firrea and the beginnings of the rtc to help remedy the thrift industrys problems and restore the publics flagging confidence congress passed the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 firrea pl 10173 enacted in august 1989 firreas httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22959 principal thrust was the creation of program to close and clean up insolvent thrifts who collectively held billions of dollars in deposits insured at the time by the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic3 the vehicle created by firrea to conduct the cleanup was the resolution trust corporation rtc principal funding for the rtc came from an offbudget entity the resolution funding corporation refcorp firreacreated publicprivate partnership which was apart from but was operated by the federal home loan bank fhlb system federal entity that supplies credit reserves to thrift institutions similar to what the federal reserve does for commercial banks refcorp issued about 30 billion in noncallable zero coupon 30 and 40 year us treasury bonds to fund the rtc the interest payments on those bonds were largely funded by firreadirected annual payment of 300 million from the member banks of the fhlb and taxpayer dollars4 in addition to the 30 billion from refcorp the rtc received 188 billion from the us treasury and 12 billion from federal home loan member banks giving it total of about 50 billion in initial funding subsequent legislation increased rtcs funding which would eventually total about 1051 billion5 2 timothy curry and lynn shibut the cost of the savings and loan

bailout investors business daily february 1 1996 5 for example the rtc completion act of 1993 pl 103204 enabled the rtc to continue to fund its operations in its first few years number of members of congress grew disenchanted with the rtcs performance and recommended that it be significantly overhauled for example in 1991 the hon frank annunzio recommended completely eliminating the rtc and replacing continued crs3 the structure of the rtc as directed by firrea the board of directors of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic also assumed the role of the rtcs board firrea also established an rtc oversight board whose mandate was to oversee the development of rtc policy the oversight board also oversaw the rtcs budget and monitored its use of taxpayer funds the board however was not to be involved in detailed rtc operational issues such as matters pertaining to individual transactions as specified by firrea the oversight board had five members three of whom were federal officials the secretary of the treasury who served as the boards chairman the chairman of the federal reserve board and the secretary of housing and urban development the two remaining members were nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate in 1991 motivated by number of issues including the rtcs need for interim funding and concerns that its dual board structure was cumbersome and inefficient for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22959 example the oversight board had to approve policies recommended by the rtcfdic board congress passed the rtc refinancing restructuring and improvement act of 1991 pl 102233 among other things the law replaced the oversight board with what has been described as more limited and less intrusive thrift depositor protection oversight board tdpo which included the secretary of the treasury and the chairman of the federal reserve board but not the secretary of housing and urban development the law also removed the fdics board from it role as the rtcs board and it replaced the fdic as the rtcs manager with the rtcs chief executive officer also was also member of the tdpo6 the process of closing or resolving individual thrifts involved one of three alternatives 1 some thrifts were sold to healthy acquirer which involved the rtc paying another institution to buy the insolvent thrift with most of its assets intact 2 some thrifts were to be shut down with their depositors being paid off and with the rtc retaining all of its assets for later sale and 3 some thrifts were shut down with their deposits being transferred to another institution because deposits are liabilities they represent claims on the institution by depositors the rtc was required to pay the institution receiving the deposits but because the expected value to the new firms of the customers who owned the deposits often exceeded the face value of the deposits the rtc frequently paid less than face value for the depository accounts the assets that the rtc controlled for thrifts in conservatorship or for thrifts in the later receivership phase took variety of forms including cash mortgages loans securities including some belowinvestment grade securities known as junk bonds land 5 continued it with private sector program lee davison the resolution trust corporation and congress 19891993 part ii federal deposit insurance corporations banking review vol

publishing group 1998 p 81 crs4 commercial properties and houses firrea required the rtc to utilize the services of privatesector companies in managing and disposing of assets whenever possible initially the agency faced significant criticism that it was not resolving failed thrifts at rate that kept pace with the growing number of thrifts in conservatorship the rtc responded to the criticism with concerted effort to resolve troubled thrifts at faster rate that effort however added greatly to the agencys collection of assets especially problem assets soon concerns over the pitfalls of dumping assets with often little regard for the low values they fetched were superseded by concerns including some from members of congress that faster approach to asset disposal was needed if the agency was going to complete its mission7 in mid1990 the agency began conducting bulk sales of packaged assets contrast to its initial approach of selling assets one by one although the bulk sale strategy was criticized for fostering lack of competition among bidders including the provision of sweetheart deals to some large investors possibly lowering asset sale prices due to discounts and thus undermining some real estate markets the criticism was overshadowed by the agencys need to rid itself of assets8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22959 in some of its auctions9 of nonperforming loans the rtc packaged assets by product geographic location and collateral type some packages being as small as few thousand dollars others in the tens of millions with average packages running between 3 million and 4 million10 other bulk packages were less diversified and very assetspecific consisting of singleproperty types such as hotels or motels11 equity partnerships at times however the bulk asset sales faced market pricing that was considerably less than the agency desired to help address such shortcomings the agency pioneered equity partnerships to help liquidate some of the packages of its real estate and financial assets while the strategy employed number of different structures all of the equity partnerships involved private sector partner acquiring partial interest in pool of assets controlling the management and sale of the assets in the pool and making distributions to the rtc based on the rtcs retained equity interest12 7 lee davison the resolution trust corporation and congress 19891993 part i 19891990 fdic banking review vol 18 2 2006 pp 3842 8 ibid pp 3839 9 the rtc made widespread use of auctions both sealedbid auctions in which bidders proffer bids sealed in an envelope and openoutcry auctions using auctioneers who set up auction sites that were often near the location of the assets some observers suggest that the agency lent groundbreaking legitimacy to the notion of asset auctions 10 jeffrey marshall learning from the rtc united states banker vol 103 iss 9 pp 2832 11 ibid pp 2930 12 an example was the rtcs partnership with colony capital of angeles which invested in the rtcs national land fund and became jointventure partner the colony pool had 119 assets with book value of 480 million largely in finished residential lots colony put up 25 of the purchase price and became the managing general partner the rtc was passive limited partner getting 75 of the cash flow as the assets were sold to point when the total reached the continued crs5 commercial mortgages and securitization the rtc is widely regarded as pioneer in the securitization of complex securitized instruments backed by commercial and multifamily loans commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs which constituted significant share of the agencys assets initially the cmbs were reportedly difficult to sell due in part to the fact that the huge losses that had occurred in the value of commercial mortgages was major factor in the thrifts troubles eventually however sales of the cmbs reportedly became quite healthy and the innovative approach to asset disposal would later earn the rtc praise13 conclusion the rtc completion act of 1993 pl 103204 terminated the rtc as of december 31 1995 all of its remaining assets liabilities and duties were transferred to the fdic in the end the rtc orchestrated the closing of 747 thrifts more than 25 of the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22959 industry it was also responsible for selling more than 450 billion of their real estate and disposing of 95 of their overall assets with recovery rate of more than 8514 estimates of the direct and indirect cost of the entire rtc thrift resolution process have ranged from 100 billion to as high as 500 billion with the most widely and recently reported estimate in the area of 150 billion the majority being taxpayer financed15 an amount said to be below original estimates16 12 continued agencys original imputed contribution after that point colonys equity share rose to 50 13 george alexander and tom rayburn fdic closes the books on rtc securitization
