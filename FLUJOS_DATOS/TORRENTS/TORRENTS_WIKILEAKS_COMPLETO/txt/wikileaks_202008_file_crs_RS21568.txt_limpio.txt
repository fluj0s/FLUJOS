only coordinating and harmonizing role in these matters with the member states most economic and monetary powers remained with the republics serbia and montenegro retained separate currencies central banks and monetary and fiscal policies for example2 the belgrade agreement and constitutional charter provide for the withdrawal of either state or both from the union following the expiration of threeyear period and referendum interim developments since the unions founding different policy priorities and concerns in each republic caused development of the union to languish although economic revitalization and reforms have been dominant concerns for both serbia and montenegro their respective governments sought different policy approaches that reflected substantial differences in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21568 economic structure and scale between the two republics this in turn presented insurmountable hurdles in the effort to harmonize the republics economic policies some observers believe that the structural differences and divergent priorities between the two republics were simply too great to allow the union to function as single state in the long run the pull of moving closer to european integration played large role in keeping the union in force however montenegros leadership never relinquished its ultimate goal of independence eu integration since playing key international role in brokering the belgrade agreement the european union remained the primary external force promoting continuation of joint serbia and montenegro state as both republics share the goal of attaining eu membership eu officials attempted to leverage this influence by insisting that serbia and montenegros surest and quickest path toward closer integration with the eu lies together rather than apart at the june 2003 thessaloniki summit eu and western balkan leaders agreed to move the region toward european integration through stabilization and association process sap3 later that year the eu agreed to begin feasibility study for stabilization and association agreement saa with serbia and montenegro the first step in the eu accession process the eu pressed serbia and montenegro to achieve greater harmonization of their economic trade and tariff policies however lack of progress in harmonization the uncertain political climate in serbia and serbias lack of full cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty delayed further work on the saa feasibility study with serbia and montenegro in 2003 and early 2004 2 montenegro adopted the deutschmark in 2001 while it was still part of the fry and now uses the euro serbia uses the dinar as its currency 3 see euwestern balkans summit declaration june 21 2003 at httpwwweu2003gr crs4 in mid2004 eu members adopted twin track policy that recognized serbia and montenegros economic distinctions and differentiated eu approaches to them including different trade and customs regimes concurrently the policy called for the preservation of serbia and montenegros existence as single state entity officials from both serbia and montenegro welcomed the eu initiative if for different reasons despite the new approach progress in finalizing the feasibility study and opening negotiations on an saa continued to lag mainly because of belgrades insufficient cooperation with icty some significant progress by serbia in late 2004early 2005 on icty cooperation helped to alleviate this hurdle if only temporarily4 in april 2005 the eu approved feasibility study on opening saa negotiations with serbia and montenegro which formally opened in october however after several rounds of reportedly positive progress in the saa talks the eu suspended further talks in april citing serbias still incomplete cooperation with icty position of montenegro the montenegrin government remained the driving political force promoting dissolution of the union prime minister djukanovic and his democratic party of socialists as well as its coalition partners have long been identified with the ultimate goal of independence while relatively dormant issue in 2003 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21568 montenegros leaders renewed their commitment to independence as the threeyear moratorium drew to close they proposed direct talks with belgrade on negotiating separation in the form of union of independent states which belgrade rejected they also insisted on holding referendum in advance of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 2006 montenegros leaders have stated that progress toward achieving an saa with the eu should not hinder prospects for montenegros independence in fact they view independence as means toward quicker eu integration and the recent eu decision to suspend saa talks over belgrades lack of full cooperation with icty appeared to bolster this view the governments domestic critics charged that djukanovics focus on independence had diverted attention away from other pressing policy problems in montenegro though never surpassing the proindependence vote in popularity the pro unionist and antigovernment bloc was expected to register sizeable share of the vote referendum background and results montenegros leadership has consistently insisted that the republic be allowed to exercise its democratic right to hold referendum on independence the april 2005 amendments to the charter upheld montenegros right to hold referendum but also called for montenegro to cooperate with the eu on respecting democratic standards the international communitys approach to the referendum focused on process and preparations for the vote key issues of concern included required turnout necessary margin of victory and voter eligibility the venice commission legal advisory body to the council of europe issued an opinion on montenegros referendum law in middecember 20055 among other things it rejected serbian proposal to consider the sizeable montenegrin population residing in serbia as eligible to vote the commission recommended that the majority and 4 see also crs report rs22097 balkan cooperation on war crimes issues by julie kim 5 text of the opinion can be found at httpwwwvenicecoeint crs5 opposition parties negotiate on the conduct and implementation of the referendum especially with regard to the specific majority and turnout required for the referendum to pass eu leaders also called for the montenegrin parties to achieve consensus on principles and processes and to refrain from unilateral actions eu foreign policy chief solana appointed slovak diplomat miroslav lajcak to be his personal representative to montenegro to facilitate dialogue between the government and opposition on the terms of the referendum after several rounds of talks in early 2006 eu envoy lajcak proposed among other things that winning majority comprise 55 of those voting and that turnout exceed 50 this formula represented compromise between the oppositions demands for threshold of majority of the entire electorate and the governments preference for simple majority of those voting after the government and opposition accepted the eu terms the montenegrin parliament passed new law on the referendum on march 2 that set voting date of may 21 2006 the text of the referendum question was are you in favor of montenegro as an independent state with full international and legal subjectivity although the share of independence supporters appeared to be growing as the vote neared it remained far from certain whether the independence camp would be httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21568 able to reach the 55 threshold many observers wondered about the possibility of the vote results falling in gray zone above 50 but below 55 and the implications of that uncertain outcome with recordhigh turnout of 863 the may 21 referendum resulted in 555 of registered voters in favor of independence and 445 against6 some in the prounionist camp disputed the results in certain polling stations but their demands for partial recount were dismissed international officials promptly praised the successful conduct of the vote eu officials stated that the eu could soon open separate saa talks with montenegro leaders from serbia and montenegro will now have to negotiate specific terms for the breakup of the joint state as per the belgrade agreement serbia will become the legal successor to the state union after montenegro gains independence kosovos status an international process to determine kosovos future status is currently under way since 1999 the province of kosovo has come under administration under an international mandate regulated by security council resolution 1244 in 2005 the security council endorsed launching negotiated process on kosovo status resolution talks headed by envoy commenced in early 2006 and international officials seek to conclude them by the end of the year although formal linkage exists between the issue of kosovos status and the interrepublic relationship between serbia and montenegro7 many observers believe each situation could affect the other and open broader discussion of borders sovereignty issues and state relationships montenegrin officials insist that montenegros case for independence has nothing to do with the kosovo situation 6 montenegro has 466079 registered voters in total population of about 670000 7 the belgrade agreement and constitutional charter state that should montenegro withdraw from the union international agreements including resolution 1244 on kosovo shall apply to serbia as successor to the fry crs6 us policy the united states strongly supports the longterm goal of countries of the western balkans to join europe and euroatlantic structures the united states supported the solanaled negotiations leading up the belgrade agreement and welcomed the adoption of the constitutional charter us administrations and some members of congress maintained longstanding close relations with the primary architects of the union agreement serbian prime minister djindjic and montenegrin president djukanovic ties stemming from the staunch antimilosevic positions of these leaders during the 1990s especially with regard to montenegro congress took care to exempt that republic from economic sanctions during the milosevic years as well as earmark to it high levels of bilateral foreign assistance montenegro remains exempt from annual legislative conditions on us aid to serbia that pertain to serbias cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal for example montenegro was spared from the temporary us suspension of some fy2005 assistance to serbia announced in january 20058 the us policy agenda with serbia and montenegro has been largely dominated by the issue of icty cooperation and kosovo nevertheless the joint or separate future of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21568 serbia and montenegro is of importance to us policymakers because of its potential impact on range of bilateral and multilateral policy issues these include us support for the stabilization of the western balkans region and its integration into western institutions including nato the normalization and expansion of us bilateral political economic and security relations with serbia and montenegro serbia and montenegros relations with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia and the future of kosovo prior to the referendum held in montenegro us officials said that the united states would remain neutral and would accept any outcome that is achieved through democratic means and through process accepted as legitimate by all sides they emphasized us support for serbia and montenegros progress toward europe within
