1999 from omb dire ctor jacob lew to the honorable j ohn spratt ranking minority member of the house budget committeethe paygo requirement as originally set forth in the bea of 1990 covered fy19911995 it was extended by the omni bus budget reconciliation act obra of 1993 through fy1998 and the budget enforcement act bea of 1997 through fy20023 as mentioned previously the paygo requirement applie s to legislation enacted through fy2002 but it covers the effects of such legislation through fy2006 with regard to direct spending the paygo requirement app lies to outlay levels rather than levels of budget authority budget authority represents the legal authority for agencies to incur obligations annual appropriations are perhaps the most well known form of budget authority outlays represent the liquidation of the obligation usually in the form of an electronic funds transfer or the issuance of check by the treasury department outlays rather than budget authority are compared to revenue levels to determine the amount of the surplus or deficit the paygo balances for each fiscal year are maintained on rolling paygo scorecard that accumulates the budgetary ffects of laws enacted during the session and in prior years beginning with fy19924 the threshold test for paygo sequester deals with how legislation affects the net cost for fiscal year on the paygo scorecard not how it changes the surplus or deficit for that fiscal year in the federal budget generally as the budget moved from an overall defi cit to an overall surplus in recent years and as an onbudget surplus emer ged there was some confusion regarding whether the paygo requirement would conti nue to apply the concern arose from the fact that the stated purpose of the paygo requirement in section 252a of the 1985 balanced budget act refers only to gislation that increases the deficit in the report accompanying the fy2000 budget resolution for example the house budget committee stated the law is somewhat unclear whether paygo lapses when th ere is an onbudget surplus omb has hinted that paygo w ould indeed lapse if the budget was in balance without counting exce ss social security receipts5 in response to this concern jacob w then director of the office of management and budget omb issued statement indicating that such position was not correct stating we believe that paygo does apply when there is an on budget surplus6 the controlling factor as stated previously is how legislation changes the balance on the paygo scorecardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31194crs3 7 for more detailed discussion of the sequestration process see crs report rl31137 sequestration procedures unde r the 1985 balanced budget act by robert keithenforcement by sequestration the sequestration process established by the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of p l 99177 and used to enforce annual deficit targets was retained by the be of 1990 and later laws as the means of enforcing the paygo requirement as well as the discretionary spending limits7 under current sequestration procedures the omb direct or issues sequestration report at the time the presidents budget is submitted to congress the preview report midway through the congressional session the upda report and within 15 days after the end of the session the fina l report the congressional budget office cbo issues sequestration reports in dvance of the omb reports but they are advisory only if the omb directors final sequestra tion report indicates that enacted direct spending and revenue levels have incurred net cost for the fiscal year on the paygo scorecard then the president must immediately issue sequestration order to remedy the violation through automa tic acrosstheboard spending reductions if sequester under this process is re quired it must occur within 15 calendar days after congress adjourns at the end of session and on the same day as any sequestration tied to enforcement of the discretionary spending limits the sequester would eliminate any net positive balance on the paygo scorecard for that fiscal year and the prior fiscal year combined caused by the enactment of legislation during the session and in prior years any required reductions would be ma in nonexempt direct spending programs emergency direct spending and revenue legislation so designated by the president and in statute is not covere d by the paygo sequestration process as mentioned previously spending for the social security program except for administrative expenses is exempt from sequestration as are many other direct spending programs any reductions in medicare spending are limited to 4 enforcement in the congressional budget process the congressional budget process estab lished by the congressional budget act of 1974 contains several mechanisms to enforce decisions regarding the recommended levels of direct spending and revenues fi rst under section 311 of the act the aggregate levels in the budget re solution serve as ceiling on total spending and floor under tota l revenues second under section 302 of the act the total amount of direct spending in the budget resolution is allocated among the various legislative committees of jurisdiction third section 310 provides for reconciliation process under which the budget resolution may contain instructions to the legislative committees to develop changes to direct spending or revenue laws to bring them into conformity with budg et resolution policies the resultant legislation is considered unde r expedited procedures in the house and senate usually in the form of an omnibus bill finally the socalled elastic clause in sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31194crs4 8 us executive office of the president office of management and budget budget of the united states government fiscal year 2002 analytical perspectives washington april 9 2001 see the preview report on pages 243251301b4 authorizes the budget resolution to set forth such other matters and require such other procedures relating to the budget as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this act pursuant to the elastic clause authority the house and senate sometimes include special procedural features in the budg et resolution the senate for example established payasyougo point of order several years ago which remains in effect this provision most recently t forth in section 207 of the fy2000 budget resolution hconres 68 bars the consideration of any legislation that would increase or cause an onbudget deficit for any one of three applicable time periods 1 the first year covered by the budget reso lution 2 the first 5 years covered by the budget resolution and 3 the 5 fiscal years following the first 5 years covered by the budget resolution although the senates paygo point of order is comparable in purpose to the statutory paygo requirement it differs in that it takes effect during the consideration of legislation rather than after the session ends and it applies to much longer time frame the policies in the budget resolution re garding direct spending and revenue levels may be at odds with the statutor paygo requirement during the past few years as the deficit changed to growing surplus the budget resolution has recommended substantia l reductions in reve nues coupled with increases in direct spending that would incur substantial nets costs on the paygo scor ecard the firewall between the paygo process and procedures to enforce the discretionary spending limits does not permit savings from constraints on the growth of discretionary spending to offset or p ay for revenue reductions accordingly congress has had to resort to procedur devices to prevent sequester from occurring while pursuing revenuereducti on legislation see later discussion fy2002 policy regarding the paygo requirement the initial policy for fy2002 regard ing the paygo requirement was established by the submission of the pr esidents budget and the adoption by the house and senate of the nnual budget resolution as re venue and direct spending legislation is considered the initial policy may be modified by various means including the designation of revenue or direct spending changes as emergency requirements the presidents budget president george w bush submitted his budget for fy2002 on april 9 2001 recommending that congress pass legislation extending the paygo requirement and discretionary spending limits8 with regard to revenues and direct spending his budget proposed 10year tax

some of it for debt reduction and contingencies he acknowledged that his proposals would incur sizeable impact on the paygo scorecard that would have to be remedied in order to prevent paygo sequester

preventing budget sequester by robert keithprevious techniques fo r preventing sequester congress and the president have been able to avoid sequester under the paygo requirement largely by not enacting legislation that in the net would cause balance on the paygo scorecard at the end of the session in the two years prior to the fy2002 cycle however congress and the president intervened in the normal operation of the paygo process with the aim of preventing currentyear or future year sequester17 the intervention took the form of an instruction to the omb director either not to count the direct spe nding or revenue effect s of legislation or to set the paygo balance for one or more years to zero it should be noted that legislative provi sions containing such techniques could violate section 306 of the 1974 congressional budget act the section bars the consideration in the house or senate of any legislation containing subject matter within the jurisdiction of the respective budget committee unless it has been reported by or discharged from that co mmittee violations of section 306 may be waived typically by special rule in the house or motion in the senate in the senate such waivers require threefift hs majority further the prohibition in section 306 is not selfenforci ng member must raise point of order to enforce the prohibition in 2000 the statutory intervention resulted in the removal from the paygo scorecard of costs that would have led to 105 billion paygo sequester for fy2001 for the year before that the statut ory intervention removed futureyear costs to minimize the possib ility of futureyear sequesters both vehicles were nnual appropriations acts considered toward the very end of the session the consolidated appropriations acts for fy2000 and fy2001 the consolidated appropriations acts for fy2000 and fy2001 both enacted by crossreference legislation that made changes in direct spending and revenues under current scorekeeping rules any such changes made in an annual appropriations act must be scored under the discretiona ry spending limits rather than the paygo scorecard however provisions in the two consolidated appropriations acts set aside this requirement fy2000 section 1001 113 stat 1537 in division b of the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106 113 november 29 1999 in addition to prohibiting the scoring of direct spending and revenue changes made in the act under the discretionary spending limits also prohi bited the scoring of these changes under the paygo scorecard this prevented co sts of 1552 billion for fy2000 and costs of 15193 billion for fy 20002004 from be ing added to the p aygo scorecard however even if the 1552 billion for fy2000 had been added to the paygo scorecard it would not have triggered p aygo sequester for that year because savings balance of 1462 billi on would have remainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31194crs9 section 1001 of the act also instructed th omb director to change any balances on the scorecard for fy20002004 to zero on january 3 2000 this action removed the combined fy19992000 savings of 3014 billion from the scorecard but also removed costs for fy20012004 amounting to 15763 billion from the consolidated appropriations act and othe r measures that could have triggered paygo sequesters in those years if not offset or otherwise prevented fy2001 at the end of the 2000 session c ongress and the president wrapped up business by enacting the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106 554 114 stat 27632764 december 21 2000 which enacted regular appropriations as well as significant direct spending nd revenue legislation by crossreference section 2 of the act prohibited scoring the direct spending and revenue changes made in the act under the discretionary spending limits but did require them to be scored on the paygo scorecard this resulted in costs of 7170 billion for fy2001 and costs of 49463 billion for fy20012005 be ing added to the paygo scorecard further section 2 of the act instructed the omb director to change the balance on the scorecard for fy2001 to zero in the course of preparing the final sequestration report for that year this action removed the combined fy20002001 costs of 10542 billion from the scorecard thereby preventing paygo sequester costs on the paygo scorecard for fy20022005 amounting to 74527 b illion which will trigger paygo sequesters for thos years if not offset or otherwise prevented were not affected
