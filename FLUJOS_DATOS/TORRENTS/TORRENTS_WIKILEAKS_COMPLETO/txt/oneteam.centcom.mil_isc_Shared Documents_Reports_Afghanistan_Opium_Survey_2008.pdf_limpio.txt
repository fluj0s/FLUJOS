flood the opium flood waters in afghanistan have started to recede this year the historic highwater mark of 193000 hectares of opium cultivated in 2007 has dropped by 19 to 157000 hectares opium production declined by only 6 to 7700 tonnes not as dramatic drop as cultivation because of greater yields record 488 kgha agai nst 425kg in 2007 eradication was ineffective in terms of results only 5480 and about one quarter of last years amount but very costly in terms of human lives also the data collection for this afghan opium survey turned into tragedy as one of our colleagues perished in suicide attack hence the decision to dedicate this work to him and all those who have died in afghanistan for the cause of democracy and security since last year the number of opiumfree provinces has increased by almost 50 from 13 to 18 this means that opium is grown in more than half of the countrys 34 provinces indeed 98 of all of afghanistans opium is grown in just seven provinces in the southwest hilmand kandahar uruzgan farah nimroz and to lesser extent daykundi and zabul where there are permanent taliban settlements and where organized crime groups profit from the instability this geographical overlap be tween regions of opium and zones of ins urgency shows the inextricable link between drugs and conflict since drugs and insurgency are caused by and effect each other they need to be dealt with at the same time and urgently the most glaring example is hilmand province in the south where 103 000 of opium were cultivated this year two thirds of all opium in afghanistan if hilmand were country it would once again be the worlds biggest producer of illicit drugs by contrast nangarhar afghanistans second high est opium producing prov ince in 2007 has become poppy free this is remarkable accomplishment the first time it happens in the countrys modern history what made the flood recede success in 2008 can be attributed to two factors good local leadership and bad weather first strong leadership by some governors for example in badakshan balkh and nangarhar discouraged farmers from planting opium through campaigns against its cultivati on effective peer pressure and the promotion of rural development they deserve tangible recognition religious leaders elders and shura also deserve credit for becomi ng increasingly effective in convincing farmers not to grow opium not least because it is against islam second drought contributed to crop failure particularly in the north and northwest where most cultivation is rainfed the same drastic weather conditions also hurt other crops like wheat increasing significantly its domestic price this combine d with the global im pact of rising food prices is creating food crisis yet higher farmgate wheat prices because of shortages and lower farmgate opium prices because of excess supply have significantly improved the terms of trade of food this may provi further incentive to sh ift crops away from drugs winning back afghanistan prov ince by province to ensure that the opium flood recedes even further several practical measures are needed xregain control of the west the policy of winning back afghanistan province by province has proven successful the goal for 2008 was to make many more provinces and especially nangarhar and badakshan opium free this has been achieved the goal for 2009 should be to win back farah and nimroz as well as zabu l and day kundi where opium cultivation and viiiinsurgency are lower than in the south because of low productivity the ec onomic incentive to grow opium in this region is lower than in the countrys more fertile south xreward good performance prevention is less costly in terms of human lives and economic means than manual eradication governors of opiu m free provinces and those who may join them in 2009 need to be able to deliver on their promises of economic assistance aid should be disbursed more quickly avoiding the transaction costs of national and international bureaucracy the revenue from licit crops has im proved in both absolute and relative terms the gross income ratio of opium to wheat per hecta re in 2007 was 101 this year it has narrowed to 31 xfeed the poor afghanistan already so poor faces food crisis in addition to longterm development assistance afghan farmers and urban dwellers urgently need food aid if such food is purchased domestically and redistributed as unodc has long been calling for this would further improve the terms of trade of licit crops xstop the cannabis with world attention focussed on afghan opium benign neglect has turned afghan cannabis into low riskhigh value cash crop there is point in reducing opium cultivation if farmers switch to cannabis this is happe ning in some of the provinces that are opium free for example in the north the issue needs to be seriously researched and addressed although in gross terms opium cultivation is most remunerative today in afghanistan one hectare of cannabis generates even greater net income because of opiums high labour cost xbuild integrity and justice drug cultivation production and trafficking are carried out on an enormous scale thanks to collusion between corrupt officials landowners warlords and criminals until they all face the full force of the law the opium economy will continue to prosper with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it it is the task of development agencies and military operations to maintain economic growth and improve security these measures should be complemented by equally robust efforts towards good governance efficient administration and honest ju diciary these efforts have yet to gain momentum xfind the missing opium while afghan opium cultivation an d production are declining in 2008 and for the third year in row its supply far outweighs world demand current domestic opium prices us70 at farmgates show that this market is responding only slowly to economic conditions such an inelastic price response suggests that vast amounts of opium heroin and morphine thousand of tons have been withheld from the market we know little about these stockpiles of drugs besi des that as reported in the winter survey they are not in the hands of farmers these stockpiles are time bomb for public health and global security as priority intelligence services need to examine who holds this surplus where it may go and for what purpose xcatch the most wanted in line with security council re solutions 1735 and 1822 the afghan government assisted by other coun tries should bring to ju stice the most wanted drug traffickers who are bankrolling terrorism and insu rgency member states have yet to demonstrate willingness to comply with the security councils decisions for example by seeking extradition of the criminals who sow death among their youth xstop the precursor chemicals in line with another sec urity council resolution 1817 of july 2008 member states agreed to step up effort s to stop the smuggling of precursor chemicals used in afghanistan to process heroin during the past few months increased joint operations have resulted in larger seizures of acetic anhy dride bound for afghan istan yet the risks and the costs of producing heroin are still too low in afghanistan and west asia xregional security most of the opiumproducing areas in afghanistan are located along the iranian and especially the pakistani borders greater counternarcotics cooperation between ixthe three countries as well as ce ntral asia and the gulf would disrupt drug smuggling and money laundering hold the course afghanistans opium problem is big but more and more localized to handful of provinces in the southwest to reduce the problem further farmers provincial governors and district officials need to receive incentives nd face deterrents in order not to grow poppy stronger security rule of law and development assistance are urgently needed the time to act is now unlike coca opium is s easonal plant in few weeks farmers will decide whether or not to plant opiu m for the 200809 harvest afghan society has started to make progress in its fight against opium farmers now recognize that the riskreward balance is tilting against growing opium local administrators and religious leaders have started to deliver it is up to the central government to provide the leadership security justice

preliminary estimate 23summary findings the total opium cultivation in 2008 in afghanistan is estimated at 157000 hectares 19 reduction compared to 2007 unlike previous years 98 of the total cultivation is confined to seven provinces with security problems five of these provinces are in the south and two in the west of afghanistan of the 34 provinces in the country 18 were poppy free in 2008 compared to 13 in 2007 this includes the eastern province of nangarhar which was the number two cultivator in 2007 and now is free from poppy cultivation at the district level 297 of afghanistans 398 districts were poppy free in 2008 only tiny portion of the total cultivation took place in the north baghlan and faryab northeast badakhshan and east kunar laghman and kapisa together these regions counted for less than two per cent of cultivation the seven southern and western provinces that contributed to 98 of afghan opium cultivation and production are hilmand kandahar uruzgan daykundi zabul farah and nimroz this clearly highlights the strong link between opium cultivation and the lack of security the total opium production in 2008 is estimated at 7700 metric tons mt 6 reduction compared to production in 2007 almost all of the production 98 takes place in the same seven provinces where the cultivation is concentrat ed and where the yield per hectare was relatively higher than in the rest of the country all the other provinces contributed only 2 of total opium production in the country the gross income for farmers who cultivated opium poppy is estimated at us 732 million in 2008 this is decrease from 2007 when farmgate income for opium was estimated at us 1 billion opium poppy cultivation decreases by 19 in 2008 the area under opium poppy cultivation in afghanistan decreased by 19 in 2008 from 193000 in 2007 to 157000 98 of which is confined to seven provinces in the south and the west figure 1 opium poppy cultivation in afghanistan 19942008

winter rapid assessment report february 2008 the full opium survey shows that the cultivation has reduced more than expected thanks to successful counternarcotic efforts in the northern and eastern provinces of afghanistan this decline was also result of unfavorable weather conditions that caused extreme drought and crop failure in some provinces especially those in which agriculture is rainfed in areas where the cultivation decline has been the result of the severe drought there are real challenges for the government and international stakeholders to sustain the declining cultivation trend there is an urgent need to mobilize support to meet short term and long term needs of the farmers affected by the drastic weather conditions eighteen provinces have been found to be free of poppy and cultivation in eastern and northern provinces cultivation was reduced to negligible levels the province of nangarhar which was once the top producing province has become poppy free for the first time since the systematic monitoring of opium started in afghanistan in the early 1990s 2008 also presents stark contrast because nangarhar cultivated as much as 18739 only last year the regional divide of opium cultivation between the south and rest of the country continued to sharpen in 2008 most of the opium cultivatio n is confined to the south and the west which are dominated by insurgency and organized criminal networks this corresponds to the sharper polarization of the security situation between the lawless south and relatively stable north hilmand still remains the dominant opium cultivating province 103500 followed by kandahar uruzgan farah and nimroz major difference in the regional distribution of 2007 and 2008 cultivation is that cultivation in the east nangarhar kunar and laghman has dropped to insignificant levels in 2008 compared to total of 19746 of opium cultivation in 2007 in 2008 the eastern region is estimated to have cultivated only 1150 number of opium poppy free provinces increases to 18 in 2008 the number of opium poppy free provinces increased to 18 in 2008 compared to 13 in 2007 and six in 2006 these poppy free 3 provinces are shown in the table below

ghor poppy free provinces in 2007 and 2008 encouragingly all the provinces which were poppy free in 2007 remained poppy free in 2008 campaigns against poppy cultivation effective law enforcement implementation by the government and alternative development assistance to farmers contributed to the increase in the number of poppy free provinces prevailing conditions of drought as noted above also played part in making opium cultivation negligible in the rainfed areas of northern afghanistan faryab and badakhshan 3 region is defined as poppy free when it is estimated to have less th an 100 of op ium cultivation 5nangarhar becomes poppy free for the first time in the history of opium monitoring in afghanistan nangarhar was traditionally large poppy growing province and in 2007 it was estimated to have 18739 of opium cultivation in 2008 nangarhar province became poppy free for the first time since the began opium cultivation monitoring in afghanistan in 2004 poppy cultivation in nangarhar was 28213 in 2005 it fell to1093 in 2006 it increased to 4872 but could only be found in very remote parts of the province kunar and laghman provinces also showed considerable reduction 35 and 24 respectively in poppy cultivation in 2008 in both provinces opium poppy cultivation amounting each to less then 500 was restricted to remote areas that are difficult to access kapisa also experienced considerable reduction of 45 in opium cultivation however this is province with high security risk and higher percentage of agricultural land if compared to kunar and laghman these factors increase the challenges of sustaining the reduction next year the poppy free status of nangarhar and reduced cultivation in kunar and laghman show an effective provincial leadership in implementing control measures to stop poppy cultivation in the eastern region north and northeast afghanistan show drastic reduction in opium cultivation northern afghanistan also shows successes in terms of poppy free status and reduced cultivation the total reduction in poppy cultivation in the north and northeast regions is 84 and 96 respectively compared to 2007 in north and northeast afghanistan the amount of opium cultivation is estimated to be very low affecting only three provinces namely faryab 289 baghlan 475 and badakhshan 200 the rest of the provinces in northern region balkh bamyan jawzjan samangan saripul kunduz and takhar are poppy free the drought in 2008 affected not only opium cultivation but other agricultural production as well in particular it caused the failure of the rainfed wheat crop which resulted in serious difficulties for farmers as consequence food prices have escalated in afghanistan if emergency food aid and massive development aid are not extended to the northern central and eastern parts of the country especially nangarhar there is serious risk of backlash next year many farmers are losing the cash income they used to receive from opium and at the same time they have to buy wheat and other food items at very high prices this poses considerable challenges in keeping the region poppy free in the near future 98 of opium poppy cultivation is restricted to the south and southwest the number of security incidents in creased sharply in the last th ree years espec ially in the south and southwest of afghanistan over the same period and in the same regions opium cultivation showed the same sharp increase in 2008 98 of opium cultivation is confined to seven provinces in the south and west namely hilmand kandahar uruzgan zabul farah and nimroz security conditions are extremely poor in those provinces hilmand still remains the single largest opium cultivating province with 103500 66 of total cultivation in afghanistan almost at the same level as 2007 between 2002 and 2008 cultivation in hilmand province more than tripled lot of land outside the traditional agricultural areas has been reclaimed for the sole purpose of opium cultivation in hilmand 6 photo 1 photo 1 shows an area on the right side of the canal which has been newly reclaimed as agricultural land for opium cultivation farmers in hilmand appear to be able to afford the high expenses needed to reclaim land for opium cultivation photo 2 photo 2 shows agriculture land in nad ali district which is well developed with ample irrigation facilities this area is known for its intensive opium cultivation the picture shows wheat and poppy in the sprouting stage wheat can be distinguished from opium because of its darker green colour 7in kandahar province opium cultivation was 14623 in 2008 reduction of 12 from 2007 but remaining significantly higher than in 2006 the increase in opium cultivation started in the year 2004 when only 4959 were cultivated since then the area under opium poppy has tripled the total area under opium in zabul increased by 45 reaching 2335 in 2008 table 1 distribution of opium poppy cultivation in afghanistan by region 2007 2008

production in afghanistan declines to 7700 mt in 2008 the average yield for afghanistan in 2008 was 488 kgha compared to 425 kgha in 2007 this is the highest average yield estimated for afghanistan since 2000 the yield per hectare in the southern region is normally considerably higher than the rest of the country prior to 2008 there was significant op ium cultivation outside the southern region which lowered the average national yield in 2008 the region that accounted for 98 of the total national cultivation is the one with the highest yield although the weather conditions were unfavorable for second crop spring cultivation throughout the whole country the first crop fall cultivation in south and southwest received adequate irrigation these conditions naturally led to reduced level of cultivation in 2008 and lower yields in the central and eastern regions but they did not affect the yield in the south where most of the cultivation was concentrated and where the yield actually increased given the different distribution of the cultivation and yield the 19 total decrease in cultivation resulted in smaller 6 decrease in potential opium production which is estimated in 2008 at

they decreased by 30 in eastern regions while in other regions except the central region the decrease in dry farmgate prices is between 1620 opium prices increased by only 2 in the central region the highest dry opium prices were reported in the central us 171kg and eastern regions us 117kg one possible explanation for the general decreasing trend is that there is surplus of opium due to the record production of 8200 mt in 2007 and another significant production level of 7700 mt in 2008 these production levels are above the estimated global demand of illicit opium 9 suggesting that the surplus production has been accumulated as stocks it could be argued that given the production increases in 2006 and 2007 and the still high production in 2008 prices have not fallen as much as expected possible explanation could be that after the sharp decrease in opium poppy cultivation in myanmar and laos in recent years opium from afghanistan appea rs to be increasingly trafficked to china india and southeast asia which were traditionally supplied by opium from the golden triangle total farmgate value of opium decreased by 27 to us 732 million based on opium production and

agricultural tax that is generally levied could thus provide revenue for these antigovernment elements who in turn provide protection for poppy growing areas reasons for cultivationnoncultivation of opium poppy as part of the 2008 survey 3050 farmers in 1529 villages across afghanistan were asked about their reasons for cultivating or not cultivating opium poppy each farmer could provide more than one reason as in 2007 almost all farmers who never cultivated opium reported religion as one of the reasons 91 of farmers in 2008 and 93 in 2007 consistent number of farmers also reported illegality of the crop 68 of farmers and respect for shuraelders decision 46 of farmers based on these results it could be argued that the majority of farmers who never cultivated poppy appear to be sensitive to the rule of law in fact few farmers cited reasons related to income or climate for not growing poppy this also shows that the culturalreligious pressure for not cultivating poppy can indeed be very strong 9world drug report 2008 unodc 10 these percentages were calculated consideri ng the 2007 gdp estimated by the central statistical office of afghanistanat us 102 billion 16figure

in the eastern region farmers appear to be more concerned about respecting the government ban than in other regions one of the reasons reported by the majority of farmers for cultivating opium across

poppy growing farmers increased in southern and western afghanistan while it decreased in the rest of afghanistan compared to 2006 the average annual income of poppy growing farmers in northeastern and central afghanistan was less than that of nonpoppy growing farmers in 2007 due to the low level of poppy cultivation and the decrease in prices in these two regions farmers grew opium mainly for personal consumption similar to 2007 the 2008 survey shows that the cultivation of opium is more widely spread in regions where farmers have the highest levels of income table 8 2007 annual household

cultivation was concentrated in hilmand kandahar uruzgan day kundi zabul farah and nimroz where security conditions are classified as high or extremely risky by the united nations department of safety

stronghold of antigovernment elements while provinces in the west farah and nimroz are known to have organized criminal networks the security map source undss shows the difference between southern and northern provinces in terms of security security incidents in afghanistan have been on the rise every year since 2003 especially in the south and southwestern provinces the number of security

the district police chief both attacks were carried out by suicide bombers the poppy eradication force pef faced large number of rocket attacks while carrying out eradication in hilmand province the nature of the attacks changed between 2007 and 2008 in 2007 police deaths were the result of violence by farmers whereas deaths in 2008 were the result of insurgent actions including suicide attacks 5480 of opium poppy eradication verified total of 5480 of eradicated poppy fields were verified by mcnunodc this included governorled eradication gle 4306 and eradication led by the centrally controlled poppy eradication force pef 1174 it should be noted that the figure provided for gle is result of adjustments made to the initial figures reported by the field verifiers in the two

some of the key factors that could explain the drop in eradication carried out in 2008 are oa reduction in the number of provinces eradicating because of the number of poppy free provinces and provinces with negligible levels of cultivation increased in 2008 in 2007 26 provincial governors conducted eradication in 2008 only 17 provinces conducted eradication ooverall crop failure due to an extremely cold winter reduced the poppy crop in number of provinces 15 the final figure adjusted using high resolution satellite images 21oincreased voluntary andor forced selferadication by poppy farmers an active public information campaign and vigorous enforcement action by some provincial governors led to substantial amount of selferadication carried out by farmers either voluntarily or through coercion these figures cannot be counted in the official figures because they are not verifiable but the claims are in the order of 3000 4000 ounlike previous years most of the cultivation is

grow opium or even more because cultivating cannabis is less labour intensive than opium though the opium survey does gather some data on cannabis cultivation estimates can be provided in this preliminary report it is clear however that cultivating cannabis is becoming increasigly lucrative when this is considered in conjuction with the fact that all the emphasis is put on reducing opium
