basic purpose lecture given on 20 april 1963 thank you well i hope you havent gotten too wet i hope you havent gotten too wet ill try to dry you out now by putting your attention on some energy masses that will develop heat like to talk to you something about goals tell you something about goals and so forth because this is your easiest entrance point as far as cases and interest is concerned everybody has goal now when you say goal thats the way it registers with people they have goal they want to get their goal you hear this you hear this i would like to get my goal so forth i used to say it myself and thirteen banks later you see well it becomes rather obviousit becomes rather obvious that person has great many more than one basic purpose now basic purpose is not something goal is not something that is new in dianetics and scientology by long ways not at all youll find it mentioned in dianetics the modern science of mental health book one talks about every person has basic purpose and this is monitoring factor as far as his life is concerned and so on well this is what makes the difference amongst people this is the thing that makes the difference completely aside from the fact that thetans are not different castes or classes or something like that but they do have their own inclinations quite individuated or individual as far as purposes are concerned now if they werent different as beings originally its my contention that they would not take quite as many divergent paths and postulate quite as many different basic purposes this fellow wants to catch catfish and that fellow wants to be tiger and this girl over here never wants to be shot and this sort of thing different different different different and persons basic purposes that he postulates and that you find him with are monitored by different tastes and different experience and so forth but were off in nevernever land that at this stage we cannot talk about as to what makes one thetan different than another thetan before he starts living and before he has any experience that is not an area we can at this time discuss but we can discuss this one we can discuss this one person who has the basic purpose to be motorman naturally has an entirely different experiential track than somebody who has basic purpose to catch catfish you can see this fellow on the bank of the river now you know and hes lying there with fish pole and his experiential line doesnt include let us say banking and doesnt include war and so forth but this other fellow to be motorman well you try to get him out on fishing expedition and what fish you know what drives them hell start saying you know now this isthis is quite remarkable in that these two people because they had divergent purposes have lived through entirely different experiential tracks which has given them an entirely different experiential pattern now difference of experiential pattern it comes abouttwo people can walk down the street together and because they are slightly apart they see slightly different views of the same objects therefore their experiences walking down the street are different now you take person who walks down the street of modern city consistently and person who walks over the sussex countryside consistently we can see that their experiential track is widely different and we exchange position and the fellow who walks through the streets all the days of his life dodging scooters and taxicabs and that sort of thing we get him down here and he goes totriesstarts to go to sleep at night and he cant his ears hurt you know its too quiet and he takes walk outside and there is sort of an absence of anything it isnt that weve made things unfamiliar for him he doesnt know what dangers lurk but he feels its probably dangerous now theres more cruel thing than to send somebody away on twoor threeweek vacation who is busy busy person living in big city you know and we send him down to the seacoast and he sits down on the seacoast and its all different well he has experience with seacoasts let us say he doesntyou know just going on regular vacations gives you an experiential trackbut those waves coming in you know the waves coming in and he listens to these things he listens to these things lies there all night long listening to these waves coming in you know and he gets back and actually he has an apartment thats just above bus terminal you know and he gets back and he lies down in his bed and how nice it is you know to lie here in nice quiet peaceful london you know crash bang thud you know its whatpartially what hes familiar with but theres another point to it what purpose does person have that makes him live in london what purpose does person have that makes him live in the country what purpose does person have who would live on the seacoast these are all different now this is your bonus this is your bonus in clearing once you have cleared person of his basic purpose he can now perform it until then he cant why ive told you many many times that the only crime you can really commit is to deny yourself that to call yourself liar and say you are wrong that is the basic crime that being can commit he can say i have been wrong and look at this and he can do things which are an overt against himself this is the fundamental of course he does things that are overts against others too and its those things he apparently suffers from but in actual fact it is because he goes against his own basic purpose he sits down and he says all right now ive had very tough time of it and this way and that and things havent worked out just right and in this next few trillennia i am going to catch catfish now thati can trust myself to do that and i can lie on the riverbank and so on that seems very nice to thats very good and im going to catch catfish now he gets very adept at this as the years go on he gets better and better and the years go on and he gets better and better and he finally can say to himself that he is catfish catcher you see and oh he really catch catfish thats about the middle of the bank you know he just looks at river and the fish just leap out of the river you know and all this timeall this time however he has made fight of it and he has imperceptibly closed terminals consistently with the enemy well theres game wardens theres the people who dont think that you ought to catch catfish theres the preservation of fish society theres the baleful look that catfish gives you when you skin him you know and theres all sorts of various actions which are extremely detrimental to his goal to catch catfish so about the time he becomes catfish catcher why he has to admit that there are enemies to this goal he says you see and he goes on and from that point on for the last half of the duration of this basic purpose the individual turns against the purpose to catch catfish and we eventually find him not only someone who would never catch catfish thats not quite the top you see it is just catfish catching there just isnt any he has reality on it at all as matter of fact before he gets to that stage of course he has joined the society to prevent the catching of catfish and sooner or later he will form society to prevent the catching of catfish he has turned against his basic purpose now that is the state the basic purpose youre going to find in pc is in it is always an expended purpose once in while you are lucky enough to get the actual absolute top goal and if you find it it will have advanced greater or lesser distance into the present in other words the first goal that the pc is actually living is usually not found by the auditor the first crack isnt that interesting instead of that hell find the second or hell find the third something like this because its easier to find that one and you go ahead and run it the pcs perfectly happy with it and he says its his purpose but theres still lot of mass around and when he runs these things hey theres pains you know and they keep going through his neck and hes not quite happy about this whole thing and you realize that when youve run this bank youve got to go the other way youve got to go toward present time now and find later basic purpose and sometimes once more later basic purpose and its more difficult to find where that ends but that is all in the business of auditing now what im talking about however is youre going to find as the first basic purpose on the individual basic purpose that he has turned against and that is all wrapped up is gone expended he has nothing more to do with it ah but lets look at this lets look at this now on the standpoint of experience this person was at one time an expert he was real expert catfish catcher he was ahe was whizzer and man all youve got to do now is show him the label on can that has the picture of one whisker of catfish on it and he just goes bluuuh these are allergies by the way and other things of that sort come under this same heading you see and thats all youve got to show him well now after youve audited him what happens does he become unable the odd part of it is for the first time he will be able to perform that basic purpose he can catch catfish or leave them alone he is able to exert power of choice now over his own actions with regard to that basic purpose lets take the poor fellow who wants to play piano you see he has basic purpose to play piano itd probably be expressed some other way like to be musician you see to play piano and this poor guy is forced every now and then to take music lessons something happens in life and he comes near piano and he cant read music and he gets his fingers caught and breaks his fingernails you know on the keys and he keeps getting his foot caught down here in the midst of theof the pedals and all kinds of wild things happen every time he comes near piano well he goes over and sits down to the piano and just starts to play the piano and his arms get tired you know or they get tired and they start hurtingstart hurting way up here cant quite understand whats happening and the next daythe next day he comes down with sinusitis he knows what this is attributable to medical science has already determined has already determined that it is virus so he comes down with this virus called piano and there he is there he is hes going to be sick and so forth of course hell still kind of monkey withhe cant quite get away from it he cant quite have nothing to do with it you get ahold of him you audit him you find this goal to play piano you finish the thing out now the funny part of it is he can now play piano or not play piano but heres test of it in general ability in general ability alone auditing out basic purpose results in an increase in ability in all lines we you get that one just not just playing piano you audit that out youve unfixated him to degree where he is now more skilled and more able generally you see because his attention isnt fixed now if you audit out to be motorman out of somebody who is trying to play piano you will find out that as you run out his basic purpose to be motorman he will learn how to play piano better you understand so theres that general gain that by the way is the most observable gain this individual is now more able generally because his attention isnt fixated but lets talk about the specific basic purpose now lets supposing this poor guy is trying to play piano and hes got goal to play piano which is run out and the top of it is piano playing you see thats finished and he gets allergies when he comes near piano and all these various things we run that outand this is the specific gain that you getall of sudden he walks over and sits down to the piano you see and he can play piano he never played piano before see but now he can suddenly play piano in other words he is now capable of executing his skills on his experiential line dont you see lets get this poor fellow who has goal to be general and then of course one ofany one of these modern armies would accept him and he has he has this goal to be general and hes got to be general and well they eventually elect him president of the united states you know i mean theysomething like that and hes got this goal and there he is and my golly he cant be general hell do something weird every time hes always kind of sickly he cant quite make it on any line you see and here he is with this goal auditor comes along and they find the basic purpose to be general they audit it out for the first time the fellow could be general you see theres the trick after the individual has postulatedhas made his basic purpose stick with himselfhe then is committed along fixed line against which he eventually turns and he can longer do what he decided to do its like new years resolutions there is nothing as dead as new years resolution in september well you know it yourself you cant even remember this is only april so here is the crux of the situation is after the individual has lived he should have the ability to live but because hes made basic postulates and turned against them he then lives less by the ordinary action the more you associated with this universe the more you associated with life the better you would be able to fare in life now that is in the cards we know that an auditor can take somebody out herejust ordinary processinghe takes somebody out here that cant pass drivers test heevery time he goes down why the police say hahahaha you again you know and take his shillings you know because they have to live or they think they do and gets another permit or you know test and he goes through this thing and he flunks again he keeps turning uturns where he should do right turns you know and you can always tell these fellows that are going to fail the fellow that rides with them you know steps out and looks scared you know well you take this fellow and you dont have tothis was the way the world used to go you know swami swami you will now you know hypnotize him you know you will now be able to pass your drivers test do you remember the scandal theyd had down here in brighton somebody was hypnotizing people so they could pass their drivers test i dont know if you remember that or not but you actually can implant suggestion in somebody that he can and it will last for quite while right up to the first wreck anyway and any auditor can take this individual that cant pass this examination and just get him to familiarize himself with the car not to the degree of going around and driving the car but just reach and withdraw from the fenders well oh alots of us have done this just reach and withdraw from the fenders reach and withdraw from the bonnet reach and withdraw from the windscreen reach and withdraw reach and withdraw turn the key on and off turn it on and off turn it on and off and the next doggone thing you know individual sort of goes wog and something hits him and he looks at this and acegets in the car and he can drive it have you ever seen this or shadow f_ this phenomenon occur its common phenomenon all rightto us in scientology it is itd probably look like miracle in the world of science i love that world of science anyway here are theseheres this familiarization now we know in auditing that if you familiarize somebody with something he can then accomplish it unless there is some deepseated engramic reliable item or something that is kicking his head off you wont be able to do it all right but we know then that familiarization results in tolerance that is in the ordinary course of existence well the reactive mind by fixation on purpose brings about reduction of experience this motorman would go on strike if anybody asked him to be conductor and some of them have recently you know and theyveand in the united states the railroads are all going broke because the unions have it all fixed up that every diesel locomotive has to have coal passer coal passer just rides to chicago or new york he never does tap of work you see seems funny seems funny they could find something for this fellow to do but hes fixated on this purpose and oddly enough will never become familiar with diesel locomotive and one fine day the law will slip or something like that and longer hold this what they call featherbedding in and this individual has not familiarized himself with railroading hes got fixed action hes always in fixed state with regard to his immediate environment and where you have basic purpose you have somebody in fixed state have you ever tried to talk to somebody who had some sort of social problem and had him answer you at the end of an hour or twos dissertation on your part you know you justlogic coming out youre just absolutely beautiful if you just could have had tape of it you see you could have found out how brilliant you were in arguing with him on this point have you ever had such conference all right and at the end of that time find this bird twice as convinced of his first opinion thats what hes got to do well of course youre not going up againstyoure not going up against now familiarization or reason or anything of the sort youre going up against fixation now fixation will deliver into somebodys hands great deal of experience doubt about that this girl has goal to dance and boy shes been dancing in here and there and you get back to the temples of nineveh and she was dancing back there and there isnt anything she doesnt know about dancing except now she walks like this so she cant see well you take this girl shes got terrific track on the subject of dancing and you clear her of this purpose to dance it takes the fixation off which prevents the familiarization and when you take that fixation off then the individual can function and the first thing you know boy can she dance there isnt anything she doesnt know about dancing in other words youve cashed in at once about the experiential track and there it is so let us put it this way youve been living for quite while whether you are aware of it or not you have been living quite while and youre about to cash in youre about to cash in the only way you can actually cash in is to free your attention from the failures of the cycles of these past basic purposes but everybody has basic purpose now its very funny that they all admit they have basic purpose and will discuss this with you and will look for it and will be audited on it and will do everything under the sun about the subject of basic purpose you they neveryou never mentioned to them that this basic purpose may have been going on you see for very very long time you never have to tell them anything about this well thats quite interesting isnt it as matter of fact even in the us ive seen some newspaper stories devoted to scientology very friendly ones on the subject of everybody has basic purpose thats quite interesting i mean thats an open door everybody has basic purpose whats yours you know and people get quite engrossed with this because their attention of course is fixated in that particular direction but theyre very interested in it why because theyve got tremendous experiential track along that line and anybody who has had one and departed from it wishes he could have it again what he wants is the experience that went along with it what he wants is the memory of all the adventures hes had along that line and yet he doesnt have those anymore theyre so closed out he doesnt even remember his basic purpose which is very gruesome joke and very grim well right here what happens that an individual cant remember everything hes ever been and done and cant remember his basic purpose why not its the instantaneous character of the reactive mind everything in the reactive mind is monitored by instantaneousness everything is instantaneous time is actually the single source of human aberration and this instantaneousness reflects itself in the fact that when you find your firstand im talking about you when you as an auditor find your first ri on pc or you as preclear have your first ri found on you itll look like its right now it always has that sensation with it its always right now and you find an earlier one and an earlier one and each one is right now and you find anyou find an earlier basic purpose and its right now too and you find an earlier basic purpose and its all right now in other words instantaneousness time has ceased to exist time has ceased to exist time has closed out the individual longer conceives of time spans on this subject he only conceives of instantaneousness in other words time has perished and so each individual is carrying around this terrific instantaneousness of things he was doing lord knows when and he thinks of these things as an instantaneous occurrence and because of this character he can then only spot those things which he himself has been definitely connected with over period of time such as he has lived in this house in this body for ten years so therefore he has that much track you see and his current lifetime will have memory connected with it but everyone agrees that nobody has lived beforenot because they are mean not because they are trying to get even with each other its because before doesnt exist only now exists you see and when they try to think before this life they run straight into the instantaneous character of the reactive bank so there isnt anything there there is noness of yesterday it doesnt exist its all instantaneous these thingsthese things you can experience theres nothing much to this but the its rather fantastic when pc suddenly looks up andhes been going along with you you know going running along and he doesnt know anything about the past or anything of the sort and hes running along and hes been running out reliable items out of the bank and hes been running out his basic purpose and hes been going at it and so forth and he looks up and he says this is very very peculiar you say whats peculiar well i could i could get the idea i saw few days ago picture of the french revolution and somebody beheading somebody i dont quite take this take what well it seems like this is trillions of years ago in some space society or itsor its on some planet someplace else orgee whose memory am i running oh thats the answer yes somebody elses mind yes yes itsi must be running somebody elses mind you see and this is prompted by the fact that all of these identities are other identities than the one he has now his instantaneous characteristic is eventually discharged and now he has time you get most people you know theyyou think that they cant remember back of five years or something if the psychologist had made thorough examination of this situationthat is hed have found quite differently that person is incapable the ordinary person on the street of remembering past the age of twelve or eleven or something its quite late its quite late they have some spotty memories somebody else has told them about and theyll quote these to you as their actual early track in this lifetime so actually not even this lifetime is total memory span so dont be surpriseddont be surprised when the memory span closes down back of this lifetime now that which youve seen as time track on pc which did lead back into past lives is outside this reactive bank and these items and identities thats what you call free track and you can run person up and down this free track but every once in whilehes got this airplane in some earlier life or whatever it is and hes every once in while this airplane is okay but the left wing is black well get away from that if youre just running free track because hes seenhes seen the borderline where this incident impinges upon the goals problem masses in the bank which are black masses so you can run person on free track and do quite bit with this but the track they have actually lived arduously on their own basic purposes is not there its just not there its just one big black scrunch totally instantaneous so of course nobodys ever lived before because thats instantaneous see and theres nothing there dont you see thats the state man is in he is not living the life he thinks he is living now you go about the business as an auditor of finding the basic purpose of an individual and you will find him just as happy as can be and i have an announcement for you auditors about the most therapeutic best groovedin acceptable auditing pc can have is contained in the activities under the heading of quote trying to find goal unquote now because youll be straining so hard to find the pcs goal you miss this fact that the most rewarding processing the pc can receive is the effort to find goal i think thats quite interesting because of course its liable to be missed the auditor misses it the pc misses it both of them are sitting there saying i wonder what my goal is i wonder what your goal is dont you see and theyre working away to get this goal and theyre working at it and theyre working at it and theyre working at it and theyre working at it now if the auditor doesnt know this fact he gets the pc all stirred up all the time about an anxiety of not having the pcs goal see he gets the pc all anxious on the subject of well whats your goal ive been auditing you now for fifty hours and we havent got any goal yet now put your goal down on the list you know and he harasses the pc or the pcs starting to get worried because well theyve gone this far and they havent found the pcs goal in actual fact the pc is not up to confronting his goal theres an element of luck and an element of confront in it and he hasnt put the goal down on the list and the moment when the pc puts the goal down on the list is in the lap of the gods it is not predeterminable moment now there are lots of tricks by which you can find pcs goals find them very rapidly all this sort of thing but what do we mean very rapidly youll find pcs goal as soon as the pc puts his goal down on goals list and you wont find the pcs goal any sooner than that in other words youve got to have his goal to find it now therefore goals finding is totally determined on the basis of how long is it going to be before the person puts his goal on the list thats how long it takes to find goal given good auditing his goal will be found as soon as he puts it on the list an auditor finding goals uses an arc break to establish having gone past pcs goal because you go over and past pcs goal and hell explode he wont tell you youve missed his goal hell just be very upset with you and very upset with the world at large and you go back few goals page or two and theres his goal sitting there and you didnt give it enough attention it rocket read and it did this and it did that but you said well were gonna well get to that next week sometime and so forth and bow he doesnt even know whats going towhatyou dont know what hit you as an auditor this perfectly sweet pc thats always been so propitiative you know all of sudden starts telling you all the mean vicious nasty things that you have done they never say youve missed my goal or anything like that its you who are the villain you see and you go back and you look at it and you will find the goal sitting there on the list youve gone over it but anyway you cant find the pcs goal that is ready to be found until the pc puts it on the list now there are goals that are common to every pc and unfortunately so far as i know these goals are too far back and too heavy to be run the goal to create is common to everybody its an early track goal that sits back aroundwell of course itd vary from person to person but it sits back around 216 trillion years when you run that thing its just like oh i dont know eat dinner with burning fused dynamite on the middle of the table you know its dangerous pc will live through it even if you did that you can find goals that are common to every case but i repeat they are too early on the track and too strong and too far from the pcs reality to even read as goals he can put these goals on the track and you can read them to the pc but they wont read now washington had fad going every once in while an organization will get fad going on favorite goal and washington had the goal to be some of the pcs they were running to be on you know they were looking awful creaky thats way back thats way back thats tough goal see thats tough well look at the simple character of it what do you think simpleminded spirit flying around the universe all of sudden he says well the solution to all of my problems im going to say now that im going to be that is it you can see where the goal would sit on the track and you try to run such goal and youre in trouble so although there are goals in common to all pcs that is not good method of finding the pcs goal now the later the goal is the closer it is to now why the more complicated the goal isthe more complex it is and the more finite and youre going to find some funny goals youre going to find some goals that you wouldnt think would be the pcs goal we used to have this opinion ah it doesnt seem to be the pcs goal and so forth goal like that to wreck cars ah carslifetime its nothing and yet youre liable to find such goal the nearer they are to pt the nearer they are to present timethe more complex they are and the more definitive and the more defensive theyre the goals of person who has had it you know to have nothing to do with men see you know to leave to have money good survival goals you know now those goals are the goals that are nearer present time and the closer you can find that goal to present time eventually why the better off youll be but heres the strange part of it all the closer it is to present time the probability is the harder it will be to find so you take the goal you can find that is offered by the pc you dont try to force goals off on pc at least at this stage of processing you dont try to force goals off on pc you wait till the pc puts it on the list and you give him proper questions and you use what we had here 212 to find items and you list goals against that these are all fast methods of finding goals there are all kinds of rapid ways of doing it there are phrases likethe best phrase of them all is tell the most antisurvival goal you can think of you get nice list of that and very often the pc puts it right down on the list bang and then he gets to thinking about it and when you null that little list and you read that goal it doesnt go out and he says ohoooh that scares stiff thats my goal now there are questions of this character that you can get the pc to list on that very often deliver it but sometimes the pc will not put his goal on the list matter what questions you use list after list item after item and so forth youre liable not to get the pcs goal on list until he has listed as many as five thousand goals we have one actually on record but on that one trick questions were used that pc was just listing listing listing listing five thousand goals up the line the pc put the goal on the list another case three thousand goals and on that case some of the goals were gotten by trick questions but the first fifteen hundred of them i think or something like that werent maybe the first thousand of them werent just didnt put his goal on the list well now these trick questionsyou can get it on the list faster and this opens up whole thing and again we are lucky taking goals from pc and listing them and taking meter and reading them againston the meter and marking them in or out and eliminating them and bringing them downand now im talking about short goals list goals you should list in short lists dont list long goals lists now list short lists couple of pages just till the question you are asking longer reads when you ask it of the pc it longer ticks on the meter just couple of pages you null those things down call each one three times mark it in or out you know its whether or not it disturbs the needle of the meter call it three times youll find that you have three or four goals left in call these three or four goals you have couple left in now take those two or take the four and put in what you call the lefthand buttons these are suppress careful of and failed to reveal put those in on the goals you have left we didnt find goals easier because we didnt have those secret buttons it takes those three buttons to make goal rocket read we would have seen rocket reads years ago if it hadnt of beenif wed had those buttons but you put those three buttons in and the goal either stays in or goes out and then youve got one goal left in and now put in the kitchen sink on the thing see just put everything in on it you dont have to put eighteen buttons you can put in eight buttons or something like that your big mid rud buttons is what theyre called and that goal is going to produce ordinarily fireworks its not the pcs goal but its cousin and it is something the pcs attention is fixated on youre liable to get all kinds of action from this and the pc begins to feel terrific you know about life and that sort of thing well you familiarized the pc with goal now you should get one of these goals for every list you do there should be one active goal for every list you do these little short lists you just sit down and make list of goals couple of pages long and you take meter and read those back to the pc and mark the ones in or out and then put in your rudiments buttons and so forth on what youve got left you should get blowdown the ta rise the charge comes off the case the pc cognites feels fine everything is fine and you should get such reaction as that just about every list you do now if you find dead list that doesnt give you very hot goal let that go by but if youve done couple of lists that dont give you hot goals beware what has happened now is the pcs attention has been stuck on one of these early track goals we call it favorite goal what goal did you really think it was well i thought it was the goal to create ohhohoho yes all right you thought it was that goal thats fine you do another type of list you write down on that list what goal would you postulate after the goal to create or afterpardon meafter to create had failed and you just do little twopage list of that till the question longer reads when you call it on the meter what goal would you postulate after the goal or after to create had failed and hell give you list and that takes his attention off of that goal that cant be run you see moves his attention up the track toward present time you again start getting heavy action and reaction from your pc and you start getting these hot goals and the pc feels fine you just keep this up now theres only one thing wrong with this as process its probably the most wonderful processing you can give pcirrespective of finding the pcsthe goal see theres only one thing wrong with it is you eventually find the goal now what do you do well its all up now found the pcs goal cant run him on the routine 2 processes anymore there he is hes had it weve got his goal every time you say it it rocket reads every time you try to come off of it or do anything else with it or take him someplace else on routine 2 he arc breaks there he is i mean weve got his goal what are you going to do well actually of course by reasons of classification and training and that sort of thing you cant start your routine 3g on him and find items and that sort of thing youre going to wrap yourself yourself and the pc around telegraph pole and thats whats the trouble with this goals finding process everybody will listen to it everybody will run it and you should run it on pcs but the trouble with it is it finally winds up with finding the pcs goal and then it lands you in spot where you havent been trained and you say well what about this how serious is this how serious is this how thoroughly do i have to go into this well i would say offhand that nobody isand imyou know down deep in your heart im the last one that ever stopped you auditing on anything on anybody you know you know that sooner or later youre going to find the goal its going to be sitting there rocket reading there you are youve got it ah oh well where was that bulletin on routine 3m2 lets see you sit the pc there now what is this pattern of the bank i think we have to find the top oppterm thats what i heard top oppterm now thatthe top oppterm is always the goal to catch catfish thats what that is or noi dont know ive lost the bulletin joe borrowed it i think thats right i think its the goal to do something or other well the only difficulty the only bodys going to be uncomfortable in this situation is the pc how do you put this pc on ice while you go get trained youre going to do this youre going to do this some of you its perfectly all right well do everything we can to help you i know very well that you wont do anything else but routine 3m holds with it its most violent guarantee of being followed you do it wrong it has its own selfdisciplinary measures you cant mess up somebodys bank bank is absolutely impervious to being messed up you can find items in it you can shoot it around you can turn it upside down pc says hes dying that youve killed him and so forth you havent somebody on proper routine 3m2 can go right back to that bank matter how badly it was run or mauled or anything else and put it all back together again maybe theres couple of items discharged at the top or something like that its going to be very hard on somebody and worry is the occupational disease of clearing i have neverim theres couple of auditors here i could look at that i have never known to worry pc could lie in the middle of the floor screaming at high c and they would just never have worried pc practically on his deathbed and the auditor never would have worried huh both of these auditors have worried like mad so they practhey didnt sleep at night while running 3m2 its worrying process were you right were you wrong is this the way you run it how do you do it hohoho wow thats why ive had to take some awful fast shortcuts in researching it is because theres such demand for the knowledge i mean it isnt anything that you can just say well well do that next year you see people have got pcs still sitting in the auditing chair they havent gone home yet you see waiting for to do some research now the best waythe best way to get clearthe best way to get clear is actually to get trained as an auditor odd isnt it get trained up in very modern techniques as an auditor this isnt any sales talk for training im just giving you the truth i myself would rather hate to be run to ot without being welltrained auditor id hate to have that happen to id be too much of the effect of the lines and various other things would occur about the best way to get clear is to become good auditor now thats the best way now the next best way to become clear is to get it done by somebody who is very well trained indeed now those are very rapid methods of getting clear your next method of getting clear is to take somebody who doesnt quite know how with you not well trained on it and dub through somehow people are going to make it at that level therell be arms and legs missing and so forth but theyll still make it at that level we always have that kind of auditing and the other is the coaudit line where you have very heavily supervised auditing very expert supervision over few pcs and so on who are quite amateurish but theyre being steered very closely through routine 3m2 by the way does lend itself to this process its actually easier to clear them if youre clearing auditorin coaudit group it is easier to clear them than it is to find their goals because that requires little more skill you could steer these people through theyre not going to do anything wrong that will land them in any kind of trouble if youre checking all the way through because now youre running on preconceived pattern if they havent found an item that did this this and this gave rocket read and blew the tone arm down if they didnt find such an item its not it this thing lends itself to this type of processing providing the person who is doing the supervision is an expert and is experienced along this line so there is another method and then theres another methodtheres another method of getting clear on this and that is at slightly lower echelon and that is couple of guys get ahold of couple of books and some bulletins and they read them very hard and they start doing it on each other i suppose at hasi london they will be getting calls from such people quite periodically pc is wrapped all around the chandelier and the other fellow cant do anything about it i would say thats very insecure method of going about it i would say that was rather poor one but nevertheless it will occur because such things have occurred now there are some new attributes for clearing there are some new clearing processes lot of you have had 212 items and lot of you by the way have found on pcs and have had found on yourselves various items of one kind and another you know anything that somebody could run process on at any time in the development of scientology do you see what i mean by an item anything see person said well the trouble with you is your motherwere going to run ow on your mother you get the idea all right so thats mother thats an item now any one of those things that have ever been found you should carefully collect either on your pc or on yourself you should carefully collect them because this is one of the routine 2g processes and is quite valuable i think its 2g3 and this process requires that you list goals against these items and those items the earlier they are the more reliable they are to find goals with interesting well youve found two things out here today youve found two things out here today youve found that all of your auditing hasnt been wasted its still valuable and very likely some item that was found on you in lord knows when by whom if you say what would be the goal of whatever the item was and take twothreepage list till the question longer reads of that will very possibly have your goal right on it and those are all valuable those old items and the earlier they are the more valuable they were it didnt matter whether theyd proven were checked out proven to be reliable items or anything else just use all of them and the other thing is that youve been clearing people for years you have been clearing people for years youve been clearing them of problems youve been clearing them this way and clearing them that way you havent understood clearing so much in that definition but wait till you take raw meat pc who has never had anything run on them doesnt even know how to sit in the chair and doesnt know which end and the middle bank is and try to run raw clearing on this pc you will thank the lord that you have had some auditing now you yourself in auditing whatever auditing youve done has been very successful far more successful than anything else being done on the planet even in its crudest stages were not at this time abandoning everything we know about auditing dont get that idea dont get that idea and im not in any way discrediting anything youve ever done for cases dont get that idea either weve just made brand spankingnew breakthrough here that is highly skilled activity and so forth i want you to know that it exists now you i greatly appreciate the work which auditors here have done youve done people lot of good they very often have said you didnt when you did they instinctively knew that up along the line someplace there was an open sesame to freedom to total nonaberration they sniffed this out as beings and when you werent able to give that totally to them they tended to be little bit nattery on the subject therefore you are entitled to know that that gate has been opened all the way to ot have another announcement to make this is listing meter this is doll this is listing meter this is prototype and the manufacturers of this almost made us promise not to show you this this was just for to work with but nevertheless it tells you what it is its listing meter you put it down and its got glass see the glass see you can look through it and its got needle inside this glass and that needle bangs and pops back and forth and gives you all kinds of reads and you put this down like this and then you take your piece of paper underneath this and your pencil and you look through the glass as you write pretty good huh i invented it with my own little thetan now anyway this good piece of newsa rather fine quality works this is not as fine at all meter as of course the mark v which is real doll but this meter with rather good works in itbetter than i thought we could do the thingis in production and is quite cheap its quite cheap because i know youll be wanting them in coaudits and that sort of thing running various activities and coaudits and i know you will want one yourself and so on so weve made the best meter we could and were selling it with practically profit line on it at all old edgar over there just groans at the idea you see that it doesnt carry any profit with it at all its almost giveaway theim going to hand this over to edgar so that you can look at it after were through here and youll be able to take closer look at it but thats kind of interesting now couple of other things id like to say to you one of them is because youre doing something about human aberration or because youre doing something about the mind people tend to hold you responsible for the mind on an identified basis dont you see you get how this is because you can do something for the mind or you know about the mind then they say that you probably caused it and they tend to hold you responsible for all of the aberration and the bad weather on earth you see they tend to hold you responsible for everything thats ever gone on in their lives everything well actually its not true that an individual cant be hurt by life he sure can be but it is definitely true it is definitely true that the major trouble was caused by himself and not by anybody else and one thing i hate to have happen is for somebody to come up and accuse of having made this universe this way or look at an auditor and sort of accuse him of having fixed them up the way they are now were willing to take all the responsibility in the world for bailing people out and even take responsibility for aberrating people you know youd have to otherwise that would go on an automaticity not that were going to aberrate anybody but in order to takein order to take the aberration factor into account you had better realize that you didnt do it to him you see you didnt do it to him he did it to himself you follow that and youre actually doing him considerable favor to bail him out frankly there is greater favor that you could do anybody than to use well good scientology processing on somebody theres greater favor and i myself got into this because mary sue was auditing with great success and she hadnt put her goal down on the list yet and i was still sweating over trying to find her goal and i had this idea that 200 trillion years from now shed still be going on the track you see aberrated you know and still trapped in it all having cleared you see and having made an ot she was still going on because i couldnt find her goal it was driving around the bend the obligation was just too great similarly all of the favors that you have done and all of the friendship you have given and so on i appreciate too we couldnt have done thiswe couldnt have done this otherwise and i dont care how little youve done or how much youve done or how much fuss youve kicked up in the process of doing itthat was all forgiven on the march 13th amnesty by the way did you remember that i want you to know definitely that i appreciate what youve done i appreciate the people youve talked to i appreciate the auditing youve done good auditing bad auditing it doesnt matter i appreciate it do you understand because i appreciate your trying and your carrying through now theres greater favor that you could do anybody than to process them and for your support ive been trying to give you all the information make all kinds of training available make everything available so that you could find your way out too we tend in world which is all too anxious to notis everything that is going on to rather discount our own importance as an individual our own importance as group we dont realize the force we have as group as scientologists or the force we have as individuals we dont realize these things until sometimes we look at the world outside of us and although i try to protect you youre delicate from much of the bad news and things that go on and the battles lost and won i have tendency to hold these things close in theres an awful fuss raised about scientology were not doing anything to anybody and you never saw such fuss australia australias been throwing stories in the papers theyve had the attorney general ofi dont know the attorney general or corporal or whatever he istheyve gone to fantastic lengths to wipe out scientology in australia boy they just had everybody in the fight see and the boys down in melbourne have been holding front line that was pretty hot firing line recently and very easily scientology could have been wiped out organizationally in australia very easily and why all this investment of time and trouble why are the medical doctors investing tons of money in stopping us were not even curing anybody were not trying theytrying to do make us so mad well start healing people but why all this investment of government and police power and so forth why well we must be more dangerous than we think thats all i can say to you on the subject we must be far more dangerous than we think we are because when it comes right down to firing the last shot they dont dare pull the trigger and we just received cable from melbourne wed won hands down wed won the fight theyd run from the field and it was all very simple and some of the scientologists down there wrote letters in to the attorney generals office and solicitor went down and filed paper and they ran like scared pups interesting isnt it and although we have fantastic fight going on in the united states over emeters we mustnt let these nasty things around people might tell the truth and where would government be then now theres that fight going on andalthough this is very far from won theres an old sourcethats an over thats ended in australia this is very far from won in the states the government is tentatively suing for peace they want peace they say cant we dream up label we could put on these meters which would just forget the whole thing huhhuh please this is very peculiar i never fought an action like this i never fought an action like this before where the powerful enemy armed with rockets and nuclear warheads appears on the horizonhes going to crush you you see actually hes got the power all hed have to do is sneeze practically and hed blow all the organizations away and all of sudden he gets scared and runs interesting we cant count on that all the way down the line we cant count on that happening all the way down the line but with this much upset in other nationsnot england there is none in englandwith this much upset here and there in other nations what on earth what on earth whats this all about we must be far more dangerous than we think and i think we are dangerous and i got to thinking about it the other day and i told regi told reg i said you know i said theyre right to attack us theyre just absolutely dead right to attack us this way theyre just absolutely dead right look what would happen if we won all the way look at what would happen to them wouldnt that be terrible and he agreed with yeah theyre dead right to attack us they must be must be they cant be as wrong as they seem to be and we must be dangerous anybody who holds this much truth in the palm of his hand the truth held indifferently by any student of scientology is more truth than has been on this planet for an awful long time and any advanced student is holding more truth in his paws than any great philosopher of ancient greece im not trying to swell it up but we know it works now move it on forward and take this as collective organization i dont think that we would tolerate as many lies as were told so theyre dead right to attack us and i suppose we are dangerous but we dont intend to be but dont worry about these because from here on its going to be worse do you understand because up to this timeup to this time there was lot of hope in our efforts and claims you understand and now the better we teach here and the better they work at hasi london and the better you work in the field and the better trained we all are the more acquainted we are and the more results we deliver we become real threat real threat i dont intend to be threat i dont intend to be threat but look at all the games we spoil at once look at the games we spoil look atlook at them good valuable games such as hang all criminals see nothing can be done for anybody anyplace look at the television programs wed spoil look at that look at that you seen these medical programs lately on tv my children are fascinated with them absolutely fascinated with them they watch them all very carefully they turn from one channel to the other to watch the operations to laugh but think of what would happen now were not trying to do anything bad but i suppose forceful good is something this planet is not used to and were it well our congress draws to close our day has been very wet one but i hope for you pleasant one nevertheless i hope you dont all come down with the sniffles and if you do get processed and i want to thank particularly all of you for coming down here today i wish id had better day for you but as i said we tried to make it always before ive been trying desperately to make scintillant state of clear before congress congress comes up i say well ive got to be clear before this congress and everythings got to be fine and weve got to straighten all this out before this congress you see and mary sue always gets mad when i say that she says youve been clearer longer than anybody we know but anyhow thats beside the point now i made it see but this congress why i should have gotten to be ot and handle this weather for you see so ihere trying to be ot so that when i do make when i do make it im going to have you all down here again oh you didnt believe and in the meantime why the rhododendrons were late this year the rhododendrons were all late this year we had very rough winter and lot of them got frozen they all recover but usually at this time of year saint hill is just one great mass of rhododendron blossoms from one end to the other and so on so they arent out and you had very very rainy day here today so im going to extend to each and every one of you an invitation to drive in and drive around and walk around as soon as the weather is better and the rhododendrons are out why i owe you all good look at saint hill in good weather okay audience okay well thank you thank you very much for being here thanks lot for coming down youreim glad to see you i havent seen much of you ive been working too hard and although you think that might be pose sometime why just look at the number of bulletins youve been getting lately and youll understand but i dont see enough of you and as soon as i get the workload off i intend to remedy that considerably so thanks for you being you and thanks for being down here and good afternoon
