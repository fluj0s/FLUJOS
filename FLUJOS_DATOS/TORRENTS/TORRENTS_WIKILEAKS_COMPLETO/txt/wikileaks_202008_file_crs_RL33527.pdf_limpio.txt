third of its annual research and development budget for intramural rd to meet mission requi rements in over 700 government laboratories including federally funded research and development centers the technology and expertise generated by this endeavor may have application beyond the immediate goals or intent of federally funded rd these applications can result from technology transfer process by which technology developed in one organization in one area or for one purpose is applied in another organization in another area or for another purpose it is way for the results of the federal rd enterprise to be used to meet othe r national needs including the economic growth that flows from new commercialization in the private sector the governments requirements for products and processes to operate effectively and efficiently and the demand for increased goods and services at the state and local level congress has established system to facilitate the transfer of technology to the private sector and to state and local governments despite this use of federal rd results has remained restrained although there has been significant increase in private sector interest and activities over the past several years critics argue that working with the agencies and laboratories continues to be difficult and timeconsuming proponents of the current effort assert that while the laboratories are open to interested parties the industrial comm unity is making little effort to use them at the same time state governments are increasingly involved in the process at issue is whether incentives for technology transfer remain necessary if additional legislative initiatives are needed to encourage increased technology transfer or if the responsibility to use the available resources now rests with the private sector httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33527g22g142g140g145g151g152g149g152g144 g162g561g22g155g138g151g156g143g142g155g497g561g23g156g142g561g152g143g561g8g142

cooperation integral to efforts associated with technology development in support of this approach congress enacted various laws facilitating cooperative research and development agreements cradas between federal agencies and the private sector and increasing funding for technology transfer activities included in the advanced technology program atp and the manufacturing extension partnership mep at the national institute of standards and technology nist laboratory of the department of commerce however many of these efforts have been revisited since the 104 th congress reflecting the then republican majoritys preferences for indirect measures such as tax policies intellectual property rights and antitrust laws to promote technology development rather than direct federal funding of private sector technology initiatives while none of the relevant programs were terminated until atp was replaced by the technology innovation program several have seen significant decreases in support enacted in the 110 th congress pl 1105 provided fy2007 appropriations of 1046 million for mep and 79 million for tp the presidents fy2008 budget requested significant decrease in support for

atp unobligated balances pl 11069 the america competes act authorizes funding for nist programs through fy2010 and creates various new initiatives within the laboratory the administrations original fy2009 budget request included 4 million to terminate federal support of the mep program and contained funding for tip on june 6 2008 the president submitted series of amendments to his budget one of which reduced the amount for the mep program to 2 million the fy2009 appropriations bill ordered reported from the house committee on appropriations would finance mep at 112 million while support for tip would total 652 million s 3182 as reported by the senate committee on appropriations provides 110 million for manufacturing extension and 65 million for tip several initiatives detailed in the american competitiveness initiative announced by the president in the 2006 state of the union address are included in bills before the current congress the aci proposed various innovationrelated

spent 137 billion in fy2007 on research and development to meet the mission requirements of the federal departments and agencies approximately onethird of this is for intramural research and development rd by federal laboratories including support for federally funded research and development centers while the major portion of this activity has been in the defense arena government rd has led to new products and processes for the commercial marketplace including but not limited to antibiotics plastics airplanes computers microwaves nd bioengineered drugs given the increasing competitive pressures on us firms in the international marketplace proponents of technology transfer argue that there are many other technologies and techniques generated in the federal laboratory system which could have market value if further developed by the industrial community similarly the knowledge base created by the agencies rd activities can serve as foundation for additional commercially relevant efforts in the private sector the movement of technology from the federal laboratories to industry and to state and local governments is achieved through technology transfer technology transfer is process by which technology developed in one organization in one area or for one purpose is applied in another organization in another area or for another purpose in the defense arena it is often called spinoff technology transfer can have different meanings in different situations in some instances it refers to the transfer of legal rights such as the assignment of patent title to contractor or the licensing of governmentowned patent to private firm in other cases the transfer endeavor involves the informal movement of information knowledge and skills through persontoperson interaction the crucial aspect in successful transfer is the actual use of the product or process without this the benefits from more efficient and effective provision of goods and services are not achieved however while the united states has perhaps the best basic research enterprise in the worldas evidenced in part by the large number of nobel prizes awarded to american scientistsother countries sometimes appear more adept at taking the results of this effort and making commercially viable products to be sold in us and world markets for further discussion of innovation and economic growth see crs report rl33528 industrial competitiveness and technological advancement debate over government policy by wendy h schacht despite the potential offered by the resources of the federal laboratory system the commercialization level of the results of federally funded research and development remained low through the 1980s studies indicated that only approximately 10 of federally owned patents were ever used there were various reasons for this including the fact that many of these technologies and patents had commercial application major factor in successful transfer is perceived market need for the technology or technique however because federal laboratory rd is generally undertaken to meet an agencys mission or because there are insufficient incentives for private sector research that the government deems in the national interest decisions reflect public sector rather than commercial needs thus transfer often depends on attempts to

government usetechnology pushrather than on market pull in other words technology is developed and use for it established because the expertise exists rather than because it is perceived to be needed additional barriers to transfer involve costs studies have estimated that research accounts for approximately 25 of expenditures associated with bringing new product or process to market thus while it might be advantageous for companies to rely on governmentfunded research there are still significant added costs of commercialization after the transfer of technology has occurred however industry unfamiliarity with these technologies the not invented here syndrome and ambiguities associated with obtaining title to or exclusive license for federally owned patents also contribute to limited level of commercialization complicating the issue is the fact that the transfer of technology is complex process that involves many stages and variables often the participants do not know or understand each others work environment procedures terminology rewards and constraints the transfer of technology appears to be most successful when it involves onetoone interaction between committed individuals in the laboratory and in industry or state and local government champions are generally necessary to see transfer through to completion because it is so often time and energyconsuming process given this technology transfer is best approached on casebycase basis that can take into account the needs operating methods and constraints of the involved parties

g11g151g157g142g155g142g156g157g561 the federal interest in the transfer of techno logy from government laboratories to the private sector is based on several factors the government requires certain goods and services to operate much of the research it funds is directed at developing the knowledge and expertise necessary to formulate these products and processes however the government has neither the mandate nor the capability to commercialize the results of the federal rd effort technology transfer is mechanism to get federally generated technology and technical knowhow to the business community where it can be developed commercialized and made available for use by the public sector federal involvement in technology transfer also arises from an interest in promoting the economic growth that is vital to the nations welfare and security it is through further development refinement and marketing that the results of research become diffused throughout the economy and can generate growth it is widely accepted that technological progress is responsible for up to onehalf the growth of the us economy and is the principal driving force in longterm economic growth and increases in our standard of living economic benefits of technology or technique accrue when product pro cess or service is brought to the marketplace where it can be sold or used to increase productivity when technology transfer is successful new and different products or processes become available to meet or induce market demand transfer from the federal laboratories can result in substantial increases in employment and income generated at the firm level cooperation with the private sector provides means for federal scientists and engineers to obtain stateoftheart technical information from the industrial community which in various instances is more advanced than that available in the government technology transfer is also way to assist companies that have been dependent on defense contracts and procurement to convert to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33527g22g142g140g145g151g152g149g152g144 g162g561g22g155g138g151g156g143g142g155g497g561g23g156g142g561g152g143g561g8g142

state and local governments to provide improved goods and services have been accompanied by recognition that expanded technological expertise can help meet many of these needs the transfer of technology and technical knowledge from government laboratories to state and local jurisdictions can allow for additional use of ideas and inventions that have been funded and created through federal rd intergovernmental technology transfer can also help state and local officials meet responsibilities imposed by federal legislation as state and local governments increasingly look for technological solutions the concept of public technologythe adaptation and utilization of new or existing technology to public sector needshas emerged the application of technology to state and local services is complex and intricate procedure in transferring technology from the federal laboratories the application often can be direct at other times alterations in technical products and processes may be necessary for application in the state and local environment however this adaptive engineering generally is not extensive or expensive and can be accomplished by federal laboratory and state and local personnel working together state and local government concerns with regional economic growth also have focused attention on technology transfer as mechanism to increase private sector innovation related activities within their jurisdiction in order to develop and foster an entrepreneurial climate many states and localities are undertaking the support of programs that assist high technology businesses and that often use the federal laboratory system state and local efforts to develop incubator centers for small companies may rely on cooperation with federal laboratories which supply technical expertise to firms locating at the center other larger programs to promote innovation in the state such as the ben franklin partnership in pennsylvania use the science and technology resources of federal personnel additional programs have been created involving state universities private companies and the federal laboratories with each program geared to the specific needs and

technology transfer commercialization act pl 106404 several practices have been established and laws enacted that are aimed at encouraging the private sector to utilize the knowledge and technologies generated by the federal rd endeavor these are discussed below

one of the primary federal efforts to facilitate and coordinate the transfer of technology among various levels of government and to the private sector is the federal laboratory consortium for technology transfer flc the consortium was originally established under the auspices of the department of defense in the early 1970s to assist in transferring dod technology to state and local governments several years later it was expanded to include other federal departments in voluntary organization of approximately 300 fe deral laboratories the federal technology transfer act of 1986 pl 99502 provided the flc with legislative mandate to operate and required the membership of most federal laboratories today over 600 laboratories are represented the basic mission of the federal laboratory consortium is to promote the effective use of technical knowledge developed in federal departments and agencies by networking the various member laboratories with other federal entities with state local and regional governments and with private industry to accomplish this the consortium establishes channels through which user needs can be identified and addressed it also provides means by which federal technology and expertise can be publicized and made available through individual laboratories to private industry for further development and commercialization access to the resources of the full federal laboratory system can be made through any laboratory representative the flc regional coordinators the washington area representative or by contacting the chairman or executive director the flc itself does not transfer technology it assists and improves the technology transfer efforts of the laboratories where the work is performed in addition to developing methods to augment individual laboratory transfer efforts the consortium serves as clearinghouse for requests for assistance and will refer to the appropriate laboratory or federal department the work of the consortium is funded by setaside of 0008 of the portion of each agencys rd budget used for the laboratories

the stevensonwydler technology innovation act recognizing the benefits to be derived from the transfer of technology the law explicitly states that it is the continuing responsibility of the federal government to ensure the full use of the results of the nations federal investment in research and development to this end the federal government shall strive where appropriate to transfer federally owned or originated nonclassified technology to state and cal governments and to the private sector prior to this law technology transfer was not part of the mission requirements of the federal

and mandated that technology transfer be accomplished as an expressed part of each agencys mission section 11 created the mechanisms by which federal agencies and their laboratories can transfer technology each department with at least one laboratory must make available not less than 05 of its rd budget for transfer activities although this requirement can and has been waived to facilitate transfer from the laboratories each one is required to establish an office of research and technology applications orta laboratories with annual budgets exceeding 20 million must have at least one fulltime staff person for this office although the latter provision can also be waived the function of the orta is to identify technologies and ideas that have potential for application in other settings additional incentives for the transfer and commercialization of technology are contained in various amendments to stevensonwydler pl 99502 the federal technology transfer act amends pl 96480 to allow governmentowne d governmentoperated laboratories gogos to enter into cooperative research and development agreements cradas with universities and the private sector the authority to enter into these agreements was extended to governmentowned contractoroperated laboratories generally the laboratories of the department of energy in the fy1990 defense authorization act pl 101189 crada is specific legal document not procurement contract which defines the collaborative venture it is intended to be developed at the laboratory level with limited agency review in agencies which operate their own laboratories the laboratory director is permitted to make decisions to participate in cradas in an effort to decentralize and expedite the technology transfer process generally at agencies which use contractors to run their laboratories specifically doe the crada is to be approved by headquarters pl 106398 however allows the agency to define certain conditions under which the crada may be approved by laboratory itself rather than headquarters the work performed under cooperative research and development agreement must be consistent with the laboratorys mission in pursuing these jo int efforts the laboratory may accept funds personnel services and property from the collaborating party and may provide personnel services and property to the participating organization the government can cover overhead costs incurred in support of the crada but is expressly prohibited from providing direct funding to the industrial partner in gogo laboratories this support comes directly from budgeted rd accounts prior to the elimination of line item in the budget to support nondefense energy technology transfer the energy department generally relied on competitive selection process run by headquarters to allocate funding specifically designated to cover the federal portion of the crada now these efforts are to be supported through programmatic funds under crada title to or licenses for inventions made by laboratory employee may be granted in advance to the participating company university or consortium by the director of the laboratory in addition the director can waive in advance any right of ownership the government might have on inventions resulting from the collaborative effort regardless of size of the company this diverges from other patent law which only requires that title to inventions made under federal rd funding be given to small businesses notforprofits and universities in all cases the government retains nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable paidup license to practice or have practiced the invention for its own needs laboratory personnel and former employees are permitted to participate in commercialization activities if these are consistent with the agencies regulations and rules of conduct federal employees are subject to conflict of interest restraints in the case of governmentowned

conflict of interest provisions regarding cradas to be included in the laboratories operating contracts within 150 days of enactment of the law preference for cooperative ventures is given to small businesses companies which will manufacture in the united states or foreign firms from countries that permit american companies to enter into similar arrangements according to the department of commerce between fy1999 and fy2003 approximately 2800 3000 traditional cradas were active each year during this time frame between 700 950 new traditional agreements were initiated yearly including nasa space act agreements pl 99502 provides for cash awards to federal laboratory personnel for activities facilitating scientific or technological advancements which have either commercial value or contribute to the mission of the laboratory and for the transfer of technology leading to commercialization as an additional incentive federal employees responsible for an invention are to receive at least 15 of royalties generated by the licensing of the patent associated with their work the agencies may establish their own royalty sharin g programs within certain guidelines if the government has the right to an invention but chooses not to patent the inventor either as current or former federal employee can obtain title subject to the abovementioned licensing rights of the government to further facilitate the transfer process provision of the national defense authorization act for fy1991 pl 101510 amends stevensonwy dler allowing government agencies and laboratories to develop partnership intermediary programs augmenting the transfer of laboratory technology to the small business sector pl 104113 the technology transfer improvements and advancement act clarifies existing policy with respect to the dispensation of intellectual property under crada by amending the stevensonwydler act responding to criticism that ownership of patents is an obstacle to the quick development of cradas this bill guarantees an industrial partner the option to select at the minimum an exclusive license for field of use to the resulting invention if the invention is made solely by the private party then they may receive the patent however the government maintains right to have the invention utilized for compelling public health safety or regulatory reasons and the ability to license the patent should the industrial partner fail to commercialize the invention

in response to concerns over the development and application of new technology the 1988 omnibus trade and competitiveness act contained several provisions designed to foster technology transfer the law redesignated the national bureau of standards as the national institute of standards and technology nist and mandated the establishment of among other things 1 an advanced technology program to encourage publicprivate cooperative efforts in the development of industrial technology and to promote the use of nist technology and expertise 2 regional manufacturing technolo gy transfer centers and 3 clearinghouse on state and local innovation related activities the setaside for operation of the federal laboratory consortium created in pl 99502 was also increased from 0005 of the laboratory rd budget to 0008 the advanced technology program atp provided seed funding matched by privatesector investment to companies or consortia of universities industries and government laboratories to accelerate the development of generic technologies that have broad application across industries the first awards were made in 1991 as of the end of 2007 824 projects had been funded

manufacturing companies use of knowledge and technology developed under the auspices of the national institute of standards and technology and other federal agencies federal funding for the centers is matched by nonfederal sources including state and local governments and industry originally seven regional centers for the transfer of manufacturing technology were selected and are operational the great lakes manufacturing technology center at the cleveland advanced manufacturing program in ohio the northeast manufacturing technology center at rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy new york now called the new york manufacturing extension partnership the south carolina technology transfer cooperative based at the university of south carolina in columbia the midwest manufacturing technology center at the industrial technology institute in ann arbor michigan the midamerican manufacturing technology center at the kansas technology enterprise corporation of topeka the california manufacturing technology center at camino college in torrance and the upper midwest manufacturing technology center in minneapolis the original program expanded in 1994 creating the manufacturing extension partnership mep to meet new and growing needs of the community in more varied approach the partnership involves both large centers and smaller more dispersed organizations sometimes affiliated with larger centers also included is the nist st ate technology extension program which provides states with grants to develop the infrastructure necessary to transfer technology from the federal government to the private sector an effort which was also mandated by pl 100418 and program that electronically ties the disparate parties together along with other federal state local and academic technology transfer organizations there are now centers in all 50 states and puerto rico since the program was created in 1989 awards made by nist for extension activities resulting in the creation of approximately 400 regional offices it should be noted that the department of defense also funded 36 center s through its technology reinvestment project trp in fy1994 and fy1995 when the trp was terminated nist took over support for 20 of these programs in fy1996 and financed the remaining ones during fy1997 funding for this program was 119 million in fy1991 151 million in fy1992 and

97104 manufacturing extension partne rship program an overview by wendy h schacht g18g138g157g142g151g157g156g561 the patent system was created to promote innovat ion based on article i section 8 of the us constitution which states the congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries the patent system encourages innovation by simultaneously protecting the inventor and fostering competition originally it provided the inventor with lead time of 17 years from the date of issuance to develop his idea commercialize and thereby realize return on his initial investment today in response to the uruguay round agreements act the term of the patent has been changed to 20 years from date of filing the process of obtaining patent places the idea in the public domain as disclosure system the patent can and generally does stimulate other firms or inventors to invent around existing patents to provide parallel technical developments or meet similar market needs ownership of patents derived from research and development performed under federal funding affects the transfer of technology from federal laboratories to the private sector generally the government retains title to these inventions and can issue to companies either an exclusive license or more commonly nonexclusive license however it is argued that without title or at least an exclusive license to an invention and the protection it conveys company will not invest the additional time and money necessary for commercialization this contention is supported by the fact that although portion of ideas patented by the federal government have potential for further development application and marketing only about 10 of these are ever used in the private sector however there is universal agreement on this issue it also is asserted that title should remain in the public sector where it is accessible to all interested parties since federal funds were used to finance the work despite the disagreements the congress has accepted to some extent the proposition that vesting title to the contractor will encourage commercialization pl 96517 amendments to the patent

required to commercialize within predetermined and agreedon time for more information see crs report rl32076 the bayhdole act selected issues in patent policy and the commercialization of technology by wendy h schacht yet it continues to be argued that patent exclusivity is important for both large and small firms in february 1983 memorandum concerning the vesting of title to inventions made under federal funding president reagan ordered all agencies to treat as allowable by law all contractors regardless of size as prescribed in pl 96517 this however does not have legislative basis further changes in the patent laws made by the enactment of pl 98620 also affect the transfer of technology from federal laboratories to the private sector in provision that was designed to increase interaction and cooperation between governmentowned contractoroperated goco laboratories and private industry in the transfer of technology title v permits decisions to be made at the laboratory level as to the award of licenses for laboratory generated patents the contractor is also permitted by this legislation to receive patent royalties for use in additional research and development for awards to individual inventors on staff or for education cap exists on the amount of the royalty returning to the laboratory so as not to distort the agencys mission and congressionally mandated rd agenda however the creation of discretionary funds gives laboratory personnel added incentive to encourage and complete technology transfers pl 98620 also permits private companies regardless of size to obtain exclusive license for the full life of the government patent prior restrictions on large firms allowed exclusive license for only 5 of the then 17 years of the patent the w permits those government laboratories that are run by universities or nonprofit institutions to retain title to inventions made in their institution within certain defined limitations federal laboratories operated by large companies are not included in this provision the federal technology transfer act and th fy1990 dod authorization gives all companies not just small businesses universities and nonprofits the right to retain title to inventions resulting from research performed under cooperative rd agreements with government laboratories if this occurs the federal government retains royaltyfree license to use these patents in addition the federal technology act states that the government agencies may retain portion of royalty income rather than returning it to the treasury after payment of the prescribed amount to the inventor the agencies must transfer the balance of the total to their governmentoperated laboratories with the major portion distributed to the laboratory where the invention was made the laboratory may keep all royalties up to 5 of their annual budget plus 25 of funds in excess of the 5 limit the remaining 75 of th excess returns to the treasury funds retained by the laboratory are to be used for expenses incurred in the administration and licensing of inventions to reward laboratory personnel to provide for personnel exchanges between laboratories for education and training consistent with the laboratories and agencies missions or for additional transfer pl 106404 the technology transfer commercia lization act signed into law on november 1 2000 made alterations in current practices concerning patents held by the government to make it easier for federal agencies to license such inventions the law amends pl 98480 and pl 96 517 to decrease the time necessary to obtain an exclusive or partially exclusive license on federally owned patents previously agencies were required to publicize the availability of technologies for three months using the federal register and then provide an additional 60 day

technology this however is not the same as mandate to help the private sector in the development and commercialization of technology for the marketplace while the missions of the government laboratories are often broad direct assistance to industry is not included with the exception of the national institute of standards and technology the laboratories were created to perform the rd necessary to meet government needs which typically are not cons istent with the demands of the marketplace the missions of the federal laboratories are under review due in part to budget constraints and the changing world order national security is now being redefined to include economic wellbeing in addition to weapons superiority the laboratories which have contributed so much to the defense enterprise are being reevaluated these discussions provide an opportunity to debate whether the mandate of the federal rd establishment should include expanded responsibilities for assistance to the private sector whether or not the missions of the us government httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33527g22g142g140g145g151g152g149g152g144

are changed to include expanded assistance to industry there are various initiatives which may facilitate the technology transfer process under the laboratories current responsibilities these include making the work performed in government institutions more relevant to industry through augmented cooperative rd increased private sector involvement early in the rd efforts of the laboratories and expanded commercialization activities because significant portion of the laboratories are involved in defense research questions arise as to whether or not the technologies in these institutions can be transferred in such way as to be useful to commercial companies in addition the selection of one company over another to be involved in transfer or in cooperative rd agreement raises issues of fairness and equity of access as well as conflict of interest and while it is virtually impossible to prevent the flow of scientific and technical information abroad there is ongoing interest in the extent of foreign access to the federal laboratory establishment how these concerns are addressed may be fundamental to the success of us technology transfer over the past 25 years the congress has enacted various laws designed to facilitate cooperative rd between and among government industry nd academia these laws include but are not limited to tax credits for industrial payments to universities for the performance of rd changes in the antitrust laws as they pertain to cooperative research and joint manufacturing and improved technology transfer from federal laboratories to the private sector the intent behind these legislative initiatives is to encourage collaborative ventures and thereby reduce the risks and costs associated with rd as well as permit work to be undertaken that crosses traditional boundaries of expertise and experience leading to the development of new technologies and manufacturing processes for the marketplace since the 104 th congress the perspectives on joint rd technology transfer and cooperative research and development agreements appear mixed the results of legislative activity are open to discussion in the recent past both national political parties have supported measures to facilitate technological advancement there are indications that the congressional majority favors refocusing federal support for basic research as well as indirect measures to encourage technology development in the private sector cradas in particular are means to take this governmentfunded basic research from the federal laboratory system and move it to the industrial community for commercialization to meet both agency mission requirements and other national needs associated with the economic growth which comes from new products and processes it should also be recognized that the government is expressly prohibited from providing direct financial support to partners in the cooperative venture under crada thus it appears that this approach may meet the criteria expressed as acceptable to the congress while the advanced technology program faced much opposition in the house the program continued to be funded although at decreased levels until fy2008 when it was replaced by the technology innovation program recently the manufacturing extension partnership had its budget cut but these cuts were restored the following fiscal year with the support of the congress as the 110 th congress continues to make decisions concerning funding for rd the role of the federal government in technology transfer technology development and
