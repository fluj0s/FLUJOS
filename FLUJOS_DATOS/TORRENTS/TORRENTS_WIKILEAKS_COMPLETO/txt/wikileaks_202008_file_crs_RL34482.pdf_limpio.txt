research service 4 302a and 302b allocations the maximum budget authority for annual appropriations including dhs is determined through twostage congressional budget process in the first stage congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget subsequently these amounts are allocated among the appropriations committees usually through the statement of managers for the conference report on the budget resolution these amounts are known as the 302a allocations they include discretionary totals available to the house and senate committees on appropriations for enactment in annual appropriations bills through the subcommittees responsible for the development of the bills in the second stage of the process the appropriations committees allocate the 302a discretionary funds among their subco mmittees for each of the appropriations bills these amounts are known as the 302b allocations these allocations must add up to more than the 302a discretionary allocation and form the basis for enforcing budget discipline since any bill reported with total above the ceiling is subject to point of order 302b allocations may be adjusted during the year as the various appropriations bills progress towards final enactment the annual concurrent resolution on the budget sets forth the congressional budget there is as yet budget

becomes available for obligation in fy2009 budget authority obligations and outlays federal government spending involves multistep process that begins with the enactment of budget authority by congress federal agencies then obligate funds from the enacted budget authority to pay for their activities finally payments are made to liquidate those obligations the actual payment amounts are reflected in the budget as outlays budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts that are available for federal agencies to spend the antideficiency act 2 prohibits federal agencies from obligating more funds than the budget authority that was enacted by congress budget authority may be indefinite however when congress

appropriations congressional research service 5 may be available on oneyear multiyear or noyear basis oneyear budget authority is only available for obligation during specific fiscal year any unobligated funds at the end of that year are longer available for spending multiyear budget authority specifies range of time during which funds can be obligated for spending noyear budget authority is available for obligation for an indefinite period of time obligations are incurred when federal agencies employ personnel enter into contracts receive services and engage in similar transactions in given fiscal year outlays are the funds that are actually spent during the fiscal year 3 because multiyear and noyear budget authorities may be obligated over number of years outlays do not always match the budget authority enacted in given year additionally budget authority may be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in future fiscal year especially with certain contracts in sum budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorizes payments or outlays to be made from the treasury discretionary agencies and programs and appropriated entitlement programs are funded each year in appropriations acts discretionary and mandatory spending gross budget authority or the total funds available for spending by federal agency may be composed of discretionary and mandatory spending of the 464 billion gross budget authority requested for dhs in fy2009 82 is composed of discretionary spending and 18 is composed of mandatory spending discretionary spending is not mandated by existing law and is thus appropriated yearly by congress through appropriations acts the budget enforcement act of 1990 4 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriation acts and the outlays derived from that authority but it excludes appropriations for entitlements mandatory spending also known as direct spending consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriation acts and is typically not appropriated each year however some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year and are included in the appropriations acts within dhs the coast guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending offsetting collections5 offsetting funds are collected by the federal government either from government accounts or the public as part of businesstype transaction such as offsets to outlays or collection of fee these funds are not counted as revenue instead they are counted as negative outlays dhs net discretionary budget authority or the total funds that are appropriated by congress each year is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending 3 appropriations outlays and account balances for government treasury accounts can be viewed in the end of year reports published by the us treasury

individuals businesses or units of government that meet the requirements or qualifications established by law are entitled to receive certain payments if they establish eligibility the dhs budget

declining request for appropriations for some cargo security initiatives fencing infrastructure and technology the administration requested 775 million for the deployment of sbinet334 related technologies and infrastructures in fy2009 decrease of 450 million over the fy2008 enacted level of 1225 million this total included an emergency appropriation of 1053 million however this may be somewhat misleading because the fy2008 request for the account was 1000 million within the fy2009 request the administration is proposing to allocate 275 million for developing and deploying additional technology and infrastructure solutions to the southwest border an additional 410 million is requested for operations and maintenance of the cameras sensors and fencing that will have been constructed by the end of calendar year 2008 with prioryear funding3 35 the administration notes that this will fund the costs associated with operating and maintaining the technologies that have been deployed to the border as part of the sbinet program as well as 370 miles of fencing and 300 miles of vehicle barriers which are scheduled to be completed by the end of calendar year 2008 with funding appropriated in fy2007 and fy2008 recent gao testimony noted that cbps goal for fencing and vehicle barrier deployment in 2008 will be challenging because of factors that include difficulties acquiring rights to border land and an inability to estimate costs for installation3 36 gao also noted that the border patrol was not consulted early enough in the process of developing the technology solutions that would be used by sbinet and that this fact combined with some challenges relating to the integration of the technologies deployed by boeing led to an eight month delay in the initial pilot programs deployment in tucson sector3 37 oversight of the sbinet programs continuing deployment of technology fencing and infrastructure at the border including whether dhs is on track to meet its goals for fencing and vehicle barriers at the border will likely be an issue of concern to congress as it considers the fy2009 request the senate committee recommended fully funding the presidents request and noted that close oversight of the program was required due to its importance the house committee 34 sbinet is the technological and infrastructure component of the secure border initiative

to systems and structures that are expensive fail to perform as promised and do not result in more secure border3 38 the house committee noted that only 17 of f unding for fencing infrastructure and technology had been expended on the northern border and included 40 million in its fy2009 appropriation for this purpose the house committee also directed that 30 million be spent on border interoperability demonstration project to better integrate border security efforts between federal state local and tribal authorities and that 50 million be spent on regulatory and environmental assessments to mitigate the environmental damage associated with infrastructure construction lastly the house committee noted that it was disappointed with the fy2008 expenditure plan for this account and directs cbp to fully comply with its requirements for the fy2009 expenditure plan pl 110329 fully funded the presidents request but withheld 400 million from obligation until an expenditure plan

northern border in fy2009 this is the first time that dhs budget request has complied with the pl 108458 mandate requiring dhs to augment the northern border staffing by 20 of any annual increases each year between fy2006 and fy2010 an issue for congress may involve whether incentives should be offered to help dhs recruit additional agents or keep existing agents from leaving the agency in fy2007 the usbp experienced 10 attrition rate 41 the senate appropriations committee recommended fully f unding the presidents request additionally the senate committee reiterated its desire that 20 of the overall increase in border patrol agents be assigned to the northern border and required report on the challenges cbp faces in transferring agents to the northern border within 60 days of the bills enactment lastly the senate committee noted that the national guard was withdrawing its troops from their supporting role at the border in fy2008 and directed cbp in the strongest terms possible to hire the previously funded usbp support personnel in order to allow agents to focus on their border 38 house report pp 4243 39 hr 2638 as enrolled by the house and the senate pp 8384 40 dhs fy2008

including facility modifications and the build out of primary lanes as operationally necessary 44 issues for congress include whether dhss disregard of the extension enacted by pl 110161 was appropriate whether the proposed staffing increases and infrastructure modifications are adequate to meet the needs associated with the whti program and whether the program to develop enhanced state drivers licenses that may be used to cross the landborder adequately addresses security concerns 45 the senate committee fully funded the presidents request and directed cbp to provide quarterly

extending federal law enforcement officer status to cbp officers for retirement purposes in pl 110161 the fy2009 presidents request would have retracted the law enforcement officer status for cbp officers that was enacted in fy2008 during the fy2009 appropriations cycle the senate committee reiterated its strong support for cbp officers new retirement status and included 200 million to fully

gaps in cbps information about inbound cargo containers and their supply chains and directs cbp to report to the committee later than january 8 2009 on the information and intelligence cbp collects on

the budget materials what this reduction represented since one of the goals for the fiscal year was to expand the program to at least one additional port and to add more capacity at other designated

as which aliens should be detained additionally in recent years there has been debate concerning the extent to which state and local law enforcement should aid ice with the identification detention

security such as illegal arms exports financial crimes commercial fraud human trafficking narcotics smuggling child pornographyexploitation worksite enforcement and immigration fraud ice special

the ins and the united states customs service and transferred most of their investigative functions to ice effective march 1 2003 there are investigative advantages to combining the ins and customs services as those who violate immigration laws may be engaged in other criminal enterprises eg alien smuggling rings often launder money nonetheless concerns have been raised that not enough resources

removal operations dro in ice provide custody management of the aliens who are in removal proceedings or who have been ordered removed from the united states6 65 dro is also responsible for ensuring

general found that almost 94 of those detained with final orders of removal were deported whereas only 11 of those not detained who were issued final orders of removal left the country6 66 concerns have been raised that decisions regarding which aliens to release and when to release them may be based on the amount of detention space not on the merits of individual cases and that the amount of space may vary by area of the country leading to inequities and disparate policies in different geographic areas the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 5204 authorized

detainees the act also directed ice to immediately implement the government accountability offices recommendation to improve medical services state and local law enforcement 69 currently the ina provides limited avenues for state enforcement of both its civil and criminal provisions one of the broadest grants of authority for state and local immigration enforcement activity stems from ina 287g which authorizes the attorney general to enter into written agreement with state or any political subdivision to allow state and local law enforcement officers to perform the functions of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation apprehension or detention of aliens in the united states the enforcement of immigration by state and local officials has sparked debate among many who question what the proper role of state and local law enforcement officials should be in enforcing federal immigration laws many have expressed concern over proper training finite resources at the local level possible civil rights violations and the overall impact on communities nonetheless some observers contend that the federal government has scarce resources to enforce immigration law and that state and local law enforcement entities should be utilized housereported hr 6947 would have specified that funds may be used to continue 287g agreement if the dhs inspector general determined that the 287g agreement had been violated or to enter into an agreement with law enforcement other than at jail or prison of state or subdivision of the state unless the assistant secretary of ice reviewed all requests for 287g agreements in that state and prioritizes the agreements that will maximize the identification of criminal aliens convicted of dangerous crimes in addition the presidents

detection equipment purchase and installation proposed discretionary funding for the purchase and installation of explosive detection systems eds and explosive trace detection etd equipment would be reduced by 140 million compared to fy2008 levels however this reduction would be more than offset by the proposed increase to the ascf proposed increase of 47 million for screening technology maintenance and utilities reflects increasing costs of checked baggage and checkpoint screening equipment maintenance as these systems age and approach their useful service life also funding increase of 32 million is proposed for the secure flight program the checkpoint screening security funda onetime mandatory funding vehicle that provided 250 million in fy2008 for checkpoint screening

security officers tsos and other aviation security job functions these additional slots would mainly be filled by more behavioral detection officers bdos 330 additional ftes and additional screeners to conduct random screening of airport workers the presidents fy2009 request includes proposal to realign several tsa programs most notably the request proposes to place the federal air marshal service fams under the aviation security account rather than maintaining it as separate entity the budget also seeks to realign several regulatory functions including air cargo security under the aviation regulation program and several law enforcement programs including airport law enforcement support canine teams visible intermodal protective response vipr teams and federal flight deck officers ffdos under the law enforcement program the proposal also seeks to establish single human resource services within the aviation security account to support both field and headquarters staff also the request proposes that information technology and support for aviation security be realigned with the information technology function housed within the transportation security support account housereported hr 6947 the house committee recommended 6 964 million for the tsa 138 million less than the presidents request but 77 million more than the senatereported bill like the senatereported bill the housereported bill has not adopted many of the realignment proposals offered in the presidents request specifically the committee rejected the idea of consolidating air cargo with other aviation regulation activities and it rejected the concept of placing fams under the aviation security program area however like the senatereported bill hr 6947 concurred with the administration proposals to consolidate human resources and information technology activities throughout the tsa thus while funding levels for budget activities contained in hr 6947 are directly httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34482homeland security department fy2009 appropriations congressional research service 45 comparable to the senatereported amounts these amounts are not directly comparable to the presidents request for affected budget activities housereported hr 6947 requested 250 million for checkpoint support the same amount provided under the checkpoint security screening fund in fy2008 and 122 million above the presidents request for fy2009 the committee believed that this additional funding was necessary to expedite testing and deployment of checkpoint explosives screening technologies the house report expressed concern that only half of large airports have optimized their baggage screening systems to date and recommended 294 million for edsetd purchase and installation in line with the senatereported amount the committee also recommended 110 million for air cargo security 39 million above the fy2008 appropriated level but 13 million below the senatereported amount the house committee recommended 109 million for threat assessment and credentialing functions 24 million below the requested level the committee recommended 75 million of this for the secure flight program 7 million below the request citing schedule slips in the regulatory process and gao reviews of the program with regard to surface transportation security the housereported measure specified 50 million 13 million above the presidents request and 14 million below the senate reported amount the additional funding specified in the house report was intended for the deployment of additional security inspectors senatereported s 3181 the senatereported bill would have set total funding for the tsa at 6887 million 215 million less than the presidents request the reported bill supported only some of the administrationproposed functional realignments therefore funding for several of the budget activities in table 11 cannot be directly compared specifically the committee agreed with the administration plan to consolidate human resources and information technology programs throughout the tsa however the committee did not go along with the administration proposals to consolidate law enforcement activities under the aviation security program area to place the fams under aviation security and to consolidate regulatory enforcement functions including air cargo security activities the committee recommended 2692 million for passenger and baggage screening personnel compensation and benefits pcb 24 million below the requested levels based on fy2008 payroll underburn reported to the committee the committee also recommended recision of 73 million of fy2008 funds set aside for pilot programs to screen airport employees that were determined to be in excess of the amount needed to carry out these pilots the committee recommended 200 million for checkpoint support 72 million above the presidents request but 50 million less than the amount provided in fy2008 under the checkpoint security screening fund the committee noted that the administrations proposed passenger security fee increase has not been acted on by congressional authorizing committees and therefore reported mandatory funding for the aviation security capital fund at the currently authorized level of 250 million the co mmittee instead proposed funding level of 294 million for edsetd purchase and installation 140 million above the presidents request httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34482homeland security department fy2009 appropriations congressional research service 46 the committee recommended 123 million for air cargo security 18 million above the amount proposed in the presidents request within the aviation regulation and law enforcement program area under the proposed restructuring scheme the committee also sought to expand the tsa air cargo screening technology pilots to address the mandate for 100 screening of cargo placed on passenger aircraft and called for the tsa to issue an expenditure plan detailing efforts to develop covert testing protocols augment cargo strike teams and provide details of deployed canine teams and screening technologies in addition to increased air cargo security funding to meet the 100 screening mandate of the implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 pl 11053 the committee recommendation included 20 million across various budget activities to implement regulations and fulfill other mandates of the 911 act the committee also recommended 4 million for airport perimeter security pilot projects which was not included in the presidents request but is equal to fy2008 funding for this activity the committee proposed 799 million for fams 13 million above the presidents request and recommends keeping fams separate from aviation security rather than placing it under the aviation security program area as requested with regard to surface transportation security the bill sought 64 million 27 million more than the presidents request and seeks additional inspectors and operations staff pl 110329 the act provided total of 6978 to the tsa 91 million above the senatereported level and 14 million above the housereported level but 124 million less than the presidents request funding for aviation security totaled 4735 million roughly matching the housereported levels as recommended in the house and senate

fy2009 contained in the dhs joint explanatory statement as submitted in the congressional record and in the house and senate enrolled version of hr 2638 c the presidents fy2009 request contains proposal to place fams under the aviation security account rather than maintaining it as separate entity d not centralized by senate however srept 110396 indicates that an additional 20 million above the presidents request was spread across various budget activities for this purpose tsa issues for congress issues considered during in the fy2009 appropriations process included the passenger security fee surcharge proposal the adequacy of checkpoint technology investment and the appropriateness of proposed program realignments included in the presidents request passenger security fee surcharge the administration requested fouryear temporary passenger surcharge beginning in fy2009 of 050 per flight not to exceed 100 per oneway trip in addition to the current passenger security fees of 250 per flight with cap of 500 per oneway trip under the proposal these additional fees would be deposited in the aviation security capital fund ascf the surcharge is intended to offset the 426 million in new budget authority for the aviation security capital fund that the administration is seeking these funds would be used to finance the acquisition and installation of checked baggage explosives detection equipment the administration regards this new budget authority it is seeking as being subject to paygo rules and it has recommended the collection of the passenger security fee surcharge as an offsetting collection if the increased budget authority for the ascf is subject to paygo rules as the administration maintains then questions regarding the need for and possibly the adequacy of the proposed 050 surcharge may be raised during congressional appropriations debate the administration projects an increase of 216 million in offsetting security fee collections in fy2009 compared to fy2008 and it is requesting additional budget authority totaling 426 million for the ascf current authorization for the ascf consists of mandatory appropriation of 250 million derived solely from passenger security fee collections in addition the implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 pl 11053 authorizes an additional 450 million annually through fy2011 for these same purposes but as discretionary appropriation and not through the ascf congress may debate whether the direct appropriation is preferable alternative to supplementing the ascf as the administration proposes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34482homeland security department fy2009 appropriations congressional research service 50 congress may also debate whether the 050 surcharge is adequate to offset the proposed ascf funding increase particularly if economic conditions were to worsen and lead to slowdown in passenger volume and lowerthanexpected security fee revenue authorizing committees in the house and the senate have not considered legislation to raise the passenger security fees as proposed in the presidents request therefore in both the senatereported and the housereported legislation it was assumed that the ascf will be funded in fy2009 at the mandatory level currently authorized in law of 250 million both the senatereported and housereported measures therefore proposed increased discretionary appropriations levels for edsetd purchase and installation pl 110329 provided total of 544 million for baggage screening explosives detection system purchase installation and integration including 294 million for edsetd purchase and installation in addition to the 250 million mandatory ascf funding matching the amount specified in both the house and senate bills checkpoint technology investment and deployment at the presidents requested funding level the tsa anticipates deploying advanced technology t xray systems at 60 of checkpoints at category x and category i airports wholebody imaging wbi systems at 15 of checkpoints at such airports bottle liquids scanners at 65 of checkpoints at such airports and cast and prosthesis screening systems at 25 of checkpoints at such airports additionally the tsa intends to fund the deployment of additional video cameras and electronic surveillance monitoring systems at checkpoints and devote 135 million to mitigating various safety hazards at passenger and baggage screening areas congress considered whether the 128 million requested for checkpoint support will be adequate to address advanced screening technology initiatives throughout the aviation system along with these other competing efforts this may be an area of particular interest given that in fy2008 congress provided 250 million for advanced checkpoint technologies through the creation of the checkpoint screening security fund as many of these advanced checkpoint screening technologies are now moving beyond the pilot testing phase to fullscale operational deployment congress may seek to more closely examine and reevaluate the tsa s existing checkpoint screening technology plan in light of what is now known about the capabilities and limitations of these various technologies as well as the current risk environment congress may debate whether the deployment strategy should be modified to either accelerate or perhaps even scale back the fielding of various advanced checkpoint screening technologies the housereported measure specifies 250 million for checkpoint support which would maintain this activity at the level provided for under the oneyear authorization of the checkpoint screening security fund in fy2008 the senate report specified 200 million for checkpoint support 50 million below the amount specified in the house report but 72 million above the requested level pl 110329 provided 250 million for checkpoint support matching the fy2008 funding level of the checkpoint screening security fund and the amount reported in the house the act emphasized the use of these funds to acquire mulitple whole body imaging wbi technologies including xray backscatter and millimeter wave systems as directed in the senate report httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34482homeland security department fy2009 appropriations congressional research service 51 program consolidation proposals congress also considered the realignment of functions as proposed in the presidents budget request most notably placing air cargo securitywhich has been priority issue for legislation and appropriations over the past five yearwithin the aviation regulation function may be of particular concern critics may argue that air cargo security should remain separate function because of its unique characteristics and in recognition of statutory requirements to screen 50 of all cargo placed on passenger aircraft by february 2009 and 100 of such cargo by august of 2010 see pl 11053 sec 1602 while the tsa s budget justification contended that aligning air cargo security under aviation regulation would emphasize the regulatory aspects of the program and provide greater flexibility in assigning regulatory inspectors to air cargo details these air cargo screening mandates arguably suggest broader scope to the overall air cargo program the tsa has maintained that its roles and responsibilities in meeting these statutory requirements will largely be met through promulgating regulations and conducting steppedup regulatory oversight to ensure air carrier freight forwarder and shipper compliance with screening requirements and other security regulations however some in congress view the tsas role as being much larger including testing and evaluating screening technologies the acquisition and deployment of such equipment and the training and deployment of canine teams to assist in cargo screening operations the tsa has indicated that it intends to significantly expand canine team involvement in air cargo screening making these teams available for air cargo screening 425 of the time by fy2009 compared to the current availability level of 25 since formal plan for meeting statutory cargo screening requirements has not yet been presented by the tsa viewing the tsa role in air cargo security and screening as regulatory function may arguably be taking an overly narrow perspective see crs report rl34390 aviation security background and policy options for screening and securing air cargo by bart elias other proposed realignment options may not be as seemingly controversial but may nonetheless raise questions during congressional debate the proposed alignment of the federal air marshal service fams into the aviation security function may allow better integration of fams operations with screening operations and may provide more streamlined career advancement opportunities for screeners to enter fams as the tsa budget justification argues however some may question why fams the largest law enforcement unit within the tsa is not instead aligned with the law enforcement program which could potentially provide better integration with other law enforcement functions including airport law enforcement presence and the ffdo program as noted above neither the senatereported nor the housereported legislation supported the integration of fams into the aviation security the measures also did not support the realignment of air cargo security operations opting instead to keep air cargo security as separate program the committees also did not endorse the administration proposals to realign other law enforcement and regulatory functions the committees did however agree to realign human resources and information technology functions across the tsa realignment of these two functional areas was reflected in the fy2009 appropriations act pl 110329 but the act did not restructure or realign any other tsa functional areas as proposed in the presidents request httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34482homeland security department fy2009 appropriations congressional research service 52 secure flight the presidents request proposed funding increase of 32 million for the secure flight program in order to achieve initial operational deployment in the second quarter of fy2009 with goal of fully implementing secure flight in early fy2010 this long delayed and highly controversial initiative to develop system for government prescreening of airline passengers against terrorist watchlists remains an issue prior appropriations acts including the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110 161 have imposed restrictions on deploying secure flight or any other followon prescreening system until the dhs certifies and the gao reports to congress that specific issues regarding privacy protection data security and integrity and redress procedures have been adequately addressed the administration has long maintained that this requirement for gao review and certification of the secure flight system constitutes legislative veto of administration decisions and actions and therefore in the administrations view violates the constitutional framework of separation of powers nonetheless both the senatereported and housereported legislation would keep in place these requirements as well as general prohibition against the use of commercial information to assess the risk of passengers whose names do not appear on government terrorist watchlists pl 110329 also included language see sec 512 prohibiting operational deployment of secure flight in other than test basis until the dhs certifies and the gao reports that statutory conditions described in section 522 of pl 108334 pertaining to privacy data security data retention and redress procedures for passengers have been satisfactorily met the act further specified that during secure flight testing the tsa may not delay or deny boarding to passengers on the basis of any systemprovided information other than the results of matching names against government watch list the act also prohibited the tsa from expending any appropriations including prior year appropriations to develop or test algorithms assigning risk to passengers whose names are not on government watch lists and prohibited the tsa from utilizing information from nonfederal databases in the secure flight system except for passenger name record pnr data provided by the airlines united states coast guard79 the coast guard is the lead federal agency for the maritime component of homeland security

for congress increased duties in the maritime realm related to homeland security have added to the coast guards obligations and increased the complexity of the issues it faces members of congress have expressed concern with how the agency is operationally responding to these demands including coast guard plans to replace many of its aging vessels and aircraft 81 deepwater the deepwater program is 24 billion 25year acquisition program to replace or modernize 91 cutters 124 small surface craft and 244 aircraft the coast guards management and execution of the program has been strongly criticized and several hearings were held on the program in 2007 the gao and dhs ig have been very active in reviewing deepwater and in 2007 the coast guard decided to phase out an outside system integrator team led by lockheed martin and northrup grumman to execute the program for fy2009 the president requested 990 million for the program to be made available through the end of fy2013 which includes 541 million for vessels and 231 million for aircraft the fy2009 request includes 9 million to add 65 new positions for the new acquisition directorate that will be responsible for major acquisition projects most notably the deepwater program for fy2008 pl 110161 congress appropriated 651 million for deepwater which included rescissions for unmanned aerial vehicles and offshore patrol cutters and was 137 million less than the president requested last fiscal year congress called for detailed program expenditure plan from the coast guard and requested that the gao review the plan senatereported s 3181 largely concurs with the presidents budget request for deepwater except that the senate committee recommended 24 million for the missionization of three c130j aircraft while the presidents request did not include these funds the house report denied the presidents request of 3 million for unmanned aerial vehicles ua vs under the deepwater program and instead funded these under the coast guards research test and evaluation account the house committee also reduced the presidents request for national security cutters by 54 million because it believes the construction of the fourth cutter will be delayed and because gao review raises concerns about the transparency of the contractors cost and performance schedules pl 110329 provided 1034 million for deepwater and designates 245 million for aircraft and 571 million for surface ships the act withheld 350 million of this amount until the appropriations committees receives and approves an expenditure plan the act provided 13 million for missionization of three c130j aircraft 3 million for ua vs and 354 million for national security cutters as the president requested the president requested and the senatereported bill

agency gives notice to the appropriations committees issues for congress include the coast guards management of the program which is the largest and most complex acquisition effort in coast guard history the overall cost of the program and the programs timeline for acquisition these issues are discussed in crs report rl33753 coast guard deepwater acquisition programs background oversight issues and options for congress by ronald orourke responseboat medium the president requested and housereported hr 6947 concurred to provide 64 million to order fourteen 45foot response boats to

dhs explanatory statement concurred with the senate committees recommendation providing total of 108 million to purchase total of 36 boats 82 security mission some members of congress have expressed strong concerns that the coast guard does not have enough resources to carry out its homeland security mission gao audit raised this concern with respect to the security of energy tankers83 and at senate hearing the gao testified that coast guard resources were being challenged by number of security requirements 84 about 28 of the coast guards fy2009 budget request was for its port waterways and coastal security pwcs mission85 for monitoring harbor traffic the presidents fy2009 request included 26 million to continue deployment of nationwide system to detect identify track and communicate with ships in us harbors called the automatic identification system ais this system is currently able to track ships but not to communicate with them in 55 ports and nine coastal waterways 86 tracking receivers are installed on land as well as on sea buoys aircraft and satellites the fy2009 funding request is for extending tracking capab ility out to 50 nautical miles from shore and being able to

from prior years and that it is unlikely that the coast guard will achieve its acquisition schedule in fy2009 based on recent history the final bill agreed with the senate report the senate report requested quarterly briefings by the coast guard on the status and development of interagency operations centers iocs iocs are fusion centers to be located in each coast guard sector that are intended to facilitate intelligence sharing and coordinated responses among federal and state or local law enforcement to harbor securityrelated incidents ais is key technology for the functioning of the iocs the senate report srept 110396 stated that the presidents budget requests 15 million reduction in coast guard port presence and coastal security 88 the committee report recommended that this reduction be denied and instead used to add 170 billets for marine inspectors armed boat crew escorts security boardings and dangerous cargo terminal inspections an unresolved issue is the usefulness of tracking smaller vessels such as recreational boats to counter the threat posed by suicide bombers or smugglers there are too many smaller boats for the coast guard to track and recreational boaters oppose tracking because of cost and privacy concerns based on recent dhs strategy report it appears the coast guard has immediate plans to require smaller vessels be outfitted with ais transponders but will continue to pursue methods to identify small craft 89 nonhomeland security missions some members of congress have expressed concern that with the coast guards emphasis on its maritime security mission the agency may have difficulty sustaining its traditional nonhomeland security missions such as fisheries enforcement or marine environmental protection 90 in the wake of an oil spill

address in fy2009 congress appropriated 1 million for nsse costs within the secret service11 117 this appropriation is used to fund the secret services development and implementation of security

total of 100 million for the 2008 presidential nominating conventions security through the department of justices doj office of justice programs the doj appropriation was used for security and related costs incurred by state and local governments including overtime associated with these two nsses11 118 one issue that congress may address concerns whether this amount is sufficient to cover multiple or unexpected nsse costs although the secret service has never requested supplemental funding to support nsse operations in addition to the nsse funding through the secret service and doj state and local jurisdictions can use dhs grants such as the state homeland security grant program shsgp and the urban area security initiative uasi for nsserelated security activities however the grant approval process for these programs is not flexible so the programs have limited application to nsses in that states and localities would need to include shsgp and uasi funding for nsse security in their grant applications for unexpected nsses states and localities are unable to plan ahead and therefore cannot use shsgp or uasi funds to cover these unexpected security costs dhs does authorize states and localities to reprogram shsgp and uasi funding with the dhs secretarys approval however that may result in states and localities not funding other planned homeland security 117 pl 110329

budget request of 5573 million for fy2009 was 4153 million below the fy2008 level most of this difference is in the disaster relief fund account which during fy2008 received two emergency supplemental appropriations of 2900 million and 2400 million respectively the other substantial reductions were in the office of grant programs which would have received cut of 1598 million under the request there were also program areas within femas request that were below the fy2008 level for programs such as the flood map modernization fund and the emergency food and shelter program efsp fema s fy2009 budget request contained an increase of 233 million to the management and administration account parts of this increase were dedicated to series of improvements in information technology and logistical

dramatically in the late summer of 2008 during the quiescent period earlier in the year congress looked to fema for an assessment of priority areas matched with suggested resource levels that would improve femas preparedness for response to and recovery from major disaster events most prominent among the issues that have drawn the interest of congress is the quality and safety of femas temporary housing that has been provided to disaster victims 122 with regard to more effective immediate response to major disaster congress has sought to improve fema s logistics chain that supports that response an overarching theme of all these issues is the quality and depth of the fema work force and whether it is commensurate in size and skill with its missions additionally for fy2009 congress expressed support for two programs slated for cuts in the request emergency food and shelter and flood map modernization congress instead recommended increased funding levels far over the administration request disaster relief fund there were areas of agreement between the house and senate measures and the administration request the disaster relief fund drf funds disaster response recovery and mitigation work following presidentially declared disasters the house and senate concurred with the 1900 million amount requested by the administration while this represented reduction of 2400 million from last years level it also reflected an unobligated balance in the drf as well as an earlier supplemental bill which contained 897 million for the drf account 123 122 for more

readiness and support account in the fema budget the senate agreed to fund up to 250 million out of the drf for those purposes without establishing new account the house also declined to create separate account but directed that this spending remain within the disaster relief fund account since it supports future disaster activity there were two transfers recommended from the drf by both the house and senate first the house and senate recommended transfer of 106 million to fema s management and administration account second the committees also recommended the transfer of drf funds to the office of inspector general for audits and investigations related to disasters the house bill would have transferred 15 million while the senate bill set the amount to be transferred at 16 million pl 110329 provided 1400 million approximately 1278 after accounting for transfers from the fund as noted in table 14 for drf in fy2009 this amount for the drfwas reduction from the administration request and the house and senate recommendations however division b of pl 110329 the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 contained an additional 7960 million for the drf in fy2008 emergency supplemental funding taken together these amounts were intended to assure adequate funding for the busy disaster season of 2008 that included the midwest floods and hurricanes gustav and ike the fy2009 appropriation transferred 106 million from the fund to fema s management and administration account in addition 16 million will be transferred from the drf to the

the house chose to increase the program to 200 million double the requested level as statement by the chairman of the homeland security appropriations subcommittee explained additional resources for this program are especially critical now as more and more people turn to food banks and other community support organizations to meet their basic needs this is the largest single appropriation for

increase in the administrations fema budget request for fy2009 is in the expansion of the work force fema requested an increase of 184 million to support an additional 118 new permanent positions for the agency and to transition 149 temporary positions known as core appointments into permanent slots the core positions have traditionally been used by fema to accomplish ongoing disaster tasks at the regional and headquarters levels such as closing out old disasters or working in the telephone and online registration centers core personnel appointments can serve for maximum of up to four years and receive benefits similar to career employee eg health benefits the core positions status stands in contrast to the disaster assistance employees daes the daes are the temporary employees usually working on renewable 30 to 90 day appointments without benefits who are recruited trained and hired in large numbers to provide the staff support across disaster daes are often aligned into cadres of expertise for example there is public assistance pa cadre that employs engineers and other program experts to help manage the pa program in the field similarly there are daes trained to work in individual assistance mitigation congressional affairs community relations and other functional areas during disaster response and recovery operation the daes work on an as needed basis often with interruptions in service based on the level of disaster activity cores are also separate and distinct from private contractor employees and consultants who may also work in supporting role within different fema program areas since core appointments have been multiyear rather than measured in months the core employees have acquired organizational experience and programmatic skills that the agency wants to retain the retention of quality employees has been recurring challenge for fema since the lack of continuity is disruptive to fema s state and local partners in the consistent interpretation of program policy and overall customer service fema described the additional employees requested in the fy2009 budget as enhancements in several areas of the agency and mentions the

to see greater specificity on how these new positions will be apportioned throughout the agency and whether those choices correspond to congressional direction and interest the funding for more permanent staff reflects an attempt to address some general concerns that both chambers have raised the house appropriations committee recommended that 906 million be transferred from the drf account to support the conversion of temporary disaster employees to full time permanent positions while supporting the effort to supplement the permanent work force the house committee noted that the funds will not be available until the agency submits an implementation plan the committee also noted that the transfer is not at the full level requested by dhsfema because previous funding provided for this effort has been reprogrammed by fema 126 the senate appropriations committee recommended that 435 million be transferred for position conversion the senate committee wanted fema to improve customer service and is concerned about employee turnover stating that the agency is overly reliant on temporary employees for projects related to public assistance according to the senate report this reliance has created lack of consistent decision making and has compromised the accuracy of information provided to state and local governments to address these concerns the senate proposed an increase in the number of permanent personnel devoted to public assistance in particular pl 110329 transferred 106 million from the disaster relief fund to the management and administration account while the legislative language did not specify what purpose this funding would be used for this increased the account up to 943 million well above the house and senate levels and only 14 million below

appropriations congressional research service 72 2009 the full national disaster housing strategy is expected to be delivered to congress before the end of 2009 the administrations budget request for fy2009 noted that it would improve and expand the agency work force devoted to disaster assistance in general both the programs addressing eligible assistance to households and those dedicated to infrastructure repair but did not specifically address temporary housing nor the related health and safety issues the absence of information in the budget request may have reflected statements by the fema administrator indicating desire for an increased role for the department of housing and urban development in disaster housing 132 as evidence of this direction fema entered into another agreement with hud to provide housing assistance to the victims of hurricane ike133 the ongoing housing problems following hurricane katrina prompted house comments that directly addressed an ongoing area of contention regarding the rebuilding of public housing in the wake of the 2005 hurricanes recent house hearings have concentrated on the perceived conflicting views of responsibility between hud and fema regarding the repairs for public housing 134 in response to these concerns the house committee provided an additional 50000 to the office of the federal coordinator for gulf coast rebuilding to convene panel of experts to develop solutions for restoring the affordable rental housing stock of communities affected the 2005 hurricanes135 in related issue regarding mitigation the house committee noted it was encouraged by the progress being made to implement the hazard mitigation grant program hmgp funding has moved slowly but it now appears that hmgp funds will supplement mitigation measures for recipients of the road home program in louisiana 136 while noting the administrative progress the house report observed that the program deadline for applications was september 1 2008 based on all of these considerations the house report urged fema to consider extending that deadline pl 110329 included two provisions directed at gulf coast rebuilding section 546 of the law called on fema to

section 548 of the law called on fema to reimburse jones county and harrison county in the state of mississippi for unreimbursed debris removal 138 costs relating to debris as result of hurricane katrina in 2005 administrative financial and budgeting challenges an area of concern voiced by the senate appropriations committee is femas process of handling state and local grant programs according to the committee grant award distribution is flawed because there is lack of effective implementation accordingly the senate recommendation included provision to withhold 10 million from fema management and administration until the secretary in coordination with the administrator of fema certified and reported to the senate appropriations committee that the processes to incorporate stakeholder input for grant guidance development and award distribution have improved transparency and increased information about security needs on all hazards the house also voiced this concern albeit without the stipulations set forth by the senate see office of grants programs section in this report other areas of concern were also noted first the house appropriations committee cited recent gao report 139 which stated that fema needs to develop policies and procedures to ensure states and localities are involved collaboratively in all future updates to the national response framework nrf second both chambers directed fema to submit its fy2010 budget request including justification materials by office in 2008 fema was directed to submit its 2009 budget in this fashion but failed to do so the house committee used their report as an opportunity to express their displeasure with fema on this matter third the senate committee agreed with the office of inspector general that fema has financial weaknesses as result of the agencys financial reporting and accounting practices while the committee acknowledged the challenges of operating an agency which has been reorganized and supports multifaceted operations the members insisted that fema take steps to correct these areas of weakness pl 110329 reflected the above concerns and required that agency officials report to the committees on appropriations of the senate and the house on how fema processes incorporate input from stakeholders for grant guidance development and award distribution fema was required to demonstrate that the process will be sufficiently strengthened to ensure greater transparency and to include an increased capacity to provide information and consultation about security needs for allhazards finally the process fema employs to meet these objectives must be formalized and made clear to stakeholders urban search and rescue both committees disagreed with the presidents request to

the first issue is the reduction in state and local assistance funding the second issue is the allocation method dhs uses to determine state and locality grant awards and the third issue is the reduction in appropriations for the assistance to firefighters program reduction in total state and local assistance funding the issue that appears to continue to dominate dhss assistance programs for states and localities is the overall reduction in funding congress reduced funding to the state homeland security grant program by 60 million the trucking industry security program by 8 million the commercial equipment direct assistance grants by 17 million and did not fund the real id program conversely congress did increase httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34482homeland security department fy2009

development of grant guidance and the determination of awards 145 reduction in funding for the assistance to firefighters program 146 in previous years the administrations budget proposals have typically recommended significant cuts for fire grants used to fund training and equipment as well as zero funding for staffing for adequate fire and emergency response safer grants used for hiring recruitment and retention opponents of the cuts have argued that the reduced levels are inadequate to meet the needs of fire departments while the administration has argued that reduced levels are sufficient to enhance critical capabilities in the event of terrorist attack or major disaster for fy2009 the administration proposed 300 million for fire grants 46 cut from the fy2008 level funding was proposed for safer grants and the total request for assistance to firefighters grants afg was 60 below the fy2008 level for fire and safer grants combined the fy2009 budget proposal eliminated

not justify full funding 165 senatereported s 3181 the senate committee recommended 180 million for usvisit 210 million less than the presidents request the senate committee noted that it did not receive usvisits fy2008 expenditure plan until june 12 2008 or almost 34 of the way through the fiscal year and that 125 million in fy2008 funding will remain unavailable for obligation until this plan is reviewed by gao and accepted by the committeesomething that will likely not occur until september as result of the delay in submitting the plan the senate committee noted that dhs was effectively turning usvisit into forward funded account as such the senate committee reduced the fy2009 appropriation by 210 million from the fy2009 request to 180 million however the senate co

visit plans to deploy 3000 new 10 fingerprint scanners to the 292 poe where the usvisit system is currently operational issues for congress could include wether the current information technology infrastructure at poes can support the enhanced bandwidth that 10 fingerprint system will require whether the 10 fingerprint technology that gets implemented can produce fast and effective results and what kind of an impact the deployment of the system to airports will have on the travel times for individuals entering the country as well as the potential economic impacts that delays may have on airlines due to missed connections the senate committee noted its approval of the plans to transition to 10 fingerprint entry system and included full funding for that portion of the request the house committee also recommended fully funding the presidents request for this component of the usvisit system and directed dhs to provide quarterly briefings on the implementation of the 10 fingerprint entry solution exit component at air and sea ports deployment of biometric exit system has been of concern to congress for number of years without verifying the identity of travelers who leave the united states dhs has easy way of identifying individuals who overstay their visas and remain in the country illegally after being heavily criticized during fy2008 for appearing to move away from the deployment of an exit system usvisit is requesting 56 million for the exit component of the system in fy2009 according the dhs usvisit will finalize biometric exit strategy and complete implementation of biometric air and sea exit system by the end of calendar year 2008 167 the exact nature of this strategy will likely be an issue that congress will closely examine given the intense congressional interest on this topic in the past the house committee noted that the exit component remains behind schedule and expressed its concern that pilot tests have been carried out or are planned for the proposed assignment of biometric collection responsibilities to private industry 168 in order to address this concern the house committee withheld from its recommendation funding for the implementation of an exit solution at airports until us visit conducts pilot programs testing private industry collection and transmission of biometric data and cbp collection of this data at airline

of fy2007181 from may through july of 2007 uscis received three and half times more applications than during the same three months in the previous year182 consequently published accounts indicate that

184 according to media reports in february uscis officials believed that the backlog created by the application surge could take close to three years to clear185 as of april 2008 uscis believed it would take 1315 months to process an application for naturalization186 although citizenship campaigns and contentious national immigration debate have been cited as contributing factors many observers believe most of the surge in applications may be attributed to the uscis fee increase of july 30 2007 187 these fee adjustments followed an internal cost review and they increased application fees by

critics of this decision believe it could expose the united states to more security threats194 the uscis ombudsman however has argued that uscis employment of the fbi name check process is of limited value to public safety or national security because in most cases the applicants are living and working in the united states without restriction195 according to the uscis ombudsmans 2008 annual report

research service 113 appendix c dhs appropriations in context federalwide homeland security funding since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 there has been an increasing interest in the levels of funding available for homeland security efforts the office of management and budget as originally directed by the fy1998 national defense authorization act has published an annual report to congress on combating terrorism beginning with the june 24 2002 edition of this report homeland security was included as part of the analysis in subsequent years this homeland security funding analysis has become more refined as distinctions and account lines between homeland and nonhomeland security activities have become more precise this means that while table c1 is presented in such way as to allow year to year comparisons they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis as outlined above with regard to dhs funding it is important to note that dhs funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security efforts in fact while the largest component of federal spending on homeland security is contained within dhs the dhs homeland security request for fy2009 accounts for approximately 495 of total federal funding for homeland security the department of defense comprises the next highest proportion at 266 of all federal spending on homeland security the department of health and human services at 67 the department of justice at 57 and the department of state at 37 round out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security these five agencies collectively account for nearly 922 of all federal spending on homeland security it is also important to note that not all dhs funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities the legacy agencies that became part of dhs also conduct activities that are not homeland security related therefore while the fy2009 request included total homeland security budget authority of 328 billion for dhs the requested total gross budget authority was 468 billion the same is true of the other agencies listed in the table httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34482
