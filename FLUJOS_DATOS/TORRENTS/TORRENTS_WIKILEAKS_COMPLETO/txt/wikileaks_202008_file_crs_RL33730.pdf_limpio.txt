reclamation reclamation and the four major federal land management agenciesthe national park service nps fish and wildlife service fws an d bureau of land management blm in the department of the interior doi and the forest service fs in the department of agriculture usda the federal lands recr eation enhancement act rea1 authorizes the agencies to charge and collect fees at federal recreational lands and waters the act authorizes different kinds of fees outlines criteria for establishing fees and prohibits charging fees for certain activities or services the agencies can spend the revenue collected without further appropriation with most of the money retained at the collection site and the collections can be used for specified purposes the act also authorizes an interagency pass that can be used at federal recreation sites throughout the nation as well as regional multientity passes the program is to terminate 10 years after enactmenton december 8 2014 currently doi and usda agencies are in transition to the new fee authority and congress is overseeing implementation activities this new recreation fee program supersedes an earlier one the recreational fee demonstration program fee demo which began in 1996 as threeyear trial but was extended several times that program had allowed the four land management agencies but not reclamation to test the feasibility of charging fees to generate revenues for improvements at recreation sites while the number of fee sites was limited initially the agencies ultimately were allowed to establish any number of fee sites set fee levels and retain and spend the revenue collected without further appropriation at least 80 of the revenue had to be retained and used at the site where it was generated and agencies had wide latitude to spend the funds on purposes specified in law the extent to which fees should be charged for recreation has been controversial for decades and the fee demo program had both supporters and cr itics it was supported by the administration and others in part for generating revenue providing flexibility in setting fees and using revenues having the direct beneficiaries of recreation pay more for benefits deterring criminal activity such as littering and vandalism and ameliorating damage where it did occur however the fee demo program was criticized as doubly taxing the recreating public resulting in unfair and confusing fees in some areas promoting commercial development that damaged federal lands and discriminating against lowerincome people rural residents and lowimpact recreation still other criticisms pertained to program implementation including the high cost of fee collection and lack of consistency in implementation within and across agencies recent congresses considered whether to let the fee demo program expire extend it or make it permanent and how to structure any extended or permanent program central to the debate was which agencies or types of lands to include in fee program and how to determine fee amounts collect fees and spend collections in enacting the rea congress created 10year program and extended it to reclamation congress sought to eliminate some of the concerns with fee demo in part by simplifying and standardizing the types of fees authorizing an interagency recreation pass and providing for public input in establishing fee locations and amounts 1 the federal lands recreation enhancement act was enacted on december 8 2004 as title viii of division j of pl 108447 the consolidated appropriations act for

incentives for agency managers to charge and use fees for onsite improvements prior to fee demo the agencies had little incentive to develop monitor and evaluate fee collection since most fees went to the general fund of the treasury2 the agencies could not retain them for resource improvements or management activities rea monies like fee demo collections are intended to supplement appropriations in general recreation fees have represented small portion of each agencys overall financing with the bulk of agency monies coming from appropriated funds 3 the agencies excluding reclamation anticipated collecting about 240 million in fees in fy2007 with nps collections accounting for about twothirds of the total g8g142g142g156g561 in enacting the rea congress sought to reduce or eliminate duplication inconsistency and confusion over determining and collecting fees the law seeks to standardize the types of recreation fees across agencies differentiate among different types of fees and minimize the situations where multiple fees can be charged to alleviate concerns that past fees had been charged for nondeveloped areas the law outlines areas and circumstances where fees can and cannot be charged in some cases specifying the level of services needed to charge fee g22g162g153g142g156g561g152g143g561g8g142g142g156g561 the rea provides guidance on establishing entrance standard amenity expanded amenity and special recreation permit fees an entrance fee may be charged for units managed by the nps and fws only on the grounds that recreation fees at these agencies have enjoyed widespread support and the lands typically have certain kinds of infrastructure and services the law explicitly states that the blm reclamation and fs may not charge entrance fees rather these agencies may charge standard amenity fees in areas or circumstances where certain level of services or facilities is available specifically these agencies may charge standard amenity fees at national conservation area national v olcanic monument destination visitor or interpretive center that provides broad range of interpretive services programs and media an area that provides significant

specific or specialized facility equipment or service the fee may be in addition to an entrance fee or may be the sole fee the blm reclamation and fs may charge an expanded amenity fee only for specified facilities and services such as use of developed campgrounds or developed swimming sites that provide at least majority of services identified in the law use of transportation services rental of cabins boats and historic structures and participation in special tours the rea prohibits the blm reclamation and fs from charging standard or expanded amenity fees for certain activities and services such as for parking or picnicking along roads or trailsides accessing dispersed areas with low or investment unless specifically authorized in the law passing through areas without using facilities and services and using scenic overlooks in addition the law specifies places where entrance and standard fees may not be chargedfor example at nps units within the district of columbia it also bars fees from being charged to certain persons such as those under 16 years old or for certain purposes including outings for noncommercial educational purposes by schools and academic institutions further the doi and usda secretaries may charge special recreation permit fee in connection with special permit issued for specialized recreation at lands and waters of any of the five agencies specialized recreation includes group activities recreation events and use of motorized recreational vehicles

criteria for establishing recreation fees for instance they are to be commensurate with the benefits and services provided and the secretaries are to consider comparable fees charged elsewhere such as by nearby private providers of recreation servi ces to minimize confusion burden and overlap of fees the secretaries are to consider the aggregate effect of recreation fees on recreation users and providers they are to establish the minimum number of fees and avoid collecting multiple or layered fees for similar purposes in establishing new fees and fee sites the secretaries are to obtain input from recreation resource advisory committees recreation racs see below

spend the revenue collected without further appropriation each agencys collections are to be deposited into special account in the treasury in general at least 80 of the revenue collected is to be retained and used at the site where it was generated however the secretaries of doi and usda can reduce that amount to not less than 60 for fiscal year if collections exceed reasonable needs this

to be used agencywide at the discretion of the agency however the law contains other provisions for the distribution of certain collections including from the sale of the national recreation pass and regional multi entity passes the agencies have broad discretion in using revenues for purposes specified in the rea which aim to benefit visitors directly they include facility maintenance repair and enhancement interpretation and visitor services signs certain habitat restoration law enforcement operation of the recreation fee program and fee manage ment agreements the secretaries may not use collections for employee bonuses or biological monitoring under the endangered species act further the secretaries may not use more than an average of 15 of collections for program administration overhead and indirect costs under the fee demo program agencies reported that majority of fees were spent on deferred maintenance and various visitor services the rea continues requirement that the secretaries enforce the payment of fees it authorizes penalties for nonpayment with the fine for the first offense capped at 100

public participation in establishing fees under the rea for instance they are to publish notice in the federal register regarding new fee area six months before its establishment in addition for each blm and fs state or region the secretaries are to appoint recreation racs to make recommendations regarding standard and expanded amenity fees in accordance with specified procedures the secretary may establish as many racs in state or region as necessary if rejecting fee recommendation the secretary is to notify the house resources and senate energy and natural resources committees of the reasons at least 30 days before implementing decision each recreation rac is to be composed of 11 members and broadly representative of the recreation community as specified in the law each rac is to include five people who represent various types of recreation users such as summer nonmotorized recreation three people who represent different types of interest groups such as motorized outfitters and guides state tourism official to represent the state representative of affected indian tribes and representative of local governments the secretaries may appoint members from nominations by governors and designated county officials but are not to establish racs if there is insufficient interest to ensure balance of views also in lieu of creating recreation racs the secretaries may use racs established under other authorities eg the racs established under the grazing regulations the secretaries are to post notices of fees in areas where fees are being charged as well as in publications distributed in the area to the extent practicable the secretaries also are to post notices in areas where work is being performed using collections communication on how fees are spent is thought to enhance public acceptance of fees the law provides for collaboration with other federal and nonfederal entities with goal of greater convenience to the public and improved efficiency for the agencies it authorizes the secretaries to enter into contracts for various purposes such as fee collection and processing services and emergency medical services states or subdivisions of states that enter into such agreements may share in the revenues collected httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33730g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g14g138g151g141g156g561g20g142g140g155g142g138g157g146g152g151g561g7 g151g145

one goal is to facilitate recreation by consolidating existing passes and reducing confusion over which passes can be accepted where another is to increase the convenience of visiting adjacent sites managed by different agencies specifically the national parks and federal recreational lands pass is to cover the entrance fee and standard amenity fee at all areas where such fees are charged 5 the secretaries are to establish the price of the pass which generally is to be valid for one year however they are to provide free or reducedcost passes to certain individuals such as volunteers and senior or disabled visitors and may provide for discounted or free day for visitors generally they are to issue guidelines on administering the pass including on sharing costs and revenues among the agencies further the secretaries may enter into cooperative agreements with governmental and nongovernmental entities for developing and implementing the pass program the law also provides authority to develop sitespecific and regional multientity passes site specific pass is to cover the entrance or standard amenity fee for particular site for up to year regional multientity pass is to be accepted by one or more of the five agencies or one or more governmental or nongovernmental entities in establishing multientity passes the secretary is to enter into an agreement with all participating agencies or entities as to the price of the pass and the sharing of costs and revenues among other issues

supplement appropriations they believe that the new program retains the benefits of the former fee demo program such as keeping most fees onsite to provide improvements desired by visitors they also contend that the new program improves upon the former one for example by seeking to establish fair and similar fees among agencies the criteria in the rea for determining fees are intended to ensure that they are charged in appropriate circumstances namely where infrastructure and services directly benefit the public among other improvements fee supporters note that the new program provides for more public involvement in determining fee sites and setting fees eg through racs and for increased coordination with local communities eg through fee management agreements they also view the establishment of single national pass as increasing consistency convenience and clarity however some concerns with recreation fees continue to be expressed they include concerns that the new program does not go far enough in simplifying fees that it does not allow for fee experimentation to adapt to change and that it fail s to ensure that most collections will be used for maintenance backlogs of agencies which many regard as priority other concerns are that federal lands will be overdeveloped to attract feepaying tourists and that one national pass will be difficult to implement given differences in agency lands and complex issues regarding pricing and sharing revenues some charge that the authority to reduce the funds site retains to 60 could make planning difficult reduce incentives to collect fees and weaken visitor support for fees other critics continue to oppose recreation fees in general arguing among other things that appropriations should cover the costs of operating and maintaining federal lands or that they 5 this pass sometimes has been referred as the america the beautiful pass

new fee program6 the recreation fee leadership council is overseeing agency implementation of the new fee program this interagency group comprised of senior doi and usda department and agency officials was established in 2002 to enhance coordination and consistency of fees under fee demo current responsibilities include ensuring national consistency of fees developing fee policies such as those concerning passes and collections and evaluating the program on december 17 2004 the fee council adopted draft implementation plan with short medium and longterm goals shortterm goals generally undertaken within three months of enactment include creating the special accounts in the treasury conducting rough analysis of whether sites that currently charge fees meet the criteria in the rea and making preliminary assessments as to whether existing racs could rve the role provided for in the rea these particular shortterm actions have been completed mediumterm goals were generally to be accomplished within approximately 612 months of enactment they include conducting more detailed analysis of whether existing fee sites meet the requirements in the rea which has been completed another mediumterm goal is establishing interagency guidance in various areas for example regarding the criteria for charging fees comprehensive interagency guidelines have not been completed as discussed below another mediumterm goal is developing procedures for gathering the data needed for periodic reports to congress specifically under the rea not later than may 1 2006 and every three years thereafter the secretaries are to submit to congress report on the recreation fee program the report is to include an evaluation of the program and any recommendations for changes to the fee system the first triennial report to congress was issued in may 2006 the report provides information on many aspects of the transition to the rea program including fee structure policies and sites collection and use of recreation revenues development of national pass for recreation and public participation in the development of recreation fees including through the establishment of recreation racs it does not contain recommendations for improvement because implementation of the program is not complete longterm goals targeted for completion in year or more following enactment include establishing recreation racs bringing reclamation into the fee program and issuing the national parks and federal recreational lands pass the new national pass is available while these other particular longterm goals are ongoing as discussed below 6 much of the information in this section on implementing the rea is derived from two documents us dept of the interior and us dept of agriculture federal lands

interagency policy guidance on many aspects of rea is contained in handbook issued in june 20067 the implementation handbook establishes common definitions of terms in the rea and overarching policy guidelines to implement the law it does not contain information on passes which is nearing completion and is expected to be added in addition doi and the fs jointly issued guidelines for public involvement in establishing new fee areas and informing the public of how recreation fee revenues are used 8 further some of the agencies have issued their own guidance on the intention and requirements of the new recreation fee program the fee council expects such policies to be consistent across agencies some agency officials have found the rea difficult to interpret and have suggested need for more specific guidance on implementing and managing fee programs according to the september 2006 gao report for instance some officials noted need for clarification of how to apply criteria and terminology in the rea and guidance on adding or modifying fee sites the gao recommended that the interior and agriculture secretaries direct their agencies to promptly issue final rea regulations and implementation guidance on their fee programs 9 g25g152g155g148g146g151g144g561g9g155g152g158g153g156g561 the fee council established steering group composed of senior staff from each of the

racs have established processes for considering agency fee proposals while others have begun meeting to review fee proposals the fs is finalizing the selection of members for the new recreation racs according to gao the slow pace of establishing racs has delayed the implementation of new or increased fees at some blm and fs units because agency policy generally requires rac review and recommendation for new or increased fees gao recommended that the secretaries expedite actions needed for the racs to do their work to implement the rea11 the agencies also have held listening sessions throughout the country to get public input on the fee program g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g18g138g156g156g561 the interagency pass working group has focused on the development of the national parks and federal recreational lands pass key issue was how much to charge for the pass and the agencies contracted with university for pricing analysis another issue is how to track use of the pass particularly at blm and fs sites that may be remote and unstaffed still another issue is how to distribute revenues from the sale of the pass among the agencies over the long term in the short term revenues from pass sales at sites will remain with the agency that collects them revenues collected centrally for instance through sales of passes on the internet will be used for administrative costs of the program and repaying the nps for startup costs of the new pass with additional revenue split among the five agencies in the long term the distribution of revenues from centralized sales will take into account use of the pass the standard version of the new annual pass became available to the general public in january 2007 for cost of 80 there are three other versions of the pass for volunteers seniors and persons with disabilities the standard annual pass is expected to be the most widely used the volunteer pass is free to volunteers who work at recreation sites for 500 hours over any time period both the standard annual and volunteer passes are valid for 12month period and cover entrance fees and standard amenity fees the senior pass is lifetime pass for those aged 62 or older for 10 fee the access pass is free lifetime pass for persons with permanent disabilities both the senior and access passes cover entrance fees and standard amenity fees and discounts on some expanded amenity fees existing passes will be valid until they expire 12 g8g142g142g561g21g146g157g142g156g561 the agencies conducted detailed analysis of the extent to which sites charging recreation fees under the former fee demo program met the criteria and prohibitions of the rea for charging entry standard amenity and expanded amenity fees the agencies instructed units to make changes where necessary the nps and fws made little change as both agencies were authorized under fee demo to charge entrance fees and continue to have authority to charge entrance fees under rea most blm areas were in compliance with the new requirements and continue to charge fees as before although some adjustments were made for instance some sites added amenities such as picnic tables to be in compliance with rea provisions the fs made the most changes as result of the rea the agency dropped fees at 437 sites including numerous trailheads and picnic areas because they did not have the amenities required by the 11 september 2006 gao report pp 1415 and 63 12 information on and purchase of these recreation passes is available on the website of the us

majority of sites are not charging recreation feeover 90 of blm and fs over 80 of fws sites open to visitors and 48 of nps some blm and fs sites that are charging standard amenity fees do not have all the required amenities according to gao13 specifically 2 blm sites and 36 fs sites reported that they did not have all the amenities most commonly missing were permanent trash receptacles or interpretive signs exhibits or kiosks however blm and fs state and departmentlevel officials expressed belief that all fee areas were in compliance and that information to the contrary from unit staff likely was due to misunderstanding fs use of highimpact recreation area hira designations for charging fees has been controversial while the rea does not mention hiras the agencies have agreed to define an hira as an area of concentrated recreational use that includes variety of developed sites providing similar recreation opportunity further it is contiguous area composed of places activities or special natural or cultural features that is the focal point of recreation and that has clear access points and boundaries 14 the fs views it as more convenient for users to pay fees for use of these areas rather than to pay separate fees at each of their sites the agency notes that collections are used for upkeep of facilities in the areas some of the hiras have been criticized by recreationists as broad designations for large tracts of land lacking in the amenities required by the rea the rea applies to reclamation and the agency has determined that one or few sites will be part of the fee program few reclamation recreation sites meet the criteria for charging fees established in the rea about 250 of reclamations 300 recreation sites are managed by partner organizations and the agency concluded that these nonfederally managed sites will not participate in the rea program reclamation determined that 7 of the approximately 50 sites it manages directly would qualify to charge standard amenity fees under the rea as part of its review of whether and to what extent to partic ipate in the rea reclamation examined whether the costs of implementing and participating in the program would exceed expected revenues under the program the agency also assessed its authority to charge recreation fees under another authority that was not repealed by the reathe federal water project recreation act 15 before reclamations decision to participate in the rea the gao had recommended that the secretary of the interior direct reclamation to expedite decision on implementing the rea16 g23g156g142g561g152g143g561g20g142g140g155g142g138g157g146g152g151g561g8g142g142g561g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g156g561 the agencies have used recreation fees for variety of operation

expects to take in and spend the most recreation revenue dedicating the largest share of its funds to reducing the agencys backlog of deferred maintenance specifically the nps expects to spend total of 108 billion over five years from fy2006 to fy2010 with 4800 million 44 on deferred maintenance 1832 million 17 on direct costscosts of collection 1750 million 16 on visitor services 1168 million 11 on nondeferred maintenance and 1266 million 12 on other purposes the fs projects spending 2499 million from fy2006 to fy2010 maintenance deferred and nondeferred combined is expected to be the biggest expenditure960 million 38 the agency anticipates spending 660 million 26 on visitor services 425 million 17 on direct costscosts of collection and 454 million 18 on other purposes the fws anticipates spending 246 million over five years the largest share 104 million 42 would be used for visitor services other projected spending includes 37 million 15 for nondeferred maintenance 34 million 14 for direct costscosts of collection 21 million 8 for administrative overhead and indirect costs 20 million 8 for law enforcement and 31 million 12 on other purposes the agencies have different procedures for selecting projects to be funded with rea revenues for blm fws and fs most projects are approved at the local units usually within few weeks of being suggested by unit staff nps projects are reviewed by nps local units regions and headquarters before submission for doi or congre ssional approval this process can take year or more while it may help ensure consistency with the rea and accountability in use of funds it also may delay the implementation of projects and contribute to balances of unobligated revenues 19 unobligated balances of collected fees have varied between 58 and 80 from fy1997 to fy2005 during this period annual obligations increased from about 20 of total funds available in fy1997 to almost 40 in fy2005 specifically as of the end of fy2005 the agencies excluding reclamation had combined unobligated balance of recreation fees totaling 2958 million this constituted 61 of the 4838 million available for obligation these revenues accumulated under the former fee demo program as well as the current program under rea typically not all the fees collected during year are spent during that year reasons include need to carry over funds for the next years operations and for large projects insufficient staff at some units to administer and implement projects and the time needed for environmental analysis design and engineering 20 the average cost to the agencies of collecting recreation fees declined from 208 of gross fees in fy2002 to 187 in fy2005 the cost to each agency varied during fy2005 specifically the cost to the blm was 96 to the fws 14 to the fs 156 and to the nps 205 smaller park units have tended to have higher collection costs because they collect relatively little revenue or more complex site logistics eg staffed entrance fee

recreational lands pass available to veterans for cost of 10 annually the 110th congress also is continuing to oversee agency efforts to establish collect and spend recreation fees under the rea the 109th congress held hearings to oversee the recreation fee program for example on february 17 2005 senate energy and natural resources subcommittee held hearing on nps implementation of the recreation fee program with focus on the development of the national parks and federal recreational lands pass doi official addressed the structure and time frames for implementing the program and the transition to new national recreation pass other witnesses explored the marketing and management of the national park passport program which the new pass has since replaced and issues and concerns related to the development of new national pass on october 26 2005 another senate energy and natural resources subcommittee held hearing on implementation of the recreation fee program generally doi and usda officials provided an overview of implementation activities including the assessment of recreation sites for compliance with provisions of the rea development of framework for establishing recreation racs creation of hiras for areas with high concentration of recreation sites that collectively meet the definition for standard amenity fee and use of recreation fees some witnesses expressed concern with aspects of implementation such as the increase in use of special recreation permits creation of hiras where amenities appear to be lacking and slow pace of establishing recreation racs and of implementing the recreation fee program overall the september 2006 gao report on rea implementation had concluded that the agencies were making progress while some issues were unresolved specific conclusions included that two of the working groupson recreation racspublic participation and on the interagency passhad not finished their work and that the secretaries of agriculture and the interior should expedite actions to get the recreation racs operational also some doi and fs units were unclear as to how to implement the rea and final regulations and detailed policy and procedure guidance are needed for effective and consistent program implementation according to gao gao further concluded that some agencies lacked adequate controls and accounting procedures over collected recreation fees and recommended that the agencies implement internal controls over their fee revenues finally gao asserted that reclamation should expedite its decision on whether and how it will implement the rea 22 the agency has since determined that one or few sites will be part of the rea 22 september 2006 gao report p 6164
