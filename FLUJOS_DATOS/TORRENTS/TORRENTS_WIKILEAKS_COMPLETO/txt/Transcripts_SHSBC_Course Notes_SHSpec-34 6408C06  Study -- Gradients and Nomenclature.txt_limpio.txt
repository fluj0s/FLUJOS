6408c06 shspec34 study gradients and nomenclature bulletins are now being written in form that is easier to understand since lrh started to study study scores on exams have gone from 5 in the gos to 60 in the 90s since this material started to be communicated the aim is to improve the ability of the student to learn by altering the methodology of teaching this is an unusual approach we are now handling the students subjective reaction to the subject by changing the method of teaching the usual way to change the students reaction to the subject was by punishment the normal physical universe method the grade system is punishment system on rare occasions the participation of the student has been invited by some teachers education is not normally very successful although educators dont often recognize or admit this fact in scientology we have the unusual situation of being able to see the end product of our education in action this makes it easy to see how well the students learned the material in studying study lrh avoided fields where the students ability to apply what he learned is readily observable we have instantaneous inspection of the results of our study this is quite rare most fields of study expect the student to be very amateurish in the field of photography you get results almost as rapidly as in studying auditing which made it good comparative field for studying auditing is complicated activity in teaching it we apply the principle of gradient scales which was discovered long since we have someone learn fairly simple basic action very well then we add second action etc modern universities usually err by entering the gradient at too high point and assuming that the students already know basics that they dont in fact modern education is the art of teaching on an outgradient our basic gradient on education is to start by getting someone there this is step that elementary school teachers overlook and that works very well when used for five or ten minutes day brief time though that is at the start of the day for instance you could run look at that wall etc the fact that body is there doesnt prove that the person is there nobody is smart where he is not so getting the person there raises iq you always have to start with an action that is simple enough so that the student can get it rather easily otherwise he will feel spinny and confused as he goes on you could discover whether this had happened with person by checking on the emeter for early difficulties in studying dianetics or scientology if you got ta and continued reads as the person discussed it you would know that there was something there that bad never been resolved the difficulties that men have with their minds are those which have ridden forward with them into the present those are the ones that must be handled you can always get one read on difficulty or confusion that someone has had in the past simply because it is pictured on the track as having been difficulty but it wont keep reading if it hasnt ridden forward in time as an auditor you are only interested in the things that the person never resolved which are active now those things will read repetitively this applies to clearing up someones difficulty in studying because the confusions that the person had which are now cleared up have power to confuse him now arc must have preceded all misemotion and bad reaction the confusion that sticks the student in pt is never his basic confusion if student really cant learn something then there is lower point on the gradient that the student skipped at that point he had enough confusion to be overwhelmed that second point is the one that you will get on the meter you wont get the earliest point this follows the pattern of the mind person doesnt have trouble from what he knows is wrong what the student is very confused about which the instructor cant seem to teach is not the right point to try to clear up the way to handle this student is to go back and find the word in the earlier material that wasnt understood you can pinpoint within few words the exact spot at which student started to have trouble then look earlier and find the skipped gradient if there is some word that student doesnt understand with violence you look before that you go back as far as you need to the physiological manifestations will be feeling headachy spots in front of the eyes walls getting closer spinny weird feeling the skipped gradient can even be in an allied subject when word is misunderstood words right after it vanish teaching is relaying data to person that he can receive and understand in such way that he will be able to use the data that is the definition that was given the other day see p 656 above to fit in with this exact rationale that we are discussing now instruction would consist of guiding student along known gradient not dreaming up solutions to his confusions good instruction consists in backtracking to find the point where the student thought he understood when he didnt study is concatenation of certainties string of confidences and competences so before you help student out let him get in trouble never trouble trouble til trouble troubles you that is the difficulty of group study teachers have to make an average of trouble for the whole class dont ever help student before be runs into trouble it is interesting that it was in 1947 that lrh started investigating the effect of mislearned word on life following the data from commander thompson on wordassociations lrh established that when he cleared up some words what had been troubling person ceased to trouble him though he could well have new problems another aspect of the misunderstood word phenomenon can be that the word or phrase used can be inadequate leading to omitted data one can get hung up by being deprived of some information eg by typographical error so it could be omitted data as well as misunderstood words that causes trouble for the student the fault could be in the text the common ingredient is that something is not understood
