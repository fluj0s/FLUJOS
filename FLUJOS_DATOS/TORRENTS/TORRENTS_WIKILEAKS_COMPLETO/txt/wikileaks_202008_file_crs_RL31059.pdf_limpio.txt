divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31059biological weapons primer summary in the past decade public and congressional concerns over biological weapons bw and bioterrorism in particular have sharply increased though the use of living organisms eg bacteria viruses fungi to harm or kill humans livestock or plants has never occurred on large scale many government officials are viewing bw attack as when not if scenario some experts however question this assertion noting that bw production and employment is significantly more difficult than often portrayed and that there are significant political down sides for any nation or group who would employ them there have been number of calls from congress the gao and congressionallymandated commiss ions for comprehensive integrated national threat assessment to be performed so that perceived vulnerabilities alone do not drive governments response the united states has both statutes and regulations that govern possession and use of dangerous biological agents though some have deemed these too loose to maintain effective control of these agents though legislation has been introduced to date in the 107th congress legislation considered in the 106th congress may be reintroduced later in the session federal programs intended to deter respond to andor mitigate bw attack exist in broad range of government departments and agencies and have been subject to criticism for lack of coordination vicepresident cheney is overseeing review of all programs related to chemicalbiologicalradiologicalnuclear threat response and in october 2001 is expecte d to provide recommendations which would be implemented under the direction of the federal emergency management agency as state party to the biological weapons convention the united states has

background origins of current interest number of factors have contributed to the greatly heightened interest in biological weapons bw over the last several years the persian gulf war brought to light iraqs bw capabilities and years of postwar confrontations with united nations inspectors served to keep public awareness high investigations of the aum shinrikyo the japanese terrorist group that released chemical nerve agent in the tokyo subway revealed it had acquired and sought to weaponize biological agents as well the bombings of the world trade center and the oklahoma city federal building though using only conventional explosives brought the reality of very large scale terrorist attacks to us shores the defense department the centr intelligence agency and several independent studies have all spotlighted biological weapons as growing concern both for the us military and the general population on the other hand significant number of experts have begun to question whether the concern over biological weapons is out of proportion to the actual threat1 nevertheless the potential vulnerability of the general public and the military and the relatively limited bw defense capabilities currently available though longstanding have been highlighted as never before these events accompanied by bwrelated novels and movies which attract public interest and strong press interest in biological weapons will continue to make them focal point for federal state and local governments what are biological weapons biological weapon is biological agent that is intentionally used to harm or kill humans animals or plants biological agents unlike chemical weapon agents are living organisms types of agents typically considered for use as biological weapons are bacteria viruses rickettsiae or fungi unique agent category bridging thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31059crs2 2botulinum toxin is produced by the bacteria clostridium botulinum ricin is toxin obtainable from castor beans 3in 1969 after review under the nixon administration the united states unilaterally foreswore biological weapons and destroyed its bw stockpile major factors in this decision were the unpredictability of biological weapons and faith in the us nuclear arsenal for purposes of deterrence and retaliationchemical and biological distinction is toxins these are biologically produced chemicals such as shellfish toxin snake venom botulinum toxin or ricin2 for arms control and legal purposes the definition of biological weapons has proven challenge the agents themselves are in widespread use for legitimate medical research and are often stored in significant quantity consequently their production and possession cannot be completely prohibited without severe effect on legitimate and desirable activities hence statutory and treaty language has focused on the use or the intention to use biological agents to harm and their possession in quantities incompatible with legitimate purposes rather than on the agents themselvessee us laws and regulations the number of biological agents that have been seriously considered for use as weapons is relatively small because most agents do not meet the necessary criteria for discussion of the criteria see the nature of biological weapons two organizations however maintain rather extensive lists of agents that could possibly be used as biological weapons the us centers for disease control and prevention have established list of agents whose transfer and possession are under regulatory control in the united states the australia group an informal association of nations seeking to stem cbw proliferations maintains list of agents over which member countries including the united states have pledged to maintain export controls see appendix nature of biological weapons biologi cal weapons are unique presenting complex array of differing characteristics they have never been used on largescale and incidents of small scale use are isolated and rare though some nations including the united states have produced bw stockpile s in the 20th century military leaders have generally viewed biological weapons with ambivalence3 they can be unpredictable in the lethality geographical extent and onset of their effects and conceivably present as great threat to ones own forces as those of the enemy while these considerations may cause reservations among military planners they may not with those terrorists who are unconcerned about indiscriminate harm though there are literally thousands of biological pathogens relatively few have met the criteria for an effective biological weapon the traditional requirements for battlefield biological weapon are summarized below some of these requirements however may be irrelevant to terrorist group unconcerned about the extent of harm caused or to nation state using bw as strategic weapon for instance military planners have avoided highly contagious diseases

capable of being widely dispersed survivable in storage and through dispersal insusceptible to common medical treatment short period between infection and symptom onset minimal contagiousness to avoid infecting ones own forces availability of protective measures for ones own forces if infected another characteristic of concern for those who would attempt clandestine bw use is natural occurrence in the target area if natural outbreaks of disease eg cholera or typhoid are relatively common it could be used as biological weapon with increased probability of plausible denial biological weapons could also lend themselves to false flag attacks in which the perpetrator plants evidence incriminating another group or nation these characte ristics could enhance bws attractiveness for some terrorists it is often maintained that biological weapons are relatively easy to produce and use this statement however is valid only in comparison to chemical and nuclear weapons production and use biological weapons do pose some significant challenges for potential users some nations have been attempting for years to develop bw capability with apparently limited success the terrorist group aum

significant amounts of pathogen could take as little time as several days and requires only equipment that is commercially available the former director of great britains cbw defense research program has estimated that small bw production facility could be operated by ten trained personnel though brief production of bw agents in small quantities could be produced by fewer personnel6 the more difficult challenges arise in weaponizing and delivering the pathogen ideally the pathogen particles must be of an appropriate size for inhalation and achieving this has been described as one of the more technically demanding aspects of weaponization7 the pathogen must also be stabilized during storage and delivery though simple aerosolizers can be used to deliver bw agents the aum shinrikyos repeated failures in bw aerosol dispersal in japan gives some indication of the difficulties in developing an effective delivery system8 throughout all the steps of bw production and delivery those involved must also take extraordinary care to ensure they themselves are not infected inadverte ntly unless they are dealing with plant or livestock pathogens that do not infect humans these challenges notwithstanding most observers agree that the increasing availability of technology and numbers of trained biotech personnel will continue to erode the technical obstacles to bw production and use9 threat assessments in congressional testimony cia director george tenet noted that chemical and biological weapons pose arguably the most daunting challenge for intelligence collectors and analysts10 largescale weapons systems are more easily detectable by national technical intelligence means bw facilities and weapons are notably easier to hide and often require human intelligence sources to identify and evaluate consequently little detailed information is available in unclassified form until recent years the bw threat was viewed as limited to us armed forces who might engage an adversary with biological weapons capability hence the emphasis was on national programs and assessments focused on national biotechnological capabilities as the two us government reports summarized below indicate as the potential for bw terrorism began to receive greater attention many public officia ls have assumed the position that bw attack upon the us civilian population is not question of if but when as some observers have pointed outhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31059crs5 11 combating terrorism need for comprehensive threat and risk assessment of chemical and biological attack

httpwwwciagovciapublic_affairsspeechesdci_speech_032100html 13general accounting office combating terrorism need for comprehensive threat and risk assessments of chemical and biological attacks gaonsiad99163 september 1999this viewpoint is driven more by the extent of domestic populations vulnerability to bw attack than by validated threat assessment estimating the likelihood of such an attack occurring11 for some cia reports of the followers of terrorist leader osma bin laden trying to acquire bwrelated materials is sufficient basis to assume he will eventually undertake bw attack against us citizens12 others suggest that there are variety of factors both technical and political that should be considered in assessing the likelihood of this occurring it can also be noted that if terrorists goals are to gain publicity engender fear and cause his enemies to adopt significant defens ive measures simply implying the possibility of bw possession may be sufficient the considerable funds expended and extensive measures undertaken in the last several years by us federal state and local governments to prepare for possible bw attack are indicative threat assessments by their nature will always be imprecise they are based upon available information and intelligence which is often sketchy and unconfirmed consequently regardless of the methodology used to analyze the data significant degree of uncertainty generally remains as was demonstrated with the unanticipated indian and pakistani nuclear weapons tests in 1998 even large national nuclear weapons programs can evade accurate assessment it is even more difficult when attempting to monitor or predict the activities of loosely organized terrorist groups and type of weapon that requires consid erably less infrastructure it is this uncertainty when juxtaposed with the theoretical potential for casualties that encourages decisionmakers to err on the side of greater caution when considering the bw threat us government assessments while the central intelligence agency has issued in classified form the national intelligence estimate regarding foreignbased terrorism there is still single integrated assessment covering both foreign and domestic threats and as the gene ral accounting office has repeatedly noted there has been national risk assessment undertaken13 foreign countries two us

biological weapons capability iran has produced bw agents and apparently weaponized small quantity iran has used civilian medical educational and scientific organizations in addition to its biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries to provide cover for its biological warfare program iraq since 1972 has developed produced and stockpiled bw agents and weapons though iraq has made substantial disclosures to the united nations about its bw program they are incomplete and have led to the assessment that iraq still possesses bw program and may have bw agents still stockpiled libya has been seeking bw capability for years but has been hampered by lack of expertise libyas program remains in the rd stage though it may be able produce small amounts of biological agents without foreign assistance it is unlikely to make significant progress in agent weaponization north korea has conducted bw research for over thirty years and is believed capable of limited bw production and weaponization non governmental sources have suggested that the majority of north koreas investment has been focused on defensive bw measures though acknowledging limited offensive capability15 russia acknowledged in 1992 that it had conducted covert offensive bw program and claimed to have ended it its declarations under the bwc since 1992 have been incomplete and misleading leading to the suspicion that an offensive program still exists the continued presence of old hands at certain facilities denial of visitations to some former bw researchproduction sites and information from defectors regarding ongoing offensive biological warfare activities contribute to these suspicions the russian bw effort was very extensive exploring the full range of human animal and plant pathogens

designated state sponsor of terrorism has welldeveloped biotechnology sector and has been on watch list for bw proliferation but has not been listed by acda or dod in their threat assessments most observers believe that there is low probability of statesponsors providing biological weapons to terrorist groups to use at their discretion17 this opinion generally hinges on the assumption that these nations hold biologica l weapons to be too valuable or too dangerous to be trusted outside of government control however should state decide to use bw its client terrorist groups could be enlisted in the effort and would provide at least minimal level of plausible denial in addition to the countries noted above there are several countries about which there is occasional press

the state departments most recent edition of patterns of global terrorism 2000 remained unchanged from previous years in its assessment that most terrorists continued to rely on conventional tactics but some terrorists such as usama bin laden and his associates continued to seek chemical biological radiological and nuclear capabilities 21 before the senate foreign relations committee cia director

ave international networks adding to uncertainty and the danger of surprise attack there are fewer constraints on nonstate actors than on state actors adding to the unpredictability are the lone militants or the ad hoc groups here at home and abroad who may try to conduct biological and chemical weapons attack22 both the state department and the central intelligence agency focus on foreign terrorist groups however the possibility of domesticbased bw terrorism came to the fore with the 1995 arrest of an individual with white supremacist associations in possession of freezedried bubonic plague bacteria23 since then the number of bw related threats and hoaxes has continued to rise there have been number of calls for comprehensive domestic terrorist threat assessment but none has been undertaken though it might seem that the federal bureau of investigation would be the logical agency to do this the fbi is law enforcement not an intelligence collection agency consequently its investigative activities must be tied to evidence of suspected or actual crimes and their prosecution rather than the kind of sweeping intelligence collection needed to prepare an overall domestic bw

securit challenges the commission asserts that the united states should assume that it will be target of terrorist attacks against its homeland using weapons of mass destruction25 the commission also concludes that biological weapons are the most likely choice of means for disaffected states and groups of the 21st century they are nearly as easy to develop as chemical weapons they are far more lethal and they are likely to become easier to deliver26 perhaps more significantly the hartrudman commission also predicts that the design and deployment of genetically engineered pathogens could

commission also suggests particular attention to the possibility of terrorist attacks against us agriculture deeming this the easiest application of bw and virtually riskfree for the perpetrators30 the commission echoes the call for an integrated national threat assessment which includes potential usbased threats to permit more rational allocation of resources us laws and regulations biological weapons antiterrorism act of 1989 pl 101298 this act implements the biological weapons convention of 1975 criminalizing the production stockpiling transfer acquisition and possession of any biological agent toxin or delivery system for use as weapon the act specifically exempts agents intended for protective or peaceful purposes the 1996 antiterrorism and effective death penalty act amended this law to extend its coverage to threats or attempts to use biological agents as weapons and to include bioengineered agents violators can be imprisoned for any term of years including life imprisonment this act also provides the attorneyg eneral with the authority to request seizure warrant for any covered agent that is of type or quantity that has apparent justification for prophylactic protective or other peaceful purposes the attorneygeneral is also authorized to obtain civil injunction against conduct prohibited under this act the primary issue of concern regarding this act is the challenge it provides for criminal prosecution intent to use an agent as weapon must be proven and it is an affirmative defense that possession or other activity with the agent is intended for peaceful purposes some have argued this makes it far too easy for group or individual to have legal possession of potentially very dangerous pathogens and places too high burden of proof upon the prosecution these concerns were in part the reason for certain provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 discussed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31059crs11 31us congress house of

maintain list of biological agents that have the potential to pose severe threat to public health and 2 to promulgate rules for the transfer of listed agents to ensure proper training of personnel and laboratory facilities and proper safeguards to prevent access to these agents for criminal or terrorist purposes fulfilling this statutory requirement the centers for disease control and prevention cdc promulgated federal regulation 42 cfr part 72 the regulation requires any person or institution either transferring or receiving listed agents to 1 register with cdc 2 to report shipments or transfers noting end users and purposes 3 comply with appropriate federal biosafety requirements and 4 submit to random or for cause inspections to assure compliance one criticism of this legislation and the implementing regulation is that they focus solely on agent transfers and consequently do not capture those institutions or individuals who currently possess listed agents but have cause to transfer them therefore it still remains legal to possess these agents without registration as long as transfers take place this continues to concern some lawmakers and members of the law enforcement community in may 1999 the house committee on commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations held hearing to address this issue31 department of justice officials testified that the department had been working with health and human services to draft new legislation addressing this issue and it would be presented by the administration in the near future however administration sponsored

convention and the australia group biological weapons convention of 1975 bwc the united states ratified the bwc in 1975 parties to the bwc have agreed not to develop produce stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain 1 microbial or other biological agents or toxins whatever their origin or method of production of types and in quantities that have justification for prophylactic protective or other peaceful purposes and 2 weapons equipment or means of delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict they also have agreed not to transfer directly or indirectly or to assist any state group of states or international organizations to manufacture or otherwise acquire any of the bw agents toxins weapons equipment or means of delivery the bwc also requires all parties to destroy their bw stockpiles within nine months of ratification the united states ratified the bwc in 1975 and enacted implementing legislation in 1989 pl 101298 the bwc codified what the united states had already unilaterally undertaken in 1969 when president nixon ended the us biological weapons program and ordered the stockpile destroyed the bwc was negotiated in relatively short period of time 19691972 primarily because it contains provisions for enforcement or verification of compliance which are often the most difficult elements of an arms control treaty to conclude efforts to remedy this lack began in 1986 when the states parties agreed to certain confidencebuilding measures compliance with even these unverified information exchanges was limited34 since 1991 socalled ad hoc group of government experts has sought first to identify possible verification measures and then to negotiate verification protocol which could have reasonable chance of acceptance by the bwc review conference in 2001 number of factors have informed the us position in the bwc protocol negotiations perhaps the single most important is the assertion that the bwc is inherently unverifiable and that the best that can be hoped for is bolstering of confidence regarding compliance the reasons the united states has long held that the bwc is not verifiable are many but almost all stem from the uniqueness of biological weapons all other subjects of arms control agreements are countable aircraft missiles measurable nuclear detonations or not naturally occurring nerve agents35 none of these conditions is true for biological weapons biologicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31059crs16 35continued national security subcommittee june 5 2001 36indeed the legal definition of biological weapon is dependent upon the intent of the pathogen possessor to harmpathogens are naturally ubiquitous most often identified only with difficulty and their possession or the possession of equipment to produce them is necessary for wide range of perfectly legitimate and beneficial purposes eg pharmaceutical and medical research36 the facilities required to produce biological weapons may be quite small have visible signature and could otherwise carry out legitimate activities hence the universe of potential bw facilities that would have to be monitored to achieve total verification is virtually limitless once nonverifiability is assumed it raises the threshold for the costs or risks that are deemed acceptable in obtaining an agreement in the calculation of benefit and risk the united states has accepted as fundamental principles the protection of the us biotechnology industries confidential business information and the security of us biodefense programs simply put the us believes that the low level of compliance assurance expected from the bwc protocol does not justify placing these commercial and defense interests at any significant risk through broadly defined declarations or inspection procedures this position has put the united states at odds with most of its european allies who favor more stringent and intrusive regime another fundamental principle for the united states is the maintenance of existing nonproliferation export controls independe nt of the bwc the non aligned movement nam of developing nations has quite energetically sought to prohibit such controls and to requireencourage technology transfer within the framework of the protocol making such measures fundamental condition for their acceptance of any protocol the united states and its european allies continue to resist these efforts emphasizing that the bwc protocol is to address security issues and is not trade treaty this issue is still seen by many as showstopper unless the nam nations modify their stance which is deemed unlikely us negotiators have also emphasized that any protocol would apply only to bwc state parties several nations hostile to the united states are suspected or known to have bw programs and are not bwc state parties eg iraq north korea consequently protocol would have effect on their conduct this unmitigated threat is then perceived to place even greater importance on preventing the inadvertent release of technologically valuable information through declarations or visitinspections finally us negotiators have kept in mind the need for senate advice and consent to any protocol and the difficulties experienced in this process with the somewhat less controversial chemical weapons convention some consideration therefore must be given to possible senate reaction to protocol provisions to avoid contentious and possibly unsuccessful ratification effort in the bwc protocol negotiations these principles have led the united states to favor narrower declaration thresholds and reporting requirements for facilities tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31059crs17 37zelicoff 38leonard jame f an essential first step arms control today may 200

declared facilities to seek restrictions on the number of mandatory onsite visits and to support managedaccess under the final control of the visitedinspected facility these positions held to protect us commercial and biodefense information have led some to characterize the us position as somewhat paradoxical ie expressing concerns over the lack of verifiability inherent in the protocol draft yet opposing tighter verification measures in press reports and in testimony before the house committee on government reform national secur ity subcommittee there has been criticism that the united states has failed to assume leadership role in the protocol negotiations or has been paralyzed owing to bureaucratic conflict within the government37 the relative silence of the us delegation in geneva has resulted in our european allies taking the initiative and pressing for more elaborate and intrusive regime based largely upon the chemical weapons convention than the united states will support this has led some to believe that the us commitment to completing negotiations is not wholehearted and that perhaps the united states would prefer the negotiations to drift indefinitely38 these speculations have increased with reports that bush administration review panel has concluded that the socalled chairmans draft of the protocol under consideration should not be accepted there has also been speculation that the administration will not however announce an outright rejection of the protocol draft owing to concerns over the internationally sensitive issue of us unilateralism but rather will simply continue negotiations to those who emphasize need to complete negotiations so that the protocol can be considered for approval by the november 2001 bwc review conference the united states has maintained that it will not negotiate against deadline the australia group and export controls the united states in coordination with the 30member australia group maintains export controls over
