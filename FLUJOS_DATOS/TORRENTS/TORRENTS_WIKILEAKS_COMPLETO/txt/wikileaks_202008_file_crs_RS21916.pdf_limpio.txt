109th congress this report will be updated as needed introduction the national commission on terrorist att acks upon the united states commonly known as the 911 commission found that constr aining terrorist travel should become vital part of counterterrorism strategy noting that false identities are used by terrorists to avoid being detected on watchlist and that biometric identifiers make such evasions far more difficult the commission recommended that the department of homeland security pr operly supported by the congress should complete as quickly as possible biom etric entryexit screening system including single system for speeding qualified travelers the commission identified the united states visitor and immigrant status indicator technology program usvisit as the first phase of such prog ram and recommended that this system be fully integrated with other border screening systems it furtherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21916crs2 1 national commission on terrorist attacks

law enforcement tting fingerprints may be used to rule out particular suspect as the perpetrator of crimerecommended that biometric passports or ot her secure identity verification should be required of all travelers entering the united states including us citizens1 overview of biometric technologies and applications biometrics are physical or behavioral characteristics of person that can be measured and used for identification finger print patterns are familiar example of the biometric technologies so far ployed or tested by border security agencies fingerprints and face recognition are the most commonly us ed and iris scans are widely viewed as promising for future applications images nd measurements of biometrics are typically digitized and reduced to numerical identif ier that is unique to particular person biometric identifiers can then be used for two distinct purposes identity verification and identity discovery in other words they can answer two questions is this person really who he says he is nd who is this person2 identity verification in an identity verification application person enrolls in the system and his identifying data are measur ed and recorded in database or on document to confirm the persons identity late r his identifying data are measured again and compared with the original this is known as onetoone matching an accurate system will confirm true claim of identity nd reject false claim with high probability border security applications include verifying the identity documents of border crossers including preenrolled trusted travelers identity discovery identity discovery is more challenging than identity verification if person makes claim of identity or if his claimed identity may be false then his identifying data must be compared with the stored data of all possible matches this is known as onetomany matching becau many comparisons are made in identity discovery applications the likelihood of co incidental match or even multiple matches is increased moreover identity discovery may be impossible if biometric data are simply not available for some target individuals fo r example fingerprint check cannot identify traveler as suspected terrorist if the terrorists fingerprints are not known leading biometric technologies the most widely used biometric technology is fingerprint recognition based on the pattern of ridges on the fingertips fingerprint patterns have been used in law enforcemen t since the 1800s and automated systems have been commercially available since the 1970s hand geometry based on the dimensions of the fingers joints and knuckles has been used for about 30 years to control access to secure facilities such as nuclear power plants facial recognition analyzes features such as the eye sockets cheekbones and sides of the mouth it has the advantage that cameras can capture facial images remotely iris scanning technology analyzes the visible patterns in the colored iris of the eye these patte rns reportedly remain stable throughout ones lifetime and can be scanned w ithout physical contact all four of these technologies have been used in one or more border control pplications

singapore other biometric t echnologies include retinal s canning signature recognition voice recognition and numerous emerging techni ques of varying technological maturity3 interpreting accuracy claims claims for the accuracy of biometric technologies often require caref ul interpretation for several reasons first matching can fail in two ways false positive which is an incorrect match between the identifiers of two different people or false negative which is an unsuccessf ul match between two measurements of the same person second in any system the criteria used for matching can be adjusted from more stringent to less stringent in given system requiring greater similarity before declaring match will generally reduce false positives at the cost of increasing false negatives and vice versa the appropriate tradeoff may vary from application to application even for single technology third in onetomany matching the size of the stored databa strongly affects the like lihood of coincidental match despite these factors equi pment vendors often quote just one accuracy figure known as the equalerror rate eer the accuracy of onetoone matching when the matching criteria are chosen to make the false positive rate equal to the false negative rate current us biometric sy stems and border security in the past decade digitized biometrics principally fingerprints have been developed to identify individuals with greater certainty while the commission identified usvisit as the first phase of biometric entryexit screening system it also recommended that this system be more fully integrated with other border screening systems4 major us law enforcement and border security biometric systems are described below but this tr eatment is not exhaustive and there are many other systems that might warrant integration integrated automated fingerprint identification system iafis while most biometric technologies have been developed only in the past 1015 years fingerprints have

practices hinge on the principle of recipr ocity the dos has developed comparable passport for us citizens traveling abroad scheduled for issuance in spring 2005 it will include an embedded microchip

of biometric systems like those recommended by the 911 commission would be substantial and recurri ng funding for usvisit in fy2004 was 328 million in 2002 the gao estimated that incor porating biometrics into visas would cost between 700 milli on and 15 billi on per year depending on the number of applicants and the type of biometric technol ogy used and incorporating biometrics into us passports would cost between 16 billi on and 24 billion per year the initial costs of planning and fielding the system s are not included in these gao estimates13 performance as noted above performance cla ims for biometric technologies should be interpreted carefully performance depends on the details of how technology is to be used as well as on factors like ligh ting conditions for facial recognition and dirt and wear for fingerprints some biometrics may vary as person ages some can probably be masked intentiona lly by altering ones appear ance some cannot be used by individuals whose relevant body parts are absent or damaged for identity discovery applications such as matching against watchlist speed and performance dependhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21916crs6 14 for further

database which determines th number of matches that must be evaluated the time required for enrollment and matching varies between technologies comparing alternative approaches requires uniform testing met hodology that reflects all these challenges security most biometric technologies have demonstrated vulnerab ilities to intentional deception for exam ple facial recognition and iris scanning can sometimes be defeated by presenting picture of someone elses face or iris in border security applications however the presence of human operator makes such techniques less likely information security is more likely concern including unauthorized changes to or disclosure of biometric data stored in central database or on an identity document user acceptance privacy concerns include the protection of personal data against misuse perhaps including identity theft the possibility of function creep or the eventual use of biometric data for purposes other than border security the loss of personal anonymity and the possibility that some bi ometric data may re veal personal medical information some users may ve concerns about specific technologies the hygiene of fingerprint scanners or the association of fingerprints with criminals for example standards effective use of biometrics requi res standards for the type of data collected the physical format in which data are stored if they are stored on document such as passport and the software format for data collection and interchange the national institute of st andards and technology nist is the lead federal agency in this area14 the private nonprofit american nationa l standards institute ansi has also issued number of us standards for biomet rics as have severa l other privatesector organizations for border security applications international standards are essential the icao an intergovernmental body that operates under the united nations has recommended standards for biometrics in trav documents such as visas and passports15 icaos recommendations include the worldwide use of facial recognition to ensure interoperability and the storage of identifie rs in contactless integratedcircuit chips embedded in documents additional standard s work is conducted by the nongovernmental international organization for standardization iso of which ansi is the us member related applications of biometrics since the 911 terrorist att acks biometric technologies have been proposed for number of other homeland secur ity applications many of these involve controlling access to secure areas for example several air ports have tested or deployed biometric technologies for access control in au gust 2004 the transportation security administration began the prototype phase of developing uniform transportation

although its effectiveness for this purpos has been questioned these and other applications are bey ond the scope of this report but experience with them may be instructive for efforts to incorporat similar technologies into border security
