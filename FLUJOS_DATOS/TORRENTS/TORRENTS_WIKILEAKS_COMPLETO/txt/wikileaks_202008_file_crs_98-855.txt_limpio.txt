larry m eig legislative attorney american law division summary the supreme court has agreed to consider ins v aguirreaguirre case that focuses on granting asylum to participants in political protests and uprisings under the immigration and nationality act an alien who commits serious nonpolitical offense abroad is barred from asylum in the us but there is controversy over applying this bar to politicallymotivated common crimes such as assault and destruction of property in addressing this controversy the court may decide how political conditions in foreign country are to affect our standards for protecting dissidents who commit crimes as part of their political activities also at issue is how closely courts may examine administrative determinations on what crimes constitute disqualifying offenses on october 5 1998 the us supreme court agreed to consider the case of ins v aguirreaguirre 121 f3d 521 9th cir 1997 this case concerns the standards for providing safe haven in the us for aliens who have committed politicallymotivated crimes abroad aside from its possible foreign affairs implications the supreme courts decision in aguirre should clarify the approach courts should take in examining administrative denials of protection in other political offense cases facts juan anibal aguirreaguirre hereinafter aguirre entered the us illegally in 1993 prior to entry aguirre promoted student protests in guatemala against higher bus fares and the alleged failure of the government to investigate student deaths these protests at times involved forcibly removing passengers from buses burning buses and trashing stores aguirre also was politically active in guatemala apart from the student protests on facing deportation from the us aguirre claimed that he would be seriously harmed if returned to guatemala because of his political activities there asylum under us immigration law the immigration and nationality act of 1952 ina as amended protects aliens here who face persecution abroad due to their race religion nationality political opinion or membership in particular social group the primary form of protection is asylum discretionary remedy that may be granted to an congressional research service the library of congress crs2 alien with wellfounded fear of persecution related to asylum is the remedy of withholding of removal which is relief that is premised on likelihood of persecution abroad both asylum and withholding of removal are unavailable under certain circumstances these include instances in which there are serious reasons for believing that the alien has committed serious nonpolitical offense prior to arriving here prior decisions during deportation proceedings an immigration judge granted aguirre both asylum and withholding of deportation this decision was based upon the weight of the evidence presented and conclusion that prospective threats against aguirre were all politicallymotivated and not based on his having committed common crimes subsequently the board of immigration appeals bia reversed the immigration judges decision concluding that the criminal nature of aguirres acts outweigh their political nature and that the ire of the students manifested itself disproportionately in the destruction of property and assaults on civilians in 21 decision panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit overturned the bia and agreed with the immigration judge interpreting the serious nonpolitical offense disqualification the twojudge majority held that it first needed to examine whether aguirres activities were closely linked to political purpose or instead were motivated primarily by personal reasons or personal gain after finding that aguirres acts were politicallymotivated the majority examined whether they were grossly out of proportion to the alleged objective contrasting aguirres acts to the bombings and maiming involved in irish republican army cases the ninth circuit previously had considered the majority concluded that aguirres act were not of such an atrocious nature as to disqualify him from relief finally the majority held that the bia had erred in failing to take the severity of prospective persecution in guatemala into account before finding that aguirres conduct barred him from our protection in dissent third judge characterized aguirres activities as unnecessarily violent and stated that the us should not be haven for thugs issues for the supreme court the supreme court will determine whether the ninth circuit erred in overturning the bias decision to bar relief on serious nonpolitical crime grounds in making this determination the court may be required to address several subsidiary issues including how free are the courts to substitute their own interpretation of serious nonpolitical offense for that of the bia leading supreme court decision suggests that courts should defer to reasonable agency interpretation of statute it administers but other precedent allows for more active judicial role when the issue is characterized as one of straightforward statutory interpretation in barring relief on serious nonpolitical offense grounds should or may the severity of prospective persecution be taken into account the united nations high commissioner on refugees handbook calls for balancing the seriousness of the offenses against the severity of possible persecution but the bia and several courts have rejected such balancing requirement what factors bear on whether certain activities comprise serious nonpolitical offense motivation degree of harm and effect on bystanders all appear to be relevant but it is less clear whether any weight should be put on country conditions and the means available for expressing political grievances for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98855
