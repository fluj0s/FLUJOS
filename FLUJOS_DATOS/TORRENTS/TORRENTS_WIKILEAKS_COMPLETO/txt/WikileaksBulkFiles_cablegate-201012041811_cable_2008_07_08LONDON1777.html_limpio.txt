information we had been passed by the us government regarding rendition contrary to earlier assurances that diego garcia had not been used for rendition flights us investigations had revealed two occasions both in 2002 when this had in fact occurred since february i have corresponded with secretary rice on this issue and our officials have continued to work through the details and implications of the new information i promised the house that as part of this of this sic process my officials would compile list of flights where we had been alerted to concern about rendition through the uk or our overseas territories the list which they have compiled containing 391 flights reflects concerns put to us by hon members members of the public multilateral organisations and nongovernmental organisations inclusion on this list does not represent an official endorsement of any allegations about particular flight on the contrary us government flights as with other government flights occur regularly for variety of purposes our intention was to collate in one place those concerns that had been put to us directly the list was passed to the us on 15 may i undertook in february to publish the list and have today placed copy in the library of the house and published it on the fco website wwwfcogovuk the united states government received the list of flights from the uk government the

rendition through the uk our overseas territories and crown dependencies or airspace without first receiving our express permission we have made clear that we would only grant such permission if we were satisfied that the rendition would accord with uk law and our international obligations the circumstances of any such request would be carefully examined on casebycase basis our intelligence and counterterrorism relationship with the us is vital to the national security of the united kingdom there must and will continue to be the strongest possible intelligence and counterterrorism
