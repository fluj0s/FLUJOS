from caspar ammann ammannucaredu to christoph kull christophkullpagesunibech subject re climate reconstruction challenge date thu 29 jun 2006 064340 0600 cc tim osborn tosbornueaacuk keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk xflowed hi christoph sounds excellent 20th is good target with three weeks left let launch one full round to solicit comments and ideas and then i can send you what we have to build the web site ill check with mike about having him fold this into the report cheers caspar christoph kull wrote dear caspar and tim thanks for putting this issue forward pagesclivar may help communicating this challenge to the community we will be able to setup the website with the data sets and the call etc let know what you need it would be best for us to have first simple word document with the structure headings and text we will then produce hidden site that can be updated and finalized before it will go public online we will be able to announce the challenge to the community via the newsletter and enews we need respective experiment description the next newsletter is going to be published by end of july can you provide this information by the 20th this would also fit with the planned announcement in the workshop report for eosmike will draft this report i suggest to directly contact him for an incorporation of this call all the best thanks lot and greetings from bern christoph on 23062006 1923 caspar ammann ammannucaredu wrote hi tim just back from the various trips and meetings most recently breckenridge and the ccsm workshop until yesterday this coincided with the release of the nrc report thanks tim for getting in touch with simon and eduardo and i would think it would be excellent if you would be on the reconstruction side of things here we really need to make sure that all the reconstruction groups the ones that show up in the spaghettigraph also provide reconstructions for the challenge by the way mike mann is fine with the participation of the german group in this as he has spoken now favorably on the project i think the separation you point at is absolutely crucial so as i indicated in wengen i would suggest that we could organize small group of modelers to define the concepts of the experiments and then make these happen completely disconnected from standard datacenters pseudoproxy group should then develop concepts of how to generate pseudoproxy series and tell the modelers where they need what data but what they do is not communicated to the modelers based the underlying concept as well as the technical procedure of how we approach the pseudoproxies should be made public so that everybody knows what we are dealing with we could do this under the pagesclivar intersection umbrella to better ensure that the groups are held separate and to give this more official touch below quick draft we should iterate on this and then contact people for the various groups so long and have good trip to norway caspar here very quick and simple structural draft we can work from all comments welcome hesitations to shoot hard primary goals crossverification of various emulations of same reconstruction technique using same input data comparison of skill at various time scales of different techniques if fed with identical pseudoproxy data sensitivities of hemispheric estimates to noise network density identify skill of resolving regional climate anomalies isolate forced from unforced signal identify questionable nonconsistent proxies modelers try to identify climate parameters and noise structure over calibration period from pseudoproxies number of experiments available published runs available unpublished or available reordered runs core experiments of challenge 13 brand new experiments one experiment should look technically realistic trend in calibration and relatively reasonable past very different phasing one experiment should have trend in calibration at all but quite accentuated variations before one could have relatively realistic structure but contains large landuse component we could actually do some science here pseudoproxies and instrumentaldata provide cruequivallent instrumental data incl some noise that is degrading in time provide annually resolved network of pseudo proxies we could even provide small set of 5 very low resolution records with some additional uncertainty in time 2 networks one high resolution 100 records one low resolution 20 though only one network available for any single model experiment to avoid knowledgetuning or through time separation first 500years only lowred then second 500years with both pseudoproxies vary in representation in climate temperature precip combination time annual seasonal and space gridpoint small region organization of three separate and isolated groups and first steps modeler group to decide on concept of target climates forcing series provide only network information to proxygroup people ammann zorita tett schmidt graham cobb goosse pseudoproxy group to decide on selection of networks and representation of individual proxies to mimic somewhat real world situation but develop significant noise bluewhitered concepts nonstationarity and potential human disturbance people brohan schweingruber wolff thompson overpeckcole huybers anderson reconstruction group getting ready for input file structures netcdf for instrumental asciiraw series for pseudoproxy series decide common metrics and reconstruction targets given theoretical pseudoproxy network information people everybody else direct science from this important forced versus internal variations in climate simulations modelers review and catalog of pseudoproxy generation noise and stationarity in climate proxy records problems with potential humanland use influence proxy group detection methods and systematic uncertainty estimates reconstruction group tim osborn wrote hi caspar and christoph i just wanted to let you know that 1 i have emailed simon tett for hadcm3 and eduardo zorita for echog eriki not sure about erikii to ask if they would be prepared for surface temperature fields to be made available from their model runs and placed on pseudoproxy website for use in pseudoproxy studies ill let you know their response 2 in wengen i suggested that philip brohan colleague of simon tett might be interested in creating pseduoproxies from the output of caspars secret model simulation because of philips interest in statistical error models eg in the error model he just published of the instrumental temperature record hadcrut3 i have emailed philip to ask him if he would be interested again ill let you know his response with regard to the climate reconstruction challenge keith and i were wondering how it is going to be run obviously some kind of organising group would be useful to ensure it is designed to be as scientifically useful an experiment as possible yet there needs to be clear distinction between provided experimental design advice and things like convening egu sessions and having too much knowledge of the setup that would prevent such people from taking part in the challenge keith and i would be interested in the former but would also like to keep our distance and take part in the challenge im not sure that it was clear in wengen exactly who is to organise this all cheers tim dr timothy j
