6107c05 shspec25 q and period procedures in auditing the meter may fall on question but it might not be the question you asked it might be protest or something else find what the meter did fall on and clean that up notice that when you run description processing on problem the problem keeps changing thats one reason we dont do any fancy problems process on rudiments we just keep the pc on the one he brought up otherwise we start to get into all this alteris change as level in the prehav scale was developed to cure alteris it turns out that this was stopgap what cures alteris is problems pcs who obsessively alteris will run problems like rocket since the solution is an alteris of the problem you can check every once in while with the pc how did you get that answer what are you doing on running problems you have to strongly do this you have to be sure he really did recall problem and didnt just get notion of foggy confusion you dont have to check every command just every few randomly you have to use tr4 if he repeats the command after you hes set up circuit so you repeat the command dont do it if the pc has had cognition since in that case it can seem invalidative let the pc stay in communication dont be robotic about using the repeat statement but stay in pt and dont put the command on circuit the acks are halfacks not full stops to the cycle and you can put little insistence on the command when you repeat it this keeps it from sounding like new command always get the command you asked answered you can ask him if he still has the command if hes commlagging and drifting use this rarely and sparingly since it does distract the pc thats the common denominator of pcs arc breaks with auditors sudden change of attention is associated in all minds with accidents pain etc so the auditor shifting the pcs attention suddenly makes the pc feel hit you should wait until he looks vaguely in your direction dont jump on him the meter action will also tell you if the pc is doing the command if it stops registering you can suspect hes lost the command the auditing command is what it is and doesnt have any understood additional agreements in it so if you say recall problem it doesnt include tell about it or dont tell about it and you cant make agreements with the pc that he should tell you and let it be understood for the rest of the process other arc breakers are the auditor giving you five commands without letting you answer any of them or the auditor saying nothing giving new command when the pc is waiting for it you cannot tell the pc how to do the command in addition to giving the command he must understand the command but to give advice on how to do it is evaluation also if the pc makes contract with the auditor for session length that can get tacitly into every command the pc will get stuck in the first command of the session if you start with some agreement that wasnt repeated the auditing track will bunch the only understanding you have with the pc is the command given at the moment given the auditors control of the pc extends to one command at time the auditor does control the session and not with kindness or social niceties you can tell the pc youre answering things i havent asked you recall problem theres polite way of telling pc to shut up good solid nice acknowledgement as soon as the pc starts to diverge the mistake is not to control the pc but note that when youve announced yourself as control unit youd better stay one since the valence will immediately test you to see if you will if you chicken out youll get an arc broken pc arc breaks proceed from lack of control ie from lack of auditing what you can get away with is what impingement you can make on the pc but it must not be misemotional impingement or youll bolster up the valence the pc is dramatizing which is always misemotional entity under the surface youll cave the pc in so exert tone 40 control with arc theres difference between overwhelming the pc and controlling the pc if you dont shoot misemotion at the pc you can say anything to him its mistake to make any comment on anything the pc said or did even if the pc asks for evaluation its not up to the auditor to comment just to acknowledge the auditors opinion otherwise becomes stable datum to the pc and you are going to have to audit out the stable data you put in dont even imply by your acknowledgements that you agree youre not in or out of agreement with them just in control
