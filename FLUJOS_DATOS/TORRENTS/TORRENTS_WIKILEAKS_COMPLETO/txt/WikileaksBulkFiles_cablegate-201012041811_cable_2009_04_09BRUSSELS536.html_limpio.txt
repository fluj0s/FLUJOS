useu econmincouns peter chase for reasons 14 b d 1 snf summary and comment during march 23 visit to brussels daniel glaser acting assistant secretary of the treasury for terrorist financing and financial crimes assured an uncertain european union that the united states remains committed to the dual track approach to iran and said we would welcome additional eu designations targeting irans proliferation and sanctions evasion activities delivering an unprecedented classified briefing to over 70 middle east and nonproliferation experts from all 27 eu states and institutions glaser encouraged the eu to move forward on specific designations to support the current international framework targeting irans illicit conduct through financial measures 2 c eu member states and officials uniformly praised the us informationsharing on sanctions and the us policy review capturing the predominant sentiment the czech presidency expressed gratitude for aas glasers presentation and confirmation that further eu measures would be consistent with the us policy review as signal the eu are all waiting for as this plays an important role in eu considerations however some eums were uncertain whether they should move forward on pending designations before the completion of the policy review during the briefing and on its margins member states concerns emerged over national economic interests unintended consequences eg hurting average iranians sanctions efficacy irans regional role lawsuits and international unity glasers separate consultations with representatives from the council secretariat and commission and ambassadors of the czech republic presidency uk france germany spain and incoming eupresidency sweden are reported septel 3 c the content tone and timing of aas glasers briefing impressed an appreciative eu audience as sign of the new us administrations seriousness about engagement with europe the eu is predisposed to respond positively to the new administrations policy on iran and wants its views taken into account during the policy review stage glasers presentation kept the good feelings going but also helped bring eu experts down to earth in terms of specific tasks on which the eu could usefully focus now we hope the briefing provides basis for further usg lobbying in individual eu member states in capitals on pending eu designations end summary and comment us message eu should act 2009 the critical year 4 s on march 3 the czech eu presidency convened formal meeting of the eu27 iran and nonproliferation experts comogconop to receive classified briefing from us interagency delegation led by aas glaser on measures in the financial and transport sectors to counter irans illicit conduct the session lasted little over an hour 40 minute presentation followed by 30 minutes of qa given intense eu interest and in order to set the political context for the detailed technical briefing on specific us designations that followed aas glaser noted that the us policy review on iran had not yet finalized but it was already clear that brussels 00000536 002 of 004 the usg would remain committed to dual track approach to resolving the nuclear issue consequently the united states would welcome eu actions now to reinforce existing unscrs the eu should act quickly to designate additional high priority proliferation targets 5 s to be sure engagement would be an important aspect of comprehensive strategy to dissuade iran from acquiring nuclear weapons however engagement alone is unlikely to succeed diplomacys best chance of success requires all elements combining pressure and incentives to work simultaneously not sequentially our shared challenge is to work together in finding the right mix of measures time was not on our side the international community must urgently choose between several bad options facing us in 2009 none of these options were without cost glaser pointed out that the dynamic nature of the international financial system required that targeted financial sanctions against iran must be continually adjusted to maintain let alone increase pressure on iran over time targeted iranian entities were finding ways to evade sanctions via front companies and facilitators without continuous active management on the part of the international community the measures taken thus far would be rendered merely symbolic gestures 6 s glaser stated that the eu had an important but timesensitive opportunity to help diplomacy succeed by targeting illicit iranian conduct that contravened security council resolutions unscrs the international framework for moving forward was already in place under the auspices of the unscrs and the financial action task force fatf we should continue to support and operate within this framework glaser urged the eu not to underestimate its influence on the actions of other key countries and regions priority designation targets 7 s aas glasers formal presentation provided us views and specific intelligence on financial and transport entities under active eu consideration for designation including bank mellat the export development bank of iran edbi bank saderat the islamic republic of iran shipping line irisl and iran air the only entity not yet usdesignated which aas glaser explained remains potential target separately several eu contacts found our case against bank mellat edbi and shipping companies to be particularly well formulated eu audience reactions 8 c all 27 eu member states eums attended the czech presidencyhosted classified briefing on march 3 in brussels indicative of the eus high level of interest all but slovakia sent their capitalsbased nonproliferation working group conop technical expert in addition to their middle east regional expert mixture of capitals and brusselsbased this was the first time the usg was welcomed to address this combined eu expert working group which meets ad hoc to decide on revising eu nonproliferation measures against iran permanent institutional staff covering iran sanctions and nonproliferation attended from the eus commission and council secretariat the eus situation center sitcen the communitys intelligence coordination unit also sent several representatives 9 c capturing the main sentiment in the room the czech presidency expressed gratitude for aas glasers presentation brussels 00000536 003 of 004 and confirmation that further eu measures would be consistent with the us policy review as signal the eu are all waiting for as this plays an important role in eu considerations the czechs and several others noted that us informationsharing was conducive to closer transatlantic cooperation on iran policy predicting this would directly influence internal eu debate on pending designations of entities and individuals supporting irans proliferation 10 c betraying some smaller eu states resentment of the eu3 countries uk france germany prerogatives within the council on iran policy cyprus pointedly thanked the us delegation for sharing information with the entire eu so all can take an informed decision rather than being asked to take action through leap of faith when some eums have information but the rest do not we also welcome that you are stressing the dualtrack approach cyprus added comment the cypriot intervention notwithstanding the czechs took considerable risk just in hosting the us presentation the eu remains prickly over direct us participation in their internal discussions and processes particularly after the bitter divides over iraq the czechs suffered some pushback prior to the event end comment 11 c at the conclusion of the briefing handful of smaller eums raised concerns routinely featured in the eus ongoing internal debate over next steps note the eu3 and italy refrained from speaking during the briefing in apparent deference to the rest of the membership who do not enjoy routine access to us senior iran policymakers end note unintended consequences 12 c poland cyprus and portugal asked about the impact of current sanctions against iran on the elite the broader population and the deteriorating economy is the us concerned that further moves could trigger an antiwestern backlash could we target political elites without victimizing or burdening the general population while expressing support for targeted measures portugal and cyprus worried that strengthening sanctions before irans june presidential elections could prove counterproductive by radicalizing the electorate and leading to ahmadinejads reelection cyprus flagged comments by iranian human rights activist shirin ebadi against sanctions and stressed that it want to encourage iranian moderates portugal asked whether the united states has considered irans role in the region eg afghanistan iraq and the broader middle east 13 c aas glaser concurred that these are all important questions but pointed out that the international community must choose among set of bad options in very compressed timeframe the international community must convey an urgent sense of seriousness both to iran and to other interested regional stakeholders in order to change strategic calculations and maximize the chance of diplomatic success by law us sanctions target those engaged in illicit conduct including proliferation and terrorist financing targeting the irans access to the international financial system offers the best chance of reducing harm to the average population 14 c as to the impact of sanctions glaser noted that disaggregating the effect of international sanctions and irans own disastrous economic policies would be nearly impossible moreover sanctions must be examined in the context of an overall policy approach and not in isolation more useful indicator is the perception of irans brussels 00000536 004 of 004 decisionmakers who view sanctions as problematic raising business costs and necessitating evasive behavior the elite are reacting as if sanctions are having an impact russia and china 15 c the netherlands asked for us views on the roles of russia and china cyprus referenced the importance of p5 1 unity to ensure iran did not circumvent sanctions and promote efficacy adding backing is the best way aas glaser agreed but argued that we were already required to implement existing unscrs this situation demanded nimble response to changing conditions including deceptive practices by designated entities the us closely consults russia and china who must play their parts what should the eu do will us answer the mail 16 c the netherlands asked what the us explicitly wanted from europe in the diplomatic political track and whether we plan to respond to the iranian presidents earlier letters to former president bush aas glaser referred the dutch to state on matters of diplomacy on the sanctions front he noted that the us policy review should not be reason for the eu to stop reviewing its existing sanctions for appropriate next steps given the tight timeframe it would be helpful for the eu to make similar designations to those already included under existing us sanctions authorities the saderat problem 17 snf in his presentation aas glaser noted unscr 1803 and eu common position identification of saderat for proliferation concerns but explained that our domestic designation falls under us counterterrorism authorities although not raised by member states in the formal briefing several eu contacts uk france germany council secretariat and czech presidency had raised concerns that the eu would not be able to act upon the us basis for designation of bank saderat support for terrorist activity the eu common position imposing measures against iran is strictly limited to proliferation as legal basis for inclusion on the list support for terrorist financing is not grounds for inclusion comment as the additional us information presented was exclusively limited to terrorist financing concerns some eums are questioning whether sufficient proliferation basis exists for saderats inclusion under eu iran sanctions the eu does notnot yet have consensus to include saderat in the next round end comment 18 u aas glaser has cleared this message minimize considered murray
