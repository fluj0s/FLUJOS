to be worker then they will be entitled to receive workers compensation for workrelated injury for this reason their employer or principal must cover them for workerscompensation and include the remuneration paid to the deemed worker in the employers wagesdeclaration 30chapter contractors why can contractor payments be treated as remuneration 26 many people working as contractors are treated as workers for workers compensation purposes the act refers to them as deemed workers see chapter d in those cases the employer is treated as aprincipal responsible for declaring remuneration for the purposes of workers compensation contractor with an abn or department of commerce office of fair trading licence is not necessarily an independent contractor they may still be deemed worker for the purposes of nswworkers compensation the issue is whether the person is worker in particular case and must bedetermined on casebycase basis the final arbiter of whether contractor is deemed worker is the compensation court of nsw and more recently the workers compensation commission and these are decided on the individual factsof each case cases decided in other courts are also relevant workcover applies tests determined bythe courts workers compensation legislation does not rely on the tax status of the person carrying out the work to determine whether that person is worker deemed worker or contractor some of the indicators examined by the courts in determining if contractor is deemed worker are whether the arrangement is in writing contractordeemed worker can employ other people to perform the work contractordeemed worker works at stated hours on usual days and the contract specifies the hours andor days contractordeemed worker measures and inspects the site and provides fixed price quotation inclusive of labour and material contractordeemed worker deals directly with the client requesting the work or the principal contractor for whose benefit the work is to be done contractordeemed worker can make profit or loss over the market rate for tradesman working in the industry contractordeemed worker supplies the materials plant and equipment used in completion of the job contractordeemed worker could be liable for bad quality of work for this reason it is important for employers to include records about contractors in the declarations and other records they make and present to workcover andor insurers see chapter i see rule 45for information about record keeping note proprietary limited company pty ltd must have workers compensation policy to cover all its

costs are deducted from remuneration paid to contractors 27 in relation to contractors the law provides that costs necessarily incurred by that person in performing that contract see section 174 9b of the workers compensation act 1987 are not remuneration and are not used to calculate the employers premium however the act does notdefine those costs nor does it set process for how the value of particular cost is to bedetermined the employer and the insurer should consider the estimated amount of overhead costs that the contractor would be required to expend or has expended in providing services other than labourthose costs might include tools equipment materials and plant if the employer and insurer are unable to come to reasonable assessment through examining invoices receipts or other documentary evidence of the amount the contractor will be required tospend or has spent then they may use the standard default percentages shown in the table belowthe percentages shown in the

is entitled to claim workers compensation benefits for work related injury or illness then any remuneration paid to that worker is counted when calculating theemployers premium trustees whether remuneration paid to the trustee is to be counted depends on whether the trustees are individuals including partnerships and sole traders in these cases they are generally not entitled to workers

generally be workers for workers compensation purposes so any amounts the trust paysto them are counted as remuneration 34individuals employed by the trustees any individuals who the trustees employs are covered by workers compensation and trustees are required to obtain workers compensation insurance covering those workers this is so even if the trusteeemploys beneficiaries who are not themselves trustees directors directors of trustee company are able to claim workers compensation benefits if they have work related injury therefore any distribution paid to them for the work they do may be
