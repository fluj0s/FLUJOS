summary interruptions of congressional operations by incidents such as episodic computer virus infections the 2001 anthrax contamination the february 2004 ricin incident and hurricane katrina in 2005 have demonstrated the importance of congressional continuity of operations coop planning coop planning refers to the internal effort of an organization to assure that the capability exists to continue essential functions in response to comprehensive array of potential operational interruptions for congress coop planning is related to second level of preparedness continuity of government cog planning congressional cog planning focuses on ensuring that congress is able to carry out its legislative responsibilities under article i of the constitution this report discusses the circumstances surrounding coop planning including provisions for alternative meeting sites and methods for conducting house and senate meetings and floor sessions when capitol facilities are not available this report does not discuss cog planning beyond its direct relationship to coop planning information and analysis about cog can be found in crs report rs21089 continuity of government current federal arrangements and the future and crs report rl31857 executive branch continuity of operations coop an overview the task of ensuring that congress can continue to carry out its constitutional responsibilities in case of disruption presents unique challenges in addition to the operational concerns common to most organizations one challenge involves the relocation of legislative activities at the beginning of the 108th congress measure was adopted to allow the house and senate to convene at place outside the district of columbia whenever they believe that such move is in the public interest in addition the rules of each chamber allow for committee activity beyond washington dc however concerns regarding the availability of appropriate alternative facilities communication and technical capabilities and providing the necessary physical security have arisen other challenges for congressional coop planning include maintaining member office information security and the legislative information system lis some of these concerns have been addressed through the deployment of an offsite alternate computing facility supported by the house senate and library of congress although current congressional coop planning began prior to september 11 2001 details surrounding house and senate coop planning are not public information and some specific material is excluded from this report to preserve operational security contingency planning in the house however has evolved over the past 25 years and there exists range of backup strategies for maintaining critical house

introduction the disruption of congressional field offices in the gulf coast region due to the effects of hurricane katrina the 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states and the reliance of many organizational functions on advanced information technology it applications have brought renewed attention to the need for organizations to engage in continuity of operations coop planning interruptions of congressional operations in washington dc and across the country through both natural and man made disasters have demonstrated that these concerns and needs extend to congress as well as to other private and public institutions some private sector activities can be relocated or reconfigured to respond to continuity threats by dispersing centralized facilities installing automated backup systems or maintaining excess capacity the task of ensuring that the 540 members of congress can continue to carry out their constitutional responsibilities in case of disruption presents unique challenges in addition to the operational concerns common to most organizations an attack against congress could result in loss of individuals critical to governance destroy important symbols of government and undermine the national sense of safety and security continuity of operations planning refers to the internal effort of an organization such as an office or department to assure that the capability exists to continue essential functions in response to comprehensive array of potential operational interruptions coop planning is an ongoing process that is driven in part by growth and change of information systems personnel and mission critical needs operational interruptions may include routine building renovation or maintenance mechanical failure of heating or other building systems fire inclement weather or other acts of nature or range of threatened or actual attacks other events that may interrupt congressional activity include failure of information technology it and telecommunications installations due to malfunction or cyber attack1 for congress these interruptions might affect an individual office building or the entire capitol complex as the anthrax incidents in the hart senate office building demonstrated recovery from these incursions may not be immediate and may require the relocation 1 cyber attack is an incursion on range of it facilities and can range from simply penetrating system and examining it for the challenge thrill or interest to entering system for revenge to steal information cause embarrassment extort money cause deliberate localized harm to computers or damage to much larger infrastructure such as telecommunications facilities crs2 of members of congress and congressional staff infrastructure and operations for prolonged periods of time for congress coop planning is related to second level of preparedness continuity of government cog planning cog planning involves the ability of an entire branch of government to carry out its functions congressional continuity of government planning focuses on ensuring that congress is able to carry out its legislative responsibilities under article i of the constitution in congress this can include preserving the line of succession to the presidency as well as establishing an alternative meeting site for congress2 third level of preparedness enduring constitutional government ecg which is not addressed in this report involves planning by the legislative executive and judicial branches of government to maintain the ability to assure the survival of the countrys constitutional representative form of government in the aftermath of catastrophic emergency coop and cog plans can be activated independently under most circumstances coop plan could be activated when there is cog threat however many believe that to ensure the ability of the legislative branch to provide essential services to citizens and carry out critical functions integration of the two types of planning is necessary to ensure the efforts developed under each plan will work together seamlessly when necessary this report discusses the circumstances surrounding congressional continuity of operations planning it also discusses the backup maintenance and portability of various administrative functions used to support congress such as legislative information email and the continuity of congressional information technology it and enterprise systems3 plans and details surrounding coop planning are not 2 under the presidential succession act 61 stat 380 3 usc 19 the line of presidential succession passes to the speaker of the house and president pro tempore of the senate if the president and vice president are unable to carry out their duties continuity of government

organizations than smaller ones an intranet an internal system of sharing data and software is an continued crs3 publicly available and some specific information is excluded from this report to preserve operational security this report does not discuss cog planning beyond its direct relationship to coop planning4 recent activities and challenges most if not all government institutions have had plans to restore operations or continue operations in the face of an emergency during the cold war congress itself established secret remote meeting site several hours removed from washington dc where it might reconvene and resume its constitutional responsibilities in the event of nuclear attack also over the last 20 years congress has worked to incorporate disaster recovery planning into its infrastructure and software upgrades and member state and district office operations coop planning prior to september 11 2001 current congressional coop planning began pursuant to joint bipartisan leadership directive5 issued on september 6 2000 directing the capitol police board6 to develop and manage comprehensive legislative branch emergency preparedness plan to facilitate this effort the board was to work with the attending physician and the chief us capitol police and in coordination with the officers of the senate and house to develop an integrated architecture which will address all hazards which could impede the continuity of essential legislative branch functions according to the directive this integrated architecture is to include at minimum emergency preparations response mitigation and stabilization activities and recovery operations congressional coop planning has been developed from the bottom up beginning with the identification of critical operational infrastructure and resources and creating plans to maintain those capabilities in the event of wide range of unforseen circumstances individual coop plans are activated by specific events that interrupt routine congressional operations and focus on restarting those operations the explicit goal of coop planning is to ensure that congressional operations can be performed under any circumstances the activation of coop plan by one or more offices in congress is law enforcement sensitive and is based 3 continued example of an enterprise computing system 4 for more comprehensive

directive to the united states capitol police board 6 the capitol police board is comprised of the sergeants at arms of the house and senate and the architect of the capitol crs4 on ongoing threat level assessment and the discretion of relevant officials because there is more than one way to interrupt congressional activity both house and senate planners are developing variety of contingency plans to respond to range of potential operational interruptions by design coop plans are meant to be living documents revised regularly on the basis of emerging issues and needs assessments component of this revision process includes congressional staff education and training to execute their responsibilities under their coop plans contingent congressional operations incidents comprehensive coop planning was already underway when in 2001 terrorists attacked the world trade center and the pentagon and later several congressional office buildings were closed due to anthrax contamination those events added sense of urgency to the planning process begun year earlier similarly impetus to refine planning for washington dcbased incident response planning came from incidents of ricin contamination in 2004 efforts to provide contingent support in the face of incidents in congressional state and district facilities grew from those initiatives and have been put into operation in response to the devastation of the gulf coast by hurricane katrina september 11 2001 on september 11 2001 following reports of the capitol being potential next target some units of the senate officers staffs activated their coop plans and cog plans were activated in the house and senate the leadership of both chambers was moved to an undisclosed secure location for briefings7 despite the evacuation of all congressional buildings including the capitol congressional offices and the library of congress the events of september 11 did not cause any lasting interruption of essential congressional operations in some cases members and staff were able to return to their offices and resume activity later in the day and both chambers were back in session on september 128 anthrax incidents and

available only to the congressional community and thomas continued crs8 copy office information and computer data including email and office websites resides in each office among information technology professionals the need for contingency planning for the preservation of enterprise information is an industry standard in member and committee offices the sensitive nature of the information suggests that data backup and recovery strategies will need to strike balance between control of the information and its relationship to comprehensive house wide data recovery plan in other matters of coop planning the house of representatives continues to consider options for relocating floor activities in the event that capitol facilities are unavailable member communications have been upgraded with the committee on house administration issuing blackberry wireless personal digital assistant to each representative the purpose of the device is to communicate critical information to members when other modes of communication may be inoperative24 in addition to it planning in light of the perception of heightened threat the house has made several internal administrative changes to address contingency planning in january 2002 an office of emergency planning preparedness and operations oeppo was created in the house pursuant to pl 107117 the office is responsible for house mitigation and preparedness operations crisis management and response and resource services and recovery operations the director of oeppo is jointly appointed by the speaker and minority leader in the summer of 2004 business continuity and disaster recovery unit was established in the office of the chief administrative officer cao of the house other coop issues including planning for the relocation of house committee and member office activities as well as the development of enhanced capabilities offered by secure offsite backup and retrieval of critical data have been deployed or are underdevelopment by house officers senate coop planning25 in response to the joint bipartisan leadership directive and guidance from the senate sergeant at arms the senates

and the sergeant at arms of the senate and other sources as noted crs9 of 2001 with implementation of the plan constituted in three phases the first phase involved the relocation of the senate chamber and support staff needed to carry out floor business the second phase focused on maintaining the operations of senate officers including the operational and technical infrastructure of the secretary of the senate and sergeant at arms the final phase involved ensuring the continued operation of member and committee offices as well as support entities such as the legislative counsel and the senate contingent of the capitol police senate coop plan incorporate and integrate individual contingency plans for each senator committee and administrative office under system of distributed decision making each senator or committee chair will have discretion to activate his or her office coop plan as events warrant each office has an office emergency coordinator oec responsible for developing and maintaining the plan in the event of an incident affecting their office the oec is responsible for implementing the plan several units of the secretarys office operated under their coop plans during the senate anthrax incident some offices would worked under contingency plans for few days during the incident while others plans were in effect for the duration of the hart building closure two such offices were the senate disbursing office which handles payroll operations and the stationery office which distributes office supplies the offices operated from other locations while the building was unavailable despite the relocation all senate staff were paid without interruption and office supplies were available throughout the senate during the three months the building was closed coop planning training as coop planning evolves from its initial phases into stable routine element of administrative operations in all senate offices the sergeant at arms has taken several steps to maintain coop planning across the senate initiatives include the establishment of an office of security and emergency preparedness within the sergeant at arms operation the publication of comprehensive emergency preparedness manual the roadmap to readiness26 and the initiation of emergency planning activities for member state offices washington dc staff plans for the relocation of the senate chamber were completed in 2002 and the senate sergeant at arms and secretary of the senate developed range of plans for maintaining congressional information and operations training for leadership committee and member offices to develop their own coop plans has also been completed under the direction of the committee on rules and administration the sergeant at arms and secretary of the senate trained leadership committee and member offices to write and complete coop plans during the spring and summer of 2002 coop plans are dynamic and must be reflect current operational conditions to ensure that individual office coop plans remain current 26 the roadmap to readiness is comprehensive guide designed to provide senate staff with the tools necessary to create security emergency action and continuity of operations plans for your members offices both in washington dc and in home states it also provides suggestion for the conduct of education and training of office staff to enable them to respond appropriately in an emergency and provides resources for obtaining more information the report is available through the senates intranet webster crs10 senate coop planning includes annual awareness training for committee and officer staffs additionally coop plan development training is integrated into training for newly elected senators and their staffs at the beginning of new congress state offices members offices may participate in coop planning through the continuity of operations planning system an online application provided by the sergeant at arms the webbased software facilitates coop planning through the use of interview questions about how user might want their office to function in continuity situation in addition to the formal coop planning processes the senate has issued blackberry personal digital assistants to every senator27 information technology managers in the sergeant at arms office have developed extensive systems for safeguarding data and electronic records and maintain remote storage of payroll personnel and purchasing information through an outside vendor responsibility for securing and backing up committee and member hard copy office information and computer data28 including email and office websites resides in individual offices the sergeant at arms provides data backup and recovery services upon request current issues and proposals as congress moves forward with its coop planning number of procedural logistical and technical issues arise some of these include the use of remote voting29 information security the compatibility between individual member committee and other congressional coop plans and replicating traditional activities in alternative environments although some of these issues can be addressed by thorough planning and testing by professional staff others such as the possibility of remote voting could require legislative or even constitutional responses relocating legislative activities since the establishment of the district of columbia as the national capital congress has been unable to use the capitol only once during the war of 1812 british troops burned the capitol forcing congress to meet elsewhere in washington dc for five years in response to the evacuations and closures of the capitol and house and senate office buildings in 2001 2002 and 2004 both chambers made alternative arrangements to conduct congressional business some 27 ed henry and paul kane blackberry anyone roll call daily nov 27 2001 28 variety of backup methods exist one common and relatively inexpensive method for backing up data is the use of recordable compact discs cdr or to memory sticks small rewritable storage media 29 remote voting can include range of technology systems that might facilitate voting by members who are not physically present on the house or senate floor the rules of both chambers assume that members will be present and do not allow remote voting conversely senate rules authorize committees to adopt rules for proxy voting paper based form of remote voting crs11 staff were able to communicate by wireless devices and email systems while others met in alternative office space or their homes although some members of congress met together informally neither chamber met in session outside the capitol during the cold war congress established remote meeting site under the greenbrier resort in white sulphur springs west virginia30 the facility was reportedly established to assist congress to carry out its activities away from washington dc in the event of nuclear attack the site was equipped with facilities for house of representatives and senate floor activities and large hall to accommodate joint meetings31 in the absence of national attack this facility was never used and has since been opened to the public for tours at this time there are current public proposals for the establishment of similar facility the current details of physically relocating congress are not publicly available congress has taken steps to authorize the relocation of floor activities and some proposals have been put forth regarding potential facilities for congress to use in an emergency under the rules of each chamber house and senate committee activity beyond washington dc is already permissible floor activity article i section 5 clause 4 of the constitution requires the consent of both the house and the senate to adjourn for more than three days or to meet at any other place than that in which the two houses shall be sitting as used in this section of the constitution place has long been held to be the seat of government which has been statutorily defined as washington dc since 194732 in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks and anthrax interruptions congress modified its adjournment resolutions to allow either chamber to reconvene at place and time designated by the speaker of the house and the majority leader of the senate whenever they determine the public interest shall warrant it on january 9 2003 soon after the 108th congress convened the house adopted hconres 1 regarding consent to assemble outside the seat of government the senate agreed to the measure on february 13 2003 the concurrent resolution authorizes the speaker of the house and the majority leader of the senate or their respective designees acting jointly and in consultation with the minority leaders of the house and senate to convene at place outside the district of columbia whenever they believe that such move is in the public interest some have suggested that in the event of an interruption that renders capitol hill facilities unusable congress move to the legislative buildings of nearby state 30 see httpwwwgreenbriercomabout_historyasp

facilities and resume operations from those locations33 administrative questions coop planners and policymakers may consider when reviewing the relocation of floor activities include for example what facilities are available in other locations for members staff and chamber officers such as the parliamentarians security officers and clerks what level of physical security exists in these facilities if congress chose to move to state legislative facilities what arrangements would be necessary if the state legislature needs to hold its own legislative sessions some may ask whether moving congress as whole to another location improves security or merely relocates terrorist target in practical terms what logistical and technical issues must be addressed so that relocated floor activity can be supported at an alternative site and within an accelerated timeframe how would members of congress and staff be informed to meet at the alternative site how would members of congress and staff be transported to the alternative site what if members of congress were unable to get to the alternative site due to travel restrictions or interruptions finally what advance arrangements would need to

circumstances as adopted by the house 305122 on july 28 2005 and the senate 964 on july 29 2005 the conference report to hr 2985 hrept 109189 included continuity in representation provision title iii of pl 10955 making appropriations for the legislative branch for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 requires that states36 in which vacancy exists in its representation in the house of representatives hold special election within 49 days37 following an announcement by the speaker of the house that because of extraordinary circumstances vacancies in representation from the states have exceeded 100 seats make determination of the candidates who will run in the special election ensure to the greatest extent practicable that absentee ballots for the election are transmitted to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters and accept and process any otherwise valid ballot or other election material from an absent uniformed services voter or an overseas voter38 additionally the events of september 11 2001 the subsequent anthrax incidents and the february 2004 ricin incident have highlighted some of the potential vulnerabilities of the centralized assembly of the nations lawmakers prompting some observers to suggest creating virtual or electronic congress econgress39 107th congress in the 107th congress 20012002 proposal hr 3481 was introduced to require the national institute of standards and technology nist to investigate the feasibility and costs of implementing computer system for remote voting and communication for congress to ensure business continuity for congressional operations the committee on house administration held hearings on econgress initiatives and other issues surrounding the continuity of congressional operations on may 1

proposed federal statutes for expedited election to the house in extraordinary circumstances by r eric petersen and sula p richardson 39 it is unclear exactly how an econgress would be constituted and operated some observers have offered some broad suggestions involving the establishment of website that members could access from anywhere in the country and perhaps the world proponents envision such website would enable members to carry out activities normally done on the chambers floors or in committees the possibility of convening an econgress raises number of procedural technical and resource questions some of which have not yet been addressed more complete discussion of issues raised by the development of an electronic congress can be found in crs report rs21140 emergency electronic

national academy of science and the librarian of congress to examine the feasibility and costs and the constitutional and procedural issues associated with the creation of an emergency electronic communication system for congress respectively in press release announcing his intention to introduce hr 3481 representative james langevin who sponsored both measures cited the importance of maintaining the effective operation of the nations highest lawmaking body as well as the need to learn from our mistakes and take the necessary steps to prepare for future threats to ensure that government can continue to conduct its business effectively40 108th congress in the 108th congress representative langevin re introduced the latter measure as hr 2948 which was referred to the

it was referred to the committee on rules and administration legislation related to an econgress or other form of congressional emergency communications is pending in the 109th congress member office information security continuity planners suggest that critical element of coop planning is to plan ahead and to develop clear understanding of what materials and information are most crucial to continuing operations if regular facilities are not available41 component in this planning is the preservation of critical information maintained in computer systems congressional offices that wish to retain control over their own data may prefer to develop their own plans for backup and subsequent recovery of critical information recorded on paper and electronic media information security professionals recommend making regular global backup of system files and data and more frequent daily backups of new and recently changed files this might include systematic scanning and retention of electronic images of irreplaceable paper documents42 backup copies then need to be stored in secure location other than 40 for the full text of the press release see httpwwwhousegovappslistpress

the advent of the socalled paperless office the blizzard of paper that accompanied the dust and debris with the collapse of the world trade center towers on sept 11 2001 suggests many organizations are still heavily dependent on their physical documents one company that did have comprehensive digital imaging system in place before sept 11 was empire blue cross blue shield developed over the past 10 years starting with claims forms the insurance carriers optical storage system continued crs15 the office where the original files are located for example member capitol hill offices could store backup copies in state or district offices and vice versa information security professionals also recommend additional actions such as maintaining series of regularly updated copies so that not all office data are lost in the event that particular backup copy is corrupted or otherwise compromised by virus defective media or other cause43 additional considerations as coop projects move forward planners may also continue to consider responses to the possibility of interruptions affecting critical operating systems and data such as communications the legislative information system lis and individual member computer resources an electronic interruption or cyber attack could manifest itself through the spread of computer viruses or worms it could also take the form of hackers gaining access to congressional computer systems or denial ofservice dos attacks on congressional web servers44 similarly another possibility is an attack physical or electronic or other interruption to major telecommunications switching station in the washington dc area which could significantly affect the congresss ability to communicate both internally and externally some of these vulnerabilities are being addressed through the implementation of wireless devices such as the blackberry as well as the establishment of congressional alternate computing facility jointly managed by the house senate and library of congress45 additional reading continuity of operations crs report rl32752 continuity of operations coop in the executive branch issues in the 109th congress by r eric petersen 42 continued
