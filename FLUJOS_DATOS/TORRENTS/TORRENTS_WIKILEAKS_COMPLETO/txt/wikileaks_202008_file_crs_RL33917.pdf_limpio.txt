2008 farm bill became law pl 110246 when the house and senate voted to override president bushs veto on june 18 2008 the conference agreement on the bill hr 2419 had b een enacted vetoed by the president and overridden pl 110234 but inadvertently excluded the trade title both chambers repassed the conference agreement with the trade title as hr 6124 it was again vetoed and again overridden as pl 110246 the 2008 farm bill contained forestry title and forestry provisions in other titles general forestry legislation is within the jurisdiction of the agriculture committees and past farm bills have included provisions addressing forestry especially on private lands most federal forestry programs are permanently authorized and thus do not require reauthorization in the farm bill the forestry title title viii of the 2008 farm bill amended the cooperative forestry assistance act of 1978 pl 95313 16 usc 21012114 in several ways it added national priorities for forestry assistance required statewide forest assessments created new community forest and open space conservation program to protect forests threatened with conversion to nonforest uses established new coordinating committee added an emergency forest restoration program and authorized competitive allocation for some forestry assistance funding the title also directed cooperation and collaboration with indian tribes amended the lacey act to restrict imports of illegally logged wood products authorized changes to certain national forest timber contracts and provided grants to hispanicserving institutions in addition it reauthorized and extended four existing programs other titles also contained provisions affecting forestry the conservation title title ii modified most programs to include forestry activities and directed the creation of infrastructure for environmental services markets including carbon ma rkets the trade title title iii included section requiring lumber importers to report on imports and fees paid to assure implementation of the 2006 uscanada softwood lumber agreement the energy title title ix included woody biomass in many programs finally the tax title title xv included provisions to authorize new taxexempt forest conservation bonds to modify income deductions for qualified timber income and to modernize and clarify the tax treatment of timber real estate investment trusts reits other forestry provisions were suggested by various interests and might be considered in the next farm bill funding is one issue as half the mandatory spending for the forest land enhancement program flep was cancelled and the program was not reauthorized protecting communities from wildfire continues to be priority for some while controlling invasive species is priority for others assisting forestdependent communities in diversifying their economies has also been debated finally some have expressed interest in trying to provide payments for ecosystem services forest

with agriculture legislation forestry programs have been addressed in past farm bills and other agriculture legislation this report provides brief background on the house and senate agriculture committees jurisdiction over forestry with examples of bills addressed by the committees it then presents information on the forestry provisions in the 2008 farm bill the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 organized by provisions in the forestry title and other provisions 1 it concludes with some forestry issues that were debated and that might be discussed in the next farm bill the appendix includes sidebyside description of the house senate and enacted provisions g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 both the house and senate committees on agriculture have jurisdiction over forestry in general and acquired national forests 2 thus the committees have been able to exert considerable influence over federal forestry activities over the years for example the forest and rangelands renewable resources planning ac t of 1974 rpa pl 93378 16 usc 1600 1614 and the national forest management act of 1976 nfma pl 94588 which guide forest service usfs planning and management were both initially referred to the agriculture committees more recently the healthy forests re storation act of 2003 pl 108148 16 usc 65016591 was referred to and reported by the agriculture committees in addition to forestry on federal lands the agriculture committees have jurisdiction over forestry research and forestry assistance to states and to private landowners 3 forestry research is governed largely by the forest and rangeland renewable resources research act of 1978 pl 95307 16 usc 16411647 which revised and updated the mcsweeneymcnary act of 1928 forestry assistance is governed largely by the cooperative forestry assistance act of 1978 cfaa pl 95313 16 usc 21012111 wh ich revised and updated the clarkemcnary act of 1924 both laws were referred to and reported by the agriculture committees recent farm bills have also included forestry provisions primarily addressing the forestry assistance programs the 1990 farm bill the food agriculture conservation and trade act of 1990 pl 101624 contained separate forestry title that created four new forestry assistance programs revised two existing forestry assistance programs amended two forestry assistance programs 1 the conference agreement on the 2008 farm bill was originally approved by the house and the senate as hr 2419 and vetoed by the president in may 2008 both chambers overrode the veto making the bill law pl 110234 however the trade title was inadvertently excluded from the enrolled bill to remedy the situation both chambers repassed the farm bill conference agreement including the trade title as hr 6124 the president vetoed the measure on june 18 2008 and both chambers again overrode the veto which made hr 6124 law as pl 110246 and superseded pl 110234 2 jurisdiction over national forests established

five special forestry research programs amended three existing forestry research programs authorized private nonprofit tree planting foundation and created new usfs branch international forestry the 1996 farm bill the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 pl 104127 included only few forestry provisions extending the authorization for the one expiring assistance program and adding new funding option within an existing program the 2002 farm bill the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl 107171 contained separate forestry title the conference could not resolve many of the differences between the house and senate forestry provisions and thus the conference report contained fewer provisions than either some of the disputed provisions were enacted subsequently in the healthy forests restoration act g22g145g142g561g344g342g342g350g561g8g152g155g142g156g157g155g162g561g22g146g157g149g142g561 numerous programs were created modified andor extended in the forestry title of the 2008 farm bill title viii the various provisions can be sorted into two groups provisions amending the cooperative forestry assistance act cfaa and other provisions

2008 farm bill modified several of the provisions adding new requirements authorizing new programs and spending and otherwise modifying forestry assistance programs one significant aspect of the 2008 farm bill was th lack of private forest landowner assistance program which the administration had proposed to terminate the forest land enhancement program flep was created in the 2002 farm bill it was not reauthorized and thus has expired flep funding ended earlier funds were borrowed for wildfire suppression small portion was repaid and other funds cancelled in the end only about half of the 100 million of mandatory spending enacted in 2002 was actually spent on the program this marks the first time since the cfaa was enacted in 1978 that such forest landowner financial aid program is authorized g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g18g155g146g152g155g146g157g146g142g156g561 the 2008 farm bill 8001 established new set of national priorities for federal assistance for private forest conservation it added new subsection to 2 of the cfaa 4 for more information on these programs see crs report rl31065 forestry assistance programs by ross w gorte

available under this act the secretary shall focus on the following national private forest conservation priorities notwithstanding other priorities specified elsewhere in this act 1 conserving and managing working forest landscapes for multiple values and uses 2 protecting forests from threats including catastrophic wildfires hurricanes tornados windstorms snow or ice storms flooding drought invasive species insect or disease outbreak or development and restoring appropriate forest types in response to such threats 3 enhancing public benefits from private forests including air and water quality soil conservation biological diversity carbon stor age forest products forestryrelated jobs production of renewable energy wildlife wildlife corridors and wildlife habitat and recreation thus the 2008 farm bill requires that forestry assistance aim to conserve working forests protect and restore forests and enhance public benefits from private forests

statewide assessment of forest resource conditions trends threats and priorities to receive federal forestry assistance funds each state also must prepare strategy for addressing the identified threats and describe the resources needed to address those threats the states were to prepare the initial assessment and strategy with updates as needed and to coordinate with specified agencies and groups the secretary may use up to 10 million annually for fy2008fy2012 of appropriated forestry assistance planning funds to assist states with their assessments and strategies

acquire lands threatened by conversion to nonforest uses and that provide economic environmental educational and recreational benefits and serve as models of sustainable forest stewardship for other landowners the grants may be up to 50 of the acquisition cost with the authorization for such sums as are necessary this program is similar to the forest legacy program which authorizes the federal acquisition or grants to states for their acquisition of lands or easements on lands threatened by conversion to nonforest uses

reauthorization of the many agriculture programs is prime reason for the periodic farm bills but most forestry programs are permanently authorized this may reduce the pressure to include forestry title in upcoming farm bills nonetheles s interest groups have raised various forestry issues other than the authorization levels for possib discussion within future farm bill such as forestry assistance funding wildfire protection invasive species economic diversity and markets for ecosystem services that have not traditionally been marketed g8g152g155g142g156g157g155g162g561g3g156g156g146g156g157g138g151g140g142g561g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 federal funding for forestry assistance programs has generally been rising but the increase has not been spread equally among the various programs since the severe 2000 fire season and the development of the national fire plan funding for cooperative fire programs assistance to states and volunteer fire departments has risen substantially more than triple pre2000 funding and has remained at very high levels funding for forest legacy acquisition of lands or easements on lands threatened with conversion to nonforest uses has also risen substantially from less than 4 million in fy1998 to 50 million or more annually since fy2001 and request of 100 million for fy2005 in contrast the administration has proposed terminating funding for the economic action program economic assistance to rural forestdependent communities and funding has fallen from peak of 54 million in fy2001 to less than 5 million in fy2008 with funds in fy2007 the adequacy of funding for private landowner assistance programs has been concern for many these programs have provided costshares to qualified landowners for various forestry practices that increase tree growth improve wildlife habitat protect watersheds thus improving water quality and more one of the changes enacted in the 2002 farm bill was to replace two programsthe forestry incentives program fip and the stewardship incentives program sipwith the forest land enhancement prog ram flep because funding for fip and sip had been discretionary and either stagnant fip or absent sip flep was given mandatory funding through the commodity credit corporation of 100 million total through the end of fy2007 however some flep funds were borrowed to pay for firefighting and other funding was cancelled in total about half of the 100 million guaranteed for flep was actually spent on landowner assistance even the existence of landowner costshare assistance is in doubt forestry is included in many conservation programs that provide financial assistance to private landowners but flep was not reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill for the first time since 1978 forestryspecific landowner assistance program is authorized some question whether modest forestryspecific assistance program is needed since small share of the much larger conservation programs might provide more forestry assistance funding nonetheless congress may revisit the issue of separate funding for forest landowner assistance programs

focused on high biomass fuel levels particularly in federal forests and on homes in or near atrisk forests an area known as the wildlandurban interface wui12 the 2002 farm bill 8003 created new community and private land fire assistance program to assist communities and private landowners in planning and other activities to protect themselves from wildfires the program was authorized at 35 million annually through fy2007 and such sums as are necessary thereafter the usfs has included such expenditures as authorized activities in its state fire assistance program however congress has not appropriated funds explicitly for this program protecting private lands and structures from wild fires continues to garner congressional attention as the threat of wildfire persists how to assist private landowners and communities how to combine this assistance with other assistance and incentive programs and how to fund such assistance could be debated in the farm bill context

resources in some of these areas one resource eg timber minerals livestock has traditionally dominated the local economy but the economies of such areas can be devastated when that resource is

can occur when dominant economic sector is depressed the national forestdependent rural communities economic diversification act of 1990 was enacted in 23722379 of the 1990 farm bill to authorize

examined the possibilities of finding ways to compensate landowners for continuing to provide ecosystem services16 one means would be to develop such markets and the 2008 farm bill included provision
