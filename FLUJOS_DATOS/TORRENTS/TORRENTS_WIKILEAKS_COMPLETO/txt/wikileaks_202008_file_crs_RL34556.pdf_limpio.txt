the propriety of the number of deaths in detention as reliable measure of standard of care lead to the policy question of which measures would provide insight into the adequacy and quality of care finally an overarching debate on this issue concerns the appropriate standard of health care that should be provided to foreign nationals in immigration detention th is debate is especially emotional because of the balancing act between basic human rights and the cost of health care when us citizens also face barriers in accessing health care95 spending on detainee health care96 concerns about the
