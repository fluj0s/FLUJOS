period cchs auditing lecture given on 23 june 1961 thank you okay well we have arrived at friday and i think the last time i looked it was the 24th wasnt it the 23rd it just shows you you start looking at the time track and telling where youll land all right well here we go what questions do we have today oh boy im happy you really got it taped oh man im happy youve got it really taped voice i had question of at what age would one give joburgs at what age can one give joburgs well ill tell you that below thirteen or fourteen special joburg should probably exist and it should probably go down to the age of about six and then another one should exist down to the age of about three and it should be compartmented in that direction joburg would simply stir up kid under twelve on the whole track okay female voice yes thank you very much all right any other question yes another female voice will properly assessed havingness command ever cause the needle to tighten say within the first eight commands and then loosen well youre asking would properly assessed havingness command first cause the needle to tighten and then loosen what you are looking at is what will tighten havingness needle and what tightens havingness needle is an arc break your havingness is working on tuesday just dandy and on wednesday it suddenly tightens the needle well it isnt necessarily true that the havingness process is now defunct it is true that the havingness process is being run against an arc break and your rudiments arent clean on it thats all and it will make the havingness process look momentarily invalid there is another method by which this happens havingness process run too long creates an arc break and you start running havingness process fifteen twenty thirty commands about that time your pc if he has any inkling that this is wrong develops an arc break and the havingness needle tightens at that moment and the overrunning of havingness process then will tighten the needle now in case where it tightens and loosens what you had is pc with rudiment out and the havingness took care of it and youre looking at this kind of spooky situation where you didnt really realize what was going on you get the idea havingness needle however your stable datum on this is the havingness process has been running and now suddenly doesnt run two things are wrong could be wrong the first one is the most common that you have rudiment out and you are actually merely distracting somebodys attention madly and it upsets him so so much for that you got it but an arc break will tighten the havingness needle the other method by which happens of course is the havingness process has expired thats less seldom and in fact its sufficiently rare that you should always suspect the arc break okay female voice is it ever unusual for as case gets advanced the exactly right havingness process will tend to repair their havingness in just two or three commands oh yes female voice and run any longer than that will then suddenly well thats why ive said eight to twelve female voice yeah commands that is very safe and their havingness actually repairs with great speed the havingness will repair on one command female voice thats what im thinking of yeah okay i wouldnt trust it id still go on running it five eight commands female voice mmhm okay female voice yeah all right okay any other questions you know lot of you people that just arrived i know theres an awful lot of things you dont know yet and youre sitting there being very very quiet about it is this quietness symptom of you dont know enough to ask question here all right its case of im afraid you dont know what you dont know yes female voice i know something that i dont know on what you talked about yesterday on running the cchs 1 2 3 and 4 did you say you should run each one twenty minutes and then shift to the next one and on and on and then you know twenty minutes of 1 twenty minutes of 2 twenty minutes of 3 twenty minutes of 4 and then start over again hmm female voice and on and on and then i say female voice well im asking thats the way it works female voice i know thats her job go on female voice id like to have it run on go on female voice and then you do that for an hour and then you shift to an hour of joburg and then back again to the cchs for an hour uhuh uhuh uhuh this is why they dont ask questions is because i scold them and chop them up see female voice ive seen it recently in auditing will you straighten out all right its one for one which is if you have run two and half hours of cchs or five hours of cchs you should do two and half hours or five hours worth of the other but you dont ever expect anything to happen with cchs running them for whole auditing period of whole hour cchs are not an endurance contest this question has too many ramifications in the first place it infers too many things you have said if you run the cchs twenty minutes and then twenty minutes and then twenty minutes my god my god see thats what im saying about see dont run the cchs twenty minutes apiece run flat cch only twenty minutes and if it is flat now get that one right because boy you can lay an awful egg with the cchs see got it get that one real good you run cch that is flat for only twenty minutes its got to be flat for twenty minutes before you leave it now if cchs are not biting then you discover this oddity that youll be running cch for twenty minutes and the next cch for twenty minutes but thats only if theyre not biting you got that female voice yes yes female voice but i dont have it real well all right now your cchs are run only so long as they produce change and longer and they are run constantly that they produce change now your cch is run as long as it produces change now have you ever had cchs in the academy female voice ahhhh heres whats happening were going up against battery of processes which are unknown female voice i have had cchs run on all of them oh but youve got to be trained in running cchs assign somebody to train her running cchs okay because theres lot more to it than having them run yeah now cch must be run as long as it produces change and you cannot get auditing compartmented into time brackets without observation which is what i see the tendency is here and we mustnt do that we audit pc and the only reason we say twenty minutes is because that is the period of observation that is safe thats safe period of observation thats not too long thats not too short got it all right now when period of twenty minutes has elapsed without any change if we exceed that the pc feels he is being punished hes doing the auditing command and hes apparently being punished for doing the auditing command by the auditing command continuing to be run on him as though then he is not doing it right the biggest danger in running cchs is invalidation of the pc and to run an unflat process flat is not an invalidation but to run flat process consistently and continually operates as an invalidation and the only trouble weve ever had with the cchs is an invalidation of the pc now the way that cch 3 and 4 can be run would stand your hair on end lets supposing we didnt have that little clause in there of did you do that on 3 and 4 you see the idea of asking the pc if the pc has done it get the idea all right now supposing that we had the auditor this is whats happened countless times weve had the auditor deciding whether or not the pc did it and immediately the cchs become totally unworkable as matter of fact that was the first great invalidation of the cchs and why we tended to come off of them slightly the cchs were working just wonderfully until all of sudden bunch of people got ahold of the cchs and they would make motion with the book which the devil himself couldnt complicate and which they themselves couldnt have followed immediately afterwards and theyve said to the pc now you didnt do that you know in effect and grabbed the book back and take the thing away into the air and give it to the pc and pooh you know ive watched it man i mean its grim the auditor takes the book and goes flipflop and hands it to the pc and the pc takes the book and goes flipflop and the auditor sighs and takes the book back from the pc and does the same flipflop again and the pc takes the book and goes flipflop and the auditor sighs and takes the book and then i finally would say to the auditor if i was observing it what the hell is wrong with you the pc did it oh yes but the title is reversed when he does it and you say man just knock off of this auditing and go get audited will you but its just using the mechanism of invalidation mechanism of invalidation all right pc if theyre invalidated while running the cchs tend to go nnnnn and it can be done by an auditor he can actually invalidate the pc by misrun of the cchs theyve got to be pretty flagrant but we ask the pc then did you do that or are you satisfied with that youve gone flipflop with the book and the pc scratches the back of his neck with it and say did you do that and the pc looks at you cunningly and says yeah i did it all right and you take the book away from him thats all right youre through youve had it and you do another motion its whether the pc thinks he did it and you would be absolutely amazed gazing into the quicksand and morass that some people call mind what they think they have done and what they think they have observed its marvelous do you know that some 20 percent of the people who are walking around in the streets right this minute never see wall and never see curb ceiling or person they only see their own facsimiles of the wall curb and person they put them up here driving automobiles and give them medals for killing everybody they cant even see the object they see facsimile of the object and you very often will see this cease to exist in the cchs youll all of sudden say the person will say this wall is terribly bright there doesnt seem to be anything between and the wall well man thats right hitherto theyve looked at picture of the wall that was on the wall and they see the picture and theres the wall now heres one of the things you can have somebody do you say theres bird going tweettweet outside and you say all right now make picture of that bird out there now bring it in and look at it what is it they say its crane and they hear an automobile going by in the street and you say now put out picture you know make picture of that automobile now bring it in the room and look at it and what is it and they say steamboat they say what the hell is wrong with actually they will get the facsimile theyre stuck in duplicated if they do that now that symptom goes forward considerably further it goes forward to the fact that the person doesnt ever see the wall or the carpet or the ceiling or the floor or anything he sees picture that he has made which he has interposed between him and it you can generally detect this person because their depth perception is fantastic awful bad you know they run into walls and door sides and so forth and then they go to the oculist and get fitted with specs and then they run into more doors and more windows of course the specs dont help you to see facsimiles they never see anything you see all right now you take that person now hes very easily invalidated because why is he doing this he makes facsimile of the wall and looks at his facsimile of the wall because it is not safe to look at walls in other words this fellow is nervous he is upset he is hes quivery you see hes real shaky about the physical universe so this things liable to bite him at any minute you know and lions and tigers would be quite an wouldnt be unusual at all to have them just jump out of the fireplace at any minute you know or suddenly materialize from nowhere and this sort of things liable to happen now he starts to get spark of confidence you see in actually having observed you and then he did it now this tells him hes in communication with you he must have seen something otherwise he couldnt duplicate something so the auditor begins to be real all right now the auditor says you didnt do that in some way of course the auditor ceases to be real at once because the fellows whole protective mechanisms go up and he thereafter makes pictures of the auditors and he cant do the auditing command and it all goes to pieces dont you see in the first place all youre trying to do is convince him the auditor is real now if the auditor becomes part of the dangerous environment by tending to invalidate the pc by overrunning process the process is perfectly flat the pc to the best of his knowledge and belief has done it for long time all right yet the auditor continues to run the process the auditor is tending to say to the pc it isnt all right so the pc all of sudden doesnt know whats all right and the pc gets nervous and doesnt want to come to the next session and so forth this is all auditor invalidation of the pc all these various mechanisms occur to retard the use and operation of the cchs now if you know those basic mechanisms you know why youre running the cchs which the basic goal of the cch is to make the auditor the physical universe and present time real to the pc to show him that he can observe the auditor the auditing room and present time thats all its doing see it isnt doing anything really more significant its familiarizing with these things but it uses these various mechanisms of duplication and so on on up the line auditing commands the control of the auditor the communication of the auditor all these various things all add up to additives so that this reality on the auditor and the auditing room by the cchs far exceeds anything you would get this way look at am i here all right thats good now look at the wall is that there ah thats fine now weve run thousand hours of the cchs you see its justit wouldnt work thats all because there isnt enough duplication and there isnt enough anything now lets take this fellow that were gradually bringing out of his chrysalis hes getting fairly confident hes getting downright cocky about it and hes giving you his hand and we dont look adequately at whats going on in his mind actually one of the first things he knows very often is that you dont exist or that you are figment of his imagination or something of this sort and all of sudden he says hey it begins to be very very evident to him that there is somebody else alive and that there is an otherdeterminism somewhere in the universe and his scarcity on otherdeterminisms is fantastically low that is the scarcest scarce people get so they even start mocking up thetan bedbugs to keep him company at night and so forth and they dont know any other determinism exists anyplace but through the process of the cchs you get this condition finally appears that somebody else exists and that universe is here and thats the only result youre going to get out of the cchs now at any time that you introduce into it this factor is i may be real but boy youre sure be wishing in minute you hadnt found it out this room may be getting awfully real to you but well just make it as horrible as we can because its really youre really not doing right you know youre doing wrong now this is how you can run the cchs wrong now any time you settle down to timed routine that has nothing to do with the pc youre in instant trouble instant and immediate trouble we know more or less on the average what the safe margins of anything are but i will tell you that twenty minutes is an awfully long time for child its safe for an adult but its quite long time for child whose attention span may very well be only ten minutes and the child in the course of that twenty minutes may get to feeling terribly invalidated theyre doing their level best to give you their hand and be obliging and theyre liable to feel terribly invalidated so as you shut down the line in age when youre running it on child well call it something like seven or eight minutes and if the child did the process consistently seven or eight minutescall it 75 if you want to be precisethe child wont feel invalidated female voice i find big difference in children timewise hm female voice i found that there was tremendous difference in how long was long enough between children i ran it on two different children age three give that hand and one just did real well for about twenty minutes and the other one about six minutes was and then what happened female voice well then he just fell clear clear clear apart and then what did you do female voice and then i just kept on and kept on yeah female voice but i only after that i shortened the length of the sessions but for the first time i stayed with it for the time the whole twenty minutes that i had done with the other child after that when i arranged the time i made shorter times and he did better after that shorter times for what female voice like ten minutes for the process changing or the process being unchanged female voice for running the process id say oh man look look look look look were talking you just better talk this over with mary sue because you got this backwards and inside out i see that clearly because look you dont run cch by the clock you run it on the pc its the pcs change that determines this now youre talking about ten minute flat area before the process begins to bite ixnay there is flat area before the process begins to bite female voice thats not what i was talking about huh female voice i was talking about length of sessions oh the length of session thats incredibly short thats nowhere if you run the cchs if you dont run the cch that is biting at least an hour the kid practically spins in female voice on three year old huh female voice on three year old oh man teach her another voice good teach her some fundamentals here were discussing them now okay i imagine now listen youll do better with them if you run them right okay all right i didnt mean to invalidate you for asking question but it makes nervous sometimes when i see how far off these processes can get cch on child that is only run for ten minutes the auditor ought to be shot if its biting you see and the auditor quits the process at the end of ten minutes oh man hes giving the kid something like headache for the rest of the day or something like this or hes driven the kid into some of propitiative state cch has to be run that is biting actually has to be run for about an hour at least before anything could be expected to occur you got it female voice okay all right okay all right any arc break female voice all right female voice thats why i came all right okay any other question all right now lets take look at auditing in general shall we auditing in general is an activity which is engaged upon by an auditor on pc and it is regulated and monitored in its attack and approach by the pc behavior of first thing that establishes what you do as an auditor is the pcs condition what has just come out in bulletin is not what establishes what you do with the pc its the pcs condition that establishes what you should do with the pc but in view of the fact that tremendous width of randomity activity and upset can occurtremendousyou have to have standardization because you get too many ideas mixed up in what youre doing in the way of auditing and the clear view of what happens or should happen in auditing tends to go fizzle and has for about eleven years particularly in california dear old california we just had another blowup today out in california so you neednt feel bad johannesburg so anyhow there are certain things that work and there are certain things that dont work now when youve had as much work put in on what works and as much understanding and research background as has been invested in this particular activity you cant help but come up with some right answers so there are right things to do with pcs and there are wrong things to do with pcs and if you dont know the fundamentals ill lay you thousand golden sovereigns to crooked halfpenny that you wont pull any of the right ones because the laws of averages if they were so rigged that pcs or patients or people would have become clear or well in the last fifty thousand years on this planet if the laws of averages would take care of it it would have happened and we can show you clearly that it has not happened so therefore random running will not get anybody anyplace that you can make pretty sure of now we have to know first and foremost how the mind goes together man didnt appreciate this before he was busy trying to save the thing and send it to heaven or he was trying to get it nullified or he was trying to get various things and he was working with the spirit and from time to time did work with the spirit and he got place we probably got further in 1952 to 55 on the subject of exteriorization than man had ever gotten before and we learned quite bit about it and one of the things is is the sudden change of exteriorization is such sudden change that it deteriorates rapidly as condition quite remarkable how fast it deteriorates we can do today all of the things we did then you can blow people out of their heads and suddenly have them talking when they stuttered before and have them seeing when they couldnt see before and all kinds of weird odd phenomena occur but these things are all unstable phenomena i spent some time trying to stabilize these phenomena and make them into something that was highly useful and then i found out that before thetan can experience sudden change like the total loss of his body he has to be up to being able to have body first before he can walk out of body hes got to be able to have one and the people who most easily present themselves to be bunged out of their heads are people who wouldnt have anything to do with body if you paid them the person who wants nothing to do with the body at all exteriorizes at the drop of skunk all youve got to do is say to this person phhff and there they are heading past arcturus now how the buddhist the lamaist missed this i dont know but he patently knows nothing about it the mystery of the east has been exploded man anybody who would be stupid enough to sit still for twenty years and regard his navel so as to exteriorize should have his thetan examined you dont have to sit still for twenty years get somebody to say to you something on the order of the first exteriorization process is try not to be three feet back of your head whammmm there they go you know well buddhism is accomplished that was the end of track as far as buddhism is concerned and that one little set of english words took care of everything they were trying to hand out oh yes they were also trying to hand out peace peace on you too brother and so forth they were trying to hand out various other principles which got into other religions and we had people being quiet and the whole subject is devoted to how to keep people quiet its police operation whole track police operation youre always getting space jockeys and spaceopera people who are sailing in saying lets see how are we going to quiet this down these people are moving these people are dangerous they move they walk around and they whistle and they sing and they move and therefore theyre liable to do things so the thing wed better do is introduce some peaceful philosophy of some kind or another thatll just stop all this tendency toward motion thats fact and you get things like buddhism christianity the quiet philosophies i call them and of course how quiet can you get dead and you might say its covert effort to kill everybody off and its true that if you get somebody falling totally well i can trace the background in some pcs that have done so the most amusing concatenation you ever had anything to do with say well when did you begin to feel bad and the pc says oh about 1941 something like that i began to feel kind of bad i was young then but i began to feel kind of bad and so on what happened then well uh nothing much happened i just felt that id you know well it was about that time i felt id rather id better take it easy i might do things and i might you know kind of put myself under restraints little bit because something had happened then that was quite dangerous and quite upsetting and so forth and yes i became quieter i matured youll find these spots of sudden change of pace to be the spots which broke the persons life those sudden changes of pace and what do you find sitting in the midst of them all kinds of collisions and upsets and accidents most of which resulted in the advice take it easy now and you will be all right whether they gave it to themselves or it was given to them exteriorly they got the idea that if they just took it awful awful easy theyd be all right and from that time on they were all wrong they were all wrong and they could not figure out from there on what was wrong with them they were being asked to confront motionlessness and man has rather difficult time confronting motionlessness as any spaceopera boy can tell you all you have to do is persuade somebody to be totally motionless and to take it easy and hes had it he gets sick his life goes wrong he ceases to be able to communicate he has an awful time afterwards so therefore these philosophies that wait for fellow to hit disaster so they can then tell him to take it easy are all of them very much in use and very active use on the part of people who mean nothing well for man now amongst those philosophies are included medicine and psychiatry the reason they give drugs is so that the person will be quiet the reason they give electric shocks is so the person will be quiet the reason they do prefrontal lobotomies is so the person will be quiet lot of the times the reason they give medical operation is so the person will be quiet you never heard of so many reasons why people should be quiet well unless person can confront motion hes had it hes dead and done for that is your first condition of life and livingness if person cannot confront motion at all he cant work and you have the background of criminal youve automatically made criminals and dont wonder that the whole roman criminal population joined the church masse they did and dont wonder at all these fellows who have just gotten out of stir and who have suddenly embraced religion natural consequence its the motionless philosophy adopted by somebody who cant move i dare say if you held somebody in straps in chair or up against wall or in bed any undetermined length of time you would eventually find hed gotten religion or hed become buddhist or almost anything and you never would have had to have talked to him about the philosophy at all if hed never heard of it on the whole track he would probably invent it you see this all youd have to do is introduce the factor of motionlessness into his life prove to him that movement was bad and youve had it the reason we are having more and more accidents and the reason i resigned i think last week from the road safety committee in england was because all propaganda in all teachings will wind up in more accidents and i cant go along with something that is as stupidly destructive as that there is emphasis on deleting the fellow who cant drive before they license him there is emphasis on putting on the road cars that can travel on the road there is emphasis in trying to take the trucks and passengers and freight off the roads and put them back onto the railways where they belong part of any of this program makes any sense because its deteriorated into teach them to be quiet dont drive so fast i doubt speed has very very much to do with it because you start looking at accident tallies and youll find its mostly the old ladies who were driving safely in the middle of the road at ten miles an hour now your general situation then is that philosophy of quietness of motionlessness has been introduced into this sphere of reducing traffic accidents and with great certainty the more this philosophy is introduced the more criminal actions will occur on the highway driving will get worse and accident statistics will rise and thats just about all there is to it there isnt anything further to it than that the more you make populace quiet and non motionless the greater crime rate you will have the influence of tv for instance on the general crime rate around the world has been remarked upon many times but the program material is what is being blamed not that the child is being pinned motionless and that is whats happening i dont care if you showed them little orphan annie sighing over the dog in just one pose on nonmoving picture and so forth with maybe some violin music playing in the background and if this was all there ever was on tv and the children still sat in front of tv at an active time of life when they should be moving youll get higher crime rate its inevitable see all youve got to introduce is motionless you get aberration because youre preventing people from taking over the situation now ill give you something interesting with regard to this talking about how the mind works i very busily spent my hobby time which has now become my hobby time now has become relegated between 300 and 700 am thats the rest of my day you see and ive lost any time much to sleep in now and im now trying to find some sleeping time and i think theres another time track around here someplace so that ill take care of that anyway last night up at about three oclock four oclock i was studying some pictures for boat on this theory that people get seasick because of motion that was the theory and i went along blindly with this not on inspection or examination at all because man who has had lot of time at sea and so on tends to become rather conservative about the sea in other words its this way and thats the way it is you know and everybody has said that it is motion which has caused seasickness so therefore i thought itd be an awfully good idea to put tween decks and in peoples cabins and in the dining salon and so forth pictures of very quiet scenes that that would be the thing you see if you put some pictures of very quiet scenes around nice pleasant quiet still scenes person who feels queasy could look at one and feel better so i spent some time looking in some various publications for which advertised prints you see and old masters and things like this for some proper pictures in order to take care of this condition there are various things its like the sweep of light back and forth across the ceiling reflected from the waves outside and all of this sort of thing is what has been blamed for seasickness so i went ahead and i chose all of these pictures which were very silent pictures they were very motionless pictures they were very unmoving pictures and i was sitting there at my table up in my bedroom looking over all these pictures and thinking about all the seasickness this was going to save you know and after little while i started to get little bit seasick and i wasnt quite seasick i felt an odd constriction on the front of my body and i wondered what is this all about and along about 355 i had to revise this whole theory so the list although its been picked up now and the pictures will probably all get bought ill have to give half of them to the medical association about 355 i realized what this was all about that if you gave people pictures of motion it would give them chance to sort of accustom themselves to the idea of motion but if you gave them stillness you gave them total motion of the ship and sea against the total nomotion of the picture and they practically would have had it youve given them terrific thing and boy have you pinned them aboard that ship if i want to keep crew all ive got to do is put up those motionless pictures because here will be the horizon going up and down like mad you see and inside the vessel here will be all these pictures of stern solid oak trees standing there you see one was called dawn it was an oak tree reflected in the mirrorstillness of river at dawn and boy that picture was really quiet and when i first picked it out i says well thats going to take some girl or scientologist thats aboard at the present moment and theyll look at that and theyll say thank god for the tree you see sir much kinder to give them racing sloop throwing spray in all directions dont you see much kinder because they at least get chance to look at the motion in pictorial form and it gives them gradient got the idea yeah the cure for motion is motion not stillness well thats quite interesting as an observation has nothing much to do with this or you but there it is i got good reality on the thing and of course after id looked over several of these pictures of days of adventure and theres one ship of about 1757 just shooting the living daylights out of another ship you see and her sails are all full of holes and the decks on fire in couple of spots and so on and cannon balls flying all over its good enough so as you can practically hear them whistle you know and i looked at that after looking at all these still pictures you know and i looked at that and i said whooo and instantly ceased to feel little seasick got the idea so the philosophies of motionlessness are not safe philosophies to imbibe because they lead people toward illness and inability to work criminality and an inability to control their environments philosophies of motion on the other hand have not necessarily led to noncriminality witness space opera show an honest rocket jockey who has never bombarded planet in loose moment and who has never raped town and ill show you somebody thats never been on the whole track hes just never been on the whole track we dont know where hes been for the last few hundred trillion years but hes the worship of motion the worship of speed and the worship of motion itself is guarantee because there are periods of rest between them if you could keep it up at the speed of light from there on out youd probably never be affected by motion but how about going quiet between them i remember every time submarine crew used to come in they used to put them to rest they used to give them rest and i know my mother used to come up and typewriter keys and file cabinets and so forth would be flying out of my studio left and right and some circus music would be playing on the tape recorder and it would be noisy you know and active and she would come up and she would look at and she would say i really think you ought to take rest you are look working much too hard and i used to wonder now i wonder if shes got an operation going here somehow or another i wonder if there could possibly be an operation connected with this and there was there was never affected very much because she actually never talked to very much but id notice that people that didnt quite like quite ordinarily are advising to get some rest check it over i think you yourself will have subjective reality on that sort of thing now as soon as you become incapable of handling the shift and change of things you become incapable of withstanding the duress of life and begin to experience pain and the experiencing of pain is actually comes about after one has lost tolerance for motion if you want to know why somebody is hurting as youre running process you are running out their intolerance for motion now you can run motion or you can run nomotion or you can run what you please along these various lines but motion which is predictable motion of course is betterthats from the pcs point of view to unpredictable motion so unpredictable motion is something that is intolerable and the person doesnt know what to confront something is happening in front of his face and then something happens behind his face and he doesnt know which of these things to confront and he gets into fine state of affairs but first he must consider that there is something unconfrontable about it or that it is bad not to be able to confront everything at once and as soon as he gets the idea that it is bad not to be able to confront everything at once he starts to butter all over the universe and stick on the track and experiences and all this sort of thing begin to occur now theres another phenomenon which occurs about the mind is every time person has been hit hard by life and he could be hit hard because he has hit others and he now gets the motivator for his overts and so on as soon as hes been hit hard or as soon as he begins as they did in arslycus program for coercing people into working harder well you get how that is working harder that means you produce more or you will be shot you know that kind of thing the russian philosophy you get people will obsessively start producing production follows defeat production follows defeat germany and italy have outstripped all other european countries in the production of goods just in the last few years that is because they were the defeated countries and the countries that won the war dont much now look like it and thats result of defeat this is rather consistent any defeated area can be counted on to produce and any defeated person can be counted upon to be putting up more bank than person who feels victorious bank and reactive mind is the result of failures or defeats so youre eradicating mechanically on the one hand persons intolerance of motion or their intolerance of motionlessness and on the other side youre eradicating their failures or defeats and between the two of these things the bank disappears just that the bank disappears now today we dont erase bank the bank is not erased person is as we did at the beginning accustomed into not needing one takes over the automaticity of creation in other words one way or the other he takes over the automaticities of doingness and we have beingness the person he should be in order to survive we have doingness what he ought to be doing in order to get creation or do creation or something of the sort and we have havingness which is the result of creation havingness is apparently more important because its harder to arrive at but you can see from the rationale is the result of defeat thats not philosophic ambiguity most havingness is the result of defeat of some kind or another man couldnt walk on water so he began to push logs out into the surf see and we get the whole cure sequence so that everything in the universe practically is cure for past failures quite remarkable but very true now in addition to that we have another factor which enters into the situation and that is that every goal is the immediate and direct result of not having done so we get these various combinations of intolerance for motion the feelings of defeat and your next one up the line of course is your ability to have without having defeated and if you can remedy those various things in somebodys mind you have then produced completely new being he is not the same as an old being who has never had the experience hes not somebody who has been in plastic container for the last two hundred trillion you see hes been over the jumps now his knowingness his knowledge of what has happened all the way along the line doesnt leave him he still knows but the consequences of having done with renewed ability to do makes him of course not virgin that has drifted along for couple of hundred trillion now and is innocent and steps out of the auditing room as shy giggly girl would or something like this that is not the condition in which he emerges he emerges in the rather interesting condition of totally rehabilitated hardbarnacled warrior who is veteran of innumerable campaigns but doesnt show any of the marks of any of them and thats an interesting state of beingness and when we say clear we are actually saying about the weakest statement we could make on what we are doing see we just its very weak description of what we are really doing but the other description would be far far too frightening im sure i heard fellow say one time gee when i think of my days back there in high school coeducational establishmentwhen i think of all those pretty girls and if id known then what i know now oh wow you know wow you know interesting interesting point of view because youre setting somebody up who theoretically would know then what he knows now so he knew it now then but hed carefully forgotten it all because he knew what he was liable to do his best mechanism was to become stupid thats fine mechanism isnt it thats very fine mechanism you at the same time dont get the tremendously dangerous situation of the fellow who is has high level of wisdom messing up an area in which he is in he doesnt i tell you if this fellow knowing all he knew on the subject of the second dynamic were to appear in high school amongst all those girls they would probably from there on all live better lives thats probably the net result of the introduction of such situation because the fellow doesnt have the covert aspect of criminality hinging on every action you know oh he might get in trouble but nobody would get him in trouble very thoroughly i guarantee you first time they came down in the basement and found him giving lecture to the girls on the second dynamic they might the principal might be horrified but the principal at the same time would probably find himself being run on routine 1 very shortly see all sorts of new complications occur now that which strips the game from the universe or strips all games from the universe or cancels all games or ends all games of course would normally result in motionlessness but how about ending certain games for somebody who doesnt have the consequence of ending in motionlessness youve broadened persons aspect and ability to play game and recognize what game is and have some fun out of life now the second that you have broadened his view with regard to this you of course have put more games into the universe because most of the games theyre playing were invented so long ago and are so motheaten and so moldy that nobody even knows theyre games anymore i ran into one the other day which was very interesting just yesterday i think it was yesterday morning i was running into some stuff and going over some things and an old version of imsupposedto suddenly turned up an interesting old version its the difference between play and work and thats an interesting difference i finally found out what play was play is unreal or delusory motion about which youre not supposed to be serious so youre not supposed to asis it so an individual eventually gets trapped in this thing called play because everybody tells you you see that play is something which is not serious you see youre not really playing youre not really running train when youre running toy train so therefore the facsimile of the toy train doesnt get asised as train it doesnt get asised as toy train either because all the time youre playing with it youre saying its real train well as matter of fact it is real train that is miniature train that you are doing something with and play is dishonest doingness its delusory or dishonest doingness and work is not serious activity anybody who says work is serious activity is also opening up the bear pit in the middle of the trail theres reason why fellow shouldnt work at sport and theres reason why fellow shouldnt have fun at his job but some barrier got added in here and the operation simply consisted of play is delusory activity so therefore you dont asis it and you might say lot of people walking around in delusions have played too hard get the idea in other words they werent doing what they were doing they were doing something they were pretending they were doing so of course then this really got them really got them hooked up and shortcircuited now as we move ahead little bit and look at this as further consequence we find out that fellow who decides that work is hard or that he cant work is getting into the interesting thing of every time he plays he has to say now im supposed to every time he works he says now im supposed to now im supposed to what im supposed to be doing something else so we get another method of not asising anything did you ever read book and have guilty conscience because you ought to be doing something else well you know youll sooner or later hang all such books up on the end of your nose because youre not doing what you are doing youre doing what you are doing when you were at the same time should be doing something else and you arent doing something else you are doing what you are doing and probably one of the heaviest marks of persons disappearance of aberration is on this particular facet of motion which is to say that the person does what he does whether he is supposed to or not supposed to be doing it and if person did what he did and it wasnt work and it wasnt play and it wasnt ramification it wasnt im supposed to and it wasnt an im supposed to be doing something else if he did all of these paid attention to those things but just did this one he did what he was doing he would live an entirely different life what he was doing was what he was doing you get the idea without further qualifications now the morality of existence is once more test of the play work thing morality is nowimsupposedto so that these fellows that run around committing very immoral acts are saying to themselves all the time that they shouldnt be doing them so they never asis them so they continue to do them well i think its the most the most weird mechanism anybody ever saw its certainty that one gets persistence then of the things he doesnt want or gets tanglement of the things he does want and eventually all the things he doesnt want is what hes got and all the things that he does want are completely confused delusory and tangled and then he wonders why he feels odd and if you wished to make clear clean statement of what auditing was it is simply straightening somebody out so that he has tolerance of motion and tolerance of motionlessness and so that he can have what he should have or not as the case may be as he wishes restore his power of choice over this fact but to do that you have to erase the oddities of doingness in order to handle work and play and motion and motion of course becomes pain and becomes all these other things and motionlessness becomes boredom and then apathy and all these other things you have to take the tremendous significance out of these states so that person arrives at the situation where when he does something that is what he is doing hes not doing something else got the idea and when hes not doing anything he is simply not doing anything hes not sitting there not doing anything while hes supposed to be doing something else in other words he has clear view of what hes doing or not doing as the case may be therefore he never gets fuddled up with funny circuits telling him he ought to be doing this or saying that or something of the sort where do these circuits come from they just come from the basis of doing things that he shouldnt be doing while he should be doing something else and not doing things which he should be doing and of course these automaticities eventually get set up and he has avoided them to such degree that they become solid masses and hes eventually in situation where of course hes dictated to from every corner of his beingness he sits down to read book and all the time he is reading the book he knows he ought to be doing something else so he goes over and does something mundane like straighten up the straighten up all of the ties and shirts and so forth in desk drawer and starts putting his room in some kind of order one way or the other like putting the shoes on the mantleplace and he wonders now wait minute why did i do that its because all the time he is moving around pretending he should be working you see actually he knows that he would like to be reading book so we get this dualness halfheartedness halfmindedness about all actions which comes down to quartermindedness eighthmindedness nomindedness and the person becomes simply dictate of these things because his power of choice can longer be expressed now just from that you can see what the prehav scale is very very cleanly its the thing that disentangles all the things from the things and youll eventually run into all these things youll eventually run into it all because theyre the key and principal doingnesses that person gets mixed up okay all right then in trying to accomplish that if you yourself in auditing the pc make him intolerant of motion then you reverse the process that is to say by your actions and unsmooth auditing and dropping the ashtray and throwing him out the window or something like this youve fixed him up to point of where he can longer tolerate motion all right now at the same time lets make him sit still when he cant and give him bunch of sitstills when he cant do it at all and this makes him intolerant of being motionless now lets go further than that and take the next factor of wins and loses and lets fix him up so that every time he does something right we convince him he has done something wrong and we add new lose on top of his bank full of loses all right your winlose factor now is gone because hes getting failures in auditing we keep handing him failures hell go out the bottom now youre next one up if you dont duplicate things and dont make them duplicative and dont square him around on the subject of havingness in general hell wind up not being able to have anything and you could just reverse the whole process by doing those things you see just exactly backwards now what he shouldwhat you should be doing in auditing is making it possible for an individual to be still or to be in motion to win on the things that he wants to win on to accomplish the things that he thinks he ought to accomplish and one of the things you do this with in goals processing is take out of the road all the other things he should really be doing goals to large degree are dosomethingelse youll find somebody working in an operation and theyre going along and theyre doing this job all the time and all the time theyre saying to themselves i ought to be singer i ought to be singer i ought to be out studying singing i ought to be out studying singing i ought to be out studying singing you finally get tired of it and you say why dont you go out and study singing they sit at their desk and say well i ought to study singing i ought to go out and sing you get the idea just the fact of sitting at their desk makes them feel they ought to sing the second you put them out there to sing as professional singer they know what they ought to be doing they ought to be sitting at their desk by straightening out then their various goals they know what they are doing and they dont have these absorbing impulses that take them off of what they are doing because anytime fellow is sitting there with real hot desperate goal which is totally unrealized and unrealizable of course he doesnt know what hes doing he cant be doing anything hes doing because hes got to be doing something else that he cant do now if you upset the environment for the pc one way or the other by running his havingness in various ways and running his havingness backwards forwards and upside down making him allergic to the walls and so forth you know run the wrong havingness process and so on now all right take look at this room now make sure doesnt it seem rather small to you oh it doesnt well it seems small to maybe youre just putting up facsimiles and looking at them far out because the room really is small any kind of gag of this character you say all right now look at that nasty wall over there now get the idea that that wall get the idea that that wall if you got totally cleared up on the wall would be terrible enemy of yours supposing you knew all of the secrets of the universe wouldnt it be terrible if they turned out to be terrible things that would make you unhappy for the rest of your life isnt that an interesting operation and yet that interesting operation runs along in the field of philosophy continually and i have heard it mouthed by highschool girls in this lifetime well youd really better not know too much about existence because what if it turned out too terrible to know about all right so when you familiarize somebody with it and let him make up his own mind about what it is he finds out it isnt so bad he can have the stuff therefore he can do what he is doing and therefore he can be what he is being and when you when hes in that frame of mind his mental activities are not so completely absorbed with all of these reactive computations that he cannot decide what he wants to be do and have so the individual can make up his mind what he wants to be do and have but because he doesnt have any particular barriers in it of course he can be them and he can do them and he can have them and then that is very peculiar state of mind and everybody will find something wrong with that sooner or later particularly the catholic church but you have defeated not the motionless philosophies nor the motion philosophies nor have you defeated particularly all the working philosophies or nonworking philosophies or the various doingnesses and moral philosophies and immoral philosophies or the canthavemusthave communist capitalist socialist laborist lordknowswhatist philosophies you havent defeated any of these philosophies you have picked people up to point where they can inspect them youre not interested in guiding them away from these horrible evils the truth of the matter is all they would have to do is inspect them i dont imagine if itd take more than twenty or thirty people to inspect all of one of these philosophies to have it disappear you know i mean really clearsighted people i dont think itd take very much because its awfully hard to make lie continue to exist it takes some real trickery to make lie persist although lies apparently persist with the greatest of ease look how fast the aberration of pc folds up when he finds out what is the alteris that is causing it as soon as he really finds what that is it will fold up if it doesnt fold up and he thinks hes found it out he hasnt found it out hes got to look little further and then itll asis thats what youre trying to do with auditing now we lay down rules we lay down routines we lay down various things that you can get away with and you cant get away with and so forth but actually all those things are supplementing what ive told you in the last half an hour here weve gotten lot of experience on the track now on this subject and we know certain things you can get away with and certain things you cant get away with and most of these things are applied to specialized being known as homo sapiens now you start auditing grasshoppers you may find another set of conditions of how you handle grasshoppers to immediately take place therell be another set of conditions of auditing but the principles of auditing will be invariable you will be trying to do the same thing with grasshopper you were doing with homo sap but i imagine hand space mimicry with grasshopper is not quite not quite as easy as cch 3 so the processes would be different the targets of the processes would be the same the routines and activities that you would go through would be different but the exact auditing targets would be the same the conditions would be the same do you see how that works out okay well youve got long weekend ahead of you and nothing at all to do in it and so i think id like to add little additional work little additional work and i want you over this weekend to review this factthese facts ask yourself this burning question do i know the trs do i know model session do i know how to administer the cchs do i know the prehav scale and how to assess on the prehav scale for general levels do i know how to security check and this brings up burningly do i really know this emeter and do i know how to assess for goals seven things there only one has been added which is old which is the old cchs and i want you to ask yourself those questions over the weekend and come up with the answer and tear into those things which you feel shaky about on monday okay all right thank you
