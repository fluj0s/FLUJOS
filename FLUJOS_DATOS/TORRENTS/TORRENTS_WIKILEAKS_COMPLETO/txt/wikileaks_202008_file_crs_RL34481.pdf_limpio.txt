evening of may 2 2008 and cut path of destruction across the southern portion of the country the storm left in its wake an official death toll of 84537 and 53836 more missing and extensive damage to the nations premier agricultural areas some have speculated that the final number of dead is actually more than 130000 vital infrastructure was destroyed by the storm severely limiting the ability to assess the loss of life and provide assistance to the survivors for weeks following the cyclone in addition much of burmas most productive agricultural land has been severely damaged some experts expect that it will take up to two years for burmas production of rice seafood pork and poultry to recover and that the nation may face chronic food shortage s and the need for international assistance for many months burmas ruling military junta quickly faced both domestic and international criticism for its response to cyclone nargis including accusations th at it failed to provide adequate warning its slow emergency response and its reluctance to allow international relief workers into the country the united states has offered so far contributed 4017 million in relief aid even before cyclone nargis struck the junta was already facing highly controversial referendum on proposed constitution scheduled for may 10 2008 that could shape us and other countries policies toward burma as consequence the evolution and implications of the humanitarian crisis became inextricably linked to burmas political situation and its relations with the international community in widely criticized move the military junta decided go ahead with the vote holding the constitutional referendum in most of burma on may 10 2008 and in the more severely affected areas on may 24 2008 the spdc reported heavy turnout on both days and few voting irregularities opposition groups state that the turnout was light and there were many cases of voting fraud and voter intimidation on may 29 2008 the junta announced the promulgation of the new constitution on the basis of on its approval by 907 of the eligible voters according to the new constitution elections to form new government are to be held in 2010 some experts are speculating that cyclone nargis may precipitate major political change in burma including the destabilization of burmas military regime the junta has already faced domestic and international pressure to cancel the constitutional referendum local dissatisfaction with the speed and quality of the juntas provision of emergency assistance may heighten domestic opposition to the junta and its proposed constitution also rising food prices and food shortages may feed popular discontent much like fuel price increases led to protests in burma of september 2007 in addition two days before announcing the official results of the constitutional referendum the spdc extended opposition leader aung san suu kyis house arrest for the sixth consecutive year this report examines the scope of and response to the disaster as well as its links to burmas political situation and us policy the report will be updates as circumstances warrant

time on may 2 2008 cy clone nargis category 3 cyclone1 made landfall in the irrawaddy ayeyarwady division of burma and then moved across the country from southwest to northeast cutting huge path of destruction 100 miles wide and 200 miles long and striking burmas largest city rangoon with winds of up to 190 kph 120 mph see figure 1 2 it caused major damage in the lowlying agricultural delta region which also suffered the impact of storm surge the disaster struck just week before the burmese people were to vote on proposed new constitution and just the day after president bush announced an executive order tightening trade and economic sanctions the scale of the disaster requires major relief effort that has proved to be well beyond the response capacity of the authorities in burma several days after the cyclone the state peace and democracy council spdc indicated that it would accept offers of assistance from the international community despite millions of dollars in aid pledges many aid agencies and organizations experienced problems in obtaining visas for their relief workers essentially hampering fullscale immediate relief effort these factorsa devastating natural disaster and lack of access by the international humanitarian communitycombined with controversy over the recent constitutional referendum and the extension of opposition leader aung san suu kyis house arrest for the sixth consecutive year have the potential to foster significant political change within burma congress faces several issues with respect to burma in dealing with both the direct impact of cyclone nargis and its potential indirect effects on burmese politics g22g145g142g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561g152g143g561g5g162g140g149g152g151g142g561g16g138g155g144g146g156g561

revised to 84537 dead and 53836 missing5 most of the deaths were reportedly due to 35 meter 115 feet storm surge that swept across the affected areas after the eye of the cyclone 1 tropical storms in

worsened by the removal of mangrove forests in the past along burmas coastal areas14 in burma mangrove forests have been destroyed to build shrimp and fish farms according to research by the international union for the conservation of nature iucn the preservation of sri lankas coastal mangrove forests saved many lives when the 2004 tsunami struck15 based on the research in sri lanka some experts maintain that cyclone nargis would have done less damage in burma if the mangrove forests had not been removed the areas of burma most severely damaged by the cyclone were also major source of food for the nation particularly rice seafood pork and poultry according to the food and agricultural organization fao the five states struck by cyclone nargis provided burma with 65 of its rice 80 of its aquaculture 50 of its poultry and 40 of its pigs 16 in june 2008 the fao completed needs assessment for the areas affect by the cyclone an with focus on crops livestock fisheries and forestry17 an

indicated that it would accept offers of assistance from the international community though it was also reported that the spdc did not officially endorse international assistance and would prefer bilateral arrangements 19 the spdc said it would allocate 5 million for relief activities military and police units reportedly began to conduct rescue and recovery operations deploying helicopters boats and trucks but as the scale of the disaster became more evident the relief effort required was thought to be well beyond their capacity20 the government coordinated national efforts of the response through an emergency committee which put into operation national disaster management plan with the ministry of social welfare relief and resettlement heading up the relief response in addition there reportedly was widespread criticism about how the military junta has managed the disaster according to the burma campaignu k the spdc did not issue warning to the people living along

warning before cyclone nargis hit the country including where and when landfall would occur23 however spdcrun television issued statement that timely weather reports were announced and aired through television and radio in order to keep the people safe and secure nationwide24 many people in burma reportedly maintain that the state media notices failed to indicate the severity of the approaching storm or provide instructions on how to prepare for the cyclones arrival25 in the first few days after the cyclone struck it appeared that the spdc either underappreciated the extent of the damage caused by the cyclone or was intentionally underplaying the cyclones impact the first edition of the new light of myanmar released after the cyclone struck contained number of articles that implied that life in rangoon was quickly returning to normal and that the cyclones impact in the bago divi sion the kayin state and the mon state were minimal there were also reports that the spdc focused its relief and rescue efforts to areas where spdc officials and military personnel lived and worked and offered little or assistance to the general population26 in addition there were allegations that local officials stole relief supplies for their own use or to sell on the black market27 there was also criticism of the spdcs failure to prevent disaster profiteering by merchants of essential items such as food and fuel the proopposition news magazine irrawaddy reported that many commodity pricesincluding vegetables and eggsinstantly increased 100 percent following the aftermath of cyclone nargis 28 according to other reports food prices had reportedly risen three and four times what they were before the cyclone struck by may 6 200829 the spdc was also being criticized for delaying the entrance of international relief organizations into burma according to an article in the irrawaddy the spdc views international relief agencies as neocolonialist tools30 in april 2008 for instance the spdcrun newspapers accused the international committee of the red cross of supporting rebel groups in burmas karen state31 burmese political analyst aung naing oo also thinks the military junta did

assembling staff in bangkok thailand and remained poised for deployment immediately following the cyclone relatively small number of international aid workers were allowed in to burma and within weeks it was reported that 160 foreign aid workers mostly from neighboring asian countries including bangladesh china india and thailand would be allowed in also but with little indication on how far outside rangoon they would be permitted to travel it is believed aid workers from western nations that have isolated the spdc were not being welcomed customs clearance of relief materials potential

irrawaddy delta area us and british ships with relief supplies on board can enter the port of rangoon to transfer supplies to small local boats but military ships are not be permitted increased access has enabled massive international relief effort to move ahead albeit slowly according to the united nations more than 230 international staff have been granted visas and are now in the country more than 200 operation staff have traveled to the affected areas for those entering the delta some report that access has not been problem and that logistical arrangements are improving while other ngos

foreign policy issues natural disasters like the 2004 tsunami in the indian ocean 2005 earthquake in south asia and 2007 cyclone in bangladesh may affect millions of people each year who re quire prolonged urgent assistance responses are typically multilateral often have relief operation end date and are less likely to be hindered by the politics of the situation by contrast in many conflictsterrorist attacks war between states or where groups within country are fighting and in the absence of political solutionthe response cannot be separated from broader foreign policy

crises however these resources would need to be replenished or it could curtail us capacity to respond to other emergencies these accounts are typically restored through supplemental appropriations

severe food shortage for up to two years the areas struck by cyclone nargis were important sources of rice seafood pork and chicken for burma it is unlikely that the rest of the country will be able to step up food production to replace the lost output of the cyclone devastated regions it is also uncertain if burma will be able import enough food to replace its lost domestic output because of damage to its transportation infrastructure and shortage of foreign exchange as result burma may require food assistance for many months and possibly years in addition in the first few days after cyclone nargis food prices in burma reportedly increased by 100 or more while this spike in food prices is likely to subside to some extent in the coming weeks it is also likely that prices will not return to their precyclone levels in addition to the challenge of recovering from the destruction caused by the cyclone the people of burma will probably face higherand possibly risingfood prices for many months given that most households in burma were living in poverty before the arrival of nargis the higher food prices will place more strain on the burmese people it is noteworthy to recall that widespread protests in burma in september 2007 began as demonstration against an unannounced increase in fuel prices burmas potential longterm need for food assistance presents two possible concerns to congress first congress may be asked to appropriate funds to provide longterm food and agricultural assistance to burma second these recent developments may also prompt changes in the current laws

dissatisfaction with the spdcs response to the cyclone disaster potential rejection of the juntas proposed constitution and widespread food shortages and food price inflation could combine to pose threat to the political survival of burmas ruling military junta in addition the announced official results of the constitutional plebiscite are widely viewed as obviously fraudulent by burmas opposition groups and much of the general population these factors have increased the prospects for public demonstrations against the spdc political tensionsboth domestic and internationalwere also heightened by the spdcs decision on may 27 2008 to extend the house arrest of aung san suu kyi for sixth consecutive year as well as the arrest of several nld members 115 the detention decision was

senate versions of hr 3890 and subsequently forwarding the legislation to the president would build upon executive order 13464 however new congressio nal sanctions would possibly eliminate any possibility of the spdc admitting us aid or relief workers in the future and could potentially be used by the military junta to rally support based on patriotic or nationalist appeals to opposition to outside interference key factor that will impact the effectiveness of any changes in us sanctions on burma will be the perceived ability of the spdc to weather any political storm one critical element in the post nargis period will be the strength of the spdcs support among rankandfile soldiers burmas military has grown from 180000 to around 400000 troops over the last 20 years the spdc will also rely on its paramilitary support group the union solidarity and development association usda to remain in power formed in 1993 the usda is ostensibly social organization that claims nearly 23 million member s but has reputation for violent acts against opposition groups in burma in recent years the usda has organized peoples militias that have reportedly been involved in attacks on aung san suu kyi and other opposition leaders in burma 118 burmas soldiers have already demonstrated readiness to open fire on civilian protests and the usda have similarly demonstrated willingness to be weapon of oppression for the spdc whether of not the soldiers and the usda members will continue to support the military junta during any postnargis civil unrest remains to be seen there are some indications of significant political changes within the spdc since cyclone nargis and the constitutional referendum on june 20 2008 the spdc released orders 22008 and 32008 reassigning major general saw lwin to become the minister of immigration and population and making vice admiral soe thien his replacement as minister for industry2 119 according to one report unnamed military sources said that soe thiens

junior officers were promoted as part of restructuring of the spdc121 there are differing interpretations of the significance of the replacement of ministers and retirement of generals some observers speculat that there is power struggle within the spdc for the successor of than shwe between general shwe mann and lieutenant general myint swe while shwe mann is purportedly the number three man in the armed forces myint swe supposedly is very loyal to than shwe 122 other analysts are interpreting the recent changes in the spdc as the punishing of people who failed to take action after the cyclone and replace them with loyal and trusted officers in particular soe thien was allegedly removed from his position as the head of the navy because of his failure to deploy ships to counter the us and french naval vessels of the coast of burma123 another important issue will be the image of burmas buddhist monks and nunsand their actionsin the weeks ahead various accounts indicate that the monks and nuns have been key figures at the local level in organizing and coor dinating disaster relief efforts although the spdc has attempted to prevent the monks and nuns from involvement in disaster assistanceand reportedly have tried to take credit for work done by the monks and nunsburmas members of religious orders may have strengthened their popularity since the arrival of cyclone nargis having been barred from voting on the constitutional referendum burmas buddhist monks and nuns may choose to leverage their stronger popular support into renewed political action against the burmas oppressive military junta 121 min lwin junta reshuffles key military positions irrawaddy june 25 2008 122 min lwin reshuffle could signal change at the top irrawaddy june 23 2008 123 aung zaw
