primary functions to track soldiers and equipment during the battle to assist the leader in the command and control of the unit to serve as data center that processes enemy and friendly information the basic building blocks for any toccp are internal work area physical setup personnel who make the toccp function the responsibility of the bctbattalion operations officer is to assemble these building blocks and make them operate as one ultimately the success of toccp depends on its ability to battle track information in any situation ranging from combat to peacekeeping battle tracking is not an easy task the daily information flow must be carefully managed or it can rapidly overload any headquarters knowing what is important displaying that data and analyzing the information are equally crucial tasks personnel guided by experience can use these simple tracking tools to get the job done regardless of its physical size the toccp must have system in place to record and display basic message traffic an effective toccp provides vital battletracking information using centralized cop the concept of cop is simple provide situational update at glance anyone should be able to look

to date do not rely exclusively on digital systems such as force xxi battle command brigade and below and blue force tracker use standard 150000 scale military maps use smaller or larger maps as additions not substitutes place the operations map in the center flanked by the intelligence and fire support maps create overlays to one standard size consider combining status charts with situation maps to give commanders friendly and enemy situation snapshots for the planning process standardize map boards to the same size scale and overlay mounting holes this practice facilitates easy transfer of overlays from one board to another depict all unit boundaries and current locations of friendly units within the ao template known and suspected enemy locations display locations of essential sustainment modes depict main supply routes to enhance effective battle tracking recommend battle staffs build the cop as the action occurs to provide the commander relevant information 12center for

better situational awareness of the cop within the toccp 39battle staff nco handbook us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlychapter 3 battle staff rehearsals field manual fm 60 mission command command and control of army forces defines rehearsal as session in which unit or staff practices expected actions to improve performance during execution rehearsals occur during preparation and are the commanders tool to ensure staffs and subordinates understand the commanders intent and concept of operations rehearsals also synchronize operations at times and places critical to successful mission accomplishment the extent of rehearsals depends on available time rehearsals allow participants in an operation to become familiar with the plan rehearsals also translate the plan into visual impression that orients participants to their environment and to other units that will execute the operation effective rehearsals imprint mental picture of the sequence of key actions within the operation and provide coordination forum for subordinate and supporting leaders and units battle staff rehearsals are critically important to achieve two results everyone understands each part of the plan everyone is fully prepared to act when the events do not go exactly as planned soldiers and leaders who understand the plan and then execute it can win the fight commanders and staffs have numerous choices when it comes to rehearsing the plan both in rehearsal types and rehearsal techniques familiarity with each will assist the commander in selecting the best way to visualize clarify and synchronize the units planned critical actions rehearsing key combat actions allows unit participants to become familiar with the synchronization of the operation effective rehearsal planning should determine the following what critical tasks are required what method how to rehearse will be used whom to rehearse when to rehearse these commander decisions are based on time available unit training status complexity of the planned operation unit familiarity with rehearsal types and techniques 41battle staff nco handbook us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlyrehearsal techniques should include commander preferences and guidance regarding each in the units tactical standing operating procedures tacsop rehearsal techniques generally battle staffs can choose from six different techniques for executing rehearsals reference fm 60 appendix f full dress reduced force terrain model sketch map map network the resources required for each technique vary from extensive preparation time and resources in the fulldress rehearsal to map and overlay in the map rehearsal each rehearsal technique provides different degree of understanding to participants rehearsal considerations include the following time time required to conduct plan prepare execute and assess the rehearsal echelons involved number of echelons participating in the rehearsal operational security opsec ease with which the enemy might gather intelligence from the rehearsal terrain factors affecting the space needed to be allocated and secured for the rehearsal fulldress rehearsal fulldress rehearsal produces the most detailed understanding of the operation it involves every participating soldier and system if possible organizations execute fulldress rehearsals under the same conditionsweather time of day terrain and use of live ammunitionthat the force expects to encounter during the actual operation the fulldress rehearsal is the most difficult to accomplish at higher echelons at those levels commanders develop second rehearsal plan that mirrors the actual plan but fits the terrain available for the rehearsal rehearsal considerations include the following time fulldress rehearsals are the most time consuming of all rehearsal types and for companies and smaller units the most effective technique for ensuring all involved in the operation understand their roles brigade and task force commanders should consider the time subordinates need to plan and prepare when deciding whether to conduct fulldress rehearsal 42center for army lessons learned us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlyechelons involved subordinate unit can perform fulldress rehearsal as part of larger organizations reducedforce rehearsal opsec moving large part of the force may attract enemy attention commanders must develop plans to protect the rehearsal from enemy surveillance and reconnaissance one method is to develop plan including graphics and radio frequencies that rehearses selected actions but does not compromise the actual operations order opord when using this technique commanders should take care not to confuse subordinates terrain terrain management for fulldress rehearsal can be difficult if it is not considered during the initial array of forces the rehearsal area must be identified secured cleared and maintained throughout the rehearsal reducedforce rehearsal reducedforce rehearsal involves only key leaders of the organization and its subordinate units it normally takes fewer resources than fulldress rehearsal the commander first decides the level of leader involvement the selected leaders then rehearse the plan while traversing the actual or similar terrain commanders often use this technique to rehearse fire control measures for an engagement area during defensive operations reducedforce rehearsal may be used to prepare key leaders for fulldress rehearsal rehearsal considerations include the following time reducedforce rehearsal normally requires less time than fulldress rehearsal commanders should consider the time their subordinates need to plan and prepare when deciding whether to conduct reducedforce rehearsal echelons involved small unit can perform reduceddress rehearsal as part of larger organizations fulldress rehearsal opsec reducedforce rehearsal is less likely to present opsec vulnerability than fulldress rehearsal because the number of participants is smaller however the number of radio transmissions required is the same as for fulldress rehearsal and remains consideration terrain terrain management for the reducedforce rehearsal can be just as difficult as for the fulldress rehearsal the rehearsal area must be identified secured cleared and maintained throughout the rehearsal terrainmodel rehearsal terrainmodel rehearsal takes fewer resources than fulldress or reducedforce rehearsal and is the most popular rehearsal technique terrainmodel rehearsal takes proficient brigade from one to two hours to execute to standard an accurately constructed terrain model helps subordinate leaders visualize the commanders intent and concept of operations when possible commanders place the terrain model where it overlooks the actual terrain of the area of operations ao however if the situation requires more security they place the terrain model 43battle staff nco handbook us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlyon reverse slope within walking distance of point overlooking the ao the models orientation coincides with that of the terrain the size of the terrain model can vary from small using markers to represent units to large which allows participants to walk the terrain large model helps reinforce the participants perception of unit positions on the terrain rehearsal considerations include the following time often the most timeconsuming part of this technique is constructing the terrain model to ensure the model is accurate large and detailed enough to rehearse the operation units need clear standing operating procedures sops for building the terrain model good sop also states who will build the terrain model and when echelons involved because terrain model is geared to the echelon conducting the rehearsal using this technique for multiechelon rehearsals is difficult opsec this rehearsal can present opsec vulnerability if the area around the rehearsal site is not secured the collection of commanders and their vehicles can draw enemy attention units must sanitize the terrain model after completing the rehearsal terrain terrain management is less difficult than with the previous techniques good site is easy for participants to find yet concealed from the enemy an optimal location overlooks the terrain where the unit will execute the operation sketchmap rehearsal commanders and staffs can use sketchmap rehearsal almost anywhere day or night the procedures are the same as for terrainmodel rehearsal except the commander uses sketch map in place of terrain model effective sketches are large enough for all participants to see as each participant walks through the execution of the operation participants move markers on the sketch to represent unit locations and maneuvers rehearsal considerations include the following time sketchmap rehearsals take less time than terrainmodel rehearsals and more time than map rehearsals echelons involved because sketch map is geared to the echelon conducting the rehearsal using this technique for multiechelon rehearsals is difficult opsec this rehearsal can present opsec vulnerability if the area around the rehearsal site is not secured the collection of commanders and their vehicles can draw enemy attention terrain this technique requires less space than terrainmodel rehearsal good site is easy for participants to find yet concealed from the enemy an optimal location overlooks the terrain where the unit will execute the operation 44center for army lessons learned us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlymap rehearsal map rehearsal techniques are similar to sketchmap rehearsal techniques except the commander uses map and operation overlay of the same scale used to plan the operation rehearsal considerations include the following time the most timeconsuming part is the rehearsal itself map rehearsal is normally the easiest technique to set up since it requires only maps and current operational graphics echelons involved because sketch map is geared to the echelon conducting the rehearsal using this technique for multiechelon rehearsals is difficult opsec this rehearsal can present opsec vulnerability if the area around the rehearsal site is not secured the collection of commanders and their vehicles can draw enemy attention terrain this technique requires the least space of any rehearsal good site is easy to find for participants yet concealed from the enemy an optimal location overlooks the terrain where the unit will execute the operation network rehearsals units can execute network rehearsals over wide area networks or local area networks commanders and staffs execute network rehearsals by talking through critical portions of the operation over communications networks in sequence the commander establishes the organization rehearses only the critical parts of the operation these rehearsals require all information systems infosys needed to execute that portion of the operation all participants require working infosys and copy of the opord and overlays command posts can rehearse battle tracking during network rehearsals rehearsal considerations include the following time if the organization does not have clear sop and if all units do not have working communications or are not up on the net this technique can be very time consuming echelons involved this technique lends itself to multiechelon rehearsals participation is limited only by the commanders desires and the capabilities of the commands infosys opsec if network rehearsal is executed from current unit locations the volume of the communications transmissions and potential compromise of information through enemy monitoring can present opsec vulnerability the organization should use different frequencies from those planned for the operation using wire systems is an option but does not exercise the network systems which is the strong point of this technique terrain if network rehearsal is executed from unit locations terrain considerations are minimal if separate rehearsal area is required considerations are similar to those of reducedforce rehearsal 45battle staff nco handbook us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlyfigure 31 extracted from fm 60 appendix f visually depicts the relationship between the different rehearsal techniques it shows the amount of preparation resources required time used opsec risk leadership participation and the amount of detailed understanding that rehearsal participants may likely gain figure 31 unit rehearsals directing the unit rehearsal one of the most critical aspects of conducting rehearsal is how the unit controls its execution the executive officer xo directs the rehearsal before rehearsal unfolds participants review their roles and responsibilities and if necessary conduct an individual or team rehearsal of their parts before the rehearsal begins the rehearsal director normally the xo begins by calling the roll he briefs participants on the information needed to execute the rehearsal and leads discussion on the rehearsal script and ground rules rehearsal focus unit battle staffs should at minimum study paragraph 3 execution of the unit opord to

visualize the operation prior to execution battle staffs that rehearse the plan prior to execution during actual combat operations or other types of military operations will have better situational understanding of how to integrate and synchronize the plan battle staff ncos are an integral part of this process successfully rehearsing the game plan in training setting ultimately translates to enhanced mission accomplishment in the operational environment 54center for army lessons learned us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlychapter 4 troopleading procedures for

afteraction review note the following chapter is an abridged version of an original article that appeared in center for army lessons learned publication news from the front mayjune 2006 titled the art of the after action review by csm usa ret jack hardwick csm mentor joint readiness training center operations group this chapter demonstrates how to administer an effective aar from company up to brigade level battle staff noncommissioned officers ncos are an integral part of this important process at the battalion and brigade levels ___________________________________________________________________ ingredients of successful afteraction review aar unit collective learning occurs through the aar process leaders do not give aars although that language is often used an aar is not onesided presentation an aar is professional discussion of an event and focused on performance standards that enable soldiers to discover for themselves what happened why it happened and how to sustain strengths and improve weaknesses uncovered during the event under review in other words the unit examines the past event to see how it could do things better the next time it is not purely negative process pointing out strength is often more important to future success than focusing entirely on weaknesses the challenge for the facilitator of an aar is to foster spirit of selfanalysis in both soldier and leader an aar is critical to the entire training unit the leaders must be willing to learn from the soldiers who took part in the event the soldiers must open their ears and their minds in the same way platoon sergeant or lieutenant who listens to his soldiers discussing the mistakes they made in roomclearing action may be able to limit such mistakes in the future soldiers who hear their officers and ncos discussing the effectiveness of supportbyfire position stand to learn much more than just their own roles an aar must be candid discussion by all on what they saw did or were told to do it is up to the person in charge of the aar to facilitate discussion the aar process actually begins well before the exercise or the conduct of an actual combat operation for instance for training event the aar facilitator must know the training objectives and standards before the first soldier begins training in fact the aar facilitator initiates preparation for his aar before training actually takes place he first looks at the mission essential task list the unit wishes to accomplish and identifies the collective and individual tasks that contribute to the accomplishment of the mission then the aar facilitator identifies the tactics techniques and procedures and doctrine that apply to those tasks he also reviews the units standing operating procedures thorough preparation helps define the standards for the unit the aar facilitator must ensure his team is equally well prepared he must have specific tasks to observe be in position to observe those tasks and be able to provide professional feedback to the unit 59battle staff nco handbook us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlytypes of aars there are two types of aars informal and formal the informal aar is usually for soldiers crews squads and platoons informal does not mean less important an informal aar requires fewer training aids or facilities observations can be noted informally in items such as the green book in green book aar the facilitator provides information directly to the person he observes this informal aar is professional discussion and not critique it must achieve the same level of selfawareness and discussion as would formal aar with group of soldiers the formal aar requires more resources and involves the planning coordination and preparation of supporting training aids the aar site and support personnel aar rehearsal presenting professional effective aar means rehearsing unlike critique where time is controlled by the material presented the aar is controlled more by the intercommunication of those involved in the exercise which can be problem if the unit does not want to discuss the issues presented the aar facilitator must be able to ask leading openended questions to obtain explanations and not settle for yes or answer rehearsing the questions and having the facts of what happened will greatly enhance the quality of the aar the aar should be able to answer the following questions what was planned what were the goalsobjectives ask the unit subleaders to identify their missions and objectives before they ask the leaders what were the expected barriers ask the unit what problems it thought it would face or what assumptions if any were used in formulating the plan did the unit conduct risk assessment before the mission this third step is critical because it ties the answers about objectives to the possible roadblocks to those objectives what really happened ask leading questions to elicit discussion of what happened be equally adept at listening in order to turn negative results into positive lessons learned why did it happen discuss both success and failure to sustain success the unit needs to know what it is doing well concentrate on identifying what was wrong versus who was wrong what can we do to fix it identify problems and provide fixes as well as identify who will make those fixes 60center for army lessons learned us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlysummary good aar process takes time teamwork and rehearsals the aar facilitator and team must establish and build trust with the unit trust is developed by working together during training rotations at home station at combat training center or power projection platform and ultimately during combat operations the aar has been around for long time those that understand it know it will help the unit to improve the aar process formal or informal is the best means to see ourselves and make corrections where they are needed never be comfortable where you are continue to look at how you do business and make improvements even to those things you do well strive to learn every day when you stop learning you are dead the aar is means to make great organization better and to save lives 61battle staff nco handbook us unclassified rel

future cpof and the army battle command system abcs that enable units to track elements and share information with higher lower and adjacent units common operational picture with the digitization of the command post the most efficient method of battle tracking at the brigade combat team bctlevel is with common operational picture cop the cop provides the commander with uniform picture of the entire battlefield with the introduction of the abcs 64 system of systems sos the army links 11 systems so commanders can have access to the information they need in the form of cop at the bct echelon the cop comprises the following afatds advanced field artillery tactical data system fires and effects coordination cell fecc amdpcs air and missile defense planning and control system air defense and

rotarywing fixedwing unmanned aerial system sensorshooter locations the umbrella and tactical ballistic missileantiballistic missile alerts on the cop it enhances collaborative planning with threat corridor displays playback capability and the air defense plan and estimate asas is the system responsible for managing the threat picture and intelligence operations found in the s2g2 section asas is an intelligence fusion system that provides timely accurate and relevant picture of the enemy situation to the commander it accomplishes this by receiving uncorrelated enemy spot reports from fbcb2 and external database coordination messages giving the analyst the ability to fuse incoming data into an accurate red picture of correlated units known as the situation template sitemp overlay the sitemp overlay is the main contribution of the asas to the cop and it is displayed through the mcs via publish and subscribe services pass pass is accomplished when the asas publishes the sitemp overlay to the advanced information system ais then the mcs subscribes to the sitemp overlay and pulls that information from the battle control system to mission map displaying the cop the actual live feed of uncorrelated red units can be distributed to the mcs through red live feed settings in the maps and overlays application in mcs this method presents busy picture of enemy activity the intelligence staff has not evaluated all of this enemy activity therefore the enemy situation posted to the cop usually involves the correlated enemy activity found in the sitemp bcs3 facilitates the transmission of logistical information to the cop via logistic overlays which includes all friendly and enemy locations main supply routes and unit status bcs3 provides the maneuver commander from theater to brigade level the capability to access his current combat power displayed on personal computer with web browser using current operational information this information comes from fbcb2blue force tracker exchange of data via excellike spreadsheets or manual input and provides the running estimate of the status of fuel ammunition weapons platformsequipment and personnel dtss terrain analysis products that contribute to the cop include on and offroad mobility maps line of sight intervisibility plots concealment maps onroad choke point maps and tactical fordingbridging maps the dtss must subscribe to the ais to obtain graphics from mcs weather from imets and the enemy situation from asas dtss does not publish its products to the ais the overlays from the dtss can be messaged k0517 or data transferred to mcs for incorporation to the cop fbcb2 uses blue icons to show the location of individual friendly vehicles on the cop it provides situational awareness sa by telling the user his location as well as the location of other friendly forces observed enemy forces and reported battlefield obstacles this sa is best seen at the battalion level fbcb2 georeferenced reports such as the obstacle report bridge report threat warnings nuclear biological and chemical reports and spot reports are sent as digital messages sending the report can result in red icons populating all users screens 64center for army lessons learned us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlythe message is also sent to the asas system supporting the observer usually the battalion or brigade s2 integration with the global positioning system and laser range finders improves the accuracy of these reports in addition to supporting weather briefings imets is also able to analyze and graphically display the impact of current projected or even hypothesized weather conditions on friendly and enemy capabilities instead of reacting to the weather imets enables the warfighter to leverage weather conditions imets provides the weather view for the cop by publishing the imets weather products to the ais subsequently the imets weather products are usually displayed through the mcs mcs obtains the imets products namely the weather impact overlays lowlevel winds display and the integrated weather effects decision aid iweda by subscribing to the weather imets topic in the bcs the weather view includes weather impact overlays decision aids weather contours and symbols the lowlevel winds display shows the results of windactivity analysis over an area of operations the iweda displays weather effects on weapon systems or missions in 24hour periods whether it is favorable marginal or unfavorable the isyscon is found in the s6g6 section it provides an automated theaterwide system that signal units use to manage multiple tactical communications systems in support of battlefield operations the isyscon facility provides an automated integrated method for managing the tactical communications networks and interfaces with each warfighting functional area in the architecture change to the requirements document has added planning and management of military satellite communications resources the mission of gccsa is to support monitoring planning and executing joint combined and army conventional military operations as such gccsa supports information exchanges with numerous joint systems abcs subsystems and coalition forces it is the digital command and control link between joint task force and strategic commanders to army operational and tactical commanders by way of the joint global command and control system gccsa provides the joint view for the cop it gives the locations of army forces at echelons above corps as well as joint and coalition units aircraft vessels and facilities the gccsa publishes to the bcs the jointlevel graphics overlay that displays ground units naval vessels aircraft obstacles and military installations the gccsa products are displayed on the cop usually through the mcs the mcs subscribes to the graphics gccsa topic in the bcs to obtain the gccsa products for the cop presently mcs consists of mcs workstations that run on notebook computer using the microsoft windows xp operating system and an mcs server which is more powerful computer running microsoft windows server 2003 in some command posts cps where there are not enough resources to host an mcs server there will be an mcs gateway an mcs gateway is notebook computer running windows xp which also provides some of the services found on an mcs server together the mcs server and the mcs workstation serve the maneuver battlefield functional area and provide the cop for the rest of the cp tais contributes to the cop by providing the airspace view through two and three dimensional 3d airspace view displaying airspace control orders acos and airspace control measures acms through mcs tais can deconflict acos and acms by rotating the 3d representation of the airspace the operator can see 65battle staff nco handbook us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlythese orders and measures from different angles tais will highlight conflicts in intended airspace usage during army airspace command and control a2c2 planning and execution the air traffic system display includes information from the aco and ato tais operators can use this display to track the flight of aircraft tais will alert the operator if an aircraft leaves the safe transition corridor the tais products such as the aco and a2c2 overlays are published to the ais and it subscribes products from other systems in abcs mcs usually subscribes to the ais to obtain the a2c2 overlays for posting to the cop command post of the future cpof is an executivelevel decision support system that provides sa and collaborative tools to support commanders decision making it does not replace the abcs in fact it depends on the abcs for the majority of its data and will continue to do so until the abcs is replaced four applications make up the cpof the maya comotioncpof application comotion client is versatile commanders view into geospatial temporal and other forms of data the oculus command sight application is primarily 3d mapbased view of the area of operations the map manager operates in the background caching imagery and map data locally so it can feed into both the comotion application and the command sight application the ventrillo voice over internet protocol voip client integrates with the comotion client to provide seamless audio communications across multiple channels the cpof is the latest trend in command and control c2 technology system currently deployed at division level cpof enables division and brigade commanders to discuss and process information share ideas and attend virtual meetings without assembling at one place cpof runs on commercial offtheshelf computer workstation with three screens that provide shared environment that distributes manipulates and displays current operational information about the locations of all friendly units known enemy forces and relevant operational plans information including images and data is seen in two and threedimensions across the distributed workspace commanders can be better informed and make better decisions by sharing situational awareness and collaborating with headquarters commanders attend virtual meeting they do not have to be in the same location or even the same country to discuss and draw on the same map cpof was developed as technology demonstration by defense advanced research projects agency darpa darpa is expanding the system with the introduction of advanced visualization tools such as multiscreen video wall video and audio conferencing and online collaboration tools that allow brigade commanders to communicate collaborate and share information 66center for army lessons learned us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlycpof enables forward command elements to reduce the staff required to operate c2 systems in the distant future advanced cpof systems will eliminate parts of the brigades tactical operations center toc the forward and assault toc could be transformed into virtual tocs cpof relies on wideband datacommunications links currently available to the army via military and commercial satellite communications services the commanders battle board is interfaced to the system supporting all the communication collaboration and information feeds he needs the system is maintained as liquid information in database format that separates the data from the viewing space this method enables faster visualization and optimal maintenance of large volumes of constantly changing information the system gathers realtime and nearrealtime feeds from multiple c2 applications constant monitoring of the battlefield is provided by tracking the combat elements on maps or satellite photos and video feeds from battlefield sensors following enemy forces through intelligence reports ground observations forward units or unmanned aerial systems commanders longer have to call on the radio to check the status of each unit cpof supports commercial presentationstyle briefings including map photos and video the participants can respond and sketch out their comments on the shared battle board presented in each location and at the central cps video wall the agile commander program provides scalable reconfigurable operator environment which enables commanders to access all cp information and functions anywhere anytime utilizing advanced mosaic and global mobile networking cpof provides planning and mapping tools to support the commanders battle management and information operations processes by rapidly processing and correlating combat information from all available sources the goal of the cpof system is to provide commanders and their staffs with an advanced distributed collaborative decisionmaking environment thus eliminating fixed cps and enabling truly mobile distributed commands cpof is an informationcentric tool that provides realtime knowledgesharing that directly impacts team effectiveness and decision making the highly intuitive visualizations allow officers to review each others data quickly to support the unique demands of battlefield awareness it achieves this by integrating comotion and commandsight software technologies providing comprehensive workspace tool that contains frames of various sorts such as charts tables and customized appliances specific to the application integration with existing abcs systems critical for providing accurate sa to cpof operators is achieved through the data bridge key design principles central to the technical approach in development include composability commanders can access view configure and tune data visualizations workspace and processes in way that supports their thinking the computer is an instrument for artists tactical to express thoughts and understandings collaboration topsight provides the visualization and understanding of who is doing what in the system allowing the command staff to better manage and share its c2 resources and expertise while current procedures focus on course of action coa generation and capture in 67battle staff nco handbook
