internet now allows for realtime video and audio streaming for students to participate in educational exchanges9 the basic exemption for distance education was originally enacted as part of the copyright act of 1976 to permit performances and displays of copyrighted works for distance education instruction without need to obtain license or rely on fair use prior to this exemption the doctrine of fair use was relied on to use copyrighted material in the educational context although the copyright act expressly permits the fair use of copyrighted work by the public for limited purposes such as criticism teaching comment scholarship or research the reach of the doctrine is nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33516crs3 10 17 usc 107 in addition fourpart test described in 107 provides

1998 c ongress directed the us copyright office to study and recommend the promoti on of distance education through digital technologies while balanc ing the rights of copyright owne rs and the interests of those using copyrighted material11 the copyright office issued its report in 199912 to facilitate distance education using digital media the office suggested among other things the following elimination of physical classroom requirement clarification of the term transmission to cover digitaltransmissions expansion of rights covered by the exemption to include those needed to accomplish network transmissions expansion of categories of works exempted from the performancerights beyond current coverage of nondramatic literary and music works and creation of new safeguards to count eract the risks imposed by digital transmissions13 the teach act pursuant to the recommendations of th copyright office congress sought to enact legislation that would alter 1102 to include provisions specifically for distance education and digital transmissi ons in march 2001 senator orrin hatch introduced s 487 the teach act proposal to allow students and teachers to bene fit from

education programs ar realtime performance programs where students and educators communicate via an electronic medium asynchronous distance education permits students to access materials at time of their choosing typically over the internet15 expanded works works permitted to be used for digital transmission during distance educationa l broadcast now include performances of nondram atic literary or musical work excluding operas music videos and musicals in their entirety any other work if only reasonable and limited portions of theperformance are used and displays of any work comparable to the use typical in facetofacedisplays 16 although what constitutes reasonable and limited portion of work is not defined in the statute the legislative history of the act suggests that determining what amount is permissible should take into account the nature of the market for that type of work and the instructional purposes of the performance17 for example the exhibition of an entire film may possibly constitute reasonable and limited demonstration if the films entire viewing is exceedingly relevant toward achieving educational goal however the likeli hood of an entire film portrayal being reasonable and limited may be rare18 limitations the teach act places two primary exceptions on the types of material subject to the distance education exemption first materials that are produced or marketed including textbooks and compilations for the express purpose of distance education are excluded from the general exemption19 thus this exception seeks to preserve the general market for distance education materials as well as the incentives to create and distribute such materialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33516crs5 20 copy is material object that allows work to be perceived reproduced or otherwise communicated directly or with the aid of machine 17 usc 101 21 17 usc 1102 22 id 23 17 usc 1102a 24 17 usc 110 25 17 usc 1102b 26 srept 10731 at 1011 27 id 28 17 usc 1102a 29 srept 10731 at 9the second exception provides that the exemption is inapplicable if the performance or display comes from copy20 that is not lawfu lly made or acquired21 an inadvertent acquisition of an unlawful copy may not result in disqualification from the exemption however actual knowle dge or having reason to believe that copy is illegitimate may constitute an unlawful acquisition22 eligible claimants for the exemption only governmental body or an accredited nonprofit educationa l institution can invoke the distance education exemption23 the act defines accreditation state certification and licensing procedures accredit institutions of elementa ry or secondary education regional or national agencies recognized by the council on higher education accreditation or the united states department of educa tion accredit postsecondary institutions with respect to an institution as whole not on course offerings alone24 conditions on permitted use section 1102 further establishes conditions for permitted use of display or performance first the performance must be directly related and of material assistance to the teaching content of the transmission25 according to the acts legislative history the drafters intended relevance and materia lity to connect the copyrighted work with the educational use26 if the work is used as entertainment or as unrelated background then materiality of the work would be inadequate27 second the performances must be made by at the direction of or under the actual supervision of an instructor as an integral part of class session28 the legislative history indicates that either an instructor or student may initiate the performance or display29 actual supervision in distance l earning context does not have the same meaning that may be ascribed to incla ssroombased instruction the supervision requirement is flexible in distance edu cation because asynchronous learning seldom occurs under an instructors realtime supervision th teach act drafters soughthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33516crs6 30 id 31 17 usc 1102a 32 17 usc 110 33 id however because they are excepted from the 1102 exception materials produced or marketed primarily for the express purpose of distance education are necessarily excluded from consideration under mediated instructional activities 34 srept 10731 at 15 citing the r eport on copyright and digital and distance education supra note 12 at 16162 footnote omittednot to limit asynchronous learning and ther efore do not require actual supervision in these environments30 further the performance must be offere d as regular part of the systematic mediated instructional activities of qualifying entities31 the teach act defines these activities to consist of integral parts of the class experience controlled by the instructor that are similar to the type of performance that would take place in live classroom setting32 the act adjusts its restrictions accordingly materials excluded from the mediated instructi onal activities context are t extbooks course packs or other material in any media typically purch ased or owned by students for their own use33 impact on fair use the determination of legitimate fair use of copyrighted work is generally both fact and casespecific the copyright office and the senate judiciary committee however are quite explicit in expressing the view that nothing in the amended exemption fo r distance education should be construed as altering the scope and applicability of fair use fair use is critical part of the di stance education landscape not only instructional performances and displays but also other educational materials or student downloading of course materials will continue to be subject to the fair use doctrine fair use applies as well to instructional transmissions not covered by the changes to section 1102 above thus for example the performance of more than limited portion of dramatic work in distance education program might qualify as fair use in appropriate circumstances34 ephemeral copies in addition to 17 usc 110 the teach act amends 17 usc 112 entitled limitations on excl usive rights ephemeral recordings an ephemeral recording is copy of work made for the purposes of later transmission by broadcasting organization entitled to transmit the work it adds new subsection f to permit an educationa l institution transmitting an authorized performance or display under 1102 to load copies or phonorecords of the performance or display on its servers for tran smission at the request of students the provision intends to facilita asynchronous education however the allowance for ephemeral c opies does not authorize the wholesale conversion of print or other analog versi ons of works into digital formats permitted conversion in this circumstance will be limited to the amount of the work authorized under 1102 and according to the senate judiciary committee onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33516crs7 35

the teach act remains silent on what constitutes technological measure copyright office report suggested that although unauthorized downstream copying technologies were being veloped they were not yet in widespread continuedif digital version of the work is available or the available digital version is encrypted35 conditions on recipients the teach act restricts the type of recipients to which display or performance can be presented for schools permissible recipients are officially enrolled students36 in government per missible recipients are officers or employees who receive the transmissions in the scope of their duties37 transmissions must also be made solely for and to the extent technologically feasible limited to permitted recipients38 the teach act drafters attempted to clarify that sole technologi cal feasibility does not include an imposition of general requirement of network security rather it is intended to require only that the stude nts or employees authorized to be recipients of the transm ission should be identified and the transmission should be technologically limited to such iden tified authorized recipients through systems such as password access or other similar measures39 mandatory preconditions for the exemption section 1102d establishes requirements that the trans mitting institution must follow to guard against copyright infringement of the works used under the distance l earning exemption the inclusion of such safeguards was deemed necessary according to the acts drafters because digital content may be more easily copied and distributed than material transmitted through analog broadcasts40 the teach act directs the transmitting institution to institute policies regarding copyright41 these policies may provide informational materials requests for compliance and notice to students that materials in use may be subject to copyright protection as the legislative history suggests the teach act drafters intend these policies to promote guidance and compliance rather than to be used as threat of punishment for failin g to respect copyright rights42 if the institution uses digital transmissions in distance learning it must apply

ensure that these two concerns are addressed they have di scretion over the manne r of implementation the reference to retention longer than class session relates back to earlier portions of the statute where exemptions for performances are given as an integral part of the class session46 the legislative history suggests class session in asynchronous distance education to mean period during which student is logged on to the server of the institution making the display or performance and is likely to vary with the needs of the student and w ith the design of th particular course47 in an attempt to clarify the senate judiciary committee suggested that this class session should resemble an actual face toface mediated class session for the purposes of asynchronous distance educa tion not particular time of duration48 the legislative history also suggests that the performance or display should not remain in the possession of the distance education recipient for longer than uses in particular class session the reference to accessible form qualifie s technological pr otection measures according to the drafters of the act educators could take measures to encrypt the digital transmission containing the work and limit access to the digital work using password such measures may constitute sufficient protection against excessive retention49 what are the obligations imposed here the house report though not the senate report extends the possibility that there is duty to guarantee that retention and further dissemination of the transmitted material will not occur instead the obligation of reasonable prevention posits an objective reasonableness standard regarding the ability of technological protection measures to prevent further retention and dissemination50 examples of current protection measures that might suffice are inhibitors that prevent the copying of streamed material and digital rights management systems that limit access and use of downloaded materials51
