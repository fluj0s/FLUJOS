francis albert frank sinatra and mother teresa of calcutta share common bond in american history these notable personages together with approximately 300 other individuals and the american red cross have been accorded the unique distinction of being awarded congressional gold medal through these awards congress has expressed public gratitude for distinguished contributions dramatized the virtues of patriotism and perpetuated the remembrance of great events this tradition of authorizing individually struck gold medals bearing the portraits of those so honored or images of events in which they participated is rich with history although congress has approved legislation stip ulating specific requirements for numerous other awards and decorations 1 there are permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of congressional gold medals when ch an award has been deemed appropriate congress has by special action provided for the creation of personalized medal to be given in its name which would in each instance truly record the approbation of grateful country

from the outset was imbued with the conviction that only the very highest achievements were entitled to such distinction and that the value of reward is enhanced by its rarity 2 instituting such tradition was considered both legitimate function and powerful instrument of nationality3 few inventions colonel davi d humphrey wrote in 1787 could be more happily calculated to diffuse the knowledge and preserve the memory of illustrious characters and splendid events than medalswhether we take into consideration the imperishable nature of the substance whence they are formed the facility of multiplying copies or the practice of depositing them in the cabinets of the curious4 with these words humphrey who had the responsibility for having the first gold medals stru ck in paris captured the essence of the feelings which inspired the continental congress to choose medals as its highest distinction and expression of national appreciation5 following long standing historical practice congress commissioned gold medals as tributes for what were considered to be the most distinguished achievements silver and bronze medals and ceremonial swords were awarded for less eminent but still notable accomplishments 6 of these only the gold medal has been continuously awarded to the present day 1 see decorations medals and badges in the general index of the united states code 2000 edition

great britain when on march 25 1776 george washington commander of the continental army was tendered the first congressional gold medal for his wise and spirited conduct in bringing about british evacuation of boston7 during the next 12 years the continental congress authorized an additional six gold medals for revolutionary military and naval leaders in 1777 major general horatio gates was recognized for his brave and successful efforts in bringing about the surrender of the british army at saratoga two years later similar honor was bestowed upon major general anthony wayne in 1779 for his courageous assault on the british at stony point new york8 gold medal was also given to major henry lee in commemoration of the skill and bravery he exhibited against the british at paulus hook ne w jersey brigadier general daniel morgan and major general nathaniel greene were praised for their gallant efforts in south carolina during 1781 six years later john paul jones was similarly honored

the continental congress was prompt in approving each of these medals those responsible for carrying out the wishes of congress were far less expeditious because of its close ties with france congress turned to paris for advice and assistance in having the medals struck unfortunately congress preoccupation with the american revolution together with the lengthy and complicated procedures which had to be followed in paris produced long delays thomas jefferson was not able to present washington his gold medal until march 21 1790 some fourteen years after it had been approved at the same time washington received mahogany box containing number of other gold medals ordered by congress soon thereafter these medals were transmitted by the former president to the various recipients 10 the gold

first gold medal authorized by the congress of the united states was given to captain thomas truxtun in 1800 for his gallant effort during the action between the united states frigate constellation

subsequently congress commissioned 27 gold medals for notable victories and achievements in the war of 1812 this was more than four times as many as it had given during the american revolution scarcely victory of any consequence was overlooked 13 the gold medal congress approved on february 22 1816 honoring captain james biddle s gallantry in capturing the british sloopofwar penguin was the final naval award of this character awarded by congress until world war ii14 g15g142g161g146g140g138g151g561g25g138g155g561 gold medals would continue to be awarded for military achievements until the civil war but with far less frequency in part this is explained by the fact that in the war with mexico naval operations were negligible and military operations were principally confined to two expeditions led respectively by major general zachary taylor and major general winfield scott taylors heroics against the mexicans earned him gold medals on three different occasions 15 scott for his efforts was accorded gold medal in 184816 gold medals were also given to 10 officers and seamen belonging or attached to the french british and spanish shipsofwar who on december 10 1846 gallantly

proposals in the 110th congress to change the procedures or criteria for awarding congressional gold medals during the 109th congress however on january 26 2005 the house by vote of 231 to 173 approved hr 54 the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005 sponsored by representative michael n castle the bill would have amended section 5111 of title 31 of the united states code by adding the following new subsection congressional gold medal standards 1 maximum numberbeginning on the date of the enactment of the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005 the secretary of the treasury may strike not more than 2 congressional gold medals for presentation pursuant to an act of the congress in any calendar year 2 program requirementsthe secretary may strike congressional gold medals only in accordance with the following requirements recipientsonly an individual may be recipient of congressional gold medal b timingno gold medal may be presented posthumously on behalf of any individual except during the 20year period beginning 5 years after the death of the individual unless the act of congress authorizing the striking of such medal was enacted before the death of such individual during house debate on hr 54 representative ca stle emphasized that his measure sought to maintain the prestige of the medal by limiting the number that may be awarded each year and to clarify that recipients are individuals and not groups passage of the measure he argued will ensure the future integrity and true honor of the award it is my goal that every recipient president civil rights leader military hero inventor or noted healer who receives the congressional gold medal will remain part of unique honor bestowed by the united states congress 97 house financial services committee chairman michael g oxley characterized the proposed legislation as commonsense effort to maintain the prestige of this award by limiting the number of medals that can be struck each year and by limiting the recipients to individuals rather than groups maintains the prestige and honor of receiving congressional gold medal combined with the requirement of minimum cos ponsorship level of twothirds of the house is the best way to preserve the integrity of the gold medal98 representative joseph crowley in opposing the legislation told his house colleagues we are rushing to act on an issue that does not represent problem who that received this medal in the past he asked was not worthy of it he also expressed dismay that the committee on 97 congressional gold medal enhancement act

g343g350g561rules refused to allow consideration of key amendment that would strike section of bill that only permits the granting of congressional gold medals to individuals although crowley tended to agree with the notion that distributing what is an exceptional honor to too many individuals could devalue the symbolic worth of gold medal there are occasions when more than one person is justified to receive the medal for their honorable actions in tandem with others he continued by emphasizing that had this bill already been law congress would not have been able to issue congressional gold dal to the little rock nine to president and mrs reagan or to martin luther king and coretta scott king 99 the house adopted by voice vote an amendment to hr 54 offered by representative oxley that would make the legislation effective immediately upon passage instead of the original effective date of january 1 2006 two amendments offered by representative crowley both of which were defeated would have 1 raised the number of gold medals that could be approved from two per calendar year to six per congress or an overall increase of two medals per congress and 2 required that there be an equitable distribution of gold medals approved between those sponsored by the majority and minority parties100 later the same day hr 54 was received in the senate read twice
