constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth and fourteenth amendments of the us constitution in furman the court ruled that the death penalty was arbitrarily and capriciously applied under existing law based on the unlimited discretion accorded to sentencing authorities in capital trials in response states began to revise their statutes to modify the discretion given to sentencing authorities these statutes went untested until the court decided gregg v georgia in 1976 in which it found in 72 decision that the death penalty did not per violate the eighth amendment the gregg decision allowed states to establish the death penalty under guidelines that excluded the arbitrariness of sentencing in capital cases as result statutory safeguards were developed to make sentencing more just and fair some of the changes included 1 in death penalty cases the determination of guilt or innocence must be decided separately from hearings in which sentences of life imprisonment or death are decided 2 the court must consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances in relationship to the crime and the defendant and 3 the death sentence must be subject to review

practice of executing mentally retarded persons in atkins v virginia and juveniles who commit capital crime while under the age of 18 in roper v simmons the court ruled that these executions were prohibited on eighth amendment cru and unusual punishment grounds the court expanded its doctrine on the ineff ective assistance of counsel in setting aside the death sentence for the petitioner in rompilla v beard because his lawyers failed to search files on his past convictions for mitigating evidence in spite of their conscientious efforts which led them to believe that it would be waste of time however the court determined in bell v thompson that the scheduling of an execution was reasonable and the actions of the court of appeals were an abuse of discretion although the case was remanded for an ineff ective assistance of counsel hearing by the court of appeals while ac ting upon an honest belief that its previous ruling had been decided erroneously also the courts decision in

99101 1958 chief justice earl warren deliv ered the opinion of the court the exact scope of the constitutional phrase cruel and unusual has not been detailed by this court but the basic policy reflected in these words is firmly established in the angloamerican tradition of criminal justice the phrase in our constitution was taken directly from the english declaration of rights of 1688 and the principle it represents can be traced back to the magna carta the basic concept underlying the eighth amendment is nothing less than the dignity of man while the state has the power to punish the amendment stands to assure that this power be exercised within the limits of civilized standards fines imprisonment and even execution may be imposed depending upon the enormity of the crime but any technique outside the bounds of these traditional penalties is constitutionally suspect this court has had little occasion to give precise content to the eighth amendment and in an enlightened democracy ch as ours this is not surprising but when the court was confronted with punishment of 12 years in irons at hard and painful labor imposed for the crime of falsifying public records it did not hesitate to declare that the penalty was cruel in its excessiveness and unusual in its character weems v united states 217 us 349 the court recognized in that case that the words of the amendment

1978specific crimes and allowed judicial or jury discretion bey ond the determination of guilt these statutes we re held to be unconstitutional8 in sum what may be gleaned from these five cases suggest that while the sentencing authority may possess some discretion it cannot be the unbridle d discretion which wa s found impermissible in furman the discretion must be limited and directed in order to minimize the potential for arbitrary and capricious actions aggravating and mitigating factors capital punishment may only be im posed under procedures that provide sentencers with those aggravating fact ors which will support imposition of the penalty and that require sentencers to take into account any evidence offered in mitigation for the defendant aggravating factors established either as elements of the capital offense or as statutory factors to be found by the senten cing judge or jury must be sufficiently clear and restricting according to the supreme courts decision in zant v stephens to avoid capricious and arbitrary decisions states that use aggravating circumstances to impose the death penalty must reasonably justify the imposition of more severe sentence for the defe ndant compared to others f ound guilty of murder9 the aggravating factors may not be so vague as to invite return to the arbitrary infliction of the penalty that the court saw in furman in maynard v carwright 10 the court made clear that not every murd er could fall under the specially heinous atrocious or cruel aggravating circumstance and that the state must construe such an aggravating circumstance so that there would be some principled way to distinguish the few cases in which the aggravating circumstance applies from the many cases in which it does not the test for whether particular aggravating factor passes constitutional muster is whether the statutory language is itself too vague to provide any guidance to the sentencer if so the question becomes whether the courts have further define d the vague terms so as to provide some guidance to the sentencer11 in lockett v ohio 12 the supreme court required ma ny states to revise their death penalty statutes by ruling that the sentencing authority in capital cases must consider every possible mitigating factor to the crime rather than limiting thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33008crs4 13 438 us 586 604 1977the

werent allowed to consider evidence including that he was 19 at the time of the robbery during which the murder occurred that he had troubled home life and that he had low iq and learning disability the texas court erroneously rejected the claim saying that it wasnt relevant because there was link between murder and his diminished capacity juvenile offenders in 1982 the supreme court was asked to decide whether the execution of juvenile offender was permi ssible under the constitution eddings v oklahoma15 was the first case the court agreed to hear based on the age of the offender who was 16 at the time he murdered police officer without deciding on the constitutionality of the juvenile death penalty the court vacated the juveniles death sentence on the basis that the trial had failed to consider additional mitigating circumstances16 however the case was significant because the court decided that the chronological age of minor is relevant mitigating factor that must be considered at sentencing17 writing for the majority justice powell stated youth is more than chronological fact it is time and condition of life when person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage our history is replete w ith laws and judicial recognition that minors especially in their earlier years generally are less mature and responsible than adults18 in 1988 the supreme court did

oklahomas death penalty statute set minimum age at which the death penalty could be imposed22 sentencing 15year old under the oklahoma statute was inconsistent with the standard for special care and deliberation required in death penalty cases23 in 1989 in stanford v kentucky24 and wilkins v missouri25 the supreme court held in 54 decision that the eighth amendment does not prohibit the death penalty for crimes committed at age 16 wilkins or 17 stanford while the thompson plurality used the threepart analysis to determine if sentencing juvenile to death constituted cruel and unusual punishment the stanford plurality did not the thompson v oklahomas standard eighth amendment analysis consisted of an evaluation of evolving standards of decency b the behavior of juries and legislators to determine what is abhorrent to the conscience of the community and c because of the juveniles reduced culpab ility the punishment is disproportionate to the severity of the crime and the application of the death penalty to this class of offenders does not measurably contribut to the purposes underlying the penalty the stanford plurality decision rejected the third element of the

particul ar punishment cruel and unusual30 plurality of the court rejected the suggestion that it the c ourt should bring its own judgment to bear on the desirability of permitting the death penalty for juveniles31 the court also found that public opinion polls and profe ssional associations were uncertain foundations on which to base constitutional law32 the dissenting judges argued that the record of state and federal legislation protecting juveniles because of their inherent immaturity was not relevant in formulating national consensus33 in 1997 christopher simmons was tried c onvicted and sentenced to death for first degree murder for crime that he committed at age 17 he appealed to the missouri supreme court which affirm ed the conviction and the sentence34 on his initial appeal simmons could not argue that his youth prohibited his execution because the us supreme court held in 1989 in stanford v kentucky that there was national consensus against the execution of young adults who were 16 or 17years ofage at the time of their crimes and as result executing juveniles was not considered cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth amendment35 hence the missouri supreme court ffirmed the circuit court of jefferson county missouri on the death sentence36 in 2002 the us supreme court in atkins v virginia reversed penry v lynaugh37 which held that national consensu s did not exist against the execution of the mentally retarded38 i n atkins v virginia the supreme court decided that consensus had developed in the thirteen years since penry was decided and that executing the mentally retarded violates the eighth amendment39 assuming that the us supreme courts ruling in atkins may correspondingly cause shift in the courts view toward the execution of j uvenile offenders s

two issues whether wer court may contradict previous ruling by the us supreme court particularly whether it was permissible for the missouri supreme court to conclude that the penalty of death for j uvenile offenders is cruel and unusual punishment which violates the ei ghth amendment and in contradiction of the courts decision in stanford v kentucky and b whether national consensus now opposes the execution of juvenile offenders younger than 18yearsofage and therefore whether the punishment now viol ates the eighth amendments prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in 54 opinion written by justice kennedy the court affirmed the holding of the missouri supreme court that impositi on of the juvenile death penalty had become truly unusual over the last decade43 and therefore violates the constitution similarly to reconsidering the permissibility of executing the retarded in atkins it also reconsidered the permissibility of executing juvenile offenders under the age of 18 in roper looking for guidance to the enactme nts of the legislatures that had considered the issue since its holding in stanford up to the time of the decision in roper 20 states did not specifically prohib it the execution of juvenile offender44 12 states had rejected the death penalty altogether45 and 18 by legislation had set the minimum age at 1846 in the 15 years between the stanford v kentucky and roper v simmons decisions 5 states either by legislati on or case law raised or established the minimum age at 1847 as starting point in its d ecision the court considered these changes in the law as well as the limited use of the death penalty in those states where the death penalty still was available for juveniles48 the court observed that the trend towa rd abolishing the death penalty for juveniles was evidence that societys current views regarding juveniles as categorically less culpable than the average criminal49 the court found three differences between juveniles and

unconstitutional if it 1 makes measurab contribution to acceptable goals of continuedrape offenders prior to furman v georgia78 and gregg v georgia79 there does not appear to be any cases regarding the supreme court review of the constitutionality of the imposition of capital punishment for the crime of rape in 1953 in rudolph v alabama80 the court denied writ of certiorari involving the appeal of sentence of death for the rape of the prosecutrix81 justices goldberg douglas and brennan dissented on the theory that there was an issue as to whether the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution permitted the imposition of the death penalty on convicted rapist who has neither taken nor endangered human life82 the dissent noted the trend in this country and thr oughout the world against punishing rape by death83 the dissent noted the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of our maturing society and questioned whether less severe penalty for the crime of rape would more likely ach ieve the goals of punishment84 the dissent also questioned whether the constitutional proscription against disproportionate punishment permitted the ta king of human life to prot ect value other than human life 85 it was not until 1977 that the supreme court in coker v georgia86 decided the issue of whether it was constitutional to impose the death penalty for the offense of rape applying the proportiona lity test the court decided that the death penalty is grossly disproportionate and ex cessive punishment for the cr ime of rape of an adult woman and therefore is forbidden by th eighth amendment as cruel and unusual punishment87 in order to ascertain whether the capital rape statute met this test the court looked to objective evidence wh ich was based upon public sentiment88 thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33008crs12 88 continued punishment and hence is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering or 2 is grossly out of pr oportion to the severity of the crime 89 id at 593 90 id the court noted that in 1925 18 states th district of columbia and the federal government authorized death as punishment for rape of an adult female by 1971 just prior to the decision in furman v georgia that number declined but not substantially to 16 states plus the federal government furman then invalidated most of the capital punishment statutes in this country includi ng the rape statutes because among other reasons of the manner in which the death penalty was imposed and utilized under those laws id 91 id at 593594 92 id at 594 the court stated if the most marked indication of societys endorsement of the death penalty for murder is the legislative response to furman it should also be telling datum that the public judgment with re spect to rape as reflected in the statutes providing the punishment for that crime has been dramatically different in reviving death penalty laws to satisfy furmans mandate none of the states that had not previously authorized death for rape chose to include rape among capital felonies of the 16 states in which rape had been capital offense only three provided the death penalty for rape of an adult woman in their revised statutes whi ch included georgia north carolina and louisiana in the latter two states the death penalty was mandatory for those found guilty id the court stated that two of these three states louisiana and north carolina had to revise their statutes because they called for mandatory death sentences and death penalties could not be mandatory pursuant to woodson v north carolina 428 us 280 1976 and roberts v stani slaus v louisiana 428 us 325 1 976 id when north carolina and louisiana revised their statutes second time the legislature authorized the death penalty for murder but excluded rape id the court also noted that florida mississippi and tennessee authorized the death penalty in some rape cases but only where the victim was child and the rapist an adult id at 595 93 id at 597evidence was based upon the history of legisl ative attitudes and jury responses as an objective approach in the process of termining the countrys present judgment regarding the acceptability of death as penalty for rape of an adult woman89 while considering the history the court noted that at time in the last 50 years has majority of the states au thorized death as punishment for rape90 although the court noted that after its decision in furman thirtyfive states reinstituted the death penalty for at least limited kinds of crimes91 these actions were an indication of the acceptance of the death penalty for murder however when you view the legislative responses to furman in regard to capital rape statutes different view is presented92 the court held that these actions by the state legislatures reflect rejection of capital punishment for rape wh ich confirmed their finding that death is disproportionate penalty for the rape of an adult woman93 the court did not just consider public sentiment based upon state legislatures and sentencing juries but concluded that it must also analyze for itself the question of the acceptability of the

acknowledging that short of homicide rape is the ultimate violation of self95 nonetheless the court found that in terms of moral depravity and the injury to the person and to the public rape does not compare with murder because it by finition does not include the death of or even the serious injury to another person96 the murderer kills the rapist if more than that does not97 notwithstanding the fact that coker was found to have committed rape under two aggrav ating circumstances the court said it did not change its holding that the death sentence is disproportionate punish ment for rape and consequently violation of the eighth amendment98 death penalty for one who does not kill since 1982 the supreme court has ddressed the law of parties99 and its applicability in capital cases on four occasions in enmund v florida100 the court decided in 1982 that enmunds agreement to act as getaway driver in robbery that ended in murder was insufficient to warra nt death enmund did not kill or intend to kill and thus his culpability is plainly diffe rent from that of the robbers who killed the court wrote we have concluded that imposition of the death penalty in these circumstances is

representation on the record from defendants counsel andor the defendant that defense counsel has explained the elements of the charge to the defendant sufficient to show the voluntariness of the guilty plea under henderson v morgan 426 us 637 647 1976 in 1987 the supreme court reconsidered enmund when it accepted tison v arizona103 for review in tison two brothers were senten ced to death for quadruple homicide their father committed after the brothers helped him escape from prison although the brothers did not intend to kill the court was of the opinion that their involvement in the prison break was substan tial and the supply of weapons they took along suggested that they were ready to kill if necessary the reckless disregard for human life implicit in knowingly engaging in criminal activities known to carry grave risk of death represents highly culpable mental state that may be taken into account in making capital sentencing judgment when that conduct causes its naturallethal result104 the court concluded we will not attempt to precisely delineate the particular type s of conduct and states of mind warranting imposition of the death penaltyrather we simply hold that major participation in the felonycombined with reckless indifference to human life is sufficient to satisfy the enmund culpability requirement105 eluding the court in bradshaw v stumpf 106 was the issue of whether the death penalty may be imposed when the prosecution argues in successive trials that each of two accomplices personally k illed the vic tim who had been murdered with single shot stumpf among other things pled guilty and was sentenced to death for crime for which the state later sought the death penalty for his accomplice107 the state knew one of the two juries would have to be in error if in separate trials they found first stumpf and then his acco mplice subject to the death pe nalty as the lone shooter the sixth circuit reversed stumpfs c onviction finding that the state secured convictions of both stumpf and his accompli ce for the same crime using inconsistent theories and also because his guilty pl ea was not knowing and voluntary because he was not aware that specific intent was an element of the crime to which he plead guilty while stumpf admitted to wounding the husband he denied ever having shot the mans wife despite this the jury f ound stumpf to

defendant because this issue was not properly presented to the court the defendant instead argued that his guilty plea was involuntary which the court re jected the case was remanded to the sixth circuit for it to consider the effect of the prosecu tors inconsistent theories on the death sentences109 however the court decided that stumpf was informed of the specific intent element of the aggravated murder ch arge and the prosecutorial inconsistencies between the two trials did not warrant voiding his guilty plea110 counseleffectiveness under the sixth amendment although it has been

counsels pe rformance was deficien t this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by th sixth amendment second the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense this requires showing that counsels errors we re so serious as to deprive the defendant of fair trial trial whose result is

burden to show that counsels inadequate pe rformance undermined the reliability of the verdict124 the court has also held in several cases that circumstances of that magnitude may also arise when the defendants attorney actively represented conflicting interests125 however according to the decision in mickens v taylor126 an analysis of conflict of interest will require the same analysis and demonstration of prejudice that is required under strickland as opposed to the presumption of prejudice and the resulting automatic reversal127 in florida v nixon 128 the supreme court through justice

unconstitutional due to the arbitrariness and discriminatory impact it had on racial minorities and the poor four years later new capital punishment laws which were suppose to prevent arbitrariness

mcclesky v kemp 144 challenge was based on study that showed black murderers of white victims were far more likely to be sentenced to death than black murderers of black victims which the court

capital sentencing the supreme court has considered cases addressing the issue of juror bias in capital cases and the defendants right to fair trial guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments these cases have focused on either the jurors attitude regarding the death penalty ie whether they are strongly opposed or in favor of the death penalty or racially biased in witherspoon v illinois 160 the court held that sentence of death cannot be imposed or recommended if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction161 the court noted that even someone opposed to the death penalty can make the discretionary judgment entr usted to him by the state and can thus obey the oath162 however state may exclude those juro rs whose attitudes about the death penalty would affect their decision regarding the defendants guilt163 later the court qualified witherspoon by stating that it did not hold that the state could exclude only those jurors who w ould automatically vote against capital punishment164 in

whether there would be any chance of parole while serving life sentence177 the constitution bars prosecutors and trial judges from misleading juries178 or from unfairly influencing their decisi on on capital punishment thus in dawson v delaware 179 the court vacated dawsons death sentence because th state introduced evidence of his association with the aryan brotherhood against him during the punishment phase of his capital murder trial whether such evidence is relevant must be determined by context sensitive balancing test the court said that the evidence in dawson left the belief that the state had introduced the evidence not because of its relevance to the proceedings but rather simply because the jury would find these beliefs morally reprehensible180 for the same reason it initially concluded that victim impact statements were unconstitutional and in violation of the eighth amendment181 view it adjusted shortly thereafter when it held that victim impact evidence violates the constitution only if it is so unduly prejudicial that it renders the proceedings fundamentally unfair182 and the same sentiment prevailed when the court reversed the death sentence of c onvicted murderer who was shackled in leg irons and handcuffed to chain around his wa ist when he faced missouri jury during his sentencing hearing183 justice breyer writing for the majority stated that shackling almost always implies that authorities consider the offender danger to the community factor juries weigh in considering whether to impose the death penalty184 in addition the court has made clear that defendant has constitutional right to jury determination of any facts critical to finding of guilt or to imposition of the death penalty in walton v arizona 185 walton challenged

must be found by jury beyond reasonable doubt in order to be consistent with the sixth amendment188 in ring v arizona 189 the court addressed the conflict between the walton and apprendi decisions in

of other decisions sometimes these decisions may provide relief for defendant who has already been convicted generally the courts have held that new rules of procedure will not be applied retroactively hence unless the case is on direct appeal at the time of the decision is rendered the defendant cannot take advantage of it 215 in direct appeal the court is limited to revi ewing the record from the trial court it will not consider evidence which was not submitted in habeas corpus the same limitations are not present and the court may consider additi onal evidence in direct appeal almost any violation of the law may be addressed this can include violations of statutes and rules in contrast habeas corpus is generally limited to constitutional claims as result the violation of

two girls in 1993one of the hallmarks of new supreme court decisions is that until their announcement many of the lower courts are likely to have ruled erroneously on the issue the question becomes
