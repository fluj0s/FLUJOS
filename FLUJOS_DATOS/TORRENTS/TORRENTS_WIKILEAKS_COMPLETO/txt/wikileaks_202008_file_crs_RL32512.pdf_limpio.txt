texas health care liability act to exercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions are completely preempted by erisa 502a and are thus removable to federal court the suits were brought to reme dy denial of benefits under an erisa regulated health benefit pl an removal questions are ordinarily determined by what appears on the face of wellpleaded complaint in this case state law claim but there is an exception when federal statute wholly displaces the statelaw cause of action erisa 502 which authorizes suit to recover benefits due participan t under the terms of his plan wholly displaces the texas law in these cases erisa establishes uniform federal regulation of employee benefit plans and calls for an integrated system of enforcement state law cause of action that duplicat supplements or supplants erisas remedy is preempted the duties allegedly imposed by the texas law in these cases do not arise independently of eris or the plan terms rather those duties derive from failure to exercise ordinary care when making health care decisions denying benefits covered by plan th respondents were entitled to such benefits only because of the covera ge of an erisaregulated plan by its terms the texas law imposes obligati on on providers for refusals to provide treatment that is not covered by pla n the fifth circuits reasons for finding preemption are rejected labeling the actions as ones for tort rather than contract damages does not change th scope of erisa preemption and the erisa exception for laws that regulate insurance is inapplicable cases involving mixed eligibility and trea tment decisions by physicians are not controlling 90 opinion for unanimous court by t homas concurring opinion by ginsburg joined by breyer alaska dept of envtl

facility in an attainment area governed by the prevention of significant deterioration psd program when epa finds that the state permitting authoritys determination of best available control technology bact for the facility is unreasonable the act authorizes epa to order construction halted when state is not acting in compliance with the acts requirements or if construction or modification of majo r emitting facility does not conform to the requirements of the psd program the fact that the act entrusts state permitting agencies with initial and primary authority for identifying bact does not preclude epa oversight and th court credits epas longstandinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32512crs2 construction that epa retains authority to rule on the reasonableness of state bact determinations the act does not limit enforcement to state administrative and judicial processes the burden of produc tion and persuasion remains with epa regardless of whether epa initiates civil enforcement action or whether the permittee brings challenge in state or federal court to stopconstruction order ep did not abuse its discretion in this case in finding that the alaska agency adec acted unreasonably in its bact determination for generator at zinc concentrate mine adec initially determined that selective catalytic reduction was the most stringent control technology that was technically and economically feasible for reducing nitrogen oxide emissions the act requires state agency making such finding to designate the technology as bact absent technical energy environmental or economic considerations justifying conclusion that the technology is not achievable for that particular source adec how ever designated different technology low nox as bact citing generalized concerns about economic diversity and the mines role as employer in the area but with actual evidence that the mine would have to cut employment or raise prices because adecs action had factual basis in the record it did not qualify as reasonable and epa validly issued the stop orders 54 opinion of court by ginsburg join ed by stevens oconnor souter and breyer dissenting opinion by kennedy joined by rehnquist scalia and thomas ashcroft v aclu 124 s ct 2783 72 uslw 4649 62904 first amendment child online protection act the court of appeals correctly affirmed district court order enjoining enforcement of the child online protection act copa because it likely violates the first amendment copa imposes criminal penalties for knowingly posting on the world wide web for commercial purposes material that is harmful to minors copa provides an affirmative defense for defendant who has restricted access by minors by requiring use of credit card or an age verification certificate or by employing any other reasonable measures that are feasible under available technology the district courts conc lusion that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits rested on the governments failure to show that the less restrictive alternative of filtering proposed by the plaintiffs would not be as effective as the challenged restrictions filters for adult content are less restrictive than copa filters apply selective rest rictions on speech at the receiving end rather than universal restrictions at the source filters allow adults the right to see material wit hout having to identify themselves and above all promoting the use of filte rs does not involve reliance on criminal penalties and would thus remove the potential chilling effect of criminal sanctions moreover filters may well be more effective than copa filters can prevent minors from seeing all pornography while copa prohibits only that pornography posted from within the united states an estimated 40 of pornography on the web comes from overseas and of course domestic providers could simply move their opera tions overseas in order to avoid copa coverage the fact that congress may not require use of filters does not remove filters as legislative alternative since congress undoubtedly may act to encourage the use of filters there are also practical reasons for leaving the injunction in place the potential harms of copa enforcement which wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32512crs3 place serious chill upon protected speec h outweigh those of enjoining enforcement since there are ongoing prosecutions that can be disrupted by the injunction moreover the factual record is not current and there are substantial factual disputes to be re solved by the district court on remand 54 opinion of

reese 124 s ct 1347 72 uslw 4227 3204 habeas corpus fair presentation of federal claim in state court the petitioner who sought federal habeas corpus relief did not fairly present his claim in state court proceedings and therefore did not adequately alert the oregon supreme court to the federal nature of his claim the petitioner asserted ineffective assistance by both trial and appellate counsel in violation of oregon law and alleged that his trial court counsel violated several provisions of the federal constitution he did not however allege that his separate appellate ineffective assistan ce claim rested on federal law because the state petition failed to alert the oregon supreme court to the federal nature of the claim the petitioner failed to satisfy the fair presentation standard the ninth circuit erred in holding that the fair presentation requirement was satisfied because the oregon supreme c ourt had the opportunity to read the lower court decision they were asked to review such rule would impose serious burden on state ppellate courts especially those with discretionary review powers on the other hand unreasonable burden is placed on state prisoners by requiring that they indicate the federal law basis for their claim in state court petition or brief 81 opinion of court by breyer jo ined by rehnquist oconnor scalia kennedy souter thomas and ginsbur g dissenting

v maryland 1963 that the prosecutions suppr ession of evidence violated his due process rights the petitioner also established cause for failing to raise the brady claim in state court the prosecution failed to disclose evidence that prosecution witness whose testimony was crucial at the capital sentencing phase of the petitioners murder trial was paid informer moreover the prosecution asserted before trial that it would disclose all brady material and did not correct the witnesss perjurious trial testimony denying his connections to the state under the circumstances it was not incumbent on the petitioner to prove the states representations false rather the petitioner was entitled to treat the prosecutors submissions as tr uthful the appeals court should have issued certificate of appealab ility with respect to second brady claim arising from another witnesss perjur ed testimony denying that he had talked to anyone about his testimony when in fact he had rehearsed his testimony

social security administrations ssas interpretation of social security act requirement for finding of disability is reasonable and entitled to deference under principles established in chevron v nrdc 1984 the statute provides that person is disabled if he not only is unable to do his previous work but cannot engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy the ssa determined that the respondent is not disabled because she remains physically and mentally able to do her previous work as an elevator operator and that it is irrelevant whether such jobs still exist in significant numbers in the national economy under this reading the phrase which exists in the national economy modifies any ot her kind of substantial gainful work and does not modify his previous work construing statute in accord with the rule of the last antecedent is quite sensible as matter of grammar moreover the interpretation does not lead to absurd results there is plausible reason why congress might ve wanted to deny benefits to person able to perform job that long er exists in the vast majority of cases the test will serve as proxy for the claimants ability to do some work that does exist in the national economy and in such cases the ssa will be spared the administrative burden of determining which jobs the claimant can perform 90 opinion for unanimous court by scalia beard v banks 124 s ct 2504 72 uslw 4578 62404 habeas corpus retroac tive application of constitutional ruling the courts 1988 ruling in mills v maryland invalidating law requiring capital sentencing juries to disregard mitigating factors th at they have not found unanimously does not apply retroactively to the respondent s sentence which had become final when the court denied certiorari in 1987 the fact that the pennsylvania supreme court considered the respondents mills claim in 1995 under discretionary relaxed waiver rule does not alter the conclusi on that for federal habeas corpus purposes the conviction had become final in 1987 mills announced new rule of constitutional interpretation that was not dictated by thenexisting precedent and cannot be applied retroactively the exception allowing retroactive application of w atershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding does not apply that exception applies only to small core of rules requiring observance of procedures that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty such as the gideon v wainwright rule requiring that indigent defendants be represented by counsel in felony cases however laudable the mills rule might be it works fundamental sh ift in our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to funda

to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32512crs5 pittman underground water act of 1919 th pittman act authorized the secretary of the interior to designate certain nonmineral lands in nevada on which settlers could obtain permits to drill for water settler who could demonstrate successful irri gation of at least 20 acres became entitled to patent for up to 640 acres each patent issued under the act was to contain reservation to the united states of all the coal and other valuable minerals in the lands together with the right to prospect for mine and remove the same the court refuses to overrule watt v western nuclear inc 1983 interpreting the stock raising homestead acts reservation to the united states of all the coal and other minerals as reserving sand and gravel the different interpretation of the pittman act is explained by the plurality as resulting from the different language of its reserva tion and by the concurrence as resulting from declining to extend western nuclears reasoning

sentence above the standard range if he finds substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence is inconsistent with the sixth amendment right to trial by jury as interpreted in apprendi v new jersey 2000 in apprendi the court ruled that any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved bey ond reasonable doubt in this case the petitioner plead guilty to seconddegree ki dnaping involving use of firearm for which the standard range set by wa shingtons sentencing reform act was 4953 months the judge conducted ntencing hearing found that the petitioner had acted with deliberate cr uelty statutory ground for departure and sentenced him to 90 months for apprendi purposes the statutory maximum judge may impose is the maximum allowable solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant and here the facts supporting the deliberate cruelty ruling were neither admitted by petitioner nor found by jury but instead were found by the judge cases that involved application of statutory minimum or indeterminate sentencing are not on point apprendi reflects the need to give intelligible content to the right of jury trial right that is mere procedural formality but fundamental reservation of power in our constitutional structure decision therefore cannot turn on whether or to what degree trial by jury impairs the efficiency or fairness of criminal justice alternatives to apprendi rule that the jury trial right extends only to whatever facts the legislature chooses to label as elements of the crime or rule that the legislat ure may not go too far in defining crime elements and sentencing factors are unsatisfactory 54 opinion of court by

first habeas corpus motion under 28 usc 2255 unless the court informs the litigant of its intent to recharacterize warns the litigant that this recharaterizati on will subject subsequent 2255 motions to the laws restrictions on second or successive motions and provides the litigant with the opportunity to withdraw or to amend the filing because the court in this case did not so warn the pro litigant about the consequences of its recharacterizing as habeas petition his rule 33 motion for new trial the recharacterized motion does not count as 2255 motion the fact that the petitioner failed to appeal the recharacterization does not validate it one of the very points of the required warning is to help the pro litigant understand whether he should appeal nd the lack of warning prevents his making an informed judgment on the matter the law of the case doctrine cannot prevent court from disregarding an earlie r holding in an appropriate case the bar on certiorari to review the grant or denial of authorization to file second or successive habeas petition 28 usc 2244 is inapplicable the subject of the certiorari petition in this case is not the denial of an authorization for second habeas petition but rather the lower courts refusal to recognize that the petition was the first not the second habeas petition 90 opinion of court by breyer join ed by rehnquist stevens oconnor

anticutback rule erisas anticutback rule which provides that pension plan amendment may not decrease participants accrued benefit prohibits amendment of pl an to expand the categories of post retirement employment that trigger susp ension of payment of early retirement benefits that have already accrued wh the respondent took early retirement in 1996 his pension plan provided that benefits would be suspended if he engaged in disqualifying employment defined at that time to include any job as construction worker but not to in clude any supervisory position after the respondent took job as supervisor in the construction industry the plan expanded the definition of disqualifying employment to include any job in any capacity in the construction industry and plan administrators moved to suspend payments to the respondent er isa prohibits application of this plan amendment to the respondent eris explicitly provides that plan amendment which has the effect of eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits erisa defines accrued benefit circularly but as matter of common sense participants benef its must be understood with reference to the conditions imposed on receiving those benefits and an amendment placing materially greater restrictions on the receipt of the benefit reduces the benefit just as surely as decrease in the size of the monthly benefit payment narrow technical arguments that benefit is merely the amount that plan is legally obligated to pay and that suspension of benefit is not an elimination or reduction are rejected an irs regu lation implementing duplicative provisions of the internal revenue code interprets the anticutback provision to flatly prohibit plan amendments that attach new conditions to benefits that anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32512crs7 employee has already earned and an unreasoned statement in the internal revenue manual cannot trump that formal regu lation separate erisa provision that refers to suspension of pa yments is irrelevant since it deals with the entirely different question of benefit forfeitures and because it relates to terms that can be offered up front not to adop tion of retroactive amendments 90 opinion for unanimous court by sout er concurring opinion by breyer joined by rehnquist oconnor and ginsburg cheney v united stat district court 124 s ct 2576 72 uslw 4567 62404 mandamus discovery against vice president the court of appeals erred in concluding that it lacked authority to issue mandamus to the district court to vacate discovery orders issued to the vice president and other federal officials who were members of the national energy policy development group for information relating to participation in the group by nonfederal individuals the plaintiffs in the district court had alleged violation of the federal advisory committee act faca althoug h each individual appointed to the group was federal official and fa ca exempts from coverage committees composed wholly of federal officers nd employees the plaintiffs alleged that faca applied because the nonfederal pa rticipants in group meetings were facto members of the group the court of appeals reasoned that it had authority to exercise the extraordinary remedy of mandamus to halt discovery and that the government could protect its rights by asserting executive privilege with narrow specificity in response to th discovery requests but the fact that the vice president is party removes the case from the category of ordinary discovery orders where interlocutory ppellate review is unavailable through mandamus or otherwise presidential c onfidentiality merits strong protection and courts have recognized the p aramount necessity of protecting the executive branch from vexatious litigation that might distract it from the energetic performance of its constitutional duties the appeals courts reliance on united states v nixon 1974 is misplaced nixon was criminal case and the information sought was re levant to criminal proceeding here the information was sought in support of civil suit and withholding the information does not hamper another branchs ability to perform its essential functions the court of appeals must reconsider the parties arguments with respect to the facto membership interpretation of faca all courts must be mindful of the burdens imposed on the executive branch in any future proceedings 72 merits 522 relief opinion of court by kennedy joined by rehnquist stevens oconnor and breyer and joined in part by scalia and thomas concurring opinion by

licensing of adult business the citys ordinance governing licensing of adult businesses is not facially unconstitutional the ordinance requires denial of license in certain circumstances eg if the applicant is underage provides false info rmation has previously had license revoked has operated an adult business determined to be public nuisance or has not paid taxes on time because the licensing criteria are objective neutral andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32512crs8 nondiscretionary they do not pose dangers of censorship and an adult business is not entitled to an unusually speedy judicial decision if license is denied the citys argument that prompt judi cial decision is not required but only prompt judicial review misreads precedent the latter standard set forth in fwpbs v dallas 1990 is not different from the former from freedman v maryland 1965 in each case the emphasis was upon issuance of license within reasonable period of time what is reasonable period of time however may vary in di fferent circumstances freedmans special judicial review procedures develope d to expedite review of prior restraint arising from movie censorship and requiring d ecision within two or three days are not necessary in this case instea d colorados ordinary judicial review procedures suffice as long as the courts remain sensitive to the need to prevent first amendment harms that may arise here the typical first amendment harm is different fro m that at issue in freedman where censors reviewed the content of film and denial likely meant complete censorship the ordinance at issue here does not seek to censor content but instead applies reasonably objective nondiscretionary crite ria unrelated to the content of the expressive materials 90 opinion of court by breyer join ed by

washington 124 s ct 1354 72 uslw 4229 3804 confrontation clause outof court testimonial statements testimonial statements by witnesses absent from trial are admissible in criminal trial only if the declarant is unavailable to testify and only if the defe ndant has had prior opportunity to crossexamine the declarant the rule of ohio v roberts 1980 allowing such testimonial evidence if it bears particularized guarantees of trustworthiness is rejected as inconsistent with the requirements of the confrontation clause the common law in 1791 conditioned admissibility on unavailability of the absent witness and on prior oppor tunity to crossexamine and those limitations were incorporated in the confrontation clause the roberts test departs from this historical understanding in part by allowing ex parte testimony upon mere finding of reliability the clause commands not that evidence be reliable but that reliability be assessed in particular manner by testing in the crucible of crossexamination reliability is an amorphous concept that is manipulable and the roberts test has been applied to admit core testimonial statements that the confrontation clause plainly meant to exclude although this case involving policestation statement by the defendants wife whos testimony at trial was barred by the marital privilege c ould have been resolved by reweighing reliability under roberts the court declines to do so the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the constitution actually prescribes confrontation 90 opinion of

safetymonitoring rules applicable to mexican motor carriers operating within the united states did not violate the requirements of the national environmental policy act nepa for similar reasons the agencys decision not to perform conformity review under the clean air act was permissible the increase in crossborder operations of mexican motor carriers and the release of emissions by those tr ucks is not an effect of the agencys safety rules but rather results from the presidents action in lifting the moratorium on such operations in order to comply with nafta the agency has ability categorically to prevent the operations of mexican motor carriers and consequently preparation of an eis on such increased operations within the united states could not fu lfill nepas purpose of informing agency decision making the agency was correct in limiting its environmental assessment to effects likely to arise from the increase in the number of roadside inspections occasioned by its new rules and in concluding that these effects would be minor similarly consideration of only those emissions that would result from the increased inspections was appropriate for purposes of determining whether emissions would exceed threshold rates and thereby activate the clean air acts conformity restriction on federal actions that facilitate violation of state implementation plans

award of 1000 the relevant statutory language sp ecifies that the ited states can be held liable for actual da mages sustained but in case shall person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of 1000 straightforward textual analysis supports the conclusi on that actual damages must be shown the simplest reading of the phrase person entitled to recovery is that it refers to the immediately preceding provi sion identifying an individual who has sustained actual damages moreove r the phrase would serve purpose if congress had intended to require the minimum without proof of actual damages there is traditional unde rstanding in tort law that recovery requires proof of some harm for wh ich damages can reas onably be assessed the common law exception allowing for award of general damages to privacy tort victim is unavailing because general damages are not authorized by the privacy act instead congress in enacting the privacy act directed study commission to consider whether the gove rnment should be liable for general damages also the acts drafting hist ory shows that congress cut out the very language in the bill that would have authorized presumed damages language recognizing the right of adversely affected plaintiffs to sue limits that right to plaintiffs who satisfy article iii standing requirements but does not s upplant the actual damages requirement there is precedent in the common law of defamation for presuming minimum level of damages for those litigants ablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32512crs10 to show some damages but not for t hose who are unable to do so

consider ation of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim the respondent has serv ed more than six years of 16year sentence imposed in error under the xas habitual offender law and the underlying theft crime for which he wa s convicted carries maximum penalty of two years in jail the respondent however has viable and significant claim of ineffective assistance of c ounsel and success on the

erred in holding that the absence of an interrogation precluded the petitioners request for suppression of jailhouse statem ents alleged to be the fruits of statements taken at his home in violation

indicted and in the absence of his attorney the appeals court erroneously conducted its fruits analysis under the fifth amendment rather than under the sixth amendment the issue for the appeals court to decide on remand is whether the rationale for th fifth amendment rule of oregon v elstad 1985 that the admissibility of jailhouse statements turns solely on whether the statements were knowingly

that the purpose of the adea was to prohibit discrimination against older workers in fa vor of younger workers not to protect relatively younger workers from discrimin ation in favor of relatively older workers the argument that plain meaning of the word age requires the opposite conclusion is reject ed social history re veals the understanding that age discrimination refers to discrimination against the old age means old age when teamed with discrimination the fact that th word age is used in its primary sense elsewhere in the act does not require that it be given the same broad meaning in the context of discrimination the cardinal rule that statutory language must be read in context defeats application of the presumption that word must be give n the same meaning throughout statute the presumption is not rigid and readily yields whenever different contexts reasonably warrant the conclusion that different meanings were intended sponsors statement in colloquy during congressional debate asserting that the bill would prohibit age discrimination between 42yearold and 52yearold whichever way the decision went is dismissed as single outlying statement washed away by tide of context and history the eeocs regulation adopting the sponsors interp retation is clearly wrong and hence not entitled to deference the fact that title vii of the civil rights act has been interpreted to prohibit discrimination against whites as well as against racial minorities does not require parallel interpretation of the adea the prohibition against age discrimination is readily read more

categories of suits prohibited by the tia ie suits to enjoin suspend or restrain the assessment levy or collection of any tax under state law the taxpayers suit is clearly not one to enjoin the levy or collection of the tax so the case turns on the meaning of assessment the word read in its statutory context is closely tied to the collection of tax ie the assessment is the official recording of liability that triggers levy and collection efforts this collectionpropelling reading is reinforced by the interpretational rule against superfluous statutory language if the word assessment by itself comprehended the entire scheme for charging or taxing then the words levy and collection would have been superfluous the tia is modeled on the earlier antiinjunction act which bars any court from entertaining suit to restrain the assessment or collection of any federal tax the antiinjunction act has been interpreted to require that taxes first be paid and that challenges to liability be

deprivation of constitutional rights by anyone acting under co lor of state law it must yield to the more specific and restrictive habeas corpus statute if an inmates claims fall within the core of habeas corpus eg if he seeks injunctive relief challenging the fact of his conviction or the duration of his sentence it is not necessary to decide whether section 1983 may be used to enjoin the use of particular method of execution in order to approve reliance on the section to challenge use of the cutdown method to gain venous access to prisoner applicability of section 1983 was conceded if the purpose of access were to provide dical treatment of an inmate not facing execution and there is reason to rule differently if the purpose is preparation for execution here the inmates claim is premised on the assumption that the cutdown procedure is unnecessary in order to gain venous access if on remand the district court termines that the procedure is necessary for administration of the lethal injection th it will have to consider how to treat methodofexecution claims generally s imilarly the court ma have to consider the appropriateness of habeas corpus in the broader context if the

require ffirmative authoriza tion from the state before it could run utility ordinarily federal preemption of state statute prohibiting private conduct allows that conduct to occur because however

decisions the court determined that an affirmative defense is available when hostile work environment case i nvolves claim of sexual harassment in the absence of tangible employment action but is unavailable if the harassment culminates in tangible em ployment action the distinction is derived from principles of agency law tangible employment actions such as hiring firing failure to promote or r eassignment are easily attributable to the employer because they fall within the special province of the supervisor an agent of the employers in cases not involving such tangible actions however it is less obvious that the agency relation is the driving force and the employer may defeat vicarious liability by establishing that it had readily available and effective policy for reporting and resolving sexual harassment complaints and that the employee did not avail herself of that complaint process in such instances the employee has the duty to mitigate harm but the employer bears the burden to allege and prove the affirmative defense in constructive discharge case in which it is alleged that the working conditions were so intolerable that reasonable person would have felt compe

bankruptcy law the discharge of debt by bankruptcy court is an in rem proceeding the court has previously held that the eleventh amendment does not bar federal jurisdiction over in rem admiralty

included in general discharge order unless ex cepting the debt from the order would impose an undue hardship on the debtor but the undue hardship determination is still part of the in rem proceeding service of process required by the rules but not by the statute when the debtor initiates an undue hard ship determination does not offend the eleventh amendment issuance of process is normally an

the united states after the court held in 1941 that the united states is not person subject to antitrust liability congress amended the law to allow the united states to bring antitrust suits it did not however change the definition of person and thus did not change the fact that the united states cannot be an antitrust defendant because the pra makes the service an establishment of the executive

show reasonable probability that he would not have pleaded guilty if he had been properly warned with few exceptions not even preserved error requires reversal without regard to the mistakes effect on the proceeding the standard used in rule 52 which governs claims of error not preserved by timely objection is error that affects substantia l rights and this means error with prejudicial effect on the outcome there are reasons why the burden should not be too easy for someone in the res pondents position rule 52 encourages timely objections and avoidance of wasteful reversals and the rule governing unpreserved objections should recognize the particular importance of the finality of guilty pleas the appeals courts test whether the error was minor or technical and whether the fendant understood the rights at issue requires examination of the effect of the omitted warning on defendants decision whether to go to trial in this case the fact that the plea agreement itself read to the

assessment of tax against partnership within the threeyear period after filing return suffices to extend the statute of limitations for another 10 years for collection of the tax from the general partners as well as from the partnership it was not necessary for irs to separately assess the partners within the original threeyear limitations period it is the partnership that is primarily liabl for the employment taxes at issue here under section 6203 of the internal reve nue code tax assessment records the liability of the taxpayer the liability in this case arose from the partnerships failure to pay employment taxes under section 3402 every employer is required to deduct and wit hhold from wages an employment tax and section 3403 provides that the employer shall be liable for the payment of that tax the employer in this case is the partnership and it is the partnership therefore that is the taxpayer for purposes of ssessment under section 6203 the fact that california law makes individua l partners jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership is irrelevant to th taxpayer determination taxes are ordinarily selfassessed by filing if the taxpayer fails to file the irs can assess all taxes and penalties owed it is the tax that is assessed not the taxpayer and the statute of limitations attaches to the debt as whole nothing in the code requires the irs to duplicate its efforts by separately assessing the same tax against individuals or entities who are not the actual taxpayers but are by reason of state law liable for paym ent of the taxpayers debt

ause that preserves antitrust remedies the acts detailed regulatory scheme does not shield regulated entities from antitrust liability through operation of the doctrine of implied immunity remedy is available however through application of antitrust law as general matter the sherman act does not prohibit refusal to deal and breach of statutory obligation to deal does not fit within the few narrow exceptions to this general principle the exception recognized in the aspen skiing case 1985httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32512crs40 involving company that terminated cooperative venture with competitors and declined to accept retail prices for its product is distinguished because the statutory obligation to deal makes the defendants prior c onduct irrelevant and because the services the defendant withheld are not otherwise marketed or offered to the public the essentia l facilities doctrine is ina pplicable because the 1996 acts extensive provision for access make s it unnecessary to impose judicial doctrine of forced access creating new exception is not justified by traditional antitrust principles the exis tence of the 1996 act designed to deter and remedy anticompetitive harm suggests that there are only slight benefits to be gained by antitrust intervention any such benefits may be outweighed by the costs which include the possibility of false positives derived from mistaken

brought him to the police station at the request of police officers and he was taken to an interview room and questioned for two hours his parents we re not allowed to accompany him and he was not given miranda warning the determination of whether suspect is in custody for miranda purposes is an objective test that depends upon whether reasonable person would have felt that he was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave here there were conflicting indications and fair minded jurists could disagree over whether the respondent was in custody weighing against an incustody finding are the facts that the police did not transport the respondent to the sta tion he and his pare nts were told the interrogation would be brief he was not threatened nd he was allowed to leave after the interrogation other facts point in the opposite direction the interrogation lasted two hours respondent wa s not told he could leave and his parents were not allowed to be present the ninth

defense counsels summation is highly defere ntial and doubly deferen tial when it is conducted through the lens of federa l habeas in this case which turned on whether stabbing was accidental the defense attorney pointed out some conflicts in an eyewitness account cautioned that neither his clients criminal record nor the victims state of pregnancy was relevant to his clients guilt and emphasized that the jury had to sift through the conflicting testimony and determine who was lying the ninth circuit based its ruling in part on counsels failure to highlight other potentially exculpatory evidence and in part on his reminding the jury about his clients criminal record but judicious selection of arguments for summation is core exercise of defense counsel s discretion and there is strong presumption that counsels emphasis is matter of t actics rather than sheer neglect acknowledging the clients shortcomings is calculated risk in seeking to build credibility with the
