from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to michael mann mannmeteopsuedu jim salinger jsalingeraucklandacnz subject re enso blamed over warming paper in jgr date tue jul 28 101545 2009 cc trenbertucaredu jrenwickniwaconz bmullanniwaconz gavin schmidt gschmidtgissnasagov jim et having now read the paper in moment of peace and quiet there are few things to bear in mind the authors of the original will have right of reply so need to ensure that they dont have anything to come back on from doing the attached year or so ago there is word limit and also it is important to concentrate only on few key points as we all know there is so much wrong with the paper it wont be difficult to come up with few but it does need to be just two or three the three aspects i would emphasize are 1 the first difference type filtering 14 implies that they smooth the series with 12 month running mean then subtract the value in jan 1980 from that in jan 1979 then feb 1980 from feb 1979 and so on as we know this removes any longterm trend the running mean also probably distorts the phase so this is possibly why they get different lags from others using running means also enhances the explained variance perhaps we should repeat the exercise without the smoothing 2 figure 4 and figure 1 show the unsmoothed gtta series these clearly have trend perhaps show the residual after extracting the enso part 3 they do the same first difference on the smoothed soi the soi doesnt explain the climate jump in the 197677 period their arguments in 30 are all wrong few minor points there are some negative rr values just after equation 3 im sure tom wigley wouldnt have proposed nino events occurring after volcanoes attached this paper as well from quick read it doesnt say what is purported in fact it seems to show clearly how the analysis should have been done there is paper by ben santer more recent where he applies the same type of extraction procedure to models ill send this separately as it is large in case it is too large here is the reference santer bd wigley tml doutriaux c boyle js hansen je jones pd meehl ga roeckner sengupta s and taylor ke 2001 accounting for the effects of volcanoes and enso in comparisons of modeled and observed temperature trends journal of geophysical research 106 2803328059 finally ive attached paper i wrote in 1990 where i did something similar to what they did i looked at residuals from gaussian filter and i added the smoothed data back afterwards i was working at the annual timescale and i did have many more years cheers phil at 0019 25072009 michael mann wrote hi jim grant foster tamino did nice job in previous response attached we wrote to similarly bad article by schwartz which got lot of play in contrarian circles since hes already done some of the initial work in debunking this i sent him an email asking hi if we was interested in spearheading similar effort w this one let get back to folks after ive heard back from him and we can discuss possible strategy for moving this forward mike on jul 24 2009 at 611 pm jim salinger wrote kia orana all from the tropical south pacific yes phil bit like midsummer nights dream and gavin taminos bang up job is great and good that you go up with stuff on real climate mike as kevin is preoccupied for the scientific record we need rebuttal somewhere pulled together who wants to join in on the multiauthored effort i am happy to coordinate it return to winter this evening after enjoying balmy south east trades and sunny dry 24 c in the cook islands jim quoting michael mann mannmeteopsuedu folks were going to go up w something brief on realclimate later today mostly just linking to other useful deconstructions of the paper already up on other sites mike on jul 23 2009 at 1101 pm jim salinger wrote i am tied up next week but could frame something up the following week which i hope would be multiauthored it would be quite good to have rebuttal from the same department at uni of auckland which glenn mcgregor of ijc is director of i havent had tne oportunity to download the text here in the cook islands so this would give the opportunity to do that who else wants to join in jim quoting kevin trenberth trenbertucaredu i am on vacation today and dont have the time i have been on travel the past 4 weeks including ar5 ipcc scoping mtg the ncar summer colloquium is coming up in week and then i am off to oz and nz for 3 weeks gewexileaps ceop and i have an oceanobs09 plenary paper to do kevin formal comment to jgr seems like worthwhile undertaking here contrarians will continue to cite the paper regardless of whether or not its been rebutted but for the purpose of future scientific assessments its important that this be formally rebutted in the peer reviewed literature mike on jul 23 2009 at 905 pm jim salinger wrote hi all thanks for the proactiveness is there an opportunity to write letter to jgr pointing out the junk science in thisif it is not rebutted then all sceptics will use this to justify their position jim quoting michael mann mannmeteopsuedu 2nd email ________ thanks kevin hadnt even noticed that in my terse initial skim of it yesthat makes things even worse than my initial impression this is truly horrible paper one wonders who the editor was and what heshe was thinking or drinking m on jul 23 2009 at 351 pm kevin trenberth wrote i just looked briefly at the paper their relationships use derivatives of the series well derivatives are equivalent to high pass filter that is to say it filters out all the low frequency variability and trends if one takes wt and does differentiation one gets dy aw cos wt so the amplitude goes from to aw where w is the frequency 2pi l where l is the period so the response to this procedure is to reduce periods of 10 years by factor of 5 compared with periods of 2 years or 20 and 50 years get reduced by factors of 10 an 25 relative to two year periods ie their procedure is designed to only analyse the interannual variability not the trends kevin hi seth you always seem to catch at airports only got few minutes took cursory look at the paper and it has all the worry signs of extremely bad science and scholarship jgr is legitimate journal but some extremely bad papers have slipped through the cracks in recent years and this is another one of them first of all the authors use two deeply flawed datasets that understate the warming trends the christy and spencer msu data and uncorrected radiosonde temperature estimates there were series of three key papers published in science few years ago by mears et santer et and sherwood et see gavins excellent realclimate article on this 1httpwwwrealclimateorgindexphparchives200508ettu lt these papers collectively showed that both datasets were deeply flawed and understate actual tropospheric temperature trends i find it absolutely remarkable that this paper could get through serious review wout referencing any 3 of these critical papers papers whose findings render that conclusions of the current article completely invalid the christy and spencer msu satellitederived tropospheric temperature estimates contained two errorsa sign error and an algebraic error that had the net effect of artificially removing the warming trend christy and spencer continue to produce revised versions of the msu dataset but they always seem to show less warming than every other independent assessment and their estimates are largely disregarded by serious assessments such as that done by the nas and the ipcc so these guys have taken biased estimates of tropospheric temperatures that have artificially too little warming trend and then shown quite unremarkably that nino dominates much of what is left the interannual variability the paper has absolutely implications that i can see at all for the role of natural variability on the observed warming trend of recent decades other far more careful analyses paper by david thompson of csu phil jones and others published in nature more than year ago used proper widelyaccepted surface temperature data to estimate the influence of natural factors nino and volcanos on the surface temperature record their analysis was so careful and clever that it detected postworld war ii error in sea surface temperature measurements that yields artificial cooling during the mid 1940s that had never before been discovered in the global surface temperature record needless to say they removed that error too and the correct record removing influences of enso volcanoes and even this newly detected error reveal that robust warming of global mean surface temperature over the past century of little less than 1c which has nothing to do w volcanic influences or enso influences the dominant source of the overall warming as concluded in every legitimate major scientific assessment is anthropogenic influences human greenhouse gas concentrations w some offsetting cooling due to sulphate aerosols this later paper provides absolutely nothing to cast that in doubt it uses flawed set of surface temperature measurements for which the trend has been artificially suppressed to show that whats left over interannual variability is due to natural influences duh its joke and the aptly named mark morano has fallen for it m on jul 23 2009 at 1154 am borenstein seth wrote kevin gavin
