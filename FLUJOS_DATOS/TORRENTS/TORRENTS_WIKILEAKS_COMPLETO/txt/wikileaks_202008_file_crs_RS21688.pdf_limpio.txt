according to data from the centers for diseas control and prevention cdc about 16 of children living in the united states between the ages of one and five years have an unacceptably high level of lead in their blood ie 10 micrograms or more of lead per deciliter of blood which may result in learning disabilities reduced intellectual ability or other problems1 this rate of elevated bloodlead levels is much less than it was only few years ago between 1991 and 1994 when cdc estimated that 44 of such children had elevated lead levels the drop in bloodlead levels resulted at least in part from the success of federal programs aimed at reducing childhood exposure to house dust containing leadbased paint lbp from deteriorated or abraded surfaces of walls door jambs and window sashes it is not necessary for child to eat paint chips to become poisoned normal handtomouth behavior in leadcontaminated home can deliver enough lead to damage the developing nervous sy stem of child under the age of seven years poor children are at special risk because inadequate nutrition increases lead absorption by the body most buildings constructed prior to 1978 when the lead content of interior paint was restricted to current levels contain lbp but at least 86 of the lead is found in houses constructed prior to 1960 about 24 million us homes were constructed prior to 1960 and have not undergone major renovation about 20 of these homes are occupied by lowincome households defined as households with incomes less than 13 times the poverty level 2 by the year 2010 about 18 million of the housing units constructed prior to 1960 will be demolished and approximately 38 million units will be substantially renovated at private expense to remove leadbased paint roughly 37 million of the remaining 184 million units will be occupied by lowincome families the us department of housing and urban development hud plans to eliminate lead hazards in an estimated 14 million of these units that receive federal assistance including both federally owned and privately owned housing 3 about 23 million pre1960 housing units occupied by lowincome families are expected to continue to pose lbp risks4

several options are available for lbp risk management in housing complete removal of lbp from the interior surfaces of residence by qualified contractor provides the best protection for children removal however can be very costly hud estimated in 1999 an average cost of 9000 per dwelling for an inspection risk assessment and full abatement when hud procedures 1 centers for disease control and

184 million homes constructed prior to 1960 would be about 166 billion per year for 10 years6 at the end of that period all homes constructed prior to 1960 would be renovated or demolished if only 23 million lowincome housing units were fully abated the estimated cost would be 21 billion per year alternatively all homes constructed prior to 1960 could be inspected and homes with lbp hazards such as loose or peeling paint coul d be managed with interim measures to reduce exposure at cost of about 2500 per unit for ex ample lbp could be covered over with lead free paint according to hud because only bout onethird of the units would present lbp hazards in need of control the estimated total annual cost of interim measures over 10 years would be approximately 184 billion at the end of that period ie in the year 2010 the houses constructed prior to 1960 would be leadsafe but maintenance would have to continue for houses not abated or demolished if interim measures were applied only to lowincome housing the estimated total annual cost would be 230 million 7 abatement of hazards also produces benefits according to an analysis by hud the benefit of reducing lbp hazards derives primarily from higher intelligence quotient iq levels and associated increases in lifetime earnings of children who avoid lead exposure hud estimated that when childs bloodlead concentration increases by one microgram of lead per deciliter ie onetenth of liter of blood average lifetime earnings are reduced by at least 550 present value discounted at 7 due to reduced cognitive ability 8

directs hud to establish procedures to eliminate as far as practicable lbp hazards9 in all public housing and private housing constructed prior to 1978 that receive federal financial assistance10 the act requires periodic risk assessments and interim measures to reduce identified lbp hazards in such housing in addition the act requires inspection for lbp hazards prior to federally funded rehabilitation or renovation lbp hazards must be reduced in projects receiving less than 25000 in federal funds and eliminated if project receives at least 25000 in federal funds11 risk assessments inspections and interim and permanent measures to reduce or eliminate lbp hazards are eligible rehabilitation expenses for federal funds 5 the hud estimate does not include the cost of temporarily relocating families during abatement or possible costs of disposal of hazar dous waste 6 presidents task force eliminating childhood lead poisoning p 24 7 ibid 8 this figure includes medical costs

expired september 30 1994 but presidents have continued to request f unds and congress has continued to appropriate them since fy1992 congress has appropriated more than 1 billion for these activities roughly 300 million has been appropriated for related lbp abatement by nongovernmental organizations and for training certification and research programs in addition in fy2003 congress established parallel demonstration pr ogram for lbp abatement targeted at major urban areas with the highest lead paint abatement needs based on the number of occupied pre 1940 units of rental housing and disproportiona tely high number of documented cases of leadpoisoned children congress appropriated 50 million for this grant program in each of fy2003 and fy2004 47 million in fy2005 and 48 million in

hazards which aims to eliminate lbp hazards to children before 2010 the strategy recommends that the federal government provide funding through grants to control lbp using interim measures in the 23 million units of privately owned lowincome housing that were constructed prior to 1960 and that are not receiving federal assistance and therefore are not covered by hud regulations assuming that some of the cost could be met by state local or private funding leveraged by federal funding the task force recommended 50 increase in federal grant funding under the residential leadbased paint hazard reduction act from 60 million in fy2000 to 90 million for fy2001 14 congress appropriated 59 million for statelocal lbp management grants in fy2001 80 million in fy200215 96 million in fy2003 95 12

with leadbased paint also has been proposed in the 110th congress s 2244 would require seller or lessor of housing to 1 conduct risk assessment or inspection for the presence of leadbased paint hazards 2 disclose to the purchaser or lessee the results of such inspection or assessment and hazard control measures carried out 3 remediate any leadbased paint hazards found and 4 include in any contract for the purchase or lease of housing documentation of any inspection risk assessment or hazard control measure in addition s 2244 would authorize grant expenditures for lead hazard reduction in housing for the elderl or persons with disabilities and for dwellings with bedrooms housing categories that currently are excluded from the lead hazard reduction grant program finally the bill would direct the department of energy doe to require the conduct of lead hazard control measures during weatherization projects
