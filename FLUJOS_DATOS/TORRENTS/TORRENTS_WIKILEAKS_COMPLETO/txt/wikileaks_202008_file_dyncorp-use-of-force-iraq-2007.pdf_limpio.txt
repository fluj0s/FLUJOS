effective date 081307 revision date page 4 of 10 1 deadly force is any force that is likely or can reasonably be expected to cause death or serious bodily injury deadly force includes but is not limited to any us of firearm force that is not likely to cause death or seri ous bodily injury but nonetheless does result in death or serious bodily injury is not considered to be the use of deadly force 2 di recognizes and respects t he paramount value of all human life consistent with this princi ple is the commitment to take all reasonable steps to prevent the need to use deadly force the first of two bedrock principles of these ruf regar ding the use of deadly force is necessity the necessity to use deadly force arises when all other availabl means of preventing imminent and grave danger to specific i ndividual or other person have failed or would likely fail howe ver an employee is not required to place himself or herself another di employee other coalition and friendly forces or the pub lic in unreasonable danger or death or serious injury before using deadly force 3 the use of deadly force is reasonable when the employee reasonably believes under all of the facts and circumstances known to the employee at that that the person at whom the use of force is directed present s an imminent threat that could result in death or serious bodily injury to the employee or another person use of force by di empl oyees up to and including deadly force in defense of another pers on by is authorized on behalf of all us persons and all c oalition and iraqi forces and police 4 the use of deadly force is authorized when it becomes reasonably necessary in such ca ses di personnel must also be aware of the risk that the use of such force poses to uninvolved persons and to the extent practical limit or mitigate that risk however the pres ence of uninvolved persons does not in and of itself preclude the use of deadly force 5 the use of deadly force must be objectively necessary and reasonable under all the circumstanc known to the individual at the time necessity encompasses many factors such as the likelihood that the subject will use deadly force on the employee title di rules for the use of force ruf for di programs in iraq number di3001 unit issuing government services approved by bob rosenkranz effective date 081307 revision date page 5 of 10 or others if such force is not used by the employee the employees knowledge of the cap abilities of the threatening party or situation the presence of other persons who may be at risk if force is not used and t he nature and the severity of the subjects conduct or the danger posed reasonableness of belief or decision must be viewed from the perspective of the individual on the scene who may often be forced to make split second decisions under circum stances that are tense unpredictable and rapidly evolving reasonableness and necessity are not to be viewed fr om the calm va ntage point of hindsight 6 whenever situation occurs in which deadly force is deemed necessary those di personnel in volved should where feasible attempt to move to secure location such as military compound or housing compound in order to minimize the necessity of having to use deadly force 7 when an employee is involved in use of deadly force incident it shall be the supervisors responsibility to ensure that the following measures are adhered to the supervisor shall immedi ately as circumstances allow take possession of the employees weapon and turn such weapon into the armory where the weapon will be secured as evidence it shall be the responsibility of the employees supervisor to insure that the employee is issued replacement weapon if and when t hat action is appropriate b employees who discharge weapon resulting in the death or injury of another person will be placed as circumstances dictate on administrative leave or reassigned other duties until the investigation is co mplete program management will consult with the sbu hr to determine on case by case basis whether administrative leave is with or without pay c the on duty supervisor will i dentify all witnesses including full names and how to contact them at later time to the incident and begin the initial investigation into the circumstances surrounding the in cident the supervisor will inform the civpol security manager or psd commander title di rules for the use of force ruf for di programs in iraq number di3001 unit issuing government services approved by bob rosenkranz effective date 081307 revision date page 6 of 10 wpps project manager vpio or equivalent as applicable of the incident relaying all circumstances known at the time d in all cases where any pers on has been injured or killed as result of the use of force by an employee the involved employee will be offered t he opportunity to undergo debriefing by qualified practi cing psychologist as soon as practicable vi special procedures for convoys and vehicle threats to compounds one of the greatest threats in iraq is the vehicl borne improvised explosive device vbied being used to attack our convoys and secured compounds shooting at vehicle is authorized if it constitutes the appropriate level of force to mitigate the threat however before shooting at vehi cle is authorized the totality of the circumstances surrounding the si tuation must be taken into account these circumstances in clude current threat information especially that pertaining to vbieds number and nature of occupants of the vehicle the riding dynamics of the vehicle time of day and current location b warning shots are not author ized in iraq as the danger of inadvertently hitting noninvolved persons is too great warning shots are defined as shooting into the air or ground in order to attract attention shots into vehicles grillengine compartment are specifically aimed shots at designated target which poses an imminent threat and are not considered to be warning shots for purposes of this policy c when you identify what may be vbied threat to civpol compound or to one of our conv oys the following steps will be employed 1 the vehicle that presents the th reat will be specific ally identified preferably when it is closer than 100 meters away and everything possible will be done to warn the driver of the threat he is creating before employi ng deadly force these actions must include the following steps in an escalation of force 1 if in convoy situation the follow v ehicle will position itself to screen title di rules for the use of force ruf for di programs in iraq number di3001 unit issuing government services approved by bob rosenkranz effective date 081307 revision date page 7 of 10 the remainder of the convoy and the motorcade will have bright visible warning lights 2 englis h and arabic stay back warning signs will be affixed to vehicles and at entrances to compounds 3 hand signals and verbal warnings are used and 4 high powered warning lights such as fl ash lights or st robe lights are directed at the driver cert ain of the above steps may be omitted if the dire necessity of the situation dictates 2 if all the above warnings fa il and the vehicle still presents threat or there is insufficient in which to employ the above escalation of force steps bef ore the vehicle poses an unacceptable risk which is usua lly measured depending upon the circumstances as being within 40 meters of the convoy or installation then show your intent to use lethal force by pointing your weapon to show the driver of the approaching vehicle your intent to use it if necessary 3 if the driver still does not stop or is so close before being identified that there is time available to employ any of the above listed steps then shoot well aimed individual shots at the vehicle to disable it usually the only practical available target is in which to disable the vehicle is the front grill and into the engine block however if other opti ons are available such as shooting the tires then that optio n is also permitted this is done to prevent loss of human life repeat this if necessary to stop the vehicle it is within the employees best judgment to determine the fewest possible num ber of shots necessary to achieve the desired security effect 4 if the above actions do not caus the driver to cease being threat shoot individual well aimed shots through the windshield it is within the employees bes t judgment to determine the fewest possible number of shots necessary in order to achieve the desired security effect 5 summary of escalation of forc requirements as circumstances permit if in convoy motorcade will have visible warning lights position follow vehicle to screen convoy b use of highly visible warning signs in english and arabic c use of hand signals and verbal warnings title di rules for the use of force ruf for di programs in iraq number di3001 unit issuing government services approved by bob rosenkranz
