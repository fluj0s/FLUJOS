increased responsibility of small unit leaders and decentralized execution of operations added to c2 challenge the backdrop of the brigades aor is recurring theme in many observations in the following

recommend creating dedicated stryker support group ssg from the csb to support the sbct nonlethal operations and intelligence interpreter and linguist support to the brigade was inadequate many local interpreters quit because of threats to them or their family from antiiraq forces keeping interpreters employed and alive was key issue with the brigade the limited number of interpreters available forced the brigade to move interpreters to various elements across spectrum of functional disciplines including civil affairs ca intelligence psychological operations psyops and the aor to meet mission requirements the screening process for linguists is limited the brigade sometimes relied on linguists without clearances for key positions such as psyops and ca team support the number of

infrastructure reimbursements for unnecessary damages leaflets loudspeakers etc to be more responsive to the brigade commanders information operations io campaign this is not stating that company commanders should be given carte blanche privileges with ca as the approving authority for contracting processes however they should receive training which in turn would increase the nonlethal effects

slat armor significantly changes stryker performance and increases the circumference of the stryker vehicle drivers did not receive any training on driving with slat armor until it was installed in theater slat armor placement is recommended on limited amount of stryker vehicles at home station for urban and offroad driver training digital systems most s6 personnel did not receive specific training on the digital systems used by the brigade yet officers and soldiers performed admirably despite this deficiency developing standard program of instruction is recommended for mtoe communication systems within the brigade possible course of action would be to adopt the united states air force job book model where each task is identified and certified master gunner signs off on the users ability to perform that task units need to sustain trainthetrainer skills by developing master trainers in such areas as the force xxi battle command brigade battalion and below fbcb2 and the maneuver control systemlight mcsl intelligence the opposing force opfor at the ctc was described as well trained extremely competent and accurate with their weapons however the opfor was not consistent with the threat array in iraq the opfor should replicate insurgent and terrorist tactics the opfor should be composed of an array of fourtofive hostile groups with unique motives and influences the certification exercise certex and operational exercise oe joint readiness training center jrtc rotation featured onedimensional opfor the signal intelligence sigint environment was based on legacy threat with frequency modulation fm communications used only for tactical control cell phones are used extensively for communications in iraq the sigint baseline should reflect realistic communications suggesting relationships and contacts not just tactical control information thehow to defeat the opfor ttp needs to be reexamined for example finding mortar cache may not result in decrease in mortar attacks however capturing reconnaissance cell that determines targets and distances or capturing cell that trains others in mortar operations may result in decreased attacks units are not given sufficient opportunity to train with nonorganic assets such as ca or psyop teams nor is there sufficient time for the tht to develop humint networks to provide the actionable intelligence needed in support of search and attack operations the mre should replicate the rules of engagement roe within theater and therefore causing the deploying unit to develop other

predeployment training should provide additional nondoctrinal training to prepare subordinate elements for the missions they may face in theater training should more closely replicate the roe the deploying unit will probably experience in theater this can enhance development of other nonlethal and lethal methods to engage the opfor where the unit receives the additional training is not the issue though the ctc are by far the best and most realistic venue to address this need materiel command and control the brigade provided army airspace command and control a2c2 using doctrinal air

were returned to the manufacturer and the brigade deployed to kuwait the ikss was expected to be delivered in theater due to the long lead times for certain satellite components the engineering approval procurement and training process was truly remarkable considering time line of less than ninety days from concept to employment in the field this was first for the signal community the brigades ikss operated under hub and spoke concept with two master reference terminals mrt controlling eleven traffic terminals tt over seven megabits per second aggregate data rate were shared

siprnet ip were dispersed throughout the ikss network each tt facilitated four voice over ip voip red side phones hosted off of the brigade subscriber node bsn and an orderwire line though the ikss provided immense capability to the battalions the actual data that passed through gateways out of the brigade was predicated on what was being provided from higher headquarters this issue along with vantage switch inconsistency problems with mobile subscriber equipment mse call outs and link stability resulted in initial questions about ikss by brigade leadership as to whether it was operating as advertised this perception was solelybased on the systems that facilitated interbrigade network connectivity mse vantage and not necessarily the ikss what must be understood is that ikss is transmission medium and data path dependant being passed to other customers in the network once the vantage and mse stability improved and the capability of the system fully realized the brigade fully endorsed ikss as the most valuable upper tactical internet asset for network access and the war fighter early in deployment the brigade worked with peoc3t to devise sanctuary ikss node outside of the brigades battle space given the mobility of the brigade and changing mission sets placing mrt in camp doha kuwait connected to deployable ku earth terminal system dkets would provide siprnet on demand to tts it would also provide control and management location external of the brigade after significant period the coalition forces land component commander cflcc approved the network accreditation to integrate the ikss into the theater network the brigade agreed to position mrt with peoc3t and data path support staff at camp doha connecting the ikss into the dkets this network connection enabled the brigade to receive siprnet connectivity external of mse theater assets and significantly improved the speed and reliability for the brigade the ikss has been the biggest c2 force multiplier within the brigade and has demonstrated capability that must be included for all followon sbcts and signal transformation architectures the brigade successfully demonstrated the feasibility viability and flexibility of ikss for any unit operating in noncontiguous battle space the use of commercial satellite networks lessens the impact upon military satellite networks and in some cases can provide cleaner more reliable footprint in an ao being the first unit to ever receive and utilize ku satellite system to the extent the brigade did and the speed at which it was developed and deployed there were several recommended changes that the brigade has noted specific to ikss all systems should be fielded with e100 model taclane and the potential incorporation of advanced encryption standard aes cisco routers such configuration may negate the need for second taclane for tunneling nipr as is the current configuration using an aes router could potentially facilitate niprnet path directly from

has consistently provided reliable connectivity to the brigade once deployed the brigade experienced limited available satellite links in theater this resulted in only two of three terminals being in system at any one time the saturation of smartt assets in iraq 4th infantry division and 1st armored division resulted in the brigade being limited to two satellite links with data rates limited to 512 kbs and 1024 kbs during operations in samarra the network structure for the smartt was 1024 kbs from toc to 4th infantry division and 512 kbs from toc b to toc this architecture benefitted the brigade by employing the smartt as both an intrabrigade and internodal to 4th infantry division communications system once the brigade moved to its final location in mosul the smartt supported an intranodal link between toc and the bsb at 1024 kbs and 512 kbs link for the nocv prior to deployment after action review aar comments from the 4th infantry division 4id and the 1st armored division 1ad indicated severe equipment reliability issues with the smartt primarily related to the medium power transmitter mpt and cooling fans on the transmitter to date the brigade has not experienced similar equipment issues though cooler weather during the initial deployment may have been factor the brigades requirements in addition to the proliferation of smartt assemblages in theater added strain on an already saturated military satellite network the brigade was consistently limited to only two links at 1024 kbs and 512 kbs even though additional links were requested numerous times eventually the link structure was modified to three links at 512 kbs each the smartt has performed exceptionally well throughout deployment some physical improvements to the assemblage would enhance operational capability enabling an auto tracking memory function would improve satellite acquisition time when shutting down the smartt and reinitializing the acquisition process the smartt needs to

especially overlays bandwidth limitations caused overlays to be sent in layers or in pieces in order to make it through the communications infrastructure when sending operational products between tactical operation centers the primary means switched to outlook email with an attachment toctotoc communications were not as restricted and allowed for larger file size and faster dissemination for routine battle rhythm products dissemination was accomplished by posting the product to designated web site for other individuals to access and pull down this made it easier for staff sections to make last minute changes to their status charts prior to the battle update brief bub this allowed staffs at different echelons to have access to products at all levels without bothering subordinate units for the information the battle captain described the process for disseminating an overlay to the stryker vehicles if the staff received an overlay from higher it would come via outlook email with mcs overlay attachment the staff would then save the overlay onto the desktop of the computer using mcs the staff would import the overlay and then use the messaging capability to send the overlay to the fbcb2 box in the brigade toc when overlays were sent between mcs and fbcb2 all graphics would change to black which made it harder for the individuals executing the mission to depict between the graphics and therefore the ttp of sending the overlays to the brigade fbcb2 first was adopted the brigade staff would make the necessary color changes on the fbcb2 box and then disseminate the overlay to the appropriate individuals the battle captain also explained that if the staff had to create an overlay to disseminate they would do it on mcs because of the ease the mcs software lends to developing overlays they would then revert to sending the overlay to the brigade fbcb2 for color adjustments and for final dissemination the brigade reallocates fbcb2 systems from within their organization and equips nondigital units that are attached to the brigade this gives nondigital units the capability to communicate within the brigade via fbcb2 loss of capability from using this method was not factor due to the number of available spares in the unit and systems were taken off of nonessential vehicles posting operational products to web site was the preferred method of distributing products this allowed all echelons access to all products insightslessons learned abcs does not efficiently provide the technology to disseminate operational products within the toc

specifically the antenna base oring consistently failed resulting in the antenna becoming off center and not 90 degrees in orientation to the ground contact pins internal to the antenna frequently broke leading to intermittent data links overall the performance of the ntdr since its fielding has been below expectations this is especially the case in light of the data requirements of the brigade the relatively low data rate of 288 kbs caused difficulty in obtaining reliable link in the large battle space emphasis on other systems has resulted in the radio not being extensively used during

the brigadetargeting cell then meets and assigns responsibility for the target and the target folder is given to the unit this is the first step in the unit planning process after the unit completes the plan call is placed to the brigade requesting psyop and possibly combat camera support to assist in the cordon and search operation while these elements contribute to the overall success of that mission they are not employed to target the trust and confidence of the local population in the long term emphasis on building trust and confidence might negate the need to conduct future cordon and search operations as the nation becomes more selfpolicing insightslesson learned targeting should be supported by sound and detailed intelligence targets should be nominated and vetted at the targeting cell meetings targeting folders should be prepared detailing target vulnerabilities measures of success should be developed so that the tasked unit understands the first and second orders of effect and the standard by which the mission is to be accomplished as in lethal targeting combined arms approach is best when weaponizing the target incorporating multiple nonlethal effects generators normally have better target results than using only one system such as psyop the importance of properly planned and executed nonlethal effects what to expect from the staff when they are planning it

of effects could be measured as successful if 700 leaflets represent leaflet to 50 percent of the males within that neighborhood figure that has been established as the saturation point were distributed the second order of effect measurement for success could be if 1000 students show up for the opening day of school figure that represents majority of students illegible for school and third order of effect measurement for success could be if the neighborhood had increased its level of support for the newly established government and education system insightslesson learned measures of success can be tracked back to the commanders intent and assist in validating and justify the expenditure of resources measures of success serve as key indicator to the unit when assessing if they have been successful and determine if resources should be moved to other efforts establishing track record of weapons effects to audiences to change weapon system delivery method target audience or

to leverage the information operations io objectives and utilized an approval process not linked with the formal targeting process nonlethal effects were integrated into cordon and search operations specifically tactical commanders found it very useful for loudspeaker teams to accompany the inter cordon as method for informing the local population of what was going on and how to comply once the operation was completed the media was alerted and moved to the location to provide coverage of the event soldiers also used combat camera to document damages occurring during the raid to provide method for reimbursement if detentions were made the documentation and media access were executed as defensive counterpropaganda operations insightslessons learned the integration of multiple elements

machine allowing the antiiraq forces to alter the details of the incidents to their benefit it is safe to assume that operations that do not mass multiple nonlethal forces is unlikely to have any lasting effect since the antiiraq forces uses creditable message followed by the application of ruthless force to reinforce the sincerity of their message often the delivery of the message is more important than the message itself coalition force messages are often discounted however the same message delivered from member of their tribe is much more effective and caries more weight than message from different tribe effective targeting will include good understanding of the cultural aspect of nonlethal effects employment insightslesson learned nonlethal effects should be massed in order to

notice of when their support was required since some had been suspected of providing information to the antiiraq forces to reduce this tendency units preferred fulltime interpreters who lived on the fob and were of different ethnicity to the majority of antiiraq forces there was progressive pay scale for interpreters they were all paid the same and therefore system for rewarding those who were

adjustment for both the brigade and antiiraq forces in which the enemy will move reacquire range through tabular firing tables ingressegress routes establish security and the brigade will either destroy or in most cases cause the enemy to move to new location and repeat the process countermortar operations in stability operations and support operations environment is manhunting vs maneuver warfare therefore the approach in the targeting process is different for example brigade and battalions do very well with the findfixfinish methodology in conventional environment where counterfire radars acquire and counterbattery artillery destroy the opposing indirectfire systems in manhunting environment with specific roe limitations as is in mosul counterfire operations do not need to center on the mortar crew counterfire operations should be used against reconnaissance elements and crew training in addition the brigade believes that the exploitanalyzedisseminate portion of the targeting process must be practice more at the combat training centers ctcs for this type of operating environment the majority of mortar attacks are harassment with one to three rounds fired most attacks are not on target the brigade has discovered most enemy attacks are inaccurate due to the expedient firing techniques used from vehicles and the skilllevel of the operator this could explain the delays between attacks after countermortar mission insightslessons learned while the roe restricts indirect fires within mosul it does not restrict the use of other nonlethal and lethal fires countermortar operations are constant adjustment by the brigade to adapt to the enemys ttp antiiraq forces are using second tier personnel to execute mortar fires and first tier personnel to train and equip them which is large factor in the ineffectiveness of enemy mortar fires most if not all countermortar operations arrive too late to achieve desired the effects because the antiiraq force are capable of displacing within 30 seconds of firing the mere presence of coalition forces will cause the enemy to move to another location and force him to repeat his process of target selection and

operations are not conducted in the traditional manner with radar and indirect counterfire assets while the assets radars mortars and howitzers are available to conduct this type operation the targets are too perishable compared to the time required to clear fires the enemy is currently using mortars to harass our fob by loading mortars 60 mm 82 mm and 120 mm in vehicles and driving to preplanned firing location three to four rounds are fired and then the crew loads the weapon and departs the suspected elapsed time from first round fired to departure is less than one minute clearance of lethal indirect fires in and around mosul does not reside with the brigade so clearance time is considerably longer than the target is presented thus preventing response to counter this employment of mortars

have to talk to all four agencies to get the status of one stryker system with the various databases being used one print from the sams2 can longer inform the commander about the status of his nonmission capable systems insightslessons learned all maintenance in the brigade should be fed through the standard army maintenance system 2 sams2 at the support operations office the s6 should correct any soft ware issues and pass all hard ware issues to the spo the lse should manage all contractors as staff section of the spo dotmlpf implicationrecommendation direct brigade maintenance through the standard army maintenance system 2 sams2 at the support operations office doctrine topic v nonmission capable nmc systems tracking art 62 provide maintenance observation systems are being tracked nmc if any of their subsystems defined by ar 700138 are nmc discussion brigade is experiencing subsystems are being replaced by logistic support element lse other contractors and s6 and are not being reported to the combat repair team crt chief new serial numbers are added to the system in which they are component 96 for official use onlyoperations in mosul iraq iir stryker brigade combat team 1 3rd brigade 2nd infantryinsightlesson learned any subsystem changes need to be reflected in unit level logistic systemground ullsg so that the system can be tracked correctly dotmlpf implicationrecommendation use automated integrated technology ait in reading bar codes on subsystems to automatically pass the change in serial number to the combat repair teams crt materiel topic w security of ground movement art 63 provide transportation support observation convoys are the most vulnerable us targets for the antiiraq forces discussion the support vehicles arrived in theater woefully inadequate for the evolving threat the bsb has beefedup vehicles to combat this evolving threat the bsb has been able to acquire some tardec armor kits for different vehicles and has fabricated steel plated armor for all other vehicles that leave the wire they have made halfring armor plate for their gunners their suggested improvement for the tardec armor is bigger windows than the 12in by 12in windows that limit visibility only the gunner can fight in moving battle because of the window size the windshields of all vehicles need to be armored for 762mm all doors on the vehicles need to open and close securely and easily crewserved weapons of choice are the m2 and m240b the reason for the mix is to balance the heavy firepower of the m2 with the quicker more accurate m240b the bsb has purchased riotstyle face shields that can stop 762mm rounds protective armor products part number702mt driver vision enhanced dve is necessary in all vehicles because of dust and sand headsets for gunners are combat multiplier and lifesaver as the gunner cannot hear commands from those inside the vehicle during fight double stack radios are necessary to ensure the convoy has the capability to communicate with their parent unit as well as the unit controlling the area they may be traveling through insightlesson learned proper preparation of equipment will save lives units need to ensure that they have armored vehicles and ring mounts dve protective face shields headsets for gunners mix of firepower and double stack radios for official use only 97operations in mosul

headsets for the gunner m2s m240bs and double stack radios necessary to ensure success in convoy operations in this environment organization topic x local national convoys art 63 provide transportation support observation local national convoys are not being used but local national trucks roll in brigade support battalion bsb convoys discussion local national trucks and operators are contracted to supplement bsb assets they are protected as part of the us convoy their trucks are not armored or armed and are not as fast or agile as us tactical vehicles there has been at least one instance where local national jumped out of his vehicle during fight recovery operations are difficult since our equipment is not designed for recovery of these local nation civilian trucks insightlesson learned the use of local national trucks can be great logistic multiplier however their use in high threat areas needs to be as limited as possible dotmlpf implicationrecommendation use of local national trucks as last resort option transportation requirement shortfalls should focus on tactical vehicle augmentation organization topic forward operating based fob resupply operations art 641 provide base camp sustainment observation the corps support battalion csb and the bsb both conduct fob supply with the bsb pushing forward of the fob discussion the mix between the csb and bsb in fob resupply allows the bsb to have the surge capability to support units operating outside of the fob the issue in this area of operation ao is the csb is not capable equipment and training of moving through high threat areas the csb is not dedicated ssg or an echelon above brigade eab and therefore are not in direct support ds of the brigade which can have an impact on the brigades priority to the csb the brigade has even had to provide back up support to the csb for maintenance and has pushed resupply convoys to corps units in the ao when the threat was too high for the 98 for official use onlyoperations in mosul iraq iir stryker brigade combat team 1 3rd brigade 2nd infantrycsb the bsb relies heavily on aerial resupply to elements outside of the fob as often as is practical the sherpa has been huge logistic multiplier insightlesson learned since the csb is not ssg or eab they are not in direct support of the brigade and therefore the brigade is not always csb priority use of army fixed and rotary wing aircraft has been great logistic asset dotmlpf implicationrecommendation support sbct with dedicated ssg or eab to allow the brigade full freedom of maneuver
