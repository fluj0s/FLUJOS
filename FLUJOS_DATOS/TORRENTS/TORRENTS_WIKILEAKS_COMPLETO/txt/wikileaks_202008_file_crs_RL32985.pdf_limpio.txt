regarding the provision of internet services over cable connections to address the legal status of such services under the communications act of 1934 as amended in the declaratory ruling the commission determined that cable modem service as it is currently offered is properly classified as an interstate informa tion service not as cable service and that there is separate offering of telecommunications service by classifying cable modem service as an information service and not telecommunications service or hybrid information and telecommunicati ons service the commission precluded the mandatory application of the requirements imposed on common carriers under title ii of the communications act thus allo wing the provision of such services to develop with relatively few regulatory requirements there were numerous challenges to the fccs classification of cable modem service as an information service which were consolidated and by judicial lottery assigned to the ninth circuit for review the ninth circuit applying its own interpretation of the act vacated the fccs ruling regarding the classification of cable modem service as an information service on appeal the supreme court overturned the ninth circuits decision findi ng that the fccs interpretation of the act was reasonable in light of the statute s ambiguity the courts decision revives the fccs

regarding the provision of internet services over cable connections to address the lega l status of such services under the communications act of 1934 as amended7 i n t h declaratory ruling the commission determined that cable modem service as it is currently offered is properly classified as an interstate informa tion service not as cable service and that there is separate offering of telecommunications service8 by classifying cable modem service as an information service and not telecommunications service or composite service that combines an information service and telecommunications service the commission precluded the manda tory application of the requirements imposed on common carriers under title ii of the communications act thus allowing the provision of such services to develop with relatively few regulatory requirements in making the determination that cable modem services are information services and not telecommunications services th commission first looked to the relevant statutory definitions of each as establis hed by the telecommunications act of 19969 in enacting the telecommunications ac t of 1996 congress codified defin itional distinction between telecommunications and telecommunications service and information service telecommunicati ons is defined under the act as the transmission between or among points specified by the user of information of the users choosing without change in the form or content of the information as sent or received10 information service on the other hand is defined as the offering of capability for generating acquiring storing transforming processing retrieving utilizing or making available information via telecommunications11 noting that the statutory definitions are based on the func tions that are made available with the service rather than the facilities used to provide the service the commission then examined the functions that cable modem service makes available to its end users12 citing its determination in an earlier proceeding that internet access service in general should be classified as an in formation service the commission found that since cable modem service is an offering of internet access service it must also behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32985crs3 13 id at 4822 see also in the matter of federalstate joint board on universal service 13 fcc rcd 11501 april 10

decision in brand x infra regarding the twopart test established in chevron usa inc v natural resources defense council inc 467 us 837 1984 19 id 20 slip op at 8an information service13 the commission stated that cable modem service is single integrated service that enables the subscriber to utilize internet access service through cable providers facilities and to realize the benefits of comprehensive service offering14 the commission rejected the notion that cable modem service included an offering of tel ecommunications service to subscriber conceding that while the service was provided via lecommunications th telecommunications component was not separable from the data processing capabilities of the service15 ninth circuits decision the ninth circuit determined that the question before it was whether its prior interpretation of the telecommunications act controlled review of the commissions decision regarding the classification of cable modem service16 three years prior in att v city of portland three judge panel of the ninth circuit determined that cable modem service was not cable serv ice but was both an information and telecommunications service17 in the brand x case the court held that it was bound to follow its own precedent regarding the classification of cable modem service rather than apply the twopart test set forth by the supreme court in chevron usa inc v natural resources defense council inc for reviewing an agencys interpretation of statute it is charged with administering18 thus the court in the brand x case vacated the part of the commissions declaratory ruling regarding the classification of cable modem service as an information service19 supreme courts decision the court began its decision with the conclusion that chevron s framework should be used to evaluate the commissions interpretation of the statute and that the ninth circuit should have also applied chevron rather than following its own construction of the statute in the portland case20 in chevron the court held that ambiguities in statutes within an agencys jurisdiction to administer are delegationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32985crs4 21 id citing chevron 467 us

offer the court went on to say because the term offer can sometimes refer to single finished product and sometimes to the individual components in package being offered depending on whether the components still possess fficient identity to be described as separate objects the statute fails unambiguously to classify the telecommunications component of cable modem service as distinct offering continuedof authority to the agency to fill th statutory gap in reasonable fashion21 if the court determines that the st atute is ambiguous and the ag encys interpretation of the statute is reasonable chevron requires federal court to accept the agencys construction of the statute even if the ag encys reading differs from what the court believes is the best st atutory interpretation22 the ninth circuits decision not to apply chevron in favor of the conflicting construction of the communica tions act it had adopted in portland was based on an incorrect assumption23 according to the suprem court the ninth circuit incorrectly assumed that its construction overrode the commissions regardless of whether portland had held the statute to be unambiguous24 however the supreme court noted that courts prior judicial construction of statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves room for agency discretion25 after determining that the ninth circuit erred in applying its own construction of the act the court moved to its chevron analysis26 as to the statutes ambiguity the court first looked to the definitions of telecommunicati ons service and telecommunications in the lecommunications act of 199627 the court determined that while cable companies in the broadband internet service business offer consumers an information service in the form of internet access and they do so via telecommunications it does not i nexorably follow as matter of ordinary language that they also offer consumers the highspeed data transmission telecommunications that is an input used to provide this service28 restating the principle established in chevron the court stated that where statutes plain terms admit of two or more reasonable ordina ry usages the commissions choice of one of them is entitled to deference and concluded that the use of the term offer in the definition of telecommunicati ons service was ambiguous in such way as to admit two or more reasonable ordinary usages29httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32985crs5 29

was am biguous as to the classification of cable modem service the court then applied the second step of the chevron analysis to determine whether the commissions interpretation was reasonable policy choice for the commission to make30 the respondents in the case argued that the commissions construction was unreasonable because it allows any communications provider to evade comm oncarrier regulation under title ii by the expedient of bundling informati on service with telecommunications31 the court rejected this argument stating that it did not believe that these results follow from the construction the commission adopted32 the court went on to articulate its interpretation of the commissions construction as we understand the declaratory ruling the commission did not say that any telecommunications service that is priced or bundled with an information service is automatically unregulated under title ii the commission said that telecommunications input used to provid an information service that is not separable from the dataprocessing cap abilities of the service and is instead part and parcel of the information servi ce and is integral to the information services other capabilities is not telecommunications offering33 the court also rejected the respondents argument that cable modem service provided simply the ability to transmit information in so doing the court noted that the internet access provided by the cable modem service allowed consumers to have access to dns service allowing them to reach thirdparty websites the world wide web electronic mail remote terminal access nd file transfer capabilities which effectively provides the capability for acquiring storing retrieving and utilizing information inherent in the definition of an information service34 the court therefore concluded that the commissions construc tion was reasonable35 the court also rejected re spondent mci incs argument that the commissions treatment of cable modem service is incons istent with its treatment of dsl service and is therefore an arbitrary and capricious deviation from agency policy in violation of the administrative procedures act36 the court concluded that the commission provided reasoned explanation for treatin g cable modem service differently fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32985crs6 37 id 38 see eg 47 usc 542 limiting application of franchise fees

within the limits of reasoned interpretation to change course if it adequately justifies the change37 legal implications the courts reversal of the ninth circ uits decision effectively revives the commissions declaratory ruling classifying cable modem service as an information service as such cable ope rators providing broadband internet access are currently not subject to the myriad of regulatory requi rements mandated under title ii of the act most notably providers of cable modem services are not obligated to provide unaffiliated intern et service providers access to their broadband platforms in addition providers of cab modem services remain free at this point from provisions governing discrimination in the provision of services universal service support assistance to law enforcement in the interception of communications made over the network network accessibility to individuals with di sabilities and the protection of subscriber information moreover the commissions classification of cable modem service as an information service appears to limit the scope of state and local regulatory authority over such services regulatory requireme nts and fees imposed on cable operators by localities pursuant to the franchising author ity conferred under title vi of the act are apparently applicable only to the provision of cable services38 classification of cable modem service as an information service appears to preclude the imposition of such requirements on cable opera tors broadband internet offerings39 the question remains however whether the fcc can and will impose certain regulatory requirements on the provision of cable modem service pursuant to its authority under title i of the act in brand x the court expressly acknowledged the existence of such authority and the possibility that the commission might impose special regulatory duties on facilities based isps under its title i ancillary jurisdiction the fcc is currently exa mining

service subject to relatively few regulatory requirements it did not change the status quo it did however spur followon fcc activity on the classification of dsl service and also ffected the debate about modifying the communications act at the time of the brand x decision the fcc already had tentatively concluded that dslbased internet access service is an information service41 but while awaiting that court decision the fcc conti nued to treat dsl service as having telecommunications service co mponent and therefore subj ect to the access and other requirements in title ii of the act on august 5 2005 the fcc adopted an order that granted dsl internet access providers the same regulatory classification and treatment as cable modem internet access providers42 but there continues to

integration efficiencies or to maximize the return on or even fully recoup their investments on the other hand the independent applicati ons providers argue that in order for them to best meet the needs of endusers and offer innovative rvices in competition with the vertically integrated network providers and in so cases services not offered at all by network providers they must have th same unfettered open access to the physical networks that the network providers enjo or at the least be protected by non discrimination rules similarly many endusers argue that their broadband network providers should not be allowed to restri ct their usage of the broadband network as long as they do not in any way compromise the integrity of the network there are four general approaches to the regulation of broadband network providers visavis i ndependent applications providers structural regulation such as open access ex nondisc rimination rules expost adjudication of abuses of market position as they arise on caseby case basis and nonmandatory principles as the basis for self regulation43 open access generally refers to structural requirement that would prevent br oadband network provider from bundling broadband service with internet access fro m its own inhouse isp the basic principle behind network nondi scrimination regime is to gi ve users the right to use nonharmful attachments or applications and give innovators the corresponding freedom to supply them so long as the in tegrity of the network is not affected ex post adjudication of abuses of market position would place the burden of proof on complainant that any restrictions imposed by broadband provider on access to its network is harmful to consumers non mandatory principles such as the four internet freedoms articulated by formerfcc chairman michael powell44 would leave access relationships entirely to the market place on the assumption that it is platform providers own self interest to minimize restrictions some observers have suggested that the appropriate level of regulation on broadba nd network providers may depend upon whether viable third br oadband platform option most likely wireless becomes available to independent applications providers and endusers45
