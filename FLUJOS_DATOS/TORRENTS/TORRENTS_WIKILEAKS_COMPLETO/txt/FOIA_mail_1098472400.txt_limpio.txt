from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to tom wigley wigleycgducaredu subject re mbh date fri oct 22 151320 2004 cc santer1llnlgov tom just got the science attachments for the von storch et paper for tim and keith so i thought you might like to see them ive just sent reply to von storch as he claims his model is better representation of reality than mbh how model that is only given past forcing histories can be better than some proxy data is beyond but hans seems to believe this the era40 report and jgr paper are relevant here era40 is not of climate quality there are differences and trends with cru data before the late 1970s and again around the mid1960s that should include other variables that are calculated it is so bad in the antarctic that era40 rejects most of the surface obs because they get little weight and they dont begin to get accepted until the late 1970s conclusion is that you cant consider era40 for climate purposes maybe the next generation with considerable efforts in getting all the missing back data in and changes to weights given to surface data might mean the 3rd generation is better i shouldnt rabbit on about this as i have to go home to drive with ruth to gatwick for our week in florence lot of people criticise mbh and other papers mike has been involved in but how many people read them fully or just read bits like the attached the attached is complete distortion of the facts mm are completely wrong in virtually everything they say or do i have sent them countless data series that were used in the jonesmann reviews of geophysics papers i got scant thanks from them for doing this only an email saying i had some of the data series wrong associated with the wrong yeardecade i wasted few hours checking what id done and got thanks for pointing their mistake out to them if you think mm are correct and believable then go to this web site 1httpcgicseunsweduaulambertcgibinblog it will take while to get around these web pages and youve got to be bit of nerd and know the jargon but it lists all the mistakes mckittrick has made in various papers i bet there isnt link to this on his web site the final attachment is comment on truly awful paper by mckittirck and michaels i cant find the original but its reference is in this the paper didnt consider spatial autocorrelation at all fortunately longer version of the paper did get rejected by ijc it seems few papers are rejected point im trying to make is you cannot trust anything that mm write mbh is as good way of putting all the data together as others we get similar results in the work in the holocene in 1998 jones et and so does tom crowley in paper in 1999 keiths reconstruction is strikingly similar in his paper from jgr in 2001 mikes may have slightly less variability on decadal scales than the others especially cf esper et but he is using lot more data than the others i reckon they are all biased little to the summer and none are truly annual i say all this in the reviews of geophysics paper bottom line their is way the mwp whenever it was was as warm globally as the last 20 years there is also way whole decade in the lia period was more than 1 deg c on global basis cooler than the 196190 mean this is all gut feeling science but years of experience of dealing with global scales and varaibility must got to florence now back in nov 1 cheers phil at 2046 21102004 you wrote phil i have just read the mm stuff critcizing mbh lot of it seems valid to at the very least mbh is very sloppy piece of work an opinion i have held for some time presumably what you have done with keith is better or is it i get asked about this lot can you give brief heads up mike is too deep into this to be helpful tom prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk references 1 httpcgicseunsweduaulambertcgibinblog
