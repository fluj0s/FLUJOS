tests for certain dependents children were simplifie d when uniform definition of qualifying child was adopted taxpayer may cla im dependency exemptions for children 19 through 23 years of age who are fulltime students at least five months during the year between 1954 and 1986 it was possible for bot h parent and his or her child or fulltime student to claim the childs or students personaldependency exemption under provision of the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 if the parent claimed the exemption the child or dependent stude nt could not claim their own personal exemption however the tra86 also provided standard deduction for childrenstudents equal to the greater of 500 or earned income up to the full standard deduction applicable to other types of taxpayers these amounts have been adjusted annually for inflation provision included in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra97 preserved full offset for earned income ag ainst the standard deduction amount but also provided more generous offset where there is both earned and unearned income special tax rules commonly referred to as the kiddie tax apply to the unearned investment income of children under the age of 14 these rules were recently modified by the tax increase prevention and rec onciliation act pl 109 222 which increased the age of minors subject to this tax to those minors under age 18 this report will be updated to reflect legislative changes andor indexation adjustmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20072crs2 1 at the time of enactment the 750 was the projected inflation adjusted am ount for tax year 1998 this amount is adjusted for inflation and may be greater or lesser in future tax yearsinterrelationship between the personaldependency exemption and standard deduction under existing law adult taxpayers who do not itemize deductions can reduce their adjusted gross incomes by personal exemp tion and standard duction both of which are adjusted annually for inflation in 2006 the amount of the personal exemption is 3300 the amount of the standard deduction va ries according to filing status in tax year 2006 the standard deduction amounts that taxpayers may deduct from their income are 5150 if single 7550 as the head of household or 10300 if married and filing jointly the standard deduction is thought of as proxy for itemized deductions tax policy recognizes that childrendepende nt students are not completely separate from their parents and there have often been limitations on the kinds and am ounts of income that childrenstudents could receive tax free including limitations imposed by restricting exemptions and deductions tax law prior to the 2006 enactment of the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act pl 109 222 required minors under age 14 are taxed on their unearned income ie passive income such as interest at their parents marginal tax rate the new law increases the age of minors subj ect to this tax to those minors under age 18 under law prior to 1954 the internal revenue code of 1954 the standard deduction or former zerobracket amoun t could offset earned income of childstudent but not unearned income such as interest and di vidends unearned income however could be offset by the personal exemption the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 pl 99514 eliminated the personal exemption for childrenstudents who were claimed as dependents on parents return and per mitted childstudent an offset of up to 500 in the form of partial standard deduction this partia l deduction could be used against unearned income this original 500 amount has been s ubject to an inflation adjustment in 1998 the modification made by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 took effect with the maximum standard deduction for childre n and dependent students being the greater of 750 regardless of composition or ear ned income plus 250 not to exceed the standard deduction amount1 the personal exemption amount stood at 1080 prior to the 1986 change with the law providing that unearned income of childstudent could be offset against that amount but the 1986 act longer allowed personal exemption to the childstudent when claimed on parents tax return at the same time however the tra86 permitted partial standard duction to childrenstudents so for 2006 the childstudent with earned income is able to shelter up to 800 of unearned income this 800 amount will continue to be adjusted in future tax years in the case of childrenstudents with 1080 or more in unearned income and who also have earned income the amount of wa ges that can be offset has risen from 2480 before the 1986 act the zero bracket amount for single individuals to 5150 in 2006 anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20072crs3 2 the information provided in th is report applies to children between the ages of 14 and 18 as well as fulltime students between the ages of 19 and 24 for additional information see crs report 8721a minor childrens income effect of the tax reform act of 1986 by marie b morrisincrease of 2670 however for those ch ildrenstudents who onl had earned income the amount has only risen from 3560 the former zero bracket amount plus the personal exemption amount to 5150 an increase of 1590 these dollar amounts are in nominal terms and are not reflecti on of inflationadjusted amounts in those cases where the ch ildsstudents income exceeds 800 in any combination of earned andor unearned income or 5150 in earned income whichever is greater filing separate tax return w ill be necessary for the childs tudent often it is necessary to file separate return even when the childs students income falls below these levels to receive refund of ta xes previously withheld2 fivetest eligibility for dependency exemption key element in determining the tax status of child or student is to establish whether they meet the criteria for depende ncy to claim dependency exemption for any person under present law five tests must be met gross income test taxpayer cannot claim person as dependent if the person had gross income that exceeds the personal exemption amount taxexempt income is not included in the gross income test gross income is measured before allowing for expenses of earning income or other items deductible fo r income tax purposes for example an individual with investment in come of 3101 incurring 600 in selling expenses could not be claimed as dependent although his or her adjusted gross income is only 2501 well below the personal exemption amount the only exceptions to this rule are for taxpayers child who is under the age of 19 or who qualifie s as student under the age of 24 and for disabled dependents with inco attributable to earnings from sheltered workshop in this instance the availability of medical care at such workshop must be the principal reason for hisher presence there and the income must arise solely from activities at such workshop which is incidental to such medical care support test the taxpayer must furnish more than onehalf of the support of person for the taxable year unless multiple support agreement covers the person th ere are special support rules for childrenstudents of divorced or sepa rated parents excludable income not counted in the gross income test is counted in determining whether the taxpayer has furnished over half the dependents support for example public social welfare benefits while excluded from gross income are treated as support by the state member of household or relationship person need not be related to the taxpayer to qualify as dependent if he or she is member of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20072crs4 taxpayers household and lives with the taxpayer for the entire year alternatively certain dependent relatives need not live with the taxpayer or be member of the taxpayers household to be claimed as an exemption for example parents grandparents and student children of the taxpayer may be claimed as dependents even if they live in separate domicile citizenship test with lone exception for certain adopted children dependent must be citizen or national of the united states or resident of the united states or resident of ca mexico the panama canal z one or the republic of panama few residents of the philippines are also covered joint return test taxpayer is not allowed an exemption for dependent if the depende nt is married and files joint tax return as result of the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl 108311 the rules for the dependency exemption for children we re modified when uniform definition of qualifying child was adopted the uniform finition states that child is qualifying child of taxpayer if the child satisfies three tests the first test requires that the child have the same principal place of abode as the taxpayer for more than one half of the taxable year the second test requires that th child have specified relationship to the taxpayer the third test restricts the age of the child to under 19 for purposes of the dependency exemption the new law eliminates the need for ta xpayers to meet the gross income and the support tests for dependency when claiming child for the dependency exemption as long as the child meets the uniform definition students taxpayers may claim dependency exempti ons for children 19 through 23 years of age who are fulltime students at least five months during the year even if the children have gross income in excess of the pe rsonal exemption amount 3300 in 2006 and could not normally be claimed other standa rd dependency tests mu st be met including the taxpayers provision of onehalf of the dependents support these dependents cannot claim personal exemptions on their own retu rns however and their standard deduction may be lower in 2006 with some excepti ons the standard deduction for students is equal to the greater of 800 in any combina tion of earned or unearned income or their earned income plus up to 250 of unearned income providing it does not exceed the standard deduction amount of 5150 for single taxpayers if the students income is greater than these amounts he or she must file tax return the internal revenue code defines fulltime student as student who attends an educational organization during some part of each of five calendar months of the taxpayers calendar year this fivemont h period is not required to be consecutive individuals may be classified as students if they attend eith er an educational organization or if they pursue fulltime c ourse of institutional onfarm training under the supervision of an accredited agent or an educational orga nization the code defines an educational organization as one that maintains regular faculty and curriculum and normally has ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20072crs5 3 internal revenue code

pupils or st udents in attendance at the place where its educational activities ar regularly carried on3 brief history prior to1954 if child or student earned mo re than 600 the amount of the personal exemption at the time then the parent lost the ability to claim dependency exemption for the childstudent the internal revenue code of 1954 made the personal exemption available to both the parent and childstude nt otherwise childrenstudents who worked parttime to help defray the cost of their education could cause the loss of the dependency exemption to their parents even though th parents still provided more than half the childsstudents support thus between 1954 and the passage of the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 it was possible for both the parent nd childstudent to offset income by claiming personaldependency exemption for the same individual under provisions introduced by the tra86 if the parent cl aimed the dependency exemption the childstudent could not also claim it however the tra86 also provided standard deduction amount for children students equal to the greater of 500 combination of earned ndor unearned income or earned income up to the generally applicable standard deduction amount that law also provided that these amounts be indexed for inflation in future tax years while not expressly stated in the explanation of the tax reform act of 19864 prepared by the staff of the joint committ ee on taxation it may be inferred that the rationale for the 1986 change in the persona ldependency exemption was threefold one was consistency other exceptions are available for person to be claimed as an exemption on more than one tax return the general rule can be simply stated as one personal exemption per person the second reason was that the combination of the personal exemption and the sta ndard deduction was designed to provide safety net to those near the poverty threshold the inten tion was that those individuals near the poverty line would not be obliged to pay fede ral income taxes income of dependents does not relate to the poverty threshold in the same way for example child with little income of his or her own may live in hi ghincome household the third reason was that the congress was concerned that some highincome taxpayers were shifting assets to their children in an attempt to lower income subject to the parents higher tax rates to the extent they shifted that income into lower tax brackets federal revenue collections were lowered while personal exemption cannot be claimed by child or student on his or her tax return when dependency exemption is claimed by parent there are some compensating factors the exemption amount was almost doubled by the passage of the 1986 act as such we could say that cong ress shifted some of the value of the personal exemptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20072crs6 5 us congress senate committee on finance revenue reconciliation act of 1997 report to accompany s 949 105th cong 1st sess srept 10533 was hingtongpo 1997 p 222 washington gpo 1997 p 222 from the childrenstudents to the parents si nce the income of the parent was generally larger than the income of the childstudent placing the parent in higher tax rate bracket it followed that the value of dollar of pe rsonal exemption or st andard deduction could be higher for the parent than for his or her childstudent filing separate return the taxpayer relief act of 1997 modified the standard deduction of dependents as simplification measure the provision wa s included in the house passed version and remained unchanged when reported by the senates committee on finance the finance committees report stated that the reason for change was the belief by the committee that significant simplification of the ex isting income tax system can be achieved by providing larger exemptions such that taxpayers with incomes less than the exemption are not required to compute and pay any tax the committee particularly believes that the presentlaw exemptions of depe ndent children are too small5 the act increased the standard deducti on to the greater of 700 the prior 500 amount adjusted for inflation or the m of 250 and earned income but not to exceed the full standard deduction thus under pr ovisions of the act childrenstudents with earned incomes greater than 700 but less th an the standard deduction amount who have small amount of unearned income up to 250 would longer have the unearned income taxed nor have to file tax return this change became effective for tax year 1998
