disabilities and to judicial decisions requiring that states provide an education for children with disabilities if they provide an education fo r children without disabilities4 as originally enacted idea containe d specific provision for mediation but the department of education had noted that states had had success in using mediation as an intervening step prior to formal due process hearing the department encouraged the use of mediation and found that the use of discretionary grant funds for reimbursement of diation fees was permissible expenditure5 in 1997 pl 10517 added statutory langua ge on mediation when this statute was being considered congress indicated its strong preference that mediation become the norm for resolving disputes under idea6 the senate and house reports further

states from allowing parties to sign confidentiality pledge to ensure that discussions during the mediation process remain confidential irrespective of whether the mediation results in resolution26 the previous regulations provided that the states shall maintain list of individuals who are qualifie d mediators and knowledgeable about special education and that if the mediator is not selected on rotational basis from the list both parties must be involved in selecting the mediator27 the final regulations keep the listed requirements but also require that the sea must select mediators on random rotational or other impartial ba sis and delete the langua ge regarding involvement by the other party28 ed noted in its discussion of this section that these provisions are sufficient to ensure that the selection of the mediator is not biased while providing seas additional flexibility in selecting mediators selecting mediators on an impartial basis would incl ude permitting the par ties involved in dispute to agree on mediator29 the final regulations also eliminated the previous regulatory section which provided that parents be advised of the availability of mediation whenever hearing is initiated30 ed noted that 300507a2 was replaced by 300506a which incorporates section 615e1 of the act and requires mediation to be available to resolve disputes involving any matter under th is part including matters arising prior to the filing of due process complaint section 300506a therefore expands the availability of mediati on beyond that required in current 300507a231 the previous section was th considered superfluous the statutory language requires that mediator be impartial and the department of educations regulations expand upon this requirement the regulations which are similar to the previous regulatory secti on provide that mediator may not be an employee of local or state educational agency that is involved in the education or care of the child the

attorneys fees should be available for work performed during diation and many of these were decided prior to the 1997 amendments however there have been several recent decisions which have touched upon other issues generally the pre1997 cases regarding attorneys fees found that these fees were allowable33 the rationale of these cases however was drawn into question by the supreme courts decision in buckhannon board and care home v west virginia department of human resources34 although this case did not involve idea it rejected the catalyst theory the theory that if the plaintiffs actions served as catalyst to change the behavior of defendant attorneys fees may be awarded as basis for the award of attorneys fees pursuant to statutory provision the cases since buckhannon have largely turned on whether there was judicial involvement in jose luis r v joliet township high school district 20435 the court found that the plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence that the hearing officer approved or sanctioned the parties mediation agr eement and that without cour t approval or sanction the agreement was simply private settlement and therefore attorneys fees could not be awarded similarly in sanford v sylvania city sc hool board of education36 the court found that settlement agreement was not sufficient to grant prevailing party status and thus attorneys fees if th agreement was not judicially sanctioned however in ostby v oxnard union high37 the court found that the plaintiffs were the prevailing party since after mediation they had obtained private

issues regarding mediation have also been raised in pitchford v salem keizer school district38 an action was brought by pare nts of an autistic child against the school district for failure to provide their child with free appropriate public education the district court found that the iep individualized education program for one of the school years at issue was suffi ciently flawed to deprive the child of free appropriate public educa tion for that year rather than issue order on the merits the court ordered the parties to mediation to attempt to reach an agreement to avoid further litigation in amy s v danbur local school district39 the parents of child with aspergers syndrome requested extended sc hool year services for the child were denied and filed request fo r due process hearing the parents agreed to mediate with the school and they signed written ttlement agreement providing in part for tutoring and stating that all issues relating to the childs education were resolved up to the date of the agreement the pare nts alleged other violations of idea and signed another mediation agreement afterwards the parents filed complaint in district court alleging vi olations prior to the dates of the signed mediation agreements the district court concluded that the mediation agreements precluded review of the parents claims and the c ourt of appeals agreed emphasizing that the parents
