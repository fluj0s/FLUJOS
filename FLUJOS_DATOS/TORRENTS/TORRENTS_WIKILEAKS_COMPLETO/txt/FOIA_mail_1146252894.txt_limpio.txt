philip we have three groups of trees scand which includes the tornetrask and finland multimillennial chronologies but also some shorter chronologies from the same region these trees fall mainly within the 3 boxes centred at 175e 675n 225e 675n 275e 675n urals which includes the yamal and polar urals long chronologies plus other shorter ones these fall mainly within these 3 boxes 525e 675n 625e 625n note this is the only one not at 675n 675e 675n taimyr which includes the taimyr long chronology plus other shorter ones these fall mainly within these 4 boxes 875e 675n 1025e 675n 1125e 675n 1225e 675n we do some analysis at the group scale and for this we take the jja temperatures from each box and average to the group scale to obtain single series from each of scand urals and taimy we do some analysis at the overall scale and for this we take these three group temperature series and average them to get an overall nw eurasia temperature for boxes with tree chronologies in them we did also try using wider average for the region including all land temperatures from grid boxes within rectangular region from 125e to 1275e and from 575n to 725n but i dont think it correlated so well against the treering width data i cant remember the exact correlations so we didnt pursue that does that give you enough information to be going on with id recommend using crutem3 rather than hadcrut3 because the correlations seem to deteriorate with the inclusion of sst data in some cases though of course you can look into this yourself cheers tim at 1635 27042006 philipbrohanmetofficegovuk wrote thanks tim i need to extract from the instrumental and model data the appropriate data to calibrate the treerings against presumably this is the junejulyaugust average land surface temperature for particular region in nw eurasia could you send the lat and long ranges of the region cheers philip on thu 20060427 at 1601 tim osborn wrote thanks for the nice precise description of methodology philip its good that we are all clear exactly what procedure is to be applied on the train after our meeting last week keith and i discussed this bit more in the nw eurasian case study n is quite high and therefore it is likely that the bootstrap estimates will show relatively little variation and probably will underestimate the true error due to additional errors in the assumptions underlying rcs as discussed in london we will do the calculations anyway and then we will know for sure how largesmall they are rather than just speculating it looks likely that tom melvin will have time to devote directly to this issue as he will probably be funded by our that includes you simon nerc rapid project for while onceif this is confirmed then well get tom to do the calculations outlined below and communicate directly with philip over any implementation issues etc cheers tim at 1602 26042006 philipbrohanmetofficegovuk wrote keith tim at our meeting last wednesday i agreed to specify exactly what needed to be done to make uncertainty estimates for standardisation of the treering data suppose we are making proxy series from n cores from those n cores we can make an rcs age correction curve and mean proxy series the average of the cores after applying the age correction curve to each one these are the bestestimate values for the agecorrection curve and the proxy series we also need bootstrap estimates of the age correction curve and the mean proxy series to make bootstrap estimate sample with replacement from the n cores until you have set of n samples some of the cores will be in this sample once some several times and some not at all from this set of n samples make an age correction curve and mean proxy series as before these are the bootstrap estimates we need lot of bootstrap estimates id like 1000 100 will probably do at pinch so please can you make these and send the 1001 age correction curves and 1001 mean proxy series i will do something similar with the instrumental series and we can then make bootstrap estimates of the regression uncertainty and the uncertainty in the reconstructed temperatures cheers philip philip brohan climate scientist met office hadley centre for climate
