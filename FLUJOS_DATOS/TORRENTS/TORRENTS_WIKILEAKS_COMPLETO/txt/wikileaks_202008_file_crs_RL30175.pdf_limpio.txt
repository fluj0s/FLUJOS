trade benefits that are equivalent to those accorded wto members the invocation of the clause would mean that the countries may not claim wto benefits from one another as matter of right under the wto nor could the parties invoke wto dispute procedures since the wto dispute settlement understanding applies only to disputes brought pursuant to the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of
