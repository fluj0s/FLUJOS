from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to stepanipaeuranruevagiforkrasnoyarsksu subject intasvienna and norwich date fri oct 2 105137 1998 dear stepan and eugene and fritz i have now receivd contracts from the ec for the intas work i have received the real signed power of attorney form from stepan but not from eugene it seems i must have both i am bit reluctant to forge eugenes signature we will need to think about how the money should be handled also please all go back and look at the document i wrote and be sure you are happy with the committment the most important new aspect is the biomass work and i think new or additional collections need to be taken to look at the growth of young medium and old trees separately through time we have very few recent young and middle age trees in recent years we could consider using data along northsouth transects how goes the status of the siberian transect also i must go to vienna in 2 weeks to present the results of advance10k we have meeting of this group here in norwich in november but i am very sorry that i have funds to invite you to attend this could you afford meeting some time perhaps in neutral spot where we all including fritz might get together to talk about the intas work and future ec work state of the art report of progress of the taimyr and yamal work is needed very soon by emailalso so that i can report on it in vienna and norwich i am also writing paper for pages for the book of the conference in london that rashit attended i will include report of both projects hopefully with some figures of the data distribution or plots of the some version of the curves themselves along with others at high latitudes i would appreciate new copies of the full dated raw data sets in tucson compact format to produce some curves in standard style i would like to compare changing variance through time at different wave lengths and perhaps co spectra as for money on advance10k i initially was awarded 50000ecu to be split between krasnoyarsk and ekaterinburg because of exchange rate changes which have gone against us continually since the start of the project this is now worth between 02 and 025 less than it did then i have looked at the remaining money and i think i can give you each final payment of between 4000 and 4500 us dollars this is not definate but it is pretty definate i hope this means you may be able to do this years fieldwork we need to think also about how and if this should be coordinted with the intas work but maybe not how about some discussion by email regarding these points i look forward to quick reply my best wishes keith
