from mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk to storok subject fwd re kyoto survey press inquiry from the thes date thu apr 5 115931 2001 simon could you or vanessa buy thes today from the paper shop and check this out i would quite like to draft short letter to thes as suggested by steve but i need to see how the issue was presented in this weeks issue thanks mike from farrar steve stevefarrarthescouk to mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk subject re kyoto survey press inquiry from the thes date thu 5 apr 2001 094533 0100 xmailer internet mail service 55265319 dear mike thanks for that i feel terrible but despite the pain it cost to reply to the survey the deadline has now passed we had such high response rate that we decided to run the piece in this weeks paper while the issue of the us withdrawl from the protocol was still high in everyones mind so i cannot include your responses however you make number of very significant points not least your reply to question 2 on the strength of the evidence and the political framework outlined in your final sentences i wonder and i know this is pushing it whether you might consider rearranging some of these sentences to form brief letter to the editor for the following weeks paper i would like this issue to stay alive in the thes and allow the paper to play small role in persuading as many scientists as possible to take part in scientificpolitical debate that may contribute to influencing those people who can change things not an original objective i know but the thes does have fairly unique position within the academic community and hence responsibility anyhow sorry for the bad news best wishes steve steve farrar science reporter times higher education supplement 6668 east smithfield london e1w 1bx united kingdom 1wwwthescouk tel 44

sort of questionnaires since or n answers are barely adequate however ive given it go with some other comments by the way prof trevor davies is head of my school here at uea i am only director of centre within the school albeit highly relevant one you can quote if appropriate but let know before hand mike at 1230 020401 0100 you wrote dear mike hope youre well i am conducting survey of heads of uk university departments of environmental science for the times higher education supplement i am keen to explore views concerning the united states and the kyoto agreement i wonder if you could answer the following yesno questions when you get moment note i will not identify you unless you specifically state that you do not mind being quoted i do hope you can help all the bets steve 1 do you believe human activities are at least in part responsible for driving global climate change yes 2 do you feel the evidence for this is sufficiently strong to start reducing emissions to reduce emissions requires more evidence than that humans are altering climate we need to know something about the potential risks associated with future climate change whether these risks can be minimised through adaptive action and then have some socially negotiated basis for deciding about the necessity and extent of desirable emissions reductions on none of these issues do we have good basis to work from the precautionary principle if chosen would imply start reducing emissions now but i am not convinced blind application of the precautionary principle in this case is the most appropriate instrument 3 do you think the measures proposed at kyoto were too weak correct or too strong the 52 emissions reduction by 2010 by annex i countries were not driven by science but by realpolitik by definition they were the best achievable the real issue however is not about target setting its about the dynamics of change worldwide in energy technologies investment strategies consumer and community behaviour and aspirations etc it is these things that in the end will deliver safer climate not the protocol per more attention should be directed at the diverse and myriad set of actions needed to decarbonise our societies 4 are you disappointed that george bush has abandoned the kyoto agreement yes but it is too early to say that kyoto is dead the usa does not have the power of veto and bush will have to propose some climate management strategy of his own we wait and see 5 should the rest of the world press on with the agreement without the united states probably yes this can be achieved and should provide valuable lessons in global climate management which we can learn from in the longterm 6 do you feel the us should be allowed to count carbon sequestration measures such as planting new forests towards any carbon emissions reduction target yes the uk are doing it in their national climate change programme so why not the usa 7 are you optimistic that there will be new emissions control agreement within the next 12 months new one we havent got one yet i would think maybe not in the next 12 months but the critical issues about global climate management will be clearer 8 should the kyoto preliminary targets be watered down to gain the americans support if the usa dont like them let them not ratify or propose strategy of their own if you would like to add any comments to this survey as to the implications of the uss rejection of kyoto for the planet what uk can do about it or what role scientists can play in this debacle please do so in literal sense the implications for global climate are trivial what will affect the course of global climate and only then climate beyond about 2030 up until then climate is pretty much predetermined by inertia in the system in the longrun are the effects of cumulative decisions taken by many many peoplegovernmentsbusinesses over the next 1020 years lets not kid ourselves that the usa president is more powerful than he would like to think the planetary system is much bigger than one 4year term of us president the uk is playing key role both within the negotiating machinery of the fccc in pioneering new scientific analyses and in working out new forms of adapting to climate change this momentum in the uk is not going to be halted by bush scientists need to be there to point out the longterm nature of the problem it is not classic political issue where oneterm government can solve or worsen the problem scientists need to point out that for longterm planetary management we need new analytical tools new criteria for investment decisions new appreciation of the concept of global citizenship what climate change forces us to do is to think about the influence we are having on the quality of life for the next generation but one not our own generation or even our childrens generation conventional politics is not system geared up for this challenge steve farrar science reporter times higher
