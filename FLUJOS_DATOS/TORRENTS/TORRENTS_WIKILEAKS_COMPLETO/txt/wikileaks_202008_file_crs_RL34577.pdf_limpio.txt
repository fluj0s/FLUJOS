the congressional response to that proposal it compares the presidents fy2009 request to the fy2008 lhhsed amounts the report is designed to track legislative action and congressional issues related to the lhhsed appropriations bill with particular attention paid to discretionary programs however the report does not follow specifi c funding issues related to mandatory lhhsed programs such as medicare or social security nor does it follow any authorizing legislation that may be needed prior to funding some of the presidents budget initiatives for glossa ry of budget terms nd relevant websites see appendix terminology and web resources the lhhsed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills not only because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs but also because of the continuing importance of various related issues such as restrictions on the use of federa l funds for abortion and stem cell research this bill provides discretionary and mandatory funds to three fede ral departments and 14 related agencies including the social security administration ssa discretionary funding represents only onequarter of the total in the billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34577crs3 among the various appropriations bills lhhsed is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic nondefense federa l programs the department of defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs this section presents seve ral overview tables on funding in the bill particularly discretionary

uding both discretionary and mandatory appropriations the table shows various aggregate measur of lhhsed appropriations including the discretionary program vel current year level and advance appropriations as well as scorekeeping adjustments program level discretionary appropriations reflect the total discretionary appropriations in given bill regardless of the year in which they will be spent and ther efore include advance funding for future years unless otherwise specified appropriations l evels in this report refer to program level amounts current year discretionary appropriations represent discretionary appropriations in given bill for the current year plus discretionary appropriations for the current year that were enacted in prior years for example fy2008 appropriations that were enacted in the fy2007 act as the annual congressional appropriations process unfolds current year discreti onary appropriations including scorekeeping adjustments see below are measured against the 302b allocation ceilings discussed ter in this report note that media reports and comments from the administration about appropriations activities typically cite figures representing the current year discretionary totals rather than the program levels in the bill advance appropriations are funds that will not become available until after the fiscal year for which the appropriations are enacted for example funds for certain ducation programs like title i part grants to local educational agencies for the education of the disadvantaged that were include d in the fy2007 act that could not be spent before fy2008 at the earliest discussed later in this report scorekeeping adjustments are made to account for special funding situations as monitored by the congressional budget office cbo because appropriations may consist of mixtures of budget authority enacted in various years two summary measures are frequently used program level appropriations and current year appropriations

increase from fy2008 funding of 120 billion 302a and 302b allocation ceilings the maximum budget authority for annual lhhsed appropriations is determined through twostage congressiona l budget process in the first stage congress establishes the 302a allocations the maximum spending totals for congressional committees for given fis cal year this task is sometimes accomplished through the concurrent resolu tion on the budget where spending totals are specified through the statement of managers in the conference report in years when the house and senate do not reach budg et agreement these totals may be set through leadership arrangements in each ch amber the 302a llocations determine spending totals for each of the various committees as well as the total discretionary budget authority available for enactment in annual appropriations through the house and senate committees on appropriations congress reached agreement on the fy2009 budget resolution i n early june 2008 when the senate june 4 and the h ouse june 5 agreed to the conference report hrept 110659 accompanying sc onres 70 the resolution established 302a discretionary budget allocati on of 10117 billion for the purpose of comparison the 302a discreti onary allocation originally agreed to for fy2008 washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34577crs10 9531 billion the current fy2008 302 allocation revised to include emergencies is 10505 billion in the second stage of the annual cong ressional budget process the house and senate committees on appropriations separately establish the 302b allocations the maximum discretionary budget au thority available to each subco mmittee for each annual appropriations b ill the total of these allocations must not exceed the 302a discretionary total this process creates the basis for enforcing discretionary budget discipline since any appropriations bill reported with total above the ceiling is subject to point of order the 302b allocations can and often do get adjusted during the year as the various appropriations bills progress toward final enactment table 6 shows the 302b discretionary llocations for the fy2009 lhhsed appropriations determined by the hous and senate committees on appropriations comparable amounts for the fy2008 appr opriations and the presidents fy2009 budget request are also shown both th 302a and 302b llocations regularly become

appropriations occur when funds enacted in one fiscal year are not available for obligation until subsequent fiscal year for example pl 109149 which enacted fy2006 lhhsed appropr iations provided 400 million for the corporation for public broadcastin g cpb for use in fy2008 advance appropriations may be used to meet seve ral objectives these might include the provision of longterm budget information to recipients such as state and local educational systems to enable better planning of future program activities and personnel levels the more contentious as pect of advance appropriations however involves how they are counted in budget ceilings advance appropriations avoi d the 302a and 302b llocation ceilings for the current year but must be counted in the year in which they first become available for obligation this procedure uses up ahead of time part of what will be counted against the allocation ceiling in future years in fy2002 the presidents budget proposed the elimination of advance appropriations for federal discretionary programs including those for lhhsed programs congress re jected that proposal and the proposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34577crs11 has

funding restrictions on august 9 2001 president bush announced decision to use federal funds for research on human embryonic stem cells for the first time but limited the funding to existing stem cell lines embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into virtually any cell in the body and have the potential to treat medical conditions such as diabetes and parkinsons disease in response to th presidents announcement the nih developed registry of 78 embryonic stem cell lines eligible for use in federally funded research however many of th lines were found to be unavailable or unsuitable for research only 21 of the 78 eligible stem cell lines are currently available for general research purposes some scientists are concerned about the quality longevity and availability of eligible stem cell lines the nih director and many others believe that th advancement of research requires new stem cell lines the use of stem cells however raises ethical issues for some because the embryos are destroyed in order to obtain the cells an fy1996 appropriations continuing re solution pl 10499 128 prohibited nih funds from being used for the creati on of human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human embr yos are destroyed since fy1997 annual appropriations acts have ex tended the prohibition to all lhhsed funds with the nih as the agency primarily affected the restriction originally introduced by representative jay dickey has not changed significantly since it was first enacted the current provision can be found in 509 of pl 110161 division g the original fy2008 senate

behind act of 2001 pl 107110 which amended th esea among other programs there has been continuing discussion regardin g the appropriations promised and the resulting shortfall when the enacted appr opriations are compared to authorization levels some would conte nd that the esea authoriza tions of appropriations as amended by nclba represent funding commitment that was promised in return for legislative support for the new adminis trative requirements placed on state and local educational systems they would contend that the authorized levels are needed for implementing the new requirements and that the differences between promised and actual funding levels repr esent shortfall of billions of dollars others would contend that the authorized funding leve ls represent more than appropriations ceilings and as such are different fro m authorizations for most education programs that is when the authorizati on amount is specified it represents only maximum amount with the actual funding leve l to be determined during the regular annual appropriations process in the past education programs with specified authorization levels genera lly have been funded at wer levels few have been funded at levels equal to or higher than the speci fied authorization amount five esea programs as amended by nc lba had specific authorization levels for fy2002 through fy2007 title i part grants to local educational agencies leas 21st century community learning cent ers 21cclc the education block grant school choice and the fund for th improvement of education for fy2007 the aggregate authorization for these five programs was 289 billion and the appropriation was 144 billion or 145 billion less than the amount authorized all current esea program authoriza tions expired after fy2007 they have been automatically extended however fo r one additional year under section 422 of the general education provisions act g epa 20 usc 1226a providing for contingent extension of programs therefore current esea programs are authorized through september 30 2008 gepa also specifies that the amount authorized to be appropriated for prog ram during the extension shall be the amount that was authorized to be appropriated for the program during the terminal fiscal year of the program thus in the case of the five esea programs with specific authorization levels for fy2007 those aut horizations remain the same for fy2008 therefore for fy2008 the aggregate author ization for the five programs was 289 billion and the programs were funded at 157 billion or 131 billion less than the amount authorized the gepa extension applied for one year only for fy2009 all funding for esea programs is taken to be based on authorizations provided implicitly by appropriations with funds used under the polic ies in effect at the end of the explicit authorization period that is if one assumes that appropr iations will continue to be provided for esea programs despite an expired authorization it may also be reasonable to assume that the use of these funds will continue to be governed by the same policies as they were when the esea was still explicitly authorized underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34577crs25 these circumstances the authorization vels for the five esea programs with specific authorization levels for fy 2007 would continue to have the same authorization levels in fy2009 thus th aggregate authoriz ation for these five programs would continue to be 289 b illion the presidents fy2009 request for these five programs was 154 billion or 135 billion less than the authorization idea funding shortfall from 1975 to 2004 the idea special education part b grants to states program author ized state payments up to maximum amount of 40 of the national average perpupil expenditure appe times the number of children with disabilities ages 321 that each state serves appropr iations have never reached the 40 level in 2004 congress addressed the funding issue in pl 108 446 which specified authorization ceilings for part b grants to states for fy2005 through fy2011 for fy2008 the authorized amount was 192 billion and 109 billion was appropriated or 83 billion less than the amount authorized for fy2009 the authorized amount was 215 b illion and the request was for 113 billion or 102 b illion less than the authorized amount as with esea and nclba some view these differences as funding shortfalls while others see the maximum federal share and the specified authorizations as nothing more than appropriations ceilings for additional information please see crs report rl32085 individuals with disabilities educa tion act idea current funding trends by ann lordeman forward funding and advance appropriations most appropriations are available for obligation during the federal fiscal year of the appropriations bill for example most fy2009 appropriations will be available for obligation from october 1 2008 through september 30 2009 several lhhsed programs including some of the larger ed progra ms have authoriza tion or appropriations provisions that allow funding flexibility for program years that differ from the federal fiscal year for example many of the elementary and seconda ry education formula grant programs receive appropriations that become available for obligation to the states on july 1 of the same year as th appropriations and re main available for 15 months through the end of the following fi scal year that is fy2009 appropriations for some programs will become available for obligation to the states on july 1 2009 and will remain ava ilable until september 30 2010 this budgetary procedure is popularly known as forward or multiy ear funding and is accomplished through funding provisions in the lhhsed appropriations bill forward funding in the case of elementary nd secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time for sc hool officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year for pell grants for undergraduates however aggregate program costs for indi vidual students applying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ah ead of time appropriations from one fiscal year primarily support pell grants during the following academic year that is the fy2009 appropriations will be used primarily to support grants for the 20092010 academic year unlike fundi ng for elementary and secondary education programs however the funds for pell grants remain available for obligation for two full fiscal years an advance appropriation occurs when the appropria tion is provided for fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which th appropriation was enacted in the case ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34577crs26 fy2009 appropriations funds normally would have beco available october 1 2008 under regular funding provisions but will not become available for some programs until july 1 2009 under the forwar d funding provisions discussed above however if the july 1 2009 forward f unding date for obligation were to be postponed by three months until oct ober 1 2009 the appropriation would be reclassified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in subsequent fiscal year fy2010 for example the fy2009 budget request for title i part grants to leas was 143 billion this amount includes not only forward funding of 64 billion to become available july 1 2009 but also an advance appropriation of 79 billion to become available october 1 2009 like forward funding provisions these advan ce appropriations are specified through provisions in the annua l appropriations bill what is the impact of these chan ges in funding provisions at the appropriations level ther is difference between forward funded and advance appropriations except for the period availa ble for obligation at the program or service level relatively little is changed by the threemonth delay in the availability of funds since most expenditures for st andard school year occur after october 1 at the scorekeeping level however sign ificant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year and is therefore fully included in the current 302b allocation for discretionary appropriations under federal budget scorekeeping rules an adva nce appropriation is not counted in the 302b allocation until the following year in essence threemonth change from forward funding to an advance appropria tion for given program allows onetime shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations for more inform ation please see crs report rs20441 advance appropriations forward funding and advance funding by sandy streeter crs products crs report rs20441
