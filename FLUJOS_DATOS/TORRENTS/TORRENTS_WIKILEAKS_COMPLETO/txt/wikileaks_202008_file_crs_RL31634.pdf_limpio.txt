insurance market and imposed certain federal requirements on hea lth insurance plans offered by public and private employers it guaranteed the availability and renewability of health insurance coverage for certain employees and individuals and limited the use of preexisting condition restrictions the act establishe d federal standards for insurers health maintenance organizations hmos and empl oyer plans including those who self insure however it allowed states and sometimes insurers substantial state flexibility for compliance with the federal requirements hipaa also included tax provisions relating to health insurance it permitted limited number of small businesses and selfemployed individuals to contribute to tax advantaged medical savings accounts msas established in conjunction with highdeductible health insurance plans it increased the deduction for health insurance that selfemployed taxpayers may claim in addition it allowed longterm care expenses to be treated like deductible medical expenses and clarified the tax treatment of longterm care insurance hipaa amended the employee retirement income security act erisa the public health service phs act and the

organizations hmos are found in the phs act and erisa amendments the increased deduction for the selfemployed taxfavored msas and longterm care provisions are amendments to the irc part i the act in general the basic intent of hipaas health insurance provisions is to lower the possibility that people and small employers will lose existing health plan coverage and to make it easier for individuals to sw itch plans or to purchase coverage on their own if they lose employeroffered covera ge the health insurance reforms ensure that people who are moving from one j ob to another or from employment to unemployment are not denied health insurance because they have preexisting medical condition portability and limit the waiting time before plan covers any preexisting medical condition for participants and beneficiaries in group health planshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31634crs2 1 insurance that is regulated by state law may be subject to state premium limits there are premium limits on selfinsured employer plans 2 us general accounting office health insurance standards new federal law creates challenges for consumers insurers regulators gaohehs9867 february 1998the reforms were also intended to guaran tee that individuals and employers who choose to purchase coverage are able to find plan guaranteed issue and that individuals already covered as well as employers that offer coverage to their employees are able to renew their coverage guaranteed renewal finally the health insurance provisions prohib it discrimination on the basi s of health status non discrimination and require plans to offer special enrollment periods other hipaa provisions seek to make h ealth insurance more affordable the act raised the tax deduction for health insurance premiums paid by the self employed msas coupled with qualified hi gh deductible health insurance plans were made available on trial basis to limited number of individuals new tax incentives were made available to encourage individuals and employers to purchase longterm care insurance finally the act included administrative simplification and privacy provisions instructing the secretary of hhs to issue standards addressing the electronic transmission of health info rmation and the privacy of personally identifiable medical information additional federal protecti ons have been added since the passage of hipaa the protections required plans that cove r newborn delivery to allow for minimum twoday hospital stay under cer tain conditions required plan s that offer mental health services to offer them subject to similar limitations as other health benefits and required plans that cover mastectomy to also cover reconstructive surgery in addition the deduction allowed for pre mium costs for the selfemployed was changed does hipaa help individuals who are uninsured hipaas insurance provisions were designed to help insured americans who have preexisting medical condition and have stayed in job because they fear that they would lose coverage for such condition if they change to new employer or move to an individual policy it also would help those who have been denied the option to purchase insurance as an individual or through their employer because of their health status they do not address the larger problem of the uninsured estimated to be 45 million people in 2003 although other hipaa provi sions such as the tax deductibility of health insurance costs for the selfemplo yed may encourage so uninsured self employed individuals to purch ase coverage for themselves it is also the case that hipaa largely addresses the availability of insurance and does not regulate the price of health insurance coverage1 some evidence suggests that the cost of health insurance in the individual market for individuals taking advantage of hipaas grouptoindividual portability provisions is significantly higher than the cost for individuals who c ould otherwise obtain insurance this may be discouraging many hipaa eligibles from buying insurance2 whether this experience continues over the l ong run remains to be seenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31634crs3 3 health insurance coverage is defined as benefits consisting of medical care provided directly through insurance or reimbursement or otherwise and including items and services paid for as medical care under any hospital or medical service policy or certificate hospital or medical service plan contr act or hmo contract offered by health insurance issuer 4 military health care is care described under 10 usc part 55are employers required to offer health insurance as benefit the act does not require employers to offe r or pay for health insurance for their employees also the act does not require employers to offer or pay for family coverage spouses and depende nts finally the act doe s not require employers to cover part time seasonal or temporary employees however an employer who elects to sponsor group health plan has to comply with certain requirements of the act these requirements restrict the use of preexisting condition limitation periods b prohibit an employer plan from discriminating on the basis of health status in determining the eligibility of an employee to enroll in group health plan and the employees spouse and dependents if the plan provides family coverage c prohibit an employer plan from requiri ng an individual to pay premiums or contributions which are greater than those charged to similarly situated individual on the basis of health status and d ma ndate documentation of creditable coverage part ii health insurance reforms portability hipaas portability protection means that once person obtains creditable health plan coverage he or she can use evidence of that coverage to reduce or eliminate any preexisting medical condition exclusion period that might otherwise be imposed when moving to another hea lth plan the protections apply when person moves from one group health plan to another from group health plan to an individual policy or from an individual po licy to group health plan the concept of portability is really one of being able to maintain coverage and being given credit for having been insured when changing health plans it does not mean that an individual can take specific health in surance policy from one job to another what is creditable coverage the concept of creditable coverage is that individuals are given credit for previous insurance when applying for new plan under the act creditable coverage is c overage under any of the following group health plan b

insurance program schip5 what is preexisting medical condition under the act preexisting medical condition is physical or ment condition for which medical advice diagnosis care or treatment was recommended or received within the 6month period ending on the enrollment date the enrollment date is the date of enrollment of the individual in the health plan or insurance if earlier the first day of the waiting period for such enrollment6 pregnancy is not considered preexisting medical condition also preexisting medical c ondition limit or exclusion may not be imposed on covered benefits for new borns who are covered under creditable coverage within 30 days of birth fi nally preexisting dical cond ition limit or exclusion may not be imposed on covered benefits for newly adopted children or children newly placed for adoption if the child becomes covered under creditable coverage within 30 days of the adoption or placement final regulations7 implementing the health coverage portability provisions of hipaa addressed other types of benefit exclusions th at are not designated as preexisting condition exclusions by the pla n but are considered to be so by the regulators examples of these specifi c benefit exclusions include provisions excluding coverage of pregnancy until 12 months after the individual is eligible for benefits or provisions excluding treatment of injuries relating to accidents that occurred prior to enrollment plans are required to bring those exclusions into compliance with hipaa portability provisions by july 1 2005 the act also prohibits the use of gene tic information as preexisting condition unless there is diagnosis of preexisting medical condition related to the information for example evidence of positive test fo r the gene that predisposes woman to inheritable breast cancer ca nnot be treated as preexisting cond ition unless diagnosis of breast cancer is ma within the 6m onth period described above what is preexisting medical condition limitation period during this period plan may exclude or restrict coverage of pa rticipants or beneficiarys preexisting medical condition under the act group health plan is prohibited from imposing more than 12month preexisting condition limitation period 18 months for late enrollees on an hipaaeligible participant or beneficiary as described below that period is reduced by the amount of the individuals creditable coverage in the individual market hipaaeligible individuals also have portability protectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31634crs5 8 see below for more information on limitation and waiting periodsalthough the circumstances under which t hose protections apply are complex as described in mo re detail below portability in the group market hipaa requires group health plans plans that are offered to an employment based group including both employers and employee organizations that are covered by the act to meet the following requirements related to portability when person with prior creditable coverage first enrolls in group health plan the plan cannot impose limita tion period on preexisting condition that is longer than 12 months 18 months for late enrollees as defined below the length of the allowed preexisting condition limitation period is based on any creditable coverage that an individual may ve the plan cannot apply any preexisting condition waiting period on pregnancy covered newborn or on any covered child under 18 who is adopted even if the adoption is not finalized however the employer ma still require individuals to work for period of time before they are allowed to participate in the health plan this is called waiting period and should not be confused with preexisting condition limitation period8 employers who sponsor group health pl ans are required to provide enrollees with certificate that states the am ount of creditable coverage accumulated and whether or not the enrollee was subject to waiting period under the employers plan individuals can use this certificate to demonstrate prior creditable coverage when moving to new group or individual health insurance plan the act does not require an employer to continue offering coverage to enrollees who have left their jobs except under cobra continuation provisions as described below how do people take full advantage of the portability provisions of the act to benefit from the act individua ls should maintain coverage under health insurance plan without experiencing significant laps in coverage since the portability protection only app lies to people with conti nuous coverage which the statute defines as coverage with lapses of 63 or more days individuals should not allow their insurance coverage to lapse for 63 or more days how long can group health plan restrict coverage for preexisting medical condition coverage of preexisting medical condition may be limited or excluded for up to 12 months for those who enroll in health plan when first eligible to enroll in the case of late enrollment the maximum permitted limitation is 18 months for those moving from one group plan to another group plan or from individual to group coverage the new plan must reduce any preexisting condition limitation period by one month for every month that such individuals d creditable coverage under previous plan provided that they enroll when first eligible and had breakhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31634crs6 9 see what is late enrollment below 10 69 federal register 16894 apr 8 1997 in previous coverage of 63 or more continuous days for example individuals with 6 months of prior creditable coverage could face maximum preexisting condition limitation period of 6 months individuals with 11 months of prior creditable coverage could face maximum limitation period of 1 month once 12month limitation period is met new limitation may ever be imposed as long as continuous coverage is maintained that is there is break in coverage lasting longer than 62 days even if there is chan ge in jobs or health plans if there is period of 63 consecutive days during which individuals have creditable coverage they may be subject to as much as 12month preexisting condition exclusion period or an 18 month exclusi on for late enrollees9 individuals establish eligibility for waiver of preexisting condition limitations by presenting certifications that document prior creditable coverage health plans and health insurance issuers must suppl written certifications of the period of creditable coverage under the plan cove rage if any under cobra continuation provisions and any waiting or affiliation periods imposed the certification must be provided 1 when participant is l onger covered under the plan or otherwise becomes covered under cobr continuation provision 2 after termination of cobra coverage if applicab and 3 upon request whic h is made not later then 24 months after coverage ends the interim rules issued by the three agencies administering the act provide guidance and model certification forms to streamline this process10 in general the certification must be provided in writing what is late enrollment late enrollment occurs when an individual enrolls in group health plan other than during the first period in which the individual is eligible to enroll under the plan or b special enrollment period as described above group health plan may require enrollee to wait 18 months before preexisting condition is covered what is waiting period how do it differ from preexisting condition limitation period waiting period is set amount of time an employee must wait before he or she is ligible to enroll in health plan for example an employer may require an empl oyee to work for 6 months before health insurance benefits become available the act does not limit this type of waiting period employers and health insurance issuers are free to determine the length of waiting peri od however the act requires th at any waiting period be applied uniformly without regard to the health status of potential plan participants or beneficiaries also days in waitin g period are not taken into account when determining whether an indivi dual has experienced break in coverage of 63 or more days this differs from preexisting condition exclusion limitation period which allows plans to exclude coverage for cer tain preexisting health conditions for up to 12 months or 18 months as described above any waiting period required before an employee or his or family member c an become plan participant or beneficiary must run concurrently with any preexisting c ondition limitation period f rhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31634crs7 11 69 federal register 16932 1694546 1696162example if an employer required an employee without any creditable coverage to work for 5 months before he or she could enroll in the firms health plan then the preexisting cond ition limitation period imposed on the coverage of that individual could not exceed 7 months from the date of actual enrollment in the plan if that individual had 7 or more months of creditable coverage then preexisting condition limitation period could be imposed on the coverage under the new plan do plans and issuers have any discr etion in the method of crediting prior coverage yes when an individual change s plans the new benefit package may cover some benefits that were not covered under his or her most r ecent prior plan and the law allows the new plan or issuer some discretion in applying prior creditable coverage to those new benef its plans and issuers may choose between two alternatives when determining creditable coverage 1 they can chose to include all periods of coverage fr om qualified sources and thus not look at any specific benefits or 2 they can examine prior c overage on benefitsp ecific basis and are allowed to exclude from creditable coverage any categories or cla sses of benefits not covered under the most recent prior plan the april 8 1997 interim rule defines the categories of benefits that may be considered separately to be mental health b substance abuse treatment c prescription drugs d dent care or vision care11 thus for example if prior plan did not cover prescription drugs and the new plan includes this benefit the new plan may ex clude coverage of prescription drugs for up to 12 months under this second method if the second method is chosen plans or issuers must disclose its use at the time of enrollment or sale of the plan and apply it uniformly do these protections apply to an individuals spouse and children under group health plan an employer is not required to offer coverage to an individuals spouse or children if the em ployer does offer family coverage the same protections apply to spous and dependents coverage may not be denied because family member is sick and preexis ting condition restrictions are limited as described above portability and guaranteed availability in the individual insurance market hipaa guarantees the availability of plan and prohibits preexisting condition exclusions for certain eligible indi viduals who are moving from group health insurance to insurance in the individual market states have the choice of either enforcing the hipaa individual market guarantees referred to as the federal fallback or they may establish an accep table alternative state mechanism in states using

under the plan if the following conditions are met16 the employee or dependent was covere d under group health plan or had health insurance coverage at the time coverage was previously offered to the employee or dependent for example the employee may have been covered by spouses employer and declined c overage under his own employers plan the employee stated in writing at the time of declining enrollment that the reason for declining was that he or she was covered under another health insurance plan this condition applie s only if the plan sponsor or issuer requires such written statement the employees or dependents prev ious coverage was under cobra continuation provision that had become exhausted or was under some other coverage that had been terminated as result of loss of eligibility for the coverage for reasons such as legal separation divorce d eath termination of employment or reduction in the number of hours of employment or because the employer contribution towards such coverage was terminated to take advantage of special enro llment period the employee would have to request enrollment later than 30 days after the date in which his or her prior coverage was exhaus ted or terminated 2 dependent beneficiaries this special enrollment period applies to individuals who become dependents through marriage birth adoption or pl acement of doption generally this provision app lies if group health plan makes dependent coverage available and the new dependents spouse or parent is either participant or eligible including meeting any waiting periods to be participant under the plan the newly dependent individual must be allowed to enroll as beneficiary under the plan however enrollment must be sought within 30 days of the qualifying event eg the

protections may apply see above section on portability and guaranteed availability in the individual insurance market 18 this ruling stems from language in the conference report on hipaa the inclusion of evidence of insurability in the definition of health status is intended to ensure among other things that individuals are not excluded from health care coverage due to their partic ipation in activities such as motorcycling snowmobiling allterrain vehicle riding horseback riding skiing and other similar activities hrept104736 104th cong 2d sess 186 1996 plan based on health statusrelated

insurability including conditions arising out of domes tic violence and di sability group health plans are also prohibited from failing to reenroll participant or beneficiary on the basis of health statusrelated factors hipaa also prohibits plans from charging differential premiums for enrollees within group plan based on these health status related factors can an employer condition cove rage under its health plan on passing physical examination the act prohibits employer plans and issuers of group health covera ge from establishing rules of eligibility to enroll under the terms of the plan that discriminate based on one or more healthstatus related factors can group plan refuse to enroll individuals who engage in high risk recreational activities these individuals cannot be denied enrollment in group health plan based on hipaa s nondiscrimination provision group plans or issuers offering group health cove rage cannot use information about an individuals health status to either deny coverage or charge differential premiums on january 8 2001 the department of labor issued preliminary final ruling with comment period defining the nondiscr imination provisions of hipaa in this ruling health status is defined very broadly to include evidence of insurability which in turn includes provision that prohibits excluding coverage for individuals who participate in highrisk activities18 thus this broad interpretation extends the nondiscrimination protections to individual s who engage in highrisk recreational activities can group plan exclude coverage of treatments for injuries obtained while engaging in hi ghrisk recreational activities hipaas protection extend to enrollment policies and premiums the protection does not address the benefits that are covered by these plans therefore there is federal requirement to cover treatments for injuries associated with highrisk activities even if these treatments are othe rwise covered under the plan for example plan may exclude coverage for broken leg if it occu rs as result of high risk activityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31634crs16 19 this is consistent with most state health insurance reforms which primarily apply to the small group market typically defined as 2 to 25 2 to 35 or 2 to 50 employees however some state laws provide for guaranteed i ssue of groups with as few as one employee 20 the interim rules interpret the guaranteed issue requirement to apply to all products actively marketed by an issuer in the small group market 69 federal register 16971 apr 8 1997 do these nondiscrimination protect ions apply to an individuals spouse and children under group health plan an employer is not required to offer coverage to an individuals spous or children if the employer does offer family coverage the same non discrimination protections apply to spouse and any other dependents as defined unde r the terms of the plan coverage may not be denied because family member is sick and preexisting cond ition restrictions are limited as described above does the act restrict the premiu m amounts that an employer can charge for health insurance the act does not restrict premium amounts that an employer or insurer can charge it also expressly permits an employer or group health insurer to offer premium disc ounts or rebates or modify otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles for participation in health promotion and disease prevention programs however the act does prohibit health plan from charging an individual higher premiu m than the premium charged for another similarly situated individual enrolled in the plan on the basis of any healthrelated factor such as preexisting medical condition guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability the act requires insurers hmos and other issuers of health insurance selling in the small group market to accept any small employer that applies for coverage regardless of the health status or cl aims history of the employers group19 this requirement is often referre d to as guaranteed issue the act defines small employer as one with two to 50 employees if on the first day of the plan year the plan has fewer than two participants who are current employees it is not considered small group and would not be covered by this gua ranteed issue requirement under guaranteed issue the issuer mu st accept for enrollment under the policy not just the employers group as whole but also every eligible individual in the employers group who is eligible fo r and applies for timely enrollment20 exceptions to guaranteed issue are provided in the ac t for network plans that might otherwise exceed capacity limits or in the event that the employers employees do not live work or reside in the network plans area employer groups with more than 50 employees are not protected by this requirement unless otherwise re quired under state law in the past health insurance issuers usually did not examine the health status or medical history of larger employer groups when deciding whether to accept such groups for coverage the act requires the secretary of health and human services hhs and the general accounting office renamed the government accountability office in july 2004 to report every three years beginning in december 2002 on access to health insurance in the large group markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31634crs17 21 an example of participation rule is requi rement set by the issuer that 80 of all full time employees participate in the employers group health plan an example of contribution requirement is that all participants in the health plan must pay 20 of the plan premium these requirements are used to protect the issuer from selection bias also known as adverse selection in which only si ck members of an employers group sign up for insurance coverage 22 fy1997 appropriations bill for the departments of veterans affairs and housing and urban development pl 104204 title vii 23 in addition to hipaas limited federal protec tions most states have their own mandates for insurers operating in their statescan health insurance issuers dr op or cancel coverage for groups because of high medical costs the act

renewability an issuer ma drop coverage in cases of nonpayment of premiums fraud or similar reasons not relate d to health status such as violation of participation or contribution rules21 but there are limits on amounts insurers may charge federally required benefits as originally passed hipaa did not requi re an employer or issuer of group health insurance to offer specific benefits twice since its passage congress added to hipaas protections by mandating specific benefits but in each case only for plans that cover certain services as pa rt of the fy1997 appropriations bill for the departments of vete rans affairs and housing nd urban development vahud congress included provisions that 1 require plans that cover mental health services to provide limited mental health parity and

rights act which requires plans that cover mastectomy as treatment for breast cancer to also cover reconstructive surgery23 mental health parity private health insurers of ten provide less coverage for the treatment of mental illnesses than they do for the treatment of other illnesses for example health plans may limit treatment of mental illnesses by covering fewer hospital days and outpatient office visits nd increase cost sharing for mental health care by raising deductibles nd copayments twentytwo states have passed full parity laws that require health plans to impose the same treatment limitations and financial requirements on their mental hea lth coverage as they do on their medical and surgical coverage seve ral other states have enacted legislation that requires health plans to provide certain specified ntal health benefits but not full parity however these state laws have limited impact because they do not cover self insured plans erisa exempts selfinsur ed plans from state regulation nationwide about 52 of covered workers are in selfinsured plan according to the 2003 kffhret survey of employer health benefits in 1996 congress passed the mental h ealth parity act mhpa

beneficiaries be notified of available coverage for prostheses and treatment of physical complications of reconstructive procedures can an employer exclude coverage for specific types of illnesses such as cancer or acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids or treatment of injuries associated with highrisk activities federal law does not prohibit employers from excluding treatment of specific illnesses or conditions from their health benefit plans on the other hand number of factors limit certain employers ability to exclude specific illnesses from coverage most states have enacted legislation requiring that specific benefits or coverage be included in insured products some employers par ticularly small ones purchasing insurance products have little or di scretion in choosing or excluding specific types of services or procedures this is because many insurance companies and hmos have set menu of products that do not vary considerably from one employer group tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31634crs19 27 other possible types of state laws providin g for greater consumer protections are also specified in the act another for selffunded plans however erisa prevents state laws from applying and benefits are crafted by each individual employer plan thus only the few federal requirements enacted in hipaa and its am endments described above place specific coverage requirements on these selffunded plans general questions about the health insurance reforms do the requirements of the act apply to the plans of employers that provide for dentalonly covera ge or visiononly coverage such specific benefit plans do not have to comply with the requirements of the act if they meet certain conditions spelled out in the act to be exempt for example the dentalonly policy would have to be provided under sepa rate policy certificate or contract of insurance or not otherwis be an integral part of the plan do the requirements of the ac t apply to associationsponsored group health plans yes association plans must comply with the various requirements of the act rela ting to group health coverage for example the sponsor of an association plan cannot drop gr oup from coverage because of the use of medical services by the groups members moreover the association plan must comply with the restrictions on the use of preexisting medical condition limitation periods provide for creditable coverage and renew coverage except in limited cases however nothing under the act requires that an association plan accept for coverage individuals who are not members of the association can states impose requirements on insurers selling to group health plans that are different from those in the act yes states may impose their own requirements but hipaa ensures that state laws do not prevent the application of its consumer protections for example state laws regulating rating continue to apply because the act generally does not ddress rating practices on the other hand the acts provisions relating to portability such as restrictions on the use of preexisting medical condition limitation periods override state laws exceptions include specific types of st ate laws that provide for greater portability such as state laws that define preexisting medical condition to be one that existed for less than 6 months prior to becoming covered inst ead of the 6 months required under the act provide for preexisting medical condi tion limitation periods shorter than 12 and 18 months in the act and allow for breaks in continuous covera ge longer than the 62day period specified under the act27 thus for example state may prohibit issuers selling to group health plans from imposing more than 6month preexisting medical condition limitation period onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31634crs20 enrollees instead of the 12month limit in the act however state laws that allowed such limitation periods in excess of 12 months would be overridden by the requirement of the act do the insurance reforms apply to federal employees health benefits plans fehbp while there are specific references in hipaa or the subsequent benefits ma ndates that apply the requirements specifically to fehbp the plans provided by the fehbp progra m are presumed to fall under the hipaa definition of group health plan as result the federal office of personnel management which administers the fehbp program complies with the hipaa requirements does the act regulate the premiu m amount that an issuer can charge an eligible individual the act does not place any restrictions on the premium amount that issuers can charge however some states limit insurance premiums in the individual market and more may decide to do so in the future such limits would then apply because the act doe s not preempt or override either current or future state laws regulating the cost of insurance implementation nd enforcement the secretaries of hhs labor and treasury are required

with hipaa persons cobra continuation coverage is considered creditable coverage in the case of an individual who moves from one group policy to another group policy or from group policy to an individual policy this allows an individual to move from cobra to new health plan without having to wait for coverage of any preexisting medical condition under the new plan providi ng the individual does not have lapse in coverage of 63 or more days with respect to hipaas individual market protections the situation is somewhat more complex one of the requirements for eligibility for guaranteed availability and portability in the individual market is that an individual must first have elected and exhausted any availabl cobra or other c ontinuation coverage eligible individuals who do not have access to cobra or other continuation coverage may move directly to the individual market additionally in the individual market it is important to note that the insurer accepting the eligible individual for coverage can charge whatever rate is allowed under state law the act does not limit the premiums that insurers can charge does hipaa make any changes in cobra continuation of coverage requirements yes the act makes several changes to the laws providing for cobra continuation of c overage it provides clarification that disabled qualif ied beneficiary and all other qualified family members of the beneficiary are also eligible for the additional 11 months of cobra that the qualifying event of disability applies in the case of qualified beneficiary who is determined under the social security act to be disabled during the first 60 days of cobra coverage that qualified beneficiary for cobra coverage includes child who is born to or placed for adoption with the covered employee during the period of cobra coverage and that cobra can be terminated if qualified beneficiary becomes covered under group health plan which does not contain any exclusion or limitation

secretary of hhs to develop security standards and safeguards which health plans and providers must incorporate into their opera tions to protect health information from unauthorized access use and disclosure health care providers and most health plans must be in compliance with the security standards by april 21 2005 in addition hipaa directed th secretary to develop st andards for unique health identifiers ie id numbers for patients employers health plans and providers cms has issued standards for both the em ployer and provider identifiers but the health plan identifier rema ins

the language prohibits the use of funds for veloping unique patie nt identifier standard unless legislation is enacted specifi cally approving such standard the growing use of information technol ogy in the management administration and delivery of health care has led to increasing public concern over the privacy of medical information patients are worri ed about who has access to their medical records without their express authorizati on they fear that their personal health information will be used against them to deny insurance employment and housing or to expose them to unwanted judgment and scrutiny lawmakers addressed these concerns by including in hipaas administrative simplification provisions timetable for developing standards to protect the privacy of health information hipaa
