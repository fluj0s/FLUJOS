oversee implementation and funding of the endangered species act pl 93205 16 usc 15311543 and to consider proposals to amend the act major issues in recent years have included the role of science in decisionmaking consultation requirements for federal agencies critical habitat ch designation and procedures protection by and incentives for property owners and appropriate protection of listed species among others in addition many have advocated enacting as law some regulations promulgated during the clinton administration has been one of the more contentious environmental laws this may stem from its strict substantive provisions which can affect the use of both federal and nonfederal lands and resources under species of plants and animals both vertebrate and invertebrate can be listed as endangered or threatened according to assessments of their risk of extinction once species is listed powerful legal tools are available to aid its recovery and protect its habitat may also be controversial because dwindling species are usually harbingers of broader ecosystem decline is considered primary driver of largescale ecosystem restoration issues the most common cause of species listing is habitat loss the authorization for spending under expired on october 1 1992 the prohibitions and requirements of remain in force even in the absence of an authorization and funds have been appropriated to implement the administrative provisions of in each subsequent fiscal year in the 109 th congress several proposals would have reauthorized and extensively amended but none were enacted legislative proposals were introduced in the 110th congress to reauthorize the in the 110th congress the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 included provision amending the internal revenue code to permit the deduction of expenditures for endangered species recovery on species of international concern the 110th congress enacted pl 110132 reauthorizing the african elephant conservation act and the rhinoceros and tiger conservation act of 1994 through fy2012 and pl 110133 reauthorizing the asian elephant conservation act through fy2012 number of bills introduced in both the house and senate to address global climate change included provisions that would have allocated funds to the fws endangered species program and to related funds to assist species adaptation to

of animal and plant species face possible extinction endangered and threatened speciesand the law that protects them the 1973 endangered species act 16 usc 1531 et seqare controversial in part because dwindling species are often harbingers of resource scarcity the most common cause of species decline is habitat loss or alteration habitat loss occurs due to development changes in land management practices competition from invasive species and other factors nearly all related to economic political or social interests 1 has been among the most contentious environmental laws because of its strict substantive provisions which can affect the use of both federal and nonfederal lands and resources congress faces the issue of how to balance these interests which may fall on various sides of any given species controversy with the protection of endangered and threatened species and as stated in the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend because of strong support and strong opposition has not been reauthorized since the last authorization expired in 1992 in the 109 th congress there were several unsuccessful attempts to enact comprehensive legislation that would have reauthorized the esa2 consequently congressional efforts in the 110th congress focused on addressing specific controversial features of and on oversight of concerns such as the science used for making decisions and designation of critical habitat g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561g138g151g141g561g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561 g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 the 1973 pl 93205 as amended 16 usc 15311543 was comprehensive attempt to protect species at risk of extinction and to consider habitat protection as an integral part of that effort stated purpose of is to protect the ecosystems of which listed species are part under species of plants and animals both vertebrate and invertebrate may be listed as either endangered or threatened according to assessments of the risk of their extinction more flexible management can be provided for species listed as threatened distinct population segments of vertebrate species may also be listed as threatened or endangered consequently some populations of chinook coho chum and sockeye salmon in washington oregon idaho and california have been listed under even as other healthy populations of these same species in alaska are not listed and may be commercially harvested more limited protection is available for plant species under once species is listed powerful legal tools including penalties and citizen suits are available to aid species recovery and protect habitat use of these tools or the failure to use them has led to conflict 3 1 for example see crs report rl34326

which fws has management authority nmfs conducts research on the species for which it is responsible as of october 20 2008 total of 1183 species of animals and 749 species of plants were listed as either endangered or threatened under the of which the majority 612 species of animals and 746 species of plants occur in the united states and its territories the remainder occur only in other countries 5 of the 1358 us species 1168 860 are covered in recovery plans6 of the us species 526 387 have designated critical habitat ch in some portion of their range7 however species dont exist in isolation but evolve and fluctuate in abundance because of their relationships with other species conservationists increasingly are talking about ecosystems as the units of interest rather than species at times efforts to protect and recover listed species are controversial declining species often function like the proverbial canary in the coal mine by flagging larger issues of resource scarcity and altered ecosystems past resource debates in which esalisted species were part of larger issues include tennessees tellico dam water storage and construction jobs versus farmland protection and tribal graves as well as snail darters pacific northwest timber harvest protection of logging jobs and communities versus commercial and sport fishing recreation and ecosystem protection including salmon and spotted owls and the management of the apalachicola basin in alabam florida and georgia allocation of water among metropolitan agricultural and industrial users along with commercial and recreational interests as well as one fish and three mussel species

of the appropriate secretary or by petition from an individual group or state agency the secretary must decide whether to list the species based only on the best available scientific and commercial information after an extensive series of procedural steps to ensure public participation and the collection of scientific information8 in 4 for background on programs of the two administering agencies

not take into account the economic effects that listing may have economic and other considerations are taken into account in structuring alternatives for assisting the species after listing9 in addition fws and nmfs may identify selected species by adding them to list of candidate species that are believed to be at sufficient risk to warrant protection but whose protection is precluded by work to protect listed species as of october 20 2008 there were 283 species on the list of candidate species 10 g5g155g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g10g138g139g146g157g138g157g561 with certain exceptions if species is listed the secretary must designate critical habitat ch in areas where the species is currently found or which might provide additional habitat for the species recovery 11 however if the publication of this information is not prudent eg might encourage vandals or collectors the secretary may decide not to designate ch the secretary may postpone designation for up to one year after listing if the information is not determinable 16 usc 1533 as of october 20 2008 fw s had designated ch for 387 of listed domestic species as practical matter ch has not been designated for most listed species largely because fws prefers to allocate its limited resources to listing new species based on its regulation 50 cfr 40202 that takes away much of the legal value of designating ch for the recovery of the species yet fws consistently loses legal challenges for failure to designate ch and several courts have found the regulation in question to be an erroneous interpretation of the law because it does not take into account the duty to avoid adverse modification of ch 12 others have asserted the value of ch for example scientists with the center for biological diversity published study in april 2005 concluding that ch designation enhances species recovery 13 on april 28 2006 the keystone centers working group on habitat released report on habitat protection and esa14 one of the conclusions of participants in this study was that identifying the habitat that species require to recover is better done in the context of recovery planning after more rigorous analysis and deliberation have been completed rather than at the time of listing although recovery plans are not enforceable preventing adverse modification of ch is enforceable ch is frequently misunderstood by the public as posing significant direct restriction on private landowners authority to manage land while landowner may experience some additional procedures and possible restrictions on land ma nagement because of the presence of an listed species through prohibitions on taking listed species and the presence of ch may shed light on whether harm has occurred the dut to avoid adverse modification of ch is an 9 for an analysis of when and how allows consideration of economic factors see crs report rl30792 the endangered species act consideration of economic factors by pamela

individuals wishing to avoid violations contact fws or nmfs to initiate consultation that may conclude with permit issuance proposed actions that may have adverse impacts on listed species may be permitted in two ways first under section 7 of if federal agency actions or actions of nonfederal party that require an agencys approval permit or funding may affect listed species the federal agency must ensure that those actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species nor to destroy or adversely modify ch this does not apply in those instances where law requires federal agency to take only certain specific actions in order to satisfy the law according to 2007 decision by the us supreme court 16 to review the possible effects of their actions on listed species and ch federal agencies must consult with the appropriate secretary if the secretary finds that an action would jeopardize listed species or destroy or adversely modify ch the secretary mu st suggest reasonable and prudent alternatives that would avoid these harms pending completion of the consultation process agencies may not make irretrievable commitments of resources that would foreclose any alternatives the secretary issues written statement called biological opinion that may allow the agency or the applicant to take individuals of species incidental to otherwise lawful activities without triggering penalties subject to terms and conditions specified in the opinion 16 usc 1536 or may conclude that jeopardy cannot be avoided in which case the agency may seek an exemption for the action from the endangered species committee for actions without federal nexus ie federal funding permit or license the appropriate secretary may issue permits under section 10 of to

use of crediting framework in carrying out recovery measures allowing federal agencies to offset adverse effects on listed species by beneficial actions taken elsewhere 22 under this guidance federal agencies would create conservation banks by paying private landowners to conserve species allowing federal agencies to offset activities eg military training exercises oil and gas exploration and

this question depends on what is measured since major goal of is the recovery of species to the point at which protection is longer necessary this seems good starting point in the 25 years since the was enacted in 1973 48 us and foreign species or distinct population segments thereof have been delisted27 the reasons cited by fws are recovery 22 species b extinction 9 species however some may have been extinct when listed and c original data in error 17 species recovered species include alligators yellowstone grizzly bear bald eagle brown pelica n peregrine falcons two subspecies and three species of kangaroos extinct species include the dusky seaside sparrow guam broadbill bird and two small fish living in desert springs however it can be quite difficult to prove whether extraordinarily rare species are simply that or in fact are already extinct for example the ivory billed woodpecker thought by many to be extinct was believed to have been rediscovered in remote area of arkansas few years ago it might just as easily have quietly gone extinct without being rediscovered rare species are by definition hard to find 27 for updated information see httpeco

delisted as recovered28 others note that full recoveries are relatively few because the two principal causes of extinction habitat loss and invasive nonnative speciescontinue to increase in addition some scientific studies have demonstrated that most species are li sted only after they become very depleted eg median population of 407 animals for endangered vertebrates according to one study thereby making recovery difficult another measure of success might be the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations even if the species are not actually delisted if this standard is used could be considered success since large number 41 according to one study of listed species have improved or stabilized their population levels after listing other species eg red wolves and california condors might not exist at all without protection and this too might be considered measure of success although these species are still rare 29 on may 17 2005 the house committee on resources released an oversight report entitled implementation of the endangered species act of 1973 30 it reviewed and critiqued various ways that recovery might be measured one approach is to look at what proportion of the recovery objectives identified in species recovery plans have been achieved table 1 indicates how recovery has progressed related to the length of time since species

and commercial data available 34 in several recent situations legal economic and social disputes have resulted from actions under examples of these controversies include the florida panther klamath river basin suckers and coho salmon and sonoran desert bald eagles35 critics in some of these disputes suggest that the science supporting action has been insufficiently rigorous or mishandled by the agencies many rare and endangered species are little studied because they are hard to find or because it is difficult to locate enough of them to support scientific research there may be little information on many species facing extinction and only limited personnel or funds available to conduct studies on many of the less charismatic species or those of little known economic import what should be done in such instances some suggest that considerations other than species conservation should prevail others seek to change the current posture of the law by changing the role of science these considerations are complicated by the costs and time required to acquire more complete data particularly in connection with many lesserknown species does not elaborate on this question but some assert that given the protective purpose of esato save and recover speciesand the wording of best data available arguably dwindling species are to be given the benefit of the doubt and margin of safety this is the position taken on pages 17 of the joint fwsnmfs endangered species consultation handbook which states that efforts should be made to develop information but if biological opinion must be rendered promptly it should be based on the available information giving the benefit of the doubt to the species with consultation possibly being reinitiated if additional information becomes available 36 this phrase is drawn from hrept 96697 p 12 1979 which states that the best information available language was intended to allow fws to issue biological opinions even when information was incomplete rather than being forced to issue negative opinions the report also states that if biological opinion is rendered on the basis of inadequate information the federal agency proposing an

interested persons to seek correction of information even before these latest guidelines fws had promulgated guidance on information quality and peer review proceduresissues that also have been addressed in recent legislation fws and nmfs developed an interagency cooperative policy on information standards under the endangered species act40 under this policy fws and nmfs are to receive and use information from wide variety of sources including from individuals submitted information may range from the informaloral traditional or anecdotalto peerreviewed scientific studies and hence the reliability of the information can vary widely agency biologists are to review and evaluate all information impartially for purposes of listing ch designation consultation recovery and permitting actions and to ensure th at any information used by the agencies to implement is reliable credible and represents the best scientific and commercial data available agency biologists are to document their evaluations of all information and to the extent consistent with the use of the best scientific and commercial data available use primary and original sources of information as the basis for recommendations in addition agency managers are to review the work of fws and nmfs biologists to verify and assure the quality of the science used to establish official positions decisions and actions additionally companion document the interage ncy cooperative policy for peer review in endangered species act activities 41 notes that in addition to the public comments received on proposed listing rules and draft recovery plans the services are also to formally solicit expert opinions and peer review to ensure the best biological and commercial information for listing decisions the agencies are to solicit the expert opinions of three specialists and summarize these in the record of final decision special independent peer review can also be used when it is likely to reduce or resolve an unacceptable level of scientific uncertainty 38 67 fed reg 8452 39 for example see httpwwwfwsgov standstandardsprocess_wwwhtml 40 59 fed reg 34271 july 1 1994 41 59 fed reg 34270 july 1 1994

held that an agency is not obliged to conduct studies to obtain missing data43 but cannot ignore available biological information44 especially if the ignored information is the most current45 nor may an agency treat one species differently from other similarly situated species46 nor decline to list dwindling species and wait until it is on the brink of extinction in relying on possible but uncertain future actions of an agency47 best scientific and commercial data available is not standard of absolute certainty reflecting congresss intent that fws take conservation measures before species is conclusively headed for extinction48 if fws does not base its listings on speculation or surmise or disregard superior data the imperfections of the studies upon which it relies do not undermine those studies as the best scientific data availablethe service must utilize the best scientific data available not the best scientific data possible 49 judicial review can also help ensure that agency decisions and their use of scientific data are not arbitrary or capricious and that regulations are rationally related to the problems causing the decline of species especially when other interests are adversely affected50 in arizona cattle growers association v united states fish and wildlife service 51 the court stated that the evidentiary bar fws must clear is very low but it must at least clear it in the context of issuing incidental take permits under section 10a this ruling means the agency must demonstrate that species is or could be in an area before regulating it and must establish the causal connection between the land use being regulated and harm to the species in question mere speculation as to the potential for harm is not sufficient an agency must consider the relevant facts and articulate rational connection between these facts and the choices made 52

bear53 once listed the argument would be made that sources of substant ial greenhouse gas emissions such as coalfired powerplants cause an unlawful take of these species under section 9 by the effect such emissions have via climate change on the species habitat this could force negotiation of an incidental take permit for the source with greenhouse gaslimiting terms and conditions note that take is defined in the to include harm to member of listed species and harm in turn is defined by regulation to include certain significant habitat modifications or degradations additionally federal agencies proposing to issue permits for the construction or modification of greenhouse gas sources would be re quired the argument runs to initiate section 7 consultation 54 any effort to address climate change through the will encounter several obstacles chief among them whether the causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and habitat harm is too attenuated to fall within the prohibitions and requirements the also provides federal agencies with various tools to minimize esac limate change conflicts such as section 4d special rules for threatened species in may 2008 fws listed the polar bear as threatened catapulting the above section 7 section 9 and 4drule mechanisms to the fore in connection with the listing fws made abundantly clear its opposition to use of the to address climate change first it issued 4d rule for the polar bear specifically excluding from the section 9 take prohibition any taking of polar bears that is incidental to but not the purpose of an ot herwise lawful activity the effect of the exemption would appear to be that coalfired power plant could not be deemed to take polar bears through its greenhouse gas ghg emissions second fws argued in the listing preamble that todays science has not established causal connection between specific sources of ghg emissions and specific impacts to polar bears or their habitat concluding that the section 7 consultation mechanism would not be triggered by federal actions leading to greater ghg emissions eg permitting of fossilfuelfired power plants in addition amendments to the consultation regulations proposed in august 2008 would make it even less likely that consultation would be triggered by ghg emissions in the 110 th congress provisions in s 317 s 1177 and s 1554 would have amended the clean

environmentalists and recreationists upstream farmers point to their contractual rights to water from the klamath project and to hardships for their families if water is cut off others assert that the downstream salmon fishery is more valuable and that farmers could be provided temporary economic assistance while salmon extinction would be permanent still others assert that there are ways to serve all interests or that the science underlying agency determinations is simply wrong specifically at issue is how to operate the bureaus project facilities to meet irrigation contract obligations

to factor the presence of the dams into evaluations of jeopardy 2 whether or not salmon produced in hatcheries should be included in listed esus of pacific salmon and 3 the role and extent of ch

baydelta where they were once abundant the species was listed as threatened under in 1993 and in recent years species abundance has declined to the lowest ever observed the delta smelt decline is potentially attributed to combination of several factors including entrainment in water export pumps competition and predation from exotic fish species toxic contaminants changes in habitat size and quality and changes in food supply 60 the contribution of each factor in causing the species decline is controversial some contend that entrainment in water pumps is the primary cause whereas others argue that all causes might be more or less equally responsible for the observed decline 61 the delta smelt decline has significant consequences for the operation of the central valley project cvp and the state water project swp which supply water to much of california if entrainment by water pumps is largely responsible for the decline of delta smelt changes in how these pumps are operated might be required to satisfy requirements these requirements could result in reduced pumping and less water for users to address the impact of pumping on delta smelt an section 7 consultation between fws and the bureau was conducted fws issued noje opardy biological opinion biop with regard to impacts on delta smelt by the operations of the cvp and swp in 2004 and reissued the biop in 2005 to address potential critical habitat issues of the delta smelt brought up by the bureau in may 2007 the fws biop was found not to comply with with regard to delta smelt 62 the bureau and fws reinitiated

pesticides64 under the regulations when epa takes action under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra pl 80104 7 usc 136 et seq epa would decide whet her proposed fifra action is likely to adversely affect listed species or critical habitat epa would make this determination without consultation with and written concurrence from the fws director if an alternative consultation agreement is executed fws would not review the determination for consistency with on august 24 2006 the district court for the western district of washington overturned the pesticide counterpart regulations ruling that these regulations did not conform to the plain language or intent of section 7 by excusing federal action agencies from engaging in consultation 65 the court let stand the optional formal consultation process in which nmfs or fws can adopt epa effects determinations as their own national fire plan nfp counterpart regulations were promulgated by the forest service bureau of land management bureau of indian affair s national park service fws and nmfs66 the alternative consultation process contained in these counterpart regulations eliminates the need to conduct informal consultation with fws or nmfs and eliminates the requirement to obtain written concurrence from fws or nmfs for those nfp actions that the action agency determines are not likely to adversely affect any listed species or designated ch the district court for the district of columbia held that the alternative consultation agreement was not an improper bypass of section 7 67 in contrast to the pesticide counterpart regulations the services must determine that the action agencies actions are consistent with section 7 report by the services of the nfp counterpart regulations found that all ten projects reviewed by nmfs were deficient in five or six criteria and 44 out of 50 projects reviewed by fws missed at least one of six criteria with 19 missing all six 68 64 69 fed reg 47732

prohibitions in section 9 private actions and section 7 federal nexus at times frustrate the economic desires of owners of land or other property this has long been rallying cry for s detractors who assert that restrictions under routinely take property in the constitutional sense of the term69 conflicts between and property ow ners come about despite the existence of mechanisms intended to soften its impact on property owners under the fifth amendment property cannot be taken by the united states without just compensation the supreme court has long tried with limited success to define which government actions affect private property so severely as to effect such taking in briefest outline government actions usually are deemed taking when they cause either permanent physical occupation of private property or through regulation total elimination of its economic use when the government regulation removes only part but not all of the propertys use or value threefactor balancing test is used to determine whether taking has occurred70 although these factors have been little explicated by the courts it is clear that for taking to occur the property impact must be severe moreover except for physical takings the property impact is assessed with regard to the property as whole not just the regulated portion roughly 20 court decisions have addressed takings challenges to restrictions on land or other property with all but two finding taking these cases have involved restrictions on timber cutting reductions in water delivery to preserve instream flows needed by listed species particularly active area now restrictions on shooting marauding animals resulting in loss of livestock and prohibitions on the transport or sale of endangered species in several of these cases the taking claim failed because it was filed in the wrong court or was not ripe where taking claims were reached by the court they were rejected principally because the economic impact was insufficient as to the property as whole or because of the longstanding principle that the government is not responsible for the actions of wild animals of the two decisions favoring the property owner one involving reduc ed water delivery to water district owing to the need to maintain instream flows for listed fish has been repudiated by the judge who wrote it 71 the other however instructs that when government requires water subject to appropriative water rights to be physically diverted to fish ladder here for the use of listed species the diversion must be analyzed under physical rather than regulatory taking theory72 under such theory as noted the holder of water rights is likely to win its taking claim the united states is now seeking reconsideration of this decision critics want amended to afford compensation for broader range of property impacts than the constitution providesperhaps by specifying fixed percentage of esarelated property value loss above which compensation must always be paid provisions to that effect have been 69 see crs report rl31796 the endangered species act and claims of property rights takings by robert meltz 70 the three factors announced by the supreme court in penn central transp co v new york city in 1978 and reaffirmed by the court many times since are 1 the economic impact of the government action on the property owner 2 the extent to which the government action interferes with the owners reasonable investmentbacked expectations and 3 the character of the government action these are vague guideposts only the court stresses that every case is to be decided ad hoc indeed many question whether it is even appropriate to call the three factors test 71 see casitas municipal water dist v united states 76 fed cl

ones opponents of an explicit compensation standard counter that should not be singled out for more property owner friendly standard than other statutes or the c onstitution more fundamentally they note that property rights have never been absolute and that regulation has long been noncompensable as long as the impact on the property owner is not severe
