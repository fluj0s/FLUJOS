interconnectionappendix 4 1 introduction this appendix describes the general routing principles including routing diversity to be employed by vodacom to telkom as well as the same principles from telkom to vodacom the allocation of ccs 7 destination point codes is also addressed in the section relating to numbering 2 routing principles 2 1 routing from telkom to vodacom the catchment areas within the pstn served by any poi shall be mutually agreed upon between the parties concerned calls from within the agreed pstn catchment area will be routed over the pstn to the appropriate poi in accordance with the pstn routing plan at not less than the service levels and grade of service agreed to in appendix 2 section 4 2 2 routing from vodacom to telkom according to mutual agreement vodacom will route calls to the poi as defined in the routing tables supplied by telkom these tables will define first choice and alternate routing for specified pstn dial codes in the event of loss of circuits forming route rerouting to poi which is within the same pstn metropolitan exchange area as the first choice poi will be allowed rerouting to poi in different metropolitan exchange area may only be done on mutual agreement in writing 2 3 abnormal conditions the rerouting of traffic under abnormal conditions will be according to the alternate routing indicated in the routing tables supplied by telkom as for 2 2 above it is agreed to inform the other party of such rerouting undertaken in the event of severance of routes when only portion of route has failed traffic should continue to be offered to the remaining portion of that route before overflowing to latter choice routes in the event of the available capacity on the designated alternative routes being insufficient to handle all the overflow traffic then eacheither operator must contact the other to seek agreement to route the remainder of the traffic through its own network to an alternative poi the predefined prescribed arrangements and3details of the information to be handed over in such an event will be encompassed in document to be drawn up by the appropriate subcommittee in the event that the predefined routing arrangements for abnormal conditions cannot be implemented due to exceptional circumstances within the pstn telkom will provide details of the alternative arrangements which are to be implemented in their place 2 4 route diversity and security arrangements for reliability signalling links must be provisioned over physically diverse transmission paths andor equipment where such exists any deviation from this rule must be negotiated and agreed to in writing between telkom and vodacom telkom undertakes that the following rules will apply with respect to service levels these will be assesse d over any accountin g period 1 at service level of 99 5 there will not be need for diversity in any form 2 at service level of 99 9 telkom shall provide transmission equipment diversity but not necessarily route diversity 3 for the 99 95 service level then telkom shall provide transmission equipment and route diversity the above rules would not incur extra costs to vodacom and any chance to them must be discussed between the parties all 2 mbits systems carrying ccs 7 signalling links between mscs andor the pols shall be clearly marked in the switching and transmission equipment rooms so as to prevent any unnecessary maintenance activities the minimum number of links per link set shall be two any number of links per link set however exceeding 2 shall be negotiated between vodacom and telkom all circuit conditioning equipment such as pads and echo cancellers must be removed from the signalling links4accordance with ccitt recommendations 164 and 163 the international access code will also be sent 3 6 ccs 7 spc numbering 3 6 1 general the numbering of the signalling points and the networks is interrelated by the signalling point code spc and the network indicator nl for the purpose of convenience and security it is proposed that each telecommunications network have an independent signalling point code spc numbering scheme and one single numbering scheme where the interconnecting signalling points are defined this will have the effect where each telecommunications network is responsible for the internal spc numbering of its telecommunications network without being subjected to demands by other telecommunications systems 3 6 2 identification of telecommunications networks 3 6 2 1 subservice field ssf or network indicator nl the subservice field or network indicator is part of the service information octet sio the network indicators are defined in ccitt as follows bits d and c network indicator 0 0 international network inato 0 1 spare inat1 1 0 national network nato 1 1 reserved for national use nat1 where bits and b are not presently used ie spare63 6 2 2 nat0 nat0 for the national network will be used for signalling between switching units internal to the telecommunications network itself ie plmn to plmn and pstn to pstn 3 6 2 3 nat1 nat1 which is reserved for national use will be used for signalling between signalling units of different operators ie plmn to pstn 3 6 2 4 effect on switching units the nat0 indicator differentiates between local pstn exchanges and the intra plmn mscs whereas all interconnecting switching units will have two opcdpcs ie one for their network nat0 and one for the interconnection to other networks nat1 3 6 3 identification of signalling points of interconnection nat1 3 6 3 1 signalling point the identification of signalling point within telecommunications network or between telecommunications networks is done by 14 bit field will be used either to determine the destination or origin of the message when it is used to determine the destination it is referred to as the destination point cod dpc and the origin as the originating point code opc it is preferable that the format adopted by vodacom and telkom be standard 3 6 3 2 structured or random format of bits in the signalling point codes random format is where there is meaning built into the

suitable time and the expected duration of such an outage the telkom isd will report faults proven into the transmission links to the responsible transmission maintenance section of telkom according to internal fault reporting procedures recurring faults in the case of recurring or intermittent faults the parties will undertake all reasonable measures to find and clear the fault by means of special investigations and permanent monitoring of the relevant circuits 3 2 access to plmn sites housing transmission line terminating equipment when faults on the transmission links to plmn sites are reported vodacom must provide access or assistance to telkom maintenance personnel at these sites during testing and repair of the fault telkom cannot be held responsible for outages due to lack of reasonable access or assistance at plmn sites 3 3 escalation procedures in all cases of outages on transmission links provided to vodacom the escalation procedure as agreed upon in the network contract and escalation procedure document is applicable 3 4 after hours repair service the same fault reporting procedure as described above will also be followed after hours an additional fee as published from time to time by telkom will be charged for after hours repairs there will be additional charge for faults reported after hours but repaired during normal hours7the after hours repair service will be rendered during the following hours mondays to fridays from 17 00 until 7 30 the next day weekends from fridays 17 00 until 7 30 on mondays public holidays from 17 00 on the preceding working day until 7 30 on the next working day 3 5 operational standards for fixed transmission links the parties shall endeavour to adhere to the standards for the operation of the transmission links provided to vodacom as specified by ccitt recommendation g 821 or subsequent recommendations that may become relevant provided they are mutually agreed upon in writing between the parties i m 2100 series of ccitt recommendations adherence to these standards is intended to ensure that the quality of messages passing between the pstn and the plmn and between the plmn sites is such as to afford satisfaction to the senders and recipients of those messages 3 6 service levels on cofls 3 6 1 availability when applying for cofls vodacom will specify one of three levels of availability i 99 5 99 9 or 99 95 that will be assessed over particular accounting period the availability figure will exclude failures that occur after hours if vodacom does not make use of the after hours repair service referred to in clause 3 4 or when failures cannot be repaired due to lack of access or assistance at plmn sites circuit is deemed to be unavailable when there is either data throughput for period greater than 10 seconds or when the error ratio exceed 10 for more than 10 consecutive seconds the availability figure should not be used to assess the short term quality of the cofls until such time that the availability can be measured continuously with dedicated surveillance equipment the availability for the routes will be calculated by using the time from when fault is reported to the telkom iso to when it is cleared only faults due to failures of telkom equipment or telkom working party involvement or 50 of8the outage time due to faults which are cleared as fault found will be taken into account when calculating route availability the service level or availability will be calculated per route for the purpose of determining installation and rental fee discounts on cofls and the determination of service levels on such cofls route is defined as group of 2 mbits systems used to connect 2 elements within the same telecommunications network or between 2 elements in different telecommunications networks notwithstanding the physical routing of the systems further in the case of 1 msc connected to multiple pois such pois will be considered to be 1 element 4 0 transmission fixed link testing and commissioning procedures 4 1 introduction this is preservice test program to ensure that the parties agree on the acceptable performance of the 2 mbits link before commissioning the aim of this programme is to determine the preservice test points types of tests to be performed and the duration of the tests 4 2 digital performance parameters the analysis outlined below has been based on ccitt recommendations g 321 m 550 m 555 and m 557 4 2 1 brief outline of the analysis used the error performance objectives used for international isdn connections as defined in g821 are the performance classifications of errored seconds severely errored seconds ses an degraded minutes dm these performance objectives are then apportioned according to the length of the link in order to obtain the acceptable performance limits for an international digital connection9the m 550 recommendation finds it more realistic to consider the error performance of system as independent of the length but dependent on equipment density and recommends that the g 821 performance objectives for international paths be apportioned as detailed in 4 2 3 below 4 2 2 g 821 error performance objectives for international isdn connections severely errored seconds ses 0 1 errored seconds 8 degraded minutes dm 10 4 2 3 national networks apportionment d 500 km 2 0 500 km d 1000 km 3 0 1000 km d 2500 km 4 0 2500 km d 5500 km 6 0 d 5500 km 8 0 4 3 calculation of error allocation the error performance of the path is now defined by the reference performance objectives rpo which is the maximum permissible degradation allocation to each parameter ses dm over period of one month for example for national primary rate digital path nprdp of 500 km rpo 3 0 x 8 0 rpo ses 3 0 x 0 1 rpo dm 3 0 x 10 0 to minimise maintenance intervention m 550 recommends that an ageing margin of 0 5 is introduced into the objectives which now gives the bring into service objectives biso biso 0 5 x rpo x time10where time duration of the test the bring into service objectives apply only to monitoring period of one month or more in many cases this is impractical in order to monitor the performance of the system over shorter period g 24 hours and still be sure that the long term objectives biso will be met two threshold levels s1 and s2 are introduced the values of s1 and s2 are chosen so that if the measured performance of the link over 24 hours period is below the s1 value then we can be 95 confident that the long term objectives for the link will be met if however the measured performance of the link over 24 hours period is above the s2 value then we can be 95 confident that the long term objectives will not be met s1 biso 2biso s2 biso 2 biso the bring into service limits bisl of the link are determined for shorter periods of time by bisl biso x time x s1 bisl ses biso se3 x time x s1 bisl dm biso dm x time x s1 4 4 jitter jitter parameters will be measured according to g 823 at bit rate of 2 mbits the tests involved are input jitter tolerance limits are given in table 2 of recommendation g 823 maximum output jitter in the absence of input jitter limits are given in table 1 of g 823 and the jitter transfer characteristics all tests are done on an end to end basis the jitter at all interfaces must be measured and should conform with the maximum permissible levels given in

will be based on the manual method of logging all reported faults at the telkom isd 5 2 the service level of cofls will be measured in terms of the availability of each individual cofl end will be assessed separately for each calend ar month 5 3 the service level will be measured per cofl irrespective of the number of links used to provide the cofl 5 4 the first period of assessment of newly installed cofl sh all commence on the first day of the calendar month in which the link is installed 55 the last period of assessment of cofl cancelled by vodacom shall end on the last day of the last full calendar month during which such link effectively ceases to be in service 5 6 when cofl has been upgraded to higher service level the availability of such cofl shall continue to be measured in accordance with its former service level until the last day of the calendar month during which such cofl was upgraded and be measured in accordance with its new service level as from the first day of the calendar month following such upgrade 5 7 when cofl has been downgraded to lower service level the availability of such cofl sh all be measured in accordance with its new service level as from the first day of the calendar month during which such cofl was downgraded 5 8 where number of cofls are affected by the same fault the unavailable time will be recorded against each individual cofl 5 9 service levels will be measured at both vodacoms and telkoms isd by logging unavailable time for each cofl on monthly basis per calendar month these figures will be reconciled weekly cofl is deemed to be unavailable when there is either data throughput for period greater than 10 seconds or when the error ratio exceeds 103 for more than 10 consecutive seconds85 10 unavailable time is defined as the time from when fault is reported to telkoms isd to the time when the service is restored either by repair of the cofl or patching to an alternate links and the vodacom isd has been notified that the service has been restored for example if cofl had two outages of 60 and 15 minutes respectively reported during given month the availability or service level for that month is calculated as availability 1 minus total outage time in minutes divided by total minutes in month multiplied by 100 1 75 30 x 24 x 50 x 100 99 83 for practical purposes all calculations will be based on 30 day

telkoms after hours repair service b the time lost in the case where repairs are started during normal hours stopped after hours and resumed the following business day with the consent of vodacom c the time lost when failures cannot be repaired due to lack of access to vodacom sites andor lack of assistance from vodacom d the time lost due to vodacoms isd not being available to receive fault clear report the time lost due to planned outages scheduled maintenance as provided for in clause 3 1 1 2 of appendix 3 as well as planned outages due to the relocation of cofls on the same premises where the planned outage time exceeds the agreed time frames the extra time will be regarded as outage time to be added to the unavailability time of cofl unless vodacoms isd agrees to the extension of the planned outage time where planned outage time is requested less than 14 days before the planned outage unscheduled maintenance the outage time will be added to the unavailability time of cofl unless the vodacoms isd agrees to this short notice planned outage99910 5 13 only faults due 10 failures of telkom equipment or telkom working party involvement or 50 of the outage time due to faults cleared as fault found will be taken into account when calculating individual cofl availability 5 14 clause 21 of the agreement force majeure will be applicable to the repair of faults and the measurement of service levels 6 penalties and incentives 6 1 telkom will pay vodacom monthly penalty per cofl as determined with reference to the table in clause 6 3 below when the cofls average availability over calendar month is below the agreed service level for that cofl the penalty is limited to maximum of 100 of the monthly rental for that cofl the basic principle being that penalties may not exceed the actual amount received by telkom in payment for each cofl 6 2 vodacom will pay telkom monthly incentive per cofl as determined with reference to the table in clause 6 3 below when the cofls average availability over calendar month is above the agreed service level for that cofl the total monthly incentive for all cofls leased by vodacom is limited to 100 of the total monthly penalties for all cofls leased by vodacom and accumulation of penaltiesincentives will take place from one month to the next 6 3 the following penaltiesincentives per cofl will be payable by the
