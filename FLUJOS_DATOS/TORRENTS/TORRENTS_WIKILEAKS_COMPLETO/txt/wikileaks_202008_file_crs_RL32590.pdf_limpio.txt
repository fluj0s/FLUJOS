texas along with the next 10 leading states received 56 of total farm subsidy payments these states were largely concentrated in the nations central farm belt where much of the subsidized corn soybeans wheat cotton and rice are produced also ranking high were california due to cotton and rice and geor gia due to peanuts the subsidy payments were made to the operators and landlords of 707596 farms onethird of all farms in the nation however in some states much higher proportion of the farms were subsidized eg north dakota 78 and iowa 70 on average the payments amounted to 17172 per subsidized farm the range was from low of 3401 per subsidized farm in west virginia to high of 90214 per subsidized farm in california fa rm operators received an average of 9251 each and landlords

the payments are not dependent on annual congressional appropriations payment obligations to farmer s meeting the rules of the various subsidy programs are covered by the ccc the ccc uses its borrowing authority to obtain needed funds from the us treasury later congress appropriates monies to reimburse the ccc so it can repay the treasury 2 the usda does administer other farm subsidy programs that are not financed through the ccc and are not examined in this report among these are crop insurance costing about 2 billion annually in premium subsidies and farm ownership and operating loans for limited resource farmers costing nearly 200 million annually in loan subsidies 3 the data obtained by ewg are developed in fsa county offices and pertain to the farm in the county and not the address of the recipient recipients are unduplicated but may receive multiple payments from multiple programs throughout the year generally data pertain to the calendar year of paym ent but there may be exceptions 4 the data reported by ewg for 2002 may include combination of calendar year and crop year data but are characterized by ewg as calendar year payments the ewg data shown in figure 1

are made as mandatory direct payments to producers from the us department of agricultures usdas commodity credit corporation ccc1 these include commodity pri ce and income support programs certain conservation programs and select disaster assistance programs ccc direct payments to farmers in 2002 ar examined in this report2 the primary data sources are the 2002 census of agriculture available at httpwwwnassusdagovcensus and the environmental working groups ewgs farm subsidy database available at httpe wgorgfarmhomephp the ewg database is compilation from ccc payment information supplied by usdas farm service agency fsa fsas national network of county offices administers the subsidy programs and writes the ccc checks to the subsidy recipients3 these two data sets facilitate stateby state examination of payments and the division of payments betw een farm operators and landlords there is unpredictability about the timing and size of market price movements as well as natural disasters consequently the size of fa rm subsidies varies from year to year figure 1 shows that from 1995 through 2002 annual farm subsidy payments ranged from low of 72 billion to high of 235 billion averaging 145 billion annually over the eightyear period4 commodity price and income support accountshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32590crs2 4 continued records do report payments at the state or recipient level

payments for grain and cotton producers are exceptions these paymen ts were based on historical production of each of the grain and cotton crops only recipi ents of these payments were able to change their mix of crops or even produce nothing 7 eligibility requirements for payments are sp ecified in the law fo r each program the payment triggers and size of commodity s upport payments are based upon specified price levels an indirect income test or physical dama ge levels for disaster assistance loss testfarm subsidy programs most commodity support program paymen ts are linked to market prices6 when market prices decline commodity support payments increase in order to support the income of producers whose revenue othe rwise would decline conservation payments are made to encourage farm ers to remedy envi ronmental problems disaster assistance is provided when cr op and livestock production is substantially damaged or destroyed by natural disasters such as drought flood and disease thereby reducing revenue andor increasing the expenses of producers7 table 1 presents programbyprogram list of payments in 2002 some of the payments and refunds shown in table 1 were authorized by the 1996 farm bill which originally covered the 1996 through 2002 crops the 2002 farm bill pl 107 171 the farm security and rural inves tment act of 2002 was enacted on may 13 2002 and was made immediatel applicable to 2002 crops so 2002 was year of transition from the previous production flex ibility contract payments to the new direct and countercyclical payments also

paymentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32590crs6 it often is more helpful to examine commodity support payments by commodity rather than program farmers individually tend to specialize in certain commodities and this relates to the climate and soil c onditions favored by the different commodities in the absence of irrigati on corn and soybeans grow especially well in iowa illinois and surrounding states irrigation has made texas and california leading cotton states but production rema ins large in mississippi georgia and arkansas rice also is southern cr op with arkansas the leading producer while irrigation has moved californi into second place wheat tolerates low rainfall and low humidity and so is produced primar ily in north dakota kansas montana oklahoma and

farm operators and landlords there were 1705514 separate recipients of farm subsidy payments in 2002 associated with 707596 farms in nearly ll cases the recipients were individual farm operators and nonoperato r landlords however in some cases the recipients were legal business entities such as partnerships corporations c ooperatives and trusts involving more than one individual in the terminology of the law each of the farm operators landlords or other legal entities is called person and is subject to limits on the size of payments from subsidy programs10 simplifying assumption is made for purposes of this analysis that each of the 707596 farms receiving subsidy payments has single operator it is further assumed the difference between the 707596 farm operators and the 1705514 total subsidy recipients equalin g 997918 are farm landlords11 for the most part these 997918 landlords are the owners of farmland that is rented to operators often the landlords are relatives of farm operators and neighborin g landowners who have left farming it is typical for farmland to be owned collectively by the children of former farm family none of whom remains in farming but who continue to retain ownership of their former family farm given the aforementioned assumption figure 6 and table 6 show the proportion of landlords to farm operators in each state on average there were 141 landlords receiving subsidy payments for every farm operator who received payments however there was range among states from 405 landlords per operator in arizona down to 044 in alaska differences between states in the ratio of farm operators to landlords reflect di ffering commodity specializations regional approaches to farm consolidation and re gional attitudes toward farmland ownership also annual perperson payment limits creat an incentive to add actively engaged landlords rather than expand the acreage owned by the farm operator the national average farm subsidy paym ent to each farm operator in 2002 was 9251 and the average subsidy to each nonoperator recipient was 5617 since there were 141 offfarm landlords for each fa rm the average subsidy per farm to off farm landlords was
