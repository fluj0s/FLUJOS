election as president ref islamabad 2742 b islamabad 2741 classified by anne w patterson for reasons 14 bd 1 c summary in separate meetings with asif zardari pm gilani and chief of army staff kayani ambassador pressed for quick action on immunity for former president musharraf zardari and gilani said flatly that they were committed to providing immunity but not until after the presidential election now scheduled for september 6 pushing immunity now they believed could jeopardize zardaris candidacy kayani expressed concern that if immunity becomes tied up with the ongoing debate over the judges future it may never happen zardari plans to continue to slow roll action on the judges restoration but remains confident that nawaz sharif will not walk out of the coalition nawazs deadlines for action on the judges continue to pass unfulfilled the next one is scheduled for august 27 the decision by the muttahida quami movement mqm august 20 to back zardari for president has strengthened zardaris hand against nawaz nawaz is left with the option of walking out of the coalition but having little prospect of forcing new general election in the short term zardari is walking tall these days hopefully not too tall to forget his promise to kayani and to us on an immunity deal end summary 2 c ambassador met with pakistan peoples party ppp leader asif zardari on august 23 with pm gilani on august 21 and with coas kayani on august 20 3 c zardari told ambassador august 23 that he was committed to indemnity for musharraf ambassador stressed that only the promise of indemnity had persuaded musharraf to step down as president we believed as we had often said that musharraf should have dignified retirement and not be hounded out of the country zardari cited british anecdote about the spanish empire and said tell the most powerful man in the world that there is way that i would go back on what i have said zardari noted that he already had firmly committed to the us the uk and chief of army staff coas kayani that indemnity for musharraf would be forthcoming ambassador urged him to do it quickly zardari said flatly that to do it before he was elected president would lose him votes but he would do both the legislation and presidential pardon as soon as he was elected zardari revealed that former president musharraf had approached chief justice dogar about issuing restraining order against the impeachment motion but dogar had refused zardari also alleged that musharraf had planned to replace coas kayani if dogar had blocked the impeachment 4 c zardari said he was trying to keep nawaz in the coalition and was candid that he planned to tie up the judges issue for long time he said the parliament would debate the restoration of the judges chief justice dogar would then submit some rulings on the restoration of the judges all this could take months in the meantime he was trying to persuade former chief justice iftikhar chaudhry to become governor of balochistan note in move clearly orchestrated by zardari the governor magsi of balochistan resigned on august 20 making it possible to offer the position to chaudhry 5 c zardari said he did not think nawaz would leave the coalition but he admitted the pakistan muslim leaguenawaz had become increasingly testy he said that he had already agreed with nawaz to curtail the powers of the president and then allow nawaz to be eligible for third term as prime minister both measures would require constitutional amendments zardari revealed that he also had leverage over shahbaz sharif who through paperwork snafus had been technically elected illegally for third term as chief minister this too would have to be resolved in parliament zardari said so i can give them something they want noted zardari thats what politics is all about kayani worried 6 c after an august 20 meeting with visiting sct coordinator dell dailey kayani asked ambassador to stay behind and discuss his concerns that zardari was delaying islamabad 00002802 002 of 003 musharrafs immunity bill kayani had heard the large meeting of coalition partners chaired august 19 by the newly returned bilawal bhutto had discussed mostly the judges then they decided to take 72hour break to consult party members 7 c as post earlier reported reftels kayani said he took zardaris commitments to now expresident musharraf as the most important argument in persuading him to resign zardari made very specific commitments to kayani now for zardari to delay it makes him kayani look bad within his own institution and i have to bring the army along with kayani also noted that the delay does nothing for zardaris reputation for trustworthiness if this issue gets conflated with the judges and with zardaris own desires to be president it will become too complicated to pass kayani said gilani on immunity bajaur subsidies 8 c ambassador met with pm gilani and interior minister rehman malik for thirty minutes august 21 after graduation ceremony for us trained members of his protective detail he had been briefed about pdas camps discussion with ambassador haqqani 9 c gilani said the ppp was going to provide immunity for expresident musharraf but timing was important they were afraid that putting forward immunity legislation would lose them votes for asif zardaris presidential campaign ambassador pressed on this issue saying that musharraf would never have agreed to resign without the promise of immunity he assured ambassador that he and the party did not want vengeance regarding immunity gilani said many will say that we have done deal with america but still i understand that we have to do it 10 c regarding the ongoing military operation on bajaur in the federally administered tribal areas gilani assured ambassador that it will continue to its conclusion ie until all the militants were driven out gilani said the next step would be to go after taliban leader baitullah mehsud gilani wanted president bush to know that over 500 militants had been killed in the operation and that the gop had reached out to nato during general kayanis recent visit to afghanistan for tripartite meeting he said pakistan would do everything possible to encourage cooperation between the us and pakistani militaries gilani noted that pakistan was using its f16 aircraft to fight the militants and thanked the us for providing funding for the f16 midlife upgrades however gilani pleaded for urgent us assistance in providing relief for displaced people around bajaur and noted that fighting was spreading to neighboring mohmand agency 11 c malik suggested we hold off alleged predator attacks until after the bajaur operation the pm brushed aside rehmans remarks and said i dont care if they do it as long as they get the right people well protest in the national assembly and then ignore it note the strike has been front page news but the media is reporting that the targets were nests of arab fighters 12 c gilani said it would be almost politically impossible to reduce fuel subsidies raise prices in the short term along the lines deputy secretary kimmitt had suggested to the finance minister the coalition had restoration of the deposed judges immunity for musharraf and the election of the new president on their plate they were already taking enormous heat for previous fuel price increases 13 c comment nawaz may increasingly be considering leaving the coalition in the center and consolidating his hold in the punjab because he cannot engineer new general election in the short term the addition of mqms support leaves nawaz with less leverage over zardari in the current coalition the fight over iftikhar chaudhry probably is based on nawazs expectation that chaudhry would rule in both nawazs and shahbazs favor in pending court cases islamabad 00002802 003 of 003 challenging their ability to run as candidates in the national and punjab assemblies respectively until he can sit in the national assembly nawaz cannot be prime minister patterson
