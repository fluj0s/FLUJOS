criminal law applies abroad to us citizens and foreign nationals the usa patriot act and legislation implementing treaties on terrorist bombings and on financing terrorism enlarge the extent of federal extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction the usa patriot acts contributions involve credit cards money laundering and the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states congress has enacted laws proscribing various co mmon law crimes such as murder robbery or sexual assaults when committed with in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states ie when committed aboard an american vessel or within federal enclave whether federal enclaves in other countries are included within the special territorial jurisdiction of the united states is question that divides the lower courts the act provides that the overseas establishments of federal governmental entities and residences of their staffs are within the special territorial jurisdiction of the united states for purposes of crimes committed by or against us nationals existing federal law prohibits fraud nd other forms of misconduct involving credit cards passwords and other access vices the act provides statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction when the device is that of an america bank or other us entity and the case involves some fo rm of transmission transportation or storage in the us it is not clear whether the amendment is intended to narrow or simply confirm the prior scope of extraterritorial coverage the acts money laundering amendments permit federal prosecution for the overseas laundering of the proceeds of vari ous federal crimes as well as for the domestic laundering of the proceeds of va rious foreign crimes including foreign political corruption the legislation implementing the in ternational conven tions on terrorist bombings and on financing terrorism replicat existing federal law in many respects it becomes fully effective when the conventi ons enter into force for the united states at that point it will authorize federal pr osecution of overseas bombings or financing terrorism in other countries based solely upon the fact

authority for federal prosecution of crimes occurring elsewhere extraterritorial jurisdiction the constitution provides the power to enact criminal laws with extraterritorial application it vests

gives congress legislative jurisdiction over places acquired for the erection of forts magazines arsenals dockyear s and other needful buildings usconst arti 8 cls 3 10 17 the constitution limits the manner in which the authority may be exercised the due process clause of the fifth amendment for instance bars the extraterritorial application of federa l criminal laws in the absence of connection between the crime the defendant and the united st ates prosecution requires personal jurisdiction over the defendant and subj ect matter jurisdiction over the crime1 nevertheless neither due process nor any other constitutional limitation have posed any serious obstacle to the enactment and enforcement of federal law for crimes committed abroad in fact the extraterritorial application of federal

power of statutory c onstruction rather than constitutional limitation2 when statute contains statement of its extraterritorial application congresss intent is clear when the statute is silent the courts begin with presumption against extraterritorial application3 the nature of the statute however may be sufficient to overcome the presumption so long as th application beyond the borders of the united states does not offend the pr inciples of international law4 the courts will find offense to international law as long as the application features reasonable contacts between the crime and the nation sserting jurisdiction that standard is often judged by whether the case comes within one of five circumstances or principles under which intern ational law recognizes na tions prerogative to assert the application of its laws the objective territorial principle wh ere external conduct has substantial effect within the country the protective principal where the out side conduct is directed against the countrys national security the nationality principle where the offe nder is one on the countrys nationals the passive personality principle wher the victim is one of the countrys nationals and the universality principle where the co nduct such as piracy is universally condemned and may be prosecuted by any country that can capture the offender5 the inventory of federal crimes with extr

1878enactment of section 804 they do at least when either the victim or the offender is us national7 the essence of the dispute between th fourth and ninth circuits on one hand and the second circuit on the other lies in the construction of 18 usc 73 which defines the special territorial jurisdiction of the united states the fourth and ninth circuits contend that the definition in subsection 73 includes areas in other countries over which the host nation has fforded the united states privileges akin to sovereignty the second circuit argues that the subsection is intended to encompass only those areas over which congress may exercise legislative jurisdiction of the kind ordinarily vested in the several states the second circuits argument is grounded in the evolution of subsection 73 its language flows from the constitution itself which authorizes congress to exercise legislative jurisdiction over the district of columbia and like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erection of forts magazines arsenals dockyards and other needful buildings8 the first congress used this authority to outlaw murder and various other common law crimes when committed in such places re ferring to them as places within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the united states9 congress used much the same approach when it gathered the statutes at large into the first code the revised statutes again referring directly or by crossrefere nce to the forts arsenals dockyards and other places under the exclus ive jurisdiction of the united states10 in the revision of the federal criminal c ode in 1909 congress tablished separate chapter for offenses committed within this special territorial jurisdiction of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31557crs5 11 sec 272 the crimes and offenses defined in this chapter shall be punished as herein prescribed third when committed within or on any lands reserved or acquired for the exclusive use of the united states and under th exclusive jurisdiction thereof or any place purchased or otherwise acquired by the united st ates by consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erec tion of fort magazine arsenal dockyard or other needful building sec 273 murder is the unlawful killing of human being with malice aforethought sec 275 every person guilty of murder in the first degree shall suffer death 35 stat 1142143 1909 12 the term special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states as used in this title includes 3 any lands reserved or acquired for the use of the united states and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisd iction thereof or any place purchased or otherwise acquired by the united states by cons ent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erection of fort magazine arsenal dockyard or other needful buildingunited states introduced the chapter with jurisdictional statement and then went on to list the crimes proscribed in such places11 in 1937 the united states supreme court held that in the process of ceding legislative jurisdiction to the united states as part of its consent to the federal governments acquisition of piece of property state might cede less than exclusive jurisdiction state might re serve some jurisdiction to itself thus conveying more than concurrent jurisdiction to the united states james v dravo construction 302 us 134 148 1937 cong ress responded by qualifying the exclusivity language in the 1909 jurisd ictional statement in subsection 7312 so it appears to this day after the supreme court found that ci vilian dependents of military personnel could not be tried by courts martial for crimes committed on military installations overseas reid v covert 354 us1 1957 kinsella v united states ex rel singleton 361 us 234 1960 there were occas ional calls to bring overseas us installations within the definition of territorial jurisdiction in section 7 eg hr 11244 90th cong ultimately the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act of 2000 18 usc 32613267 authorized th federal prosecution of military dependents and contractors fo r overseas misconduct that woul d be triable as felony if it been committed within the territori jurisdiction of the united states in the interim however the fourth circuit held that at least some areas located in other countries might be considered within the special territorial jurisdiction of the united states as descri bed in subsection 73 united states v erdos 474 f2d 157 4th cir 1973 erdos upheld the conviction of an am erican diplomat for the crime of manslaughter committed in the american embassy in equatorial guinea erdos saw two grounds for territorial juri sdiction within subsection 73 1 any lands reserved or acquired fo r the use of the united states and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof or 2 any place purchased or otherwise acquired by the united states by consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erection of fort magazine arsenal dockyard or other needful

did not in tend the fsia to apply to the case before us whereas congress did intend the special maritim and territorial jurisdiction of the united states to cover the case before the erdos court mckeel v islamic republic 722 f2d 582 58889 9th cir 1983in erdos united states diplomat killed fellow citizen within united states embassy jurisdiction for the prosecution of erdos upon his return to

on other grounds sub nom ited states ex rel toth v quarles 350 us 11 1955no authority is cited to us to indicate that k9 air base or any other land in south korea used as an air base by the united states armed forces was or is legally speaking reserved for the use of the united states or under its exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction and our research has faile d to reveal any authority to that effect it does not appear therefore that the offenses with which toth is charged could be tried as offenses against the united states within the jurisdiction of district court 14 it found that various other federal statutes did have extraterritorial application and that the terrorists might be charged under statutes that prohibited bombing federal property 18 usc 844f carrying an explosive in relation to federal violent crime 18 usc 924c murder during the course of an armed attack on federal facility 18 usc 930c murder of federal employees during the performance of their duties 18 usc 1114 and the destruction of national defe nse material 18 usc 2155 92 fsupp2d at 198204it concluded that by virtue of the practical usage and dominion exercised over the embassy or other federal establishment by the united states government 18 usc 73 is proper grant of special territorial jurisdiction embracing an embassy in foreign country acquired for the use of the united states and under its concurrent jurisdiction 474 f2d at 1596013 courts in the second circuit read subsection 73 differently united states v bin laden 92 fsupp2d 189 sdny 2000 involved the terrorist bombing of american embassies in kenya and tanzania unlike erdos it held that the american embassies abroad were not within the special territorial jurisdiction of the united states and that statutes outlawing murder and maiming within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states 18 usc 1111 114 had extraterritorial application 92 fsupp2d at 2041614 the court of appeals for the second circ uit came to much the same conclusion it reversed conviction under 18 usc 22 43 sexual abuse of minor within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states for statutory rape which occurred in housing complex on us military base in germany united states v gatlin 216 f3d 207 2d cir 2000 gatlin based its conclusion that subsection 73 has extraterritorial application on three factors first statute is presumed to have nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31557crs7 extraterritorial applicati on absent clear indication to the contrary second gatlin read the subsections legislative history as an indication that congress intended the subsection to apply solely within the united states third it pointed out that after reid and kinsella congress the executive branch and commentators had all described as beyond federa l jurisdiction those crimes committed by dependents and contractors on overseas military bases all assuming that subsection 73 had extraterritorial application 216 f3d at 21422 the ninth circuit could not agree united states v corey 232 f3d 1166 9th 2000 corey involved the conviction of civilia n postal employee for sexual abuse committed in military housing in japan and in residence rented by the us embassy in the philippines corey found the presumption against extraterritoriality unpersuasive and not particul arly relevant in its nd jurisdiction was territorial not extraterritorial matter where the property was located as long as it was acquired for needful purposes and as long as us legislative jurisdiction over the property was exclusive or concurrent 232 f3d at 1170171 it found support in the history of subsection 73 which had been applied over time to territory beyond the confines of any admitted state or beyond the continental boundaries of the united states 232 f3d at 1173176 congress resolved the dispute or at least greatly mitigated its consequences when it enacted section 804 of the usa patriot act and the m ilitary extraterritorial jurisdiction act of 2000 the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act treats felonies committed anywhere overseas by members of the armed forces or those accompanying or employed by them as if they were committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states 18 usc 3261 section 804 of the usa patriot act cr eates new territorial subsection in 18 usc7 the special territorial jurisdiction of the united states includes the overseas business premises of federal governmental entities and the residences of the members of their staffs but only for crimes committed by or against americans other than those who come within the military extension of 18 usc 3261 the split in the circuits remains of consequence for crimes committed in federal overseas facilities by foreign nationals who are not associated with the us armed forces in the fourth and ninth circuits such crimes may come within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states in the second circuit they do not credit card fraud overseas fraud

title 18 proscribes counte rfeiting or traffickin g in counterfeit or unauthorized access devices or attempting or conspiring to do so if the offense affects interstate or foreign commerce thus prior to the addition of subsection h the section would have been thought to ve extraterritorial application when the offense affected the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states united states v ivanov 175 fsupp2d 367 37475 dconn 2001use of the phrase foreign commerce reflects congressi onal intent that 18 usc 1029 have extraterritorial application subsection h might be construed to limit the overseas application of section 1029 to circumstances involving an ameri can issuer of the depicted access device and some contact between the united states and the material used in the offense or the profits from it alternatively it might be construed as an explicit confirmation that the section applies under these circumst ances but without intending to foreclose other circumstances justif ying

on the inadequacies of the elements of the offense to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction rather than on the provisions of laundering to evade taxes20 and laundering part of law enforcement sting21 the extraterritorial aspects of section 1956 come in two forms first the statute prohibits transactions in th is country rela ted to certain crimes in other countries second the section specifically asserts extr aterritorial jurisdiction over transactions in other countries which involve more than 10000 and either the participation of an american or conduct occurring with in the united states 18 usc 1956f22 section 318 of the usa patriot act expressly eliminates any requirement that the triggering financial transacti ons occur in an american bank or other american financial institution by changing the applicable definition of financial institution to include foreign banks whether this is intended as an implicit repeal of the requirements subsection 1956f is unclear the amendment allows for extraterritorial application in inst ances where subsection 1956f would not subsection 1956f for example does not reach transactions of less than 10000 or foreign transactions by foreign national related to specified illegal activity committed in the united states the report of the house committee in which this proposal originated makes it clear that th provision was crafted to fill in gaps in existing law23 on the other hand the courts do not favor repeal by implication httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31557crs11 subsection 1956f hrept 107250 at 38 2001 the committees review of current law regarding money laundering revealed number of shortcomings for instance section 1956 of title 18 united states code makes it an offense to c onduct transaction involving financial institution if the transaction involves criminally derived property similarly 18 usc 1957 creates an offense relating to the deposit withdrawal transfer or exchange of criminally derived funds by to or through financial institution for the purposes of both statutes the term financial institution is defined in 31 usc 5312 see 18 usc 1956c6 18 usc1957f the definition of financial institution in 5312 does not explicitly include foreign banks such banks may well be covered because they fall within the meaning of commercial bank or other terms in the stat ute but as presently drafted there is some confusion over whether the government can rely on section 5312 to prosecute an offense under either 1956 or 1957 involving transaction through foreign bank even if the offense occurs in part in

nationals and has general extraterritorial jurisdiction provision 18 usc 2339bd there is extr aterritorial federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section subsecti on 2339ca is limited neither

subsection 2339cafinancing terrorism nd 2339b enjoys the benefit of their extraterritorial application wit hout any offender citizenship requirement on the other hand where their proscriptions overlap subsection 2339cc provides an additional penalty option since section 2 ca rries the same criminal pena lties as the underlying offense ie imprisonment for not more than 20 years plus fine while
