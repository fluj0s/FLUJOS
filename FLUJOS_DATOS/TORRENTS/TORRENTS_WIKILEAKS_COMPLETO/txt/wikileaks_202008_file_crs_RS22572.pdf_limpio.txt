democratization since gaining its independence in 1991 according to the us state department saparamurad niyazov ruled turkmenistan since 1989 first as head of the soviet unions turkmen communist party then as president of independe nt turkmenistan the countrys may 1992 constitution granted niyazov overwhelming powers to rule by decree as head of state and government in december 1999 constitutional amendments made niyazov president for life according to several assessments he was among the worlds most authoritarian rulers and his regime was high ly corrupt and responsible for serious human rights abuses the regime increasingly restricted contacts by citizens with the outside world sizeable natural gas exports provided major revenue but poverty repor tedly was still widespread1 according to the bush administration the united states has strategic and economic interests in turkmenistan and must rema in engaged with the country to gain its critical c ooperation in reducing thr eats to

turkmenistan also objected to criticism from the united states and others in the international community about human rights abuses and the failure to democratize niyazovs death and the political succession days after turkmenistans ruling democratic party voted to make its head president niyazov its eternal party leader he died on december 21 2006 at age 66 ostensibly from heart attack the morning of niyazovs death the state security council3 and cabinet ministers named deputy prime minister and health minister gurbanguly malikgulyyewic berdimuhammedow the acting pres ident it was also announced that the speaker of the mejlis legislature who c onstitutionally should have become the acting president had been arrested on vague ch arges in an address to the nation berdimuhammedow urged

having long refused ostensible requests from the niyazov to plan future presidential election the khm quickly approved an electoral law and announced that the next presidential election would be held on february 11 2007 among other pr ovisions the law states that only citizens born in turkmenistan between the age of 40 to 70 who have resided in country for the past 15 years and who are officials or member s of selected ngos are eligible to run the 15year residency requirement appeared designed to block expatriate politicians from eligibility and the minimum age was lowered from before to make

and proposed hudayberdi orazow as their candidate in the upcoming election although this candidacy was ignored by turkmen officials udot urged turkmen citizen s to writein orazow as their choice for president beginning his campaign berdimuhammedow asserted that the upcoming election would help mark the undevi ating democratization of society the broadening of openness and the enlistment of peoples efforts in the administration of the state at the same time he appeared to acknow ledge that at least some of the late niyazovs policies were not popular he announced that he woul d restore secondary education to ten years of study and higher education to five ears boost educational and medical exchange programs provide access to the internet to all turkmen and revise niyazovs cuts to pensions while promising not to raise ta xes berdimuhammedow pledged to continue several popular subsidy programs including the provision of fr ee natural gas electricity salt and water and lowpr iced bread housing and public transport perhaps an admission of widespread unemployment he st ated that job creation would be priority and pledged to support small and mediums ized business development he also mentioned commitment to free labor in country where c itizens allegedly are pressured to help in the harvest berdimuhammedow is widely expected to easily win election some observers suggest that the late niyazovs lingering cult of personality would have ensured an overwhelming and enthusiastic popular vote for berdimuhamme dow as the heir apparent in free and fair race even without any moves by berdimuhammedows supporters to restrict the field of candidates and otherwise control the electoral process implications for turkmenistan widespread poverty and unemployment recent wheat harvest shortfall and governmental weakness and corr uption raise concerns about stability in the weeks before niyazovs death there were anecdotal reports of bread shortages but apparently the interim leaders moved quickly to rectify this source of popular discontent berdimuhammedow appeared to acknowledge wi despread agricultural problems when he ordered working group to draw up longterm reform strategy and asserted that it is necessary to make the sector viable and prof itable both for farmers and the state in order to maximize harvests in security matters berdimuhammedow also appeared to admit that there were readiness problems when he pledged on january 5 that we will take every step to strengthen material and technical provision of our nati onal army and other lawenforcement bodies it is very importa nt not to have any kind of shortage instead they should be provided w ith sufficient food and ammunition5 the challenge of corruption was underscored by report issued in early 2006 by the ngo

portion of the wealth generated from natura l gas exports the ngo raised concerns that organized crime groups were involved in these exports and urged the international community to be wary of trading with turkmenistan6 some observers have argued that the turk men governments actions since niyazovs death may be harbingers of liberalization they point out that for the first time in turkmenistans history citizens will be offered alternative choices in presidential election even if only govern ment officials are running the political campaign has provided some possible signs of slightly more open climate for political opinion all the candidates while pledging to continue the late great leaders policies nonetheless speak of reforms they would implement if elected perhaps indicative of widespread popular grievances gurbanov pledged greater financial support for hajj travelers most turkmen belong to the sunni branch of islam pomanov promised greater aid for agriculture and support for youth and sports activities atajikov stated that he would once and for all give privat land ownership to farmers7 these observers also suggest that berdimuhammedows initial policy nnouncements may indicate progressive political orientation that may re sult in less isolationist nd authoritarian country such pronouncements include pledge at campaign stop on january 5 that if elected i will do my best to turn turkmenistan into democratic country where people enjoy freedom and every condition to work and to rest and where justice peace and friendship dominate8 other observers discount such percepti ons of liberalizati on berdimuhammedows pledge to continue niyazov s policies may not bode well for human rights reforms they argue they also point out that berdimuha mmedow officiated over such policies as the neardestruction of medical car despite his own credentials as dentist ominous human rights developments in recent days include the arrest and disappearance of environmentalist andrey zatoka on december 17 and oppositionist nurberdi nurmamedow on december 23 just after the tter reportedly had been suggested as presidential candidate by hi s supporters these observers also caution that since berdimuhammedow and other officials conti nue to ndorse the rukhnama spiritual guide allegedly written by niyazov religious rights may continue to suffer turkmen media shifted almost seamlessly from exhaus tive coverage of niyazov to reporting on berdimuhammedow perhaps raising the specter of new cult of personality these observers warn few analysts however think that berdimuhammedow or his replacement will be able to or want to recreate the late yazovs idiosyncratic regime9 some observers have criticized the ccession process as palace coup since berdimuhammedow

continuedpresidential election10 few observers suggest that berdimuhammedow may be only figurehead or is ruling in tandem with the head of niyazovs presidential guard akmurat rejepov they argue that constitutional changes and other actions have indicated that the state security council headed by rejepov is now the dominant force eclipsing the legislature and presidency11 implications for us policy the administration appears to have cautiously considered that berdimuhammedows turkmenistan might prove to be less isola tionist and authoritarian that human rights might improve and the country might s eek to boost trade ties with the outside world including by building energy export pipelines assistant secretary of state richard boucher headed the us delegation to the december 24 funeral to signal this us interest in new beginning to usturkmen relations and to offer us assistance in reforms if theyre ready he called for smooth and peaceful transition of power but stated that the united states would not lay down blueprint of reforms for turkmenistan to follow12 he admitted that he did not have great expectations that the prospective presidential election would be free and

united states would like to see turkmenistan be able to develop its resources its oil and gas reserves in market fashion that gets them market price for their energy thats where the idea of multiple pipelines multiple outlets and multiple options is really question of how to secure the sovereignty and independence of the nation14 some observers have warned that instability in turkmenistan could disrupt its sizeable gas exports to russia and since these supplies permit russia to export more of its own gas to europe such disrupti ons could have ripple effect in

natura l gas exports without delay and in full volume berdimuhammedow on january 5 2007 indicated an interest in enhancing turkmenistans sovereignty by diversifying its energy export routes including by building proposed transcaspian and rkmenpakistan pipelines some observers have criticized the administration for not pushing harder on the interim turkmen government to include opposition candidates in the election and for not moving to find and freeze any possible persona l assets of niyazov in the united states they also have urged the administration to insist on progress in democratization and respecting human rights as c onditions for closer relations16 underlining these concerns us analyst martha olcott has warned that berdimuhammedow may be insincere in promising reforms she argues that his aim may be to get western governments to pay less heed to exiled opposition politicians and to gain support for very nondemocratic constitution modified in very nondemocratic way and to validate an election in which the electoral process was flawed from the beginning17 these critics also warn that turkmenistans participation in the global war on terrorism might change niyazov had supported usled coalition operations in afghanistan against the taliban and qaeda more prorussian leadership may join russia in calling for ending us and allied acce ss to bases in central asia niyazov also had appeared successful in preventing is lamic extremists from infiltrating from neighboring iran and afghanistan or otherw ise gaining adherents however political instability in turkmenistan could increase th threat of islamic terrorism according to some observers18 congress has raised concerns about turkme nistans poor record of democratization and respect for human rights in hearin gs and other legislative action the 110th congress possibly might consider whether to boost or ch ange the focus of us assistance if the berdimuhammedow government pursues reforms alternatively sanctions or other forms of disapproval might be debated if the berdimuhamme dow governments human rights and democratization efforts remain inade quate other concerns may include the continuation of usturkmen antiterrori sm assistance the possible extension of humanitarian aid to address purported turkmen food shortage s and other urgent quality oflife needs and the possible impact of turkmenistans regime change on western energy security
