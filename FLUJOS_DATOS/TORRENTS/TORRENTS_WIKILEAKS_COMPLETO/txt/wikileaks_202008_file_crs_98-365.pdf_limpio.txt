technology introduction congress deals with many aspects of science and technology st on continuing basis in its legislative overs ight activities in the development of st policies in responding to the administr ations research and development rd plans and budgets and as component of broader policy issues in the 105th congress members and committees are looking at the future of us science and technology and st policy1 an important aspect of this examination is the role of the us government in st as the nation enters the 21th century the congressional research service was requested to provide report on this subject as an input to the bipartisan national science policy study headed by representative vernon j ehlers of the house committee on science there are several ways to examine the role of the us government in science and technology one is to expl ore that role in terms of the character of the research and development performed for example whether it is basic research applied research or development another way is by the federal missions supported such as defenserelated rd h ealth energy space or other civilian rd or the governments support of mathematical and science education and university research also the role of the government in st is being discussed increasingly in terms of actual or possible federal cooperation with other performers of rd including the private sector academia the states and international entities lastly the governments role in scien ce and technology is significan tly affected by the level of its rd budget and the effectiveness of its rd management and planning at the heart of the debate about us science and technology policy are the difficult issues of the federal role in maintaining the health of the nations science and technology and the proper balance among the performers of st for example what is the best level and mix of fede ral support of research in universities versus in federal laboratories or what is the governments role versus that of the private sector in the promotion of nati ons technological development in addressing these questions congress and the executive branch receive steady stream of reports from government agencies nongovernmental organizations academia and others on many aspects of st policy this report summarizes six recent studies that address the role of the us government in science and technology and analyzes their findings in terms of the factors mentioned above character ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs2 2crs recently analyzed us science and technology policy efforts

more of the subjects covered andor repr esent views of current policymakers the six reports may not represent all policy perspectives following the reportsummary section is an appendix of acronyms of

and technology in terms of the character of the research and development performed federal missions supported fede ral support of other perform ers of rd and federal rd budget management and planning activities it analyzes these factors in reference to the six reports summarized in the next section character of research and development one way the federal government collects information on research and development is according to whether it can be classified as basic research applied research or development3 the government historica lly has supported much of the nations basic research mainly expensive longterm andor risky research that could not or probably would not be supported by the indus trial sector or academia examples are research on nuclear weapons and in highenergy and nuclear physics conducted by the department of energy physical science and engineering research supported by the national sc ience foundation and biomed ical research conducted or supported by the national in stitutes of health applie d research projects in many scientific and engineerin g missionrelated areas are supported by federal mission agencies such as the departments of defense and energy nasa nih and nsf in terms of development two agencies account for about 88 of the development projects funded by the government dod 75 and nasa 134 the role of the federal government in relation to the character of rd is at issue in at least two ways first there is perennial divergence of opinion among sciencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs3 5vannevar bush science the endless

2933policymakers as to whether the governme nt should increase or decrease its funding support of basic research applied research andor development particulary civilian applied research and development visavis the private sector whether the government should increas or decrease support for rd is closely tied to the specific type of rd being considered for support rarely to the broad categories of basic research applied research or development in totality this seems to be particularly contentious today in disc ussions of federal technology policy as addressed in several of the reports summarized in th next section federal rd budget issues are discussed later in this section second the terms and models themselv for example basic research applied research and development and the socalled linear model of research may not adequately capture important aspects of the spectrum of scientific and engineering endeavors from basic or f undamental research through technological development innovation and commercialization number of different terms and approaches have been suggested in the r ecent scientific literatu re including in the reports summarized in this analysis the onedimensional or linear model of research proceeding from curiositydriven basic research throug h usedriven applied research and innovation the socalled bush model5 is suspect and considered by many to be inadequate today the importance of basic research driven by desire to solve practical problem and th complex relationship between basic research and technological deve lopment should be recognized6 some policy studies have recommended that the government abandon its use of the terms basic research and pplied research and instead concentrate not just on basic research but on long term highrisk needbased basic technology research7 likewise instead of characterizing rd as basic and applied research and development it may be more useful to organize rd by its time horizon and level of

by industry s all but disappeared9 this indicates the importance for policy analysis and policym aking of adequately defining the character of rd recent proposal to modify rd rminology used for federal budget purposes noted that most federally f unded research is at once both applied and basic it recommended that federal science and technology fst budget include basic and applied re search and fundamental technology development but exclude initial pr oduction maintenance and upgrading of largescale weapons and space sy stems at dod doe and nasa10 to understand the role of the fede ral government in st requires an examination of the terms and models used to characterize research and development recent reports suggest that there is growing acknowledgment among those involved in science policy analysis and po licymaking that clarification of terms used to characterize rd and innovation would not be just an exercise in semantics but could have important s ubstantive policy ramifications for example there may be an important midtier of research precompetitive research conducted by industry that is disappearing when ch research is characterized as part of another category of rd however it may not be apparent that there is problem likewise there are questions today about the validity of the linear model of research and innovation which may bear on the governments role in supporting some research and development federal rd missions the role of the government in research and development varies according to the federal mission involved since world war ii for example the government has played dominant role in defenserelated rd because it is carried out for national security purposes and because the government has been the sole or principal customer of the technologie s and products developed mu ch space rd also is federal mission where the government has been the sole or principal customer this situation may be changing in part as federal funding for defenserelated rd continues to decline significantly in real terms and as the military increasingly relies on purchasing or adapting dualuse technologie s generated in the industrial sector for commercial ends rather than for defense rd programs recent study recommended that in light of these two tr ends the nation move toward single national technology base rather than ving separate defe

prominent in the interactions between the clinton administration and the 104th and 105th congresses12 several of the reports summari zed below for example discuss the pros and cons of the advanced

federal government is less dominant partner with industry nd academia than it has been in the past an aspect of the changing role of the federal government in science and technology involves what if anything s hould be done with th federal laboratory complex the federal government has the nations largest laboratory complex and is the nations largest employer of techni cal personnel many of these laboratories scientists and engineers are considered to be world class questions have arisen over the last several years however as to the whether all of these laboratories are fulfilling important or produc tive federal missions whether some of them are redundant whether some of them should be clos ed or sold and how they relate to the rd capabilities of the private sector in the 104th and 105th

commission was composed of over 200 st ex perts and distingu ished scientists industrialists lawyers politic ians and former governmental officials includinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs12 former presidents ford and carter from 1988 through 1993 it published 19 reports including this 1993 summary produced about 12 other background and related studies and sponsored 6 books and studies that were published elsewhere from 1993 through 1996 commission staff performed followup work and task force chairman discussed many of the reports recommendations with government officials according to the commission many changes in fe deral st policy have been made as result of those reco mmendations in 1996 the commission met for the last time and approved final report on st and the next clinton administration the commission made over 300 recomme ndations on st policy in 15 areas of focus the president congress the federal judiciary the states us international affairs global development internationa l st decisionmaking by governments and intergovernmental organizations us national security the nations economic performance and technology base precollege science and mathematics education environmental research and development the role of st in regulatory decision making nongovernmental st organizations federal scientists and engineers and longterm national goals for science and technology in 14 of these areas the commission published one or more formal re ports formal report was published on recruiting and retaining federal scientists and engineers the role of the federal government in st was addr essed throughout the reports key aspects regarding the role of the us government in st the context of the carnegie commission reports is that the federal government has continuing essential role to play in us science and technology the summary report for example seems to assume th at the us government will or should continue to maintain its funding support of many areas of basic research for example high energy physics and other areas of fundament science that otherwise would not be supported app lied research and developmen t in furtherance of the governments missions for example defense health energy space and aeronautics and agriculture and science and engineering education and scientific research in the nations universities and colleges the report also recommends improveme nts in the governments technical scientific engineering and st policy leadership major theme of the summary report reflecting that of the individual re ports is that closer cooperation is necessary between the us government and industry the states nongovernmental organizations ngos and foreign nations in addition the report discusses the commissions proposal for federa l policies linking the envi ronment energy and the economy these aspects are di scussed in the next section findings andor conclusions the commissions report dealt with improvements in federal

oversight and planning it recommended that congre ss improve congressional access to expert advice and internal organization to better deal with st issues in the executive office of the president the st policy structure should be enhanced which the report stated already had occurred to some extent because some of the commissions recommendations had been imple mented examples included the elevation of the presidents science advisor to cabinet status and the reestablishment of the presidents science advisory committee psac in the bush administration and the formulation of the clinton administr ation technology policy which is very much in tune with the recommendations of the commission35 the report recommended assistance to the judiciary to improve its management and adjudication of the increasing number of cases involving complex science and technology issues the independent regulatory agencies are sometimes referred to as the fourth branch of government the report recommended that the executive office of the president in cooperation with congress and the judiciar take the lead in providing broad st policy guidance and in setting and implementing coherent regulatory priorities for these agencies to improve the governments technical capabilities at the highest level specifically those of the approximately 80 top presidential st appointments the commission recommended improvements in recruitment and reductions of barriers to ensure that the most highly qualified scientists and engineers are able to fill the positions the federal government is the rgest employer of technical personnel in the nation the report recommended that congress and agencies in the executive office of the president develop improve d personnel policies i ncluding salaries comparable to the private sector fo r the approximately 200000 scientists and engineers in the federal government w ho account for about 10 of all federal employees cooperation with industry36 with the dramatic decrease in us defense rd spending in the postcoldwar era and the militarys increasing reliance on technologies generated in the commercial sector th commission recommended that steps be taken to integrate the nations fense and civilian tec hnology bases into single dualuse commercia l and military technology base to shape and implement federal policy related to economic performance and th national technology base under these new cond itions technology policy in the executive office of the president should be enhanced the repor t recommended that the department of commerce play more

28 july 1997 1 67 recommended broadening the defense advanced research projects agency darpa from its exclusive emphasis on defense as step toward creating broader national technology base37 cooperation with states38 the report recommended th at with the end of the cold war the states should become fu ll partners with the federal government in meeting americas great contemporary challenges p 25 that would include states being represented on federal st advisory and decisionmaking organizations including those defining missions for federal laboratories the report also recommended that each state establish science advisor to its governor and an st advisory board for its legislature and aim toward establishing national organization to assist states in st matters already in existence in most states are technology programs the majority of which promote businessdr iven partnerships between industry and academia the chapter on education noted that although kindergarten through high school k12 education always has been mainly state and local responsibility the system has proven to be inad equate for improving scien ce and mathematics education nationally the commission also found that th federal effort including the activities of the department of ducation and the national sc ience foundation was divided and incoherent p 50 the report stated that presidential leadership and bipartisan commitment will be necessary over the next two or more decades if the nations precollege educational system is to be improved significantly cooperation across agencies and w ith foreign nations and entities39 the report stated that the international relati ons of the united states have suffered from the absence of longterm balanced strategy for issues at the intersection of science and technology with foreign ffairs p 29 it recomme nded that international st responsibilities be clarified acro ss federal agencies and particularly in the department of state for example th at position of science and technology counselor to the secretary of state be established and that the number of st officers in us embassies be increased40 overall there are three aims for the mid1990s to define afresh the us international goals in and for st to bring the increasingly important international programs into the mainstream throughout the st agencies of the government and to orchestrate use of the nations full technical assets especially from the private sector in order to fulfill the goals of american foreign policy p 31httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs15

energy security and economic strength in the development of na tional policy view that has become conventional wisdom the commissions term e3 has been accepted into the policy lexicon42 the commission recommended pr omoting coordination of e3 in the congress and improving the topleve l mechanism for such coordination in the executive branch43 in regard to the latter the report recommended that the system be reorganized and integrated through number of specific changes in the executive office of the president mergers of existing agencies and consolidations of laboratories of the envir onmental protection agency longterm st planning44 the report found that voting more attention to longterm us st policy both within nd outside of government is critically important in todays rapidly changing highly competitive global economy p 69 the report recommended that mechanisms for institutionalizing longterm st goal setting should be instituted in the polic ymaking and budgetsetting processes of congress and the executive branch nother major recommendation was that nongovernmental national forum on scie nce and technology goals should be established as forum for the exchange of ideas about

earlier white house reports science in the national interest 1994 and technology in the national interest 199646 as well as current clinton administration st policies and programs the administrations st policy achieve ments were promoted by examples taken from wide range of past current and proposed programs as well as by stating the potential importance of those programs in the next century the entire spectrum of federal st polic was described or alluded to in the report including federal research agency and laboratory activities programs and other related policy initiatives key aspects regarding the role of the us government in st policy the report covered six broad policy areas science technol ogy national security and global stability the environment health and human resources each issue was addressed in parate chapter science the report takes the position that the federal governments support of basic research is an underpi nning for the nations econo mic wellbeing health and security pp 1133 it highlights several nationa l science policy goals and achievements since 1993 those describe d in greatest detail were sustaining leadership in scientific knowledge inve sting in modern scie ntific facilities and instruments and partnering to advance scientific frontiers according to the report the federal role is very broad yet productive when it comes to supporting basic research and advancing scientific frontiers the re port contended that federal support of wide range of innovative and ex perimental sc ientific research projects gives the united states its lead in in ternational science awards and honors for example in nobel prize wi nners in science from 19931996 however the report also contended that unless further inves tment is made the united states may fall behi nd other nations that are increasing their national non defense rd budgets th administrations position was that competitive advantages in the future will accrue to na tions through investments that produce new basic knowledge the report provided exampl of how us advances in astronomy the environment advanced materials and nuclear science have provided wide

effort to maintain modern scientific facilities and institutions it report stated that federally funded rd facilities ar among the best in the world it cited many examples including facility developments and upgrades at nasa doe nsf and nih where federal investments have paid off wide range of scientific partne rships also were noted in the report this chapter summarized the benefits of scientific partnerships with industry academia and other rd orga nizations to enable greater leverage of national research investments technology in february 1993 president c linton set forth his national technology policy47 science and technology shaping the twentyfirst century noted the administrations accomplishments in wide range of technology initiatives both as direct supporter of technology deve lopment and as catalyst enabling us industry to compete globally pp 3536 to maintain the us technological lead the report called for the continuation of favorable domestic t echnology policies as well as where appropriate removing barriers to inte rnational rd collaboration the report contended that the government has direct role in providing funding vital to technology invention and innovation in turn that has led to the creation of new industries such as the computer nd biotechnology industries it also has propelled existing industries such as agri culture and telecommunications into global leadership positions by creating fa vorable environment for technology development federal technol ogy policy either directly or indirectly has led to advances ranging from frozen orange juice to closecaptioned television for the deaf the report stated that since 1993 the ad ministrations economic regulatory and trade policies have enabled us industry to develop co mmercialize and otherwise compete in the global economy in this role the federal government has removed barriers and streamlined proce dures for technology innovation the report stated that through the adva nced technology program atp of the department of commerce the clint on administration has created successful governmentindustry partnerships for ex ample it cited the autobody consortium which has helped the us automotive ma nufacturing and supplier industries the chapter also discussed other types of partnerships outside of the atp an example is the nasa aeronautics enterprise which has worked with the us aerospace industry to identify highpayo ff commercial technologies third area where the administration c ited successful us technology policy is infrastructure that in cludes direct federal support fo r infrastructure initiatives in information technologies and the internet the next generation internet initiative transportation intelligent transportation initiative and navigation global positioning system the administration also viewed infrastructure in largerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs18 context of networked research infrastru cture in health and medicine and in standards and measurements federal i nvestments provide payoffs in direct technology application and through partne rships for example nihs cooperative research and development agreements cradas that encourage nonfederal institutions to take more active role national security and global stab ility to ensure that the us military and the defense community is capable of mainta ining the highest level of security and vigilance the clinton administration has called for increased investments in rd linked to us national security pp 5775 the threat to national security was defined not only in terms of warfare and the need for adva nced weapons but in terms of nuclear proliferation and terrorism thus the federal st role is not just limited to the traditional one of supporting dod rd but also includes federal role in supporting and encouraging st initiatives in fields related to broad national security goals the administration report called for radi cal restructuring of us defense st policy there are three prongs to this federal role acquisition reform of the us military purchasing the highest quality tec hnology at lowest cost promotion of dualuse technologies includi ng dualuse rd integrat ed production and insertion of commercial technologies and increasing militarycivilia n technology prototypes in nuclear proliferation the report called for wide rang of efforts in which the federal role is to reduce existing threats and stem the spread the weapons of mass destruction those efforts have included new bilateral and multila teral proliferation agreements enhanced global cooperation nd new technologies for monitoring and verification the lead agen cies have been dod and doe the report stated that the us infrastructure from transportation to telecommunications is at risk from terrori st attacks the critical infrastructure protection commission was created by the president in 1997 to develop national policy addressing that risk several broad st initiatives to promote global stability also were included strengthening scientific ties with other nations fostering global partnerships in science and technology applying us advances in health and medicine to reduce or eliminat disease and using st ag reements to help countries maintain democratic advances such as in south africa environment the administrations report cited vice president gores long standing interest in environmental policy to improve the standard of living and well being of all people pp 7793 the po licy goals and achieve ments listed in this chapter reflect the environmental policy developed by the clinton administration since 1993 that environmental st policy is defined by the administration to include wide range of health biodiversity ecosystems and global climate change issues to promote sustainable future for the worlds environment the report contended that only the fede ral government can provide the broad overarching st policies and actions that will ensure cleaner environment us industry academia and state and local governments may have an interest in some environmental issues and the report cited variety of pa rtnerships with those groups and the federal government to sustain healthy and safe future the administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs19 contended that federa l policymakers must confront variety of local regional and global environmental challenges within comprehensive policy framework in this chapter the administration described the environmental challenges addressed by federa l policies and programs they included maintaining biological diversity and protecting endangered species safeguarding water resources improving air quality reducing and ultimately eliminating exposure to toxic substances limiting the impact of natural hazards for example hurricanes reversing stratospheric ozone depletion and understanding mitigating and adapting to climate change this chapter provided an extensive list of federal programs addressing those issues the list includes doe epa partment of the interior nasa noaa nih and nsf programs for developing clean alternative energy disposing of toxic waste maintaining wetlands improving satellite monitoring of weather patterns using computer modeling and simulation to forecast global clima change assessing endocrine disruptions in humans and wildlife and supporting basic research initiatives where industry and other nonfed eral institutions are not undertaking research and development among the in ternational programs is uscanada mexico public partnership ddressing ozone depletion health the report cited the long history of the federal interest in improving the health of the nations citizens through i nvestments in science and technology pp 95 115 the federal role in biomedical res earch is primarily undertaken through nihs programs addressing health and disease i ssues facing americans however other federal agencies such as usda nsf nasa epa cdc and the departments of energy defense veterans affairs nd commerce support research in health and food safety in biomedical research the federal r d effort supports nih programs focused on understanding treating preventing and curing diseases such as cancer hivaids and alzheimers disease as we ll as emerging diseases such as ebola hemorrhagic fever the nih also supports research in genetic mapping and is significant supporter of neuroscience resear ch as part of the 1990s decade of the brain p 103 in food and health the report provided several examples of ongoing federal efforts to improve food sa fety nutrition and production they include federal programs that fund research in sanitary standards and impr ove public knowledge of nutrition agricultural st issues cited in the report include direct federal st policies such as usda programs in an imal health and husba ndry and broader policies that enable greater advances in agricultural development such as harmonious trade efforts the report also cited fe deral programs in bot h basic and applied agricultural research as part of the larger federal health and safety rd portfolio human resources this chapter outlined current federal efforts in wide range of st education training and literacy issues pp 117134 it described the federal policies nd programs supporting st human resources both by direct support and funding to improve learning and knowledge and policies that create ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs20 more informed population all of the major federal research agencies have contributed to those policies the federal role in human resources development can be likened to three concentric policy rings at the center are federal policies that are intended to create and maintain worldclass leadership in sc ience and technology at the core of that policy thrust are the university research and federal laboratory systems which receive direct federal funding and suppor t part of that thrust is federal polic ies to improve the international performance of us students in mathematics and science second policy ring is federal support for an educat ed technical workforce the report cited several department of education programs to support that policy goal as well as partnerships with industry and the states to develop workforce capable of dealing with advanced technologies in the 21st century the third policy ring is to expand the st literacy of the entire us population the federal role extends from child care programs that develop reading and mathema tics skills to programs that support adult learning and lifelong education the report viewed all of these human resources policies and initiatives as important to the future of us scien ce and technology all three have broad national objectives particul arly in developing technical workforce and in encouraging scientifically literate population in thos two areas human resources policies are combined with administration science and technology policies described in the first two chapters of the administrations report and alluded to in subsequent chapters as well findings andor conclusions in the report there are two overarching st roles for the federal government one is direct role in which government support of rd promotes supports and ensures th health welfare security and economic prosperity of the american people that role is advanced through the federal agency missions in science and technology the federal laboratory sy stem and support of university research the other role is that in which the federal government serves as catalyst enabling nonfederal st institutions to flourish in that role the federal government fills broader but acco rding to the clinton administration less important position the role include s supporting st education and training creating favorable tax policies providing capital investment and creating rd spin off benefits the report contended that both roles are critical and correctly according to most science policy analysts that many of st initiatives cited in it are part of an historical federal role going back several decades or centuries for example agricultural research still since the entir report was about the role of the federal government in science and technology th ere are virtually policies programs or activities discussed in it that fall outside either the direct role of the federal government or its indirect role as catalyst when both roles are combined the tone of the report implied an activist federal st policy regardless of which role is takenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs21 48lewis m branscomb and james h keller eds investing in innovation creating research and innovation policy that works cambridge mit press 1998 516 pp all quotes in this section are from that sourceinvesting in innovation creating research and innovation policy that works 48 background of the report this book was the culmination of project undertaken by the science technology and public policy pr ogram at harvard university which was sponsored by the co mpetitiveness policy council bipartisan federal advisory commission many of the recommendations originated from diverse set of experts who pa rticipated in policy conference held jointly by harvard and the competitiveness council in washington dc on november 1819 1996 the book sought to shed light on the debate that emerged between the republican congress and the clinton administration regarding the appropriate federal role in fostering technological i nnovation the authors argued that bipartisan consensus for technology policy requires recognition that science and technology are deeply intertwined and often indistinguishable from each other in contrast to research and development which are quite distinct activities calling for different institutional settings and differe nt expectations from their sponsors according to the authors there is basic agreement between congress and the administration regarding the federal role in the support of basic research and the ducation of future scientists and engineers public activities that bene fit both the public and private sectors however much intellectually exciting and economically useful research lies between the categories of basic science and commercial product development which congress and the administration agree is primarily private sector responsibility branscomb and keller argued that when political debate divides the world of rd into basic scientific research on the one side and everythi ng else from applied research to product development on the othe r the debate loses sight of huge and important gray area of research the authors refer to this gray area as basic technology research in which both the public and privat sectors have an interest p 467 the book concluded by veloping set of principles that outline what the federal role should be in supporting needbased ba sic technology research keyaspects regarding the role of the us government in st the report concluded that innovati on is the product of intell ectual creativity and broad based collective efforts the authors argu ed that the process of innovation grows more complex as countries around the world join in global effort to create and exploit new possibilities they contended that the united states requires carefully crafted broadly supported approach to this global challeng the final chapter of the book concluded that the current single overall technology polic must give way to comprehensive sophisticated technol ogy policy based on widely shared consensus that is continually evaluated and adjusted to meet changing competitive markets in that light the book outlined six pr inciples that reflect the view that the most appropriate and effective role for the federal government is to ensure that organizations and individuals have the knowledge skills and incentives to generate private investment in innovation the authors stated that these pr inciples are entirelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs22 consistent with the governments central economic strategy to encourage savings and investment rather than to drive consumption findings andor conclusions branscomb and keller noted the six principles described next that are inte nded to provide clear framewo rk to aid in program and policy development the principles are in tended to inform decisions and provide litmus test for program evaluation and improvement before any federal money is committed for basic technology ac tivities one should ask such questions as is there significant public problem that must be addressed by the fede ral government are there other entities such as the private sector willing to offer solutions to the problem if not does the government have the skills experience and political legitimacy to bring about the desired resu lts in manner acceptable to all of those affected finally they noted that these ques tions are asked in an atmosphere of finite resources in which priorities must be set and difficult competing choices made pp 485 principle 1 encourage private innovation through publicprivate partnerships the government should promote pr ivate investment to spur economic growth improve living standards and accomplish important governmental missions by creating incentives for and reducing barriers to technology development and researchbased innovation the central thesis of this recommendati on was that the engine of innovation and productivity growth is in the private sector wherever possible the authors argued the pursuit of technology policy should favor the use of market mechanisms such as tax incentives and create markets for nonmarke t entities such as tradable permits for sulfur emissions rather than direct govern ment funding of research and development however policymakers should realize that private firms underinvest in longerrange research and in research to meet public purposes therefore the federal government should share in the cost of developing t echnologies that can meet the needs of both the public and private sectors the book c ontended that costsharing arrangements should be basic precept of federal t echnology initiatives where both public and private value is produced costsharing re quirements might be reduced in those cases where firms allow or even encourage th technology to be widely shared however the authors suggested that industrys cost sharing requirements should be raised as the technologies being developed get closer to primarily comme rcial applications principle 2 emphasize ba sic technology research focus direct government investment in science and technology fo r economic purposes on longrange broadly useful basic technology research and basi c science both of which produce benefits far in excess of what the private sector can capture itself with respect to direct or matching support of federal re search the authors recommended that the federal government continue to focus on traditional basic scientific research and b asic technology research both of which produce benefits far beyond the fair returns on investment accruing to research performers in the private sector basic technology research includes activ ities that involve investigating fundamental processes of speci fic technologies such as bl ue lasers biosensors and the wearable computers such activities us ually start early in the innovation process and lead to knowledge that is often non proprietary and widely diffusible thoughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs23 clearly on course for i ndustrial applications basic science and basic technology research are inextricably linked and depe ndent upon one another p 468 further companies have become more reluctant to put resources into basic technology research that is longterm and highrisk or both even though that research could eventually pay handsome returns to soci ety as whole the book noted that more narrowly targeted or shortterm research w ith clearly defined goals such as product and process development s hould be funded by the intende d beneficiary which might be private firm or in the case of t echnology needed primarily for government purposes by federal agency the authors contended that publicpriva technology partnerships should be structured so that it is clear how the re sults will reach broad range of users and benefit the public at large that implies using consortia of private firms universities and national laboratories in almost every case except where the government is the customer for the end product the book noted that mixture of institutional performers may be best since industry universities and nati onal laboratories have their unique ways of ensuring that new work reaches variety of potential users principle 3 facilitating access to new and old technologies promote effective use and absorption of technol ogy across the economic spectrum with special attention to the roles of higher education and the states in technology diffusion essentially this recommendation focused on the need for stronger federal and state efforts to improve the transfer of technology to the private sector primarily smaller firms mainly because many sm all firms have limited ability to choose among technologies and to ma ke effective use of them the federal government working closely with states and regi ons should develop closer links between technology policy and workforce training nd development that will help spur the diffusion and use of technology and create strong links between technology and the creation of highwage and highskill jobs two programs of the depa rtment of commerce were discussed the national institute of standards and technology nist manufactur ing extension partnership mep program was offered as an effectiv model of federalstate partnership in technology diffusion and regional econo mic development the authors also suggested that the states s hould play role in shaping nists advanced technology program atp for example atp should longer focus its grants on single company but should focus its resources on establishing multic ompany consortia so that groups of companies can benefit from new ideas such as techniques for creating new polymers materials for semiconduct ors and new systems for managing information principle 4 research and inno vation policy is more than rd utilize the full range of relevant policy tools for ex ample tax incentives regulatory reform standards and intelle ctual property rights recogniz ing that different industries technologies and regions may call for different mixes of those policy tools one size fits all t echnology policy is almost cer tain not to be successful rather the book noted that every industry is different and government agencies musthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs24 be sensitive to those differences which require different policy approaches and different mixes of science technology and systems research for example strong patent protection is essential to business success in pharmaceuticals but less so in the computer industry where most large firms crosslicensed their technology internationally biotechnology companies draw directly on cuttingedge basic research while chemical and materials firms are more dependent on advanced process technology besides directly funding rd the fede ral government should support an array of indirect incentives to help foster chnology development and diffusion including in addition to those mentioned above fac ilitation of standards development federal procurement antitrust law and competition policy and consensus building and policy analysis such as that performed by the defunct office of technology assessment for example direct federal funding for the national information infrastructure nii is not as important as the role that the federal government is playing in ensuring that regulatory hurdles are cleared and technical projects are funded so that programs such as the secondgeneration internet can be useful for both public and private sector customers principle 5 leverage globalization of innovation encourage usled innovation abroad as well as at home and able us firms to get maximum benefit from worldwide sources of technical knowledge essentially us technology policy must encourage and fac ilitate globalization and transnational collaboration not impede them the united states must learn to cooperate as well as compete given the ra pidly growing technical assets in other countries assets which in many cases ar the product of public investments the authors noted that resolving trade conflicts tends to receive more public attention than investing in transna tional collaboration and cooperation in the development of new science and technology although the tter often produces more benefits to the us economy than the former accord ing to the book the global information infrastructure gii in which us firms and institutions enjoy commanding lead today is an excellent example of the ro of us leadership in developing harmonious interna tional environment principle 6 improve government effectiveness in policy development make government stable and re liable partner in longrang national research effort through more effective institutions for policy development strong and stable bipartisan support and strong er participation by the states in policy formation and execution the final recommendation called for strong and stable bipartisan support for technology policy primarily because of the longterm nature of most government investments and the other policies recommended in this book american science and technology thrive because they are supporte d by pluralistic system there are many sources of support many types of performer s and maze of linkages among funders performers and users of scie nce and technology further there is not and should not be centralized technology policy process that undermines the value of pluralism technology policy should be explicitly ex perimental continua lly adjusted and informed by access to expert advicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs25 49gary d krenz proceedings of the 1996 jerome b wiesner symposium the future of the governmentuniversity partnership ann arbor university of michigan 1996 251 pp all quotes in this section are from that sourcethe executive office of the president must provide the locus for linking broad national policy objectives such as economic and security policy with the technology agenda congress must be an active but patient and sophisticated participant congress also has central decisionmaki ng role adjudicating among technology policy experiments policies that fail should be terminated policies that succeed must be maintained or expanded however most importantly policy experimentation must be tried for sufficiently long time nd under sufficiently reasonable conditions to be judged the book noted that the administra tion in its first term may have moved to expand its technology po licy initiatives too rapidly while congress may have moved too fast to hamstring or deauthor ize those initiatives the authors hoped that all sides will show more patience during the next four years the future of the governme ntuniversity partnership49 background of the report there is widespread concern among both faculty and students in the nations re search universities about the future of research support from the federal government one manifestati on of that concern is desire to revisit the principles on which the partnership between the government and universities has been based since the end of world war ii while there has been much work over the last several years to articulate new pr inciples consensus has emerged this conference was held with the hope that it could move toward such consensus opening remarks were made by representative vernon j ehlers and representative lynn m rivers about what each hoped to get out of the conference rep ehlers listed severa l desired outcomes of the conference that would prove useful for policy action in particular he hoped that it would serve to begin development of new model for university government relations representative rivers offered several issues that sh hoped would be addressed including the direction the nation should move to ensu re productive academic enterprise and healthy economic future the conference did not explicitly address the role of the federal government in rd beyond the discussion of the university government partnership nevertheless references to that role during the conferen ce and certain themes about that role did emerge this section summarizes those themes key aspects regarding the role of the us government in st conference participants discussed the character of rd performed in academia federal support of university research the government university partnership and organizational and ma nagement issues character of rd there was general agreement among the participants that the federal government should support l ongterm fundamental research one speaker characterized such re search as that which is not economically feasible p 111 as justification for such researc h the conference agreed that new knowledgehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs26 50bush science the endless frontier was fundamental to advances in the na tions wellbeing and that fundamental research was the primary source of that new knowledge some of the participants also asserted that the government might have role in supporting midterm research this type of research was defined as midrange precompetitive research one speaker noted that such research which had been performed mainly by industry and which provided the main connecti on between the knowledge base and products has all but disappeared because of global economic pressure that for ced industry to concentrate on new product development there was also substantial support among the speakers that critical contribution of the universitygovernment partnership is its nurturing and maintaining p 53 of the human resour ces needed for technol ogical advancement therefore support of education through the research process is an important responsibility of the federal government federal missions very little was said about fe deral funding of research that supported specific federal missions the conference however strongly endorsed support of university research by the fede ral government in the context of the universitygovernment partnership the only other reference to missionrelated rd was by one speaker who argued that po licymakers do not ade quately understand the importance of the contribution to general research and education of the rd funded by the federal mission agencies although that statement implied that federal funding of missionoriented rd should conti nue there was discussion about that proposition the governmentuniversity partnership the participants spoke of governmentuniversity partners hip as formed from the principles set forth in the 1945 vannevar bush report50 those principles were that the federal government would provide support for the performance of fundamental research at the nations universities and that research in tur n would produce the knowledge and trained people that would lay the foundation for gr eater national wellbeing one speaker argued that the partnership has been ma jor factor in the nations success over the last 50 years an important theme of the conference however was that new model for that partnership is needed although some argued that many of the principles behind the bush model were still valid most felt that new science policy was needed to guide the partnership in the future little was said about other forms of g overnment partnerships one exception was statement by one speaker noting the recent establishment of several programs supporting governmentindustry partnershi ps performing generic precompetitive research he argued that those partners hips were an importa nt new development in the nations science nd technology policy organizational and management issues most of the discussion in the conference about the federal role in rd concerned broad mana gement issues in particular several participan ts spoke about acti ons the federal government could take to reenergize the universitygove rnment research partnership httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs27 one speaker suggested that the governments role in the partnership is the general allocation of the funds and the establishment of the regulations and guidelines for example intellectual pr operty under which the research is to be performed he went on to argue that in carrying out that responsibility the federal government should develop more predictable and flexib process for determining funding levels particul arly with respect to large project s he also asserted that more efficient less burdensome administra tion of regulations would help reduce disincentives to research pp 142143 th at point was echoed by other participants who noted that the growing load of regu lations have added to the cost of doing research and have created large bureaucracies in both academia and government caution was raised by one speaker howev er who argued that while reform of regulation of research is needed unive rsities must be accountable to the public another recommendation was that the fede ral government pay the full cost of performing research that it funds one sp eaker noted that there is an increasing tendency of federal agencies to fail to pay the full costs of research primarily through reduction in indirect cost rates forcing universities to meet those costs with funds that should be used for teachin g at the same time as another speaker pointed out universities have major responsibility in seeing to it that costs are contained one speaker however stated as arguable the notion that universities are not doing enough to contain costs thereb restricting access by nontraditional student populations many participants made the point that research and education need to be more closely integrated one speaker asserted that there will need to be more emphasis on education as one of the two critical outputs from universities this speaker noted that many nsf efforts are aimed at strengthening the connection between research and education including proposal to recogniz research universities that have done an outstanding job of combining research and education there was strong suggestion from those remarks that an important federal role is to see that tighter connection is made between edu cation and research last point concerned ways to in crease public support of science and technology the participan ts agreed that without such support sustaining the governmentuniversity partnership will be very difficult if not impossible many speakers emphasized that to gain that support it was necessary to make clearer to the public the importance of science and technology to the wellbeing of society they argued that both partners universities and the government have responsibility in undertaking that task findings andor conclusions the major theme emerging from the conference was that the research partnership between the federal government and universities must be maintained for the benefit of the nation doing so however will require significant changes by both partners to deal with changing conditions brought by the end of the cold war constraints on fede ral spending and certainties about public support of university research number of other conclusions can be drawn from the points made at the conference first federal funding of f undamental research s hould continue and the primary recipient of those funds should be universities second the government rolehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs28 51department of commerce effective partnering report to congress on federal technology

at the same time univers ities and the federal government must pay more attention to public concerns finally unive rsities must give higher pr iority to education much public concern appears to be based on belief that universities have put too much emphasis on research to th detriment of education effective partnering report to congress on federal technology partnerships51 background of the report in conjunction with the responsibility of the undersecretary of commerce for technology to serve as an advocate for innovation and industrial competitiveness52 the office of technology policy otp issued report detailing the evolution of publicprivate cooperation in the areas of research and development the study analyzed th change from government as the primary customer of federally funded rd to government as partner with the private sector in developing and deploying new co mmercial technologies th at fulfill federal mission objectives and enhance us industr ys market strength p 20 following world war ii the assumption was that t echnology developed to meet federal mission requirements eventually would fi nd applications in the private sector without any formal efforts however th at was not the case and in the early 1980s several new programs were implemented to actively commercialize government technologies the approach in the 1990s has been to facilitate partnership between the public and private sectors where all participants devel op innovations necessary for global economy such changes indicat the existence of new paradigm in which government programs reflect increased business sector involvement in federal efforts to develop and adopt new technologies while the amount of federal funds spent on these activities is small in comparison to total us rd investment the leveraging of public and pr ivate financing has an economic impact beyond that of each separate investment there are several key elements of the new paradigm according to the otp report collaboration maximizes the return on rd investment by focusing on projects with potential for economic grow th job creation nd improved quality of life programs that display flexibility predictability and stability allow the government to be better partner with the private sector the increased role of the business community in projects from concept to execution provides more opportunities for economic growth throug h technology commercialization cost sharing gives the private sector greater stake in the successful operation ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs29 government programs while limits on the length of participation ensure that unsuccessful activities will be terminated key aspects regarding the role of the us government in st that there is an important role for the federal government in maintaining competitiveness is underscored throughout the report lthough the private sector has primary responsibility for the health of industrial innovation government has an interest in maximizing the economic bene fit to society of the tax dollars invested in mission rd p 37 it is through collaborative efforts that federal investments of time and resources become more effective partnerships allow for the creation of critical mass of skills knowledge and resources that permit more technologica lly challenging work to be undertaken beyond the individual capab ilities of each party for the federal departments and agencies cooperative ventures move stateoftheart in formation expertise and technologies from the private sector to th government for use in meeting mission requirements collabor ations help decrease the costs of large expensive projects where there is both public and private sector interest by offering and facilitating commercialization opport unities beyond the original app lication of the research and development the economic wellbeing of th industrial community is also of concern to the government the process of innovation typi cally is very costly and time consuming and the outcomes often are uncertain partnerships along with other technology policies are intended to alter the balance between risk and reward so that costs and uncertainty become acceptable and there is additional incentive to undertake rd collaborative activities are designed to dir ectly catalyze private sector investments in new technologies p 46 and foster the creation of business and research synergies p 54 the evidence of st rong industry support for cooperative rd efforts is reflected in the extent of partic ipation and the degree of costsharing in total the private sector has invested 3 billion in cofinancing for technology partnerships with the us government p 63 there is great potential for expanded participation by the business community there also is interest in other government initiatives to spur innovation those initia tives include product liability reform tax changes affecting capital formation standard setting regulations and other regulatory policies such efforts should be design ed to reduce uncertainties and costs tied to investments in resear ch and development the new paradigm of publicprivate partnerships includes many activities agencies are placing greater emphasis on commercialization potential in selecting projects to fund nonfinancial assistance to small firms is being offered in conjunction with ongoing rd programs fforts are being made to strengthen the private sectors intellectual property rights associated with collaborative ventures to maximize the commercial effectiveness of partnerships private sector partners need both clear title and freedom from potential conflicts in product pricing and royalties p 57 federal agencies also are attempting to build speed flexibility and predictability into the partnership programs that is in conjunction with increased private sector participation in the velopment and impleme ntation of relevant government programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs30 findings andor conclusions the results of governmentindustry partnerships while apparent are hard to assess quantita tively because of difficulties in measuring the outputs of public and priv ate investments in rd currently the executive branch is developing new methodolog ies to calculate the effects of research and development on the econo mic wellbeing of the nati on however there are documented interim measures of success identified in the office of technology policy report increased licensing between federal laboratories nd the private

expanded technical capabilities and reduced time to market the otp report offered several recommendations to facilitate partnerships as summarized next make partnership opport unities more accessible an d easier to identify the decentralized nature of federal rd has made it difficult for the private sector to identify appropriate partne rship opportunities and releva nt intellectual property increased information dissemination coul d help remedy this situation the government can act as catalyst tying sour ces of privatesector funding and business expertise with companies that need such resources it can also promote expanded professional interacti ons including fellowship progra ms work details procurement contracts professiona l seminars or joint research ventures p 67 additional interagency coordination of research can ssist in wider dissemin ation of partnership opportunities by providing public information on governmental interests and projects federal collaborative efforts with consor tia and other umbrella organizations can multiply the effects of the work by i nvolving several comp anies and universities providing effective and mbiguous intellectual propert protection can overcome obstacles to industry participation in publicprivate partnerships be better partner improve speed flexibility and predictability one of the impediments to expanded collaborative work is the time necessary to establish joint ventures and the inflexibility of the arrangements once they are negotiated the goals of the negotiations of the part nership agreement should be to enable the parties to reach agreement on mutually beneficial terms in the least possible time while spending the least possible resources p 69 funding must be available in an expedient fashion and efforts must reflect the interests of firms in controlling the intellectual property gene rated from substantial privatesector support the office of technology policy re port recommended that partnership agreements be easier to negotiate invol ving intermediary organizations in the process can be helpful the government needs to understand the differing research objectives of members of consortium i nvolved in publicpri vate collaboration the authority to use flexibility in ad ministering cooperativ ventures minimizes burdens on the participants as does predictability in partnership arrangements

be very pr oductive however those companies often do not have the business expertise necessary to commercialize the results of research and development concerted comprehe nsive effort on behalf of the federal government is necessary to assist such firms in obtaining the resources to bring technologies to the marketplace successfully further increase the privatesector role in project definition and selection privatesector participation in collaborative efforts to meet agency mission requirements is important to improved partnering and does not compromise the integrity of the governments research re sponsibilities without such interaction it is extremely difficult to move federally f unded rd into the marketplace as stated in the otp report the point is not to ta ke the agency beyond its legitimate research mission but to ensure that within the scope of that mission the agency considers the private sectors interests in defining the areas in which it will solicit funding proposals p 74 shift to commercial financial management practices the implementation of federal costaccounting principles is major obstacle to privatesector partners because it is expensive and unfamiliar th methodology was developed to meet the needs of the government as customer rath er than as partner agencies should demonstrate flexibility in moving toward commercial financial management practices when negotiating the requirements of joint venture according to otp the experience of atp and the other partnershi p programs with private sector partners indicates that cor porate fraud or misuse of funds is extremely unusual p 75 continue developing an integrated system of measuring program results increased accountability of government programs is in the interest of both congress and the administration however measurem ent of the results of federally supported rd currently is difficult and inaccurate undertaking thus further efforts must be taken to assess program outputs both the immediate effects as well as the long term widespread economic impacts of such activities the agencies need to develop and implement comprehensive system of measurement such an effort will require the involvement of industry and academia downsizing science will the united states pay price53 background of the report this book reviewed the benefits of scientific research to society and the economy traced downsizing in federal support forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs32 research and offered recommendations for forestalling cuts and for an appropriate federal role to support acade mic research federal laborat ories and industrial rd key aspects regarding the role of the us government in st studies by leading economists according to kenneth m brown show that scientific research plays crucial role in enha ncing the productivity of the us economy in promoting longterm economic growth and in providing social benefits according to brown economists have concluded that technological change accounts for between 80 and 90 of growth in output per worker over the long term but results are less clear about the effect of research on innovation although some consider fede ral support for science to be blip on historys radar screen pp1516 becau of its relatively short history and because it is decreasing percentage of national rd support it is crucia l for some federal missions and for academic research howeve r brown said that federal funds for science peaked in real terms ten years ag and have drifted dow nward since p 5 future real dollar reductions in federal research funding are expected in defense rd and in all areas of civilian rd ex cept for the national institutes of health and the national science founda tion the re ductions will occur b ecause of firm discretionary spending caps and as more of the discretionary budget goes to support increases in entitlement funding as resu lt of an increasingly large aging population pressure on the budget will increase if there is an unanticipated economic downturn additionally the current outlook reduction for science is all the more unsettling because it comes afte r rapid expansion over the period 1953 to 1990 average annual growth of rd f unding was 48 percent about two percentage points above the growth of the economy as measured by the gross domestic product p 13 additional downsizing in fe deral science funding would be risky according to brown since the returns on investment in research are so large the empirical evidence gives little guidance though as to whether the science budget should be 50 billion or 150 billion p 28 it is likely that other area of federal investment provides such high social bene fits as research and development even though the best estimates of the average ra of return on science spending suggest that it is around 50 that does not prove that there should be more spending brown cited several different economic studies that by his calculations show benefits of rd investment of about 8 to 10 of gross domestic pr oduct gdp annually another way of calculating the effects of rd is on its contribution to economic growth brown wrote another rough calculation rd is 26 percent of gdp suppose we make massive 20 percent cut in rd which would equal 05 percent of gdp if the rate of return on the lost rd had been 50 percent then we would lose 025 percentage point of growth each year fairly large amount in relation to the nations longterm growth of about 25 pe rcent certainly anyone who could devise feasible policy that woul d add 025 percentage point of economic growth would be an economic miracle worker p 26 furthermore concern about the negativ effects of downsizing science needs to account for the fact that many benefits of science are not captured in the nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs33 income accounts for instance the bette r health and longevity generated by biomedical research the effects of downsizing also need to account for the benefits lost the new knowledge not discovered federal budget cuts eliminating bad sc ience projects might help solve the problem of budget reductions but seem to be infeasible politically other major supporters of research f oundations and the private sector will not make much of contribution to replacing federally funded research dollars foundations devoted only small amount of money just about 250 million in 1993 to scientific research while federal funds have decreased in realdo llar terms and as proportion of total national support for r d industrial spending for rd has increased in the past industry funded less than 50 of national rd t oday it funds about two thirds totaling about 130 billion in 1997 wh ile the federal gove rnment funds about 75 million however industria l support of basic research has declined implying that the federal government should fund ri sky fundamental science since private companies could not fund funda mental research on the s cale funded by the federal government according to brown there is vital but limited role for government in support of research p 44 he rejected th views of some economists who question any role at all for the government in promoting science they include economist william niskanen who prefers to augment private rd expenditures through the tax system by tax credit for research and experimentation and matching grants as means of inducing more governme nt research without putting government completely in charge of selecting specific research projects p 52 he also disagreed with terence kealy who he said argues that science would be adequately supported by private means wit hout governmental intervention p 52 he said that to support his views kealy used selective exampl of failed projects that met his criteria but did not represent full spectrum of the history of projects he also disagreed with the view of char murray who he said would wipe out all subsidies for scientific research leaving only enforcement of patent law as the sum total of scie nce support p53 government funding should focus only on re search that the pr ivate sector would not fund more attention should be give n to allocating funds and determining priorities in an increasingly constrained fe deral research budget it is not easy to use objective criteria to evaluate or assess the value or outputs of fe deral research the government performance and results ac t gpra pl 10362 requires that outcomes of federal research programs be evaluated such evaluations are expensive to date gpra analyses have been satisfactorily co mpleted p 130 the economic theory of public goods according to brown provides principles that guide priority setting by developing three necessary conditions for legitimate governmental funding those are the research must have reasonabl chance of producing benefits that outweigh its costs these must be broa d social benefits rather than benefit just to particular firm the research would not be performed in the absence of governmental supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs34 54national academy of sciences allocating federal funds for science and technology the federal agency must be able to f und or perform the research efficiently see chapter 5 pp 4454 these three criteria apply equally to research grants contracted research and mission research performed by g overnment laborat ories p 48 findings andor conclusions the difference between mediocrity and excellence in science amounts to low billi ons of research support dollars annually reductions in federal sc ience funding would not cause immediate measurable showdowns in productivity growth but inev itably some needed research would never be conducted the biggest impact w ould be on the nation s universities which will be noticeably different after ten year s of diminished fede ral funding well endowed research universities may not suffer much but because of reductions in the less prominent universities fewer phds will be trained and more us students will have to go abroad to find expertise in certain fields as us universities obtain more funds from industry or seek to earn more from profitorie nted consortia the wideranging social benefits of freely available research may be compromised or scientific research in academia may become more shortterm nevertheless commercially supported academic research seems clearly preferable to simply letting academic research sh rink p 9091 the federal government should target federal funds more effectively p129 eliminate questionable programs and increase spending by ar ound 30 or 35 percent annually in real terms in order to s upport science at level which is acceptable p 128 this is within the nations r each but living within tighter budgets means that the nation will have to live within the following guidelines target federal funds more effectively if we could selectively target the least efficient federal government subsidy programs for elimination then downsizing might not be so harmful unfortunately science budgets are not established in that way nor is there any actual authority that systematically reviews rd programs with efficiency as key consideration p 54 stability in federal funding also is important the process of allocating federal f unds for science and technology needs to be made more c oherent systematic nd comprehensive p 54 brown described the proposal in th 1995 national academy of sciences report allocating federal funds for science and technology54 as reasonable attempt to organize science budgeting it called fo r development of federal science and technology fst budget which w ould exclude fundi ng of production engineering testing and upgrading of weapons systems pp 129130 nurture but do not directly subsidize industrial rd industrial research is wellfunded by industry but is shifting away even more from fundamental research to applied researc h some existing federal prog rams directed at industrial research have strong tendency to di splace what industry could have done on its own the federal government should not f und applied research projects that industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs35 will fund and should eliminate those programs that are inefficient such as the department of commerces advanced technology progra m which now appears to displace privatesector funding subsidies are justified only to the extent that they buy social benefits benefits that accrue only to the firm are not legitimate goals for federal subsides if one accepts the market oriented framework for economic policy p 106 brown endorsed the recomme ndations of the academy report on allocating federal funds for sc ience and technology that the government should encourage but not directly fund privatesector commercial technology development with two limited exceptions development in pursuit of govern ment missions such as weapons development and space flight or development of new enabling or broa dly applicable technologies for which government is the only f under available p 106 the government should reduce actions by regulatory agencies that inadvertently reduce the effective rate of return on indus trial research if industrial rd funding slows down we need to look to the more subtle and indirect causes such as tax policy federal regulations and the like the whole range of regulations health care policies and complex legalisms th at surround pharmaceuticals for example probably do more to affect the rate of return on rd than ten advanced technology programs would p 131 also the federal government can aid industry by ensuring adequate funding for fundamental scientific research at universities since such research is necessary for innovation rationalize the roles of federal laboratories federal laboratory missions need to be adjusted by congress following the end of the cold war to realign and focus the laboratories missions clear agreement on precisely what role the labs should play in the nations research terprise is lacking and pork barrel considerations are likely to warp any national plan that may emerge p 78 but the laboratories main f unctions in energy defense and related mission objectives in public health and the like seem appropri ate the missions would entail certain amount of fundamental research but not on largescale transition into research that is best performed at unive rsities p79 he sees the laboratories performing applied research that noneth eless has broad be nefits and which for that reason companies are unlikely to perform incl uding advanced computing techniques or intelligent robotics or new ma nufacturing processes and adva nced materials p 79 however laboratory performance now does not meet the requirements of the third criterion federal labor atories need to be managed more efficiently he disagreed with recommendations to create commission to target laboratories for elimination the survival of highly valuable but misused resource is at stake p 131 what is needed is commission to study the role and missions of the laboratories recognize the growth of science worldwide and develop policies to take advantage of it internationally the united states now leads the world in science as it has since the end of world war ii the downsizing of us scientific research funding is occurring at time when other nations are increasing theirs these two factors combined would in the future for ce us scientists to cooperate more with scientists in other nations and to pay more attention to the scientific results generatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs36 by other nations leadership in science does not make lot of sense as goal of science policy p 131 the nation needs to be more interactive with the countries that are enlarging their scientific activities with the global expansion of science bringing rapid growth in the worlds knowledge base we should welcome this explosion of new knowledge as benefit to the united states not fear it as threat p 124 protect federal support for academic research the federal government plays crucial role in suppor t of university research whic h is especially significant because universities are the nations largest performers of fundamental research and they train scientists and engineers on average universities receive about 60 of their research budgets from the federal g overnment thus they would suffer large reductions in their research budgets with more downsizing in federal rd budgets that would hurt the nations potential to i nnovate and cause the most serious long term consequences chap 8 industry and other sources will not be able to replace federal support for university research if it is downsized therefore federal funding needs to be protected brown concluded by noting that while research on the measurement of the economic effects of rd ppears to have gone about as far as it can with the existing data which are virtually mined out more research is needed on the theory of intellectual property and its applications especially in time when it is likely that public resources for scie nce will be limited p 132httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98365crs37 appendix acronyms of some federal departments and agencies referred to in this report cdc centers for disease control and prevention
