foreign firms still face red tape widespread corruption high health and safety standards and an unresponsive commercial court system2 lack of economic opportunity is source of popular frustration unemployment officially is close to 10 but various independent estimates are as high as 20 job creation has not kept pace with egypts high population growth rate the educational system also is inadequate to meet the needs of the burgeoning youth population poverty is another serious problem about 40 of egyptians live on less than 2 day widespread political corruption impedes economic

privatization and trade liberalization based on government consultations with the international monetary fund imf egypt committed to reducing its budget deficit through fiscal restraint in 2005 the government reduced energy subsidies but faces enormous political resistance to trimming public subsidies on bread sugar and cooking oil which cushion the impact of economic downturns on egypts poor egypt also reinvigorated its privatization program to attract foreign investment allocate resources more efficiently and increase external competitiveness significant shares of the stateowned suez cement company and joint ventures in the energy sector have been sold the government divested shares in the state dominated banking and insurance sectors as well privatization efforts have stalled recently due to disagreements about labor issues and concerns about the impact of privatization on unemployment and the price of goods additionally the government removed import service fees and surcharges and reduced the average weighted rate for tariffs in september 2004 in the past few years the government liberalized the telecommunications sector but significant trade barriers remain in

is the united statess 54th largest trading partner however egypt is the largest market for american wheat as well as significant importer of other us agricultural goods machinery and equipment

sought to negotiate an fta with the united states the fta is viewed by egypt as means to increase employment opportunities and foreign investment from the perspective of us interests the fta could enhance access to egypts market for industries such as agriculture and services3 it also could strengthen usegyptian relations affirm us commitment to economic development in the region and most importantly facilitate the administrations proposal to create middle east 3 ahmed galal and robert z lawrence anchoring reform with usegypt free trade agreement institute for international economics

that usegyptian fta would affect the us textile industry adversely in 1999 egypt and the united states signed trade and investment framework agreement tifa to promote discussion on bilateral trade and investment issues intellectual property rights ipr protection was contentious issue in prefta negotiations held under the tifa the us trade representative ustr placed egypt on its 2006 special 301 priority watch list due to egypts inadequate ipr enforcement and issuance of market approvals for unauthorized pharmaceutical products progress toward fta negotiations continued until early 2006 but was then halted by the united states reportedly in protest against the imprisonment of ayman nour the runnerup to the 2005 presidential elections4 few observers expect that discussions will resume before the presidents trade promotion authority expires in july 2007 some analysts believe that the postponement of fta talks upset egypt which pursued economic reforms in part to increase us willingness to engage in negotiations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22494 egypt also felt that the united states should reward egypts cooperation in the war on terror and ongoing efforts to promote peace in the middle east through an fta there is concern that the postponement may decrease momentum for continued economic reform in egypt other commentators suggest that the delay will galvanize egyptian authorities to push ahead with economic reforms under this view the reforms are both key to egypts economic interests and means to obtain an fta eventually there is speculation by some analysts that the delay may weaken usegyptian commercial ties as egypt seeks other trade opportunities for instance through the 2001 euromediterranean association agreement5 others counter that egypt already has open access to us markets for some goods through the qualifying industrial zones qiz program which permits egyptian industrial products with specified amounts of inputs from israel to enter the united states dutyfree and without quotas egypt initially resisted participation in qiz hopeful of usegyptian fta instead but reversed its position in 2004 because of the approaching expiration of the world trade organization multifiber agreement which threatened to crowd out egyptian textile exports to the united states due to flood of similar less expensive goods from china and india in 2005 products under the qiz program represented 12 of egypts exports to the united states textiles and apparel constituted nearly all of egypts exports under qiz6 conditioning us economic aid to egypt on reform the use of foreign assistance to support moderate arab governments in promoting peace with israel has long been cornerstone of us policy in the middle east since 1979 egypt has been the second largest

assistance to egypt is directed toward military support egypt has received about 30 billion in economic aid since 1979 from the economic support fund esf which is allocated to direct cash transfers to the egyptian government the commodity import program cip and development projects administered by the us agency for international development usaid in 1998 the united states and egypt agreed to reduce us economic aid to egypt by 40 million increments annually until stabilizing at about 400 million in 2008 congress generally earmarks aid for egypt annually in the foreign operations appropriations bill with language noting that economic aid is conditioned on egypt undertaking agreedupon economic policy reforms most recently the united states conditioned esf assistance to egypt on financial sector reform based on 2005 memorandum of understanding mou between the two countries in the mou egypt agreed to financial sector reforms such as privatizing the banking system conforming with international standards strengthening transparency and accountability and creating functioning securities market and liquid mortgage market7 although esf assistance is designed to target economic growth the funds can also httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22494 be used in other areas funding for economic growth still accounts for most of the esf account but its proportion declined from 81 in fy2004 to 52 in fy2007 in contrast democracy and governance program funding is increasing from 6 in fy2004 to 19 proposed for fy2007 similarly funding for education and training programs also rose 24 is

or legislated not when implemented however there has some been frustration over egypts failure to achieve economic reform benchmarks critics of us economic assistance to egypt suggest that the economic aid program has become an entitlement and advocate rescinding funds until economic reform projects actually are completed some advise that economic development is slow process and encourage the administration and congress to continue exercising patience with egypt 7 us government and government of egypt memorandum of understanding support for the egyptian financial sector december 22 2004 crs6 proposals to rescind economic funds to egypt also may be in response to deep disappointment over recent setbacks in egypts democratization process the slow overall pace of political reform in egypt raises questions about the sincerity of the mubarak governments prodemocracy stance some members of congress suggest that rescinding economic aid would send clear signal of us dismay to egypt without undermining middle east peace process efforts however the administration believes that rescinding aid may be deleterious to the united states strategic relationship with egypt and efforts to promote regional stability additionally some development experts caution against politicizing economic aid because they believe it would hinder egypts progress toward economic reform8 the egyptian government opposes linking economic aid to political reform and is critical of us funding for democracy and human rights programs operated by civil sector organizations without egyptian government approval recent congressional action in may 2006 the house appropriations committee rejected an amendment to cut 200 million in military aid to egypt during markup of hr 5522 the fy2007 foreign operations appropriations bill in june 2006 the house defeated an amendment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22494 198225 to hr 5522 that would have shifted 100 million in economic aid for egypt to fight aids worldwide and to assist the darfur region of sudan many supporters of the amendment were dismayed by the egyptian governments spring 2006 crackdown on prodemocracy activists in cairo representative david obey of wisconsin sponsored both amendments as it currently stands the house version of hr 5522 funds the presidents full request for egypt but sets aside 50 million for democracy and governance programming and 50 million for education in egypt it also rescinds 200 million in funds previously appropriated for cash assistance in fy2003fy2006 due to insufficient financial sector reforms on june 29 2006 the senate appropriations committee also approved the administrations request for egypt the senate version rescinds 300 million in previously appropriated but unspent economic aid to egypt 100 million above the house recommendation the accompanying senate committee report to the bill srept 109 277 expresses concern with the lack of political reform in egypt and the incarceration of secularist politicians including ayman nour the bill now faces senate floor consideration future considerations egypts progress in reforming its financial sector and improving its human rights and democratization record is likely to influence future prospects for fta negotiations and us economic aid to egypt external events also may impact economic relations between the two countries the recent breakdown of the doha round for example could prompt congress to shift more attention to the negotiation of bilateral ftas with countries such as egypt additionally egypts role in the current israelilebanon crisis and other political situations in the middle east may reaffirm the countrys strategic importance to the united states and strengthen support for us economic aid to egypt 8 crs
