in my mouth keith especially such inflamatory word i was not attributing the entirety of spin here which is of pretty massive scale to you and i said i think such spin where it has occurred is either sloppy or disingenuous you chose to assume i was talking about you in specific and that i was attributing the latter rather than the former my actual words dont bear this out in the case of the briffa osborn piece i actually tend to believe that sloppiness was the main problem in other cases of spin eg the skeptics web pages of daly and his ilk it is most clearly disingenousnousi dont equate you with daly and those folks by any stretch of the imagination hopefully you know that i respect you quite bit as scientist but in this case i think you were sloppy and the sloppiness had real cost and as to whether or not your statements about ipcc are fair i didnt use the word disservice ill leave that to each to decide but personally i think they were unfair because they opened up ipcc to criticism that is not merited by what is actually said or shown in the ipcc report other ipcc authors who have contacted feel the same way and perhaps there may be an official response on the part of ipcc authors i dont know but i agree that any further discussion ought to take place in the peerreviewed literature mike at 0509 pm 41202 0100 keith briffa wrote i agree with the sentiments expressed by tom however in his latest message mike clearly says that our perspectives piece did the ipcc disservice he then accuses us of spinning the ecs paper to say that mbh is an underestimate of what it purports to be and that we have been sloppy and disingenuous frankly this is too much to take i am not going to let this ruin my weekend so i wait until i have calmed down and find time next week to write response in the meantime i just wanted to note that i disagree with these comments perhaps the best place to continue this discussion is in the peer review literature keith at 1111 am 41202 0400 michael mann wrote ed and others i thought i too should chime in here one last time ill leave it to you malcolm keith and others to debate out the issue of any additional uncertainties biases etc that might arise from rcs in the presence of limited samples that is beyond my range of expertise but since this is new and relatively untested approach and it is on the basis of this approach that other estimates are being argued to be underestimates we would indeed have been remiss now to point this out in our letter the wording perilous perhaps should be changed by i very much stand by the overall sentiment expressed by malcolm in our piece with regard to rcs one very important additional point that malcolm makes in his message is that conservative estimates of uncertainties appropriate additional caveats etc were indeed all provided in mbh99 and i have always been careful to interpret our results in the context of these uncertainties and caveats ipcc 2001 was careful to do so to and based its conclusions within the context of the uncertainties hence the choice of the conservative term likely in describing the apparently unprecedented nature of late 20th century warmth and moreover on the collective results of many independent reconstructions briffa osborn would have you believe that ipcc 2001s conclusions in this regard rested on mbh99 alone frankly keith and tim i believe that is unfair to the ipcc whether or not one cares about being fair to mbh or not what is unfortunate here then is that esper et has been spun i to argue that mbh99 underestimates the quantity it purports to estimate full northern hemisphere annual mean temperature given the readily acknowledged level of uncertainty in both estimates combined with the apples and oranges nature of the comparison between the two which i have sought to clarify in my letter to science and in my messages to you all and the comparison plot i provided i believe it is either sloppy or disingenuous reasoning to argue that this is the case the fact that this sloppiness also readily serves the interests of the skeptics is quite unfortunate but it is indeed beside the point it would probably also be helpful for to point out without naming names that many of our most prominent colleagues in the climate research community as well government funding agency representatives have personally contacted over the past few weeks to express their dismay at the way they believe this study was spun i wont get into the blame game because theres more than enough of that to go around but when the leaders of our scientific research community and our funding managers personally alert us that they believe the credibility of our field has been damaged i think it is time for some serious reflection on this episode thats my final 2 cents mike _______________________________________________________________________ professor michael mann department of environmental sciences clark hall university of
