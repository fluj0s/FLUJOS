background and oversight issues for congress summary the navy is proposing to maintain in coming years navy with 31 amphibious ships and an additional squadron of 14 maritime prepositioning force future or mpff ships the mpff squadron is intended to implement new operational concept called sea basing under which forces would be staged at sea and used to conduct expeditionary operations ashore with little or reliance on nearby land bases the navys proposed fy2008 budget requests 13983 million in procurement funding for ninth san antonio lpd17 amphibious ship to be procured in fy2008 the navy estimates the total procurement cost of this ship at 17983 million the ship received 2962 million in fy2008 advance procurement funding and the navys proposed fy2008 budget calls for the final

for the mpff the issue for congress is whether to approve modify or reject the navys plans for procuring amphibious and mpff ships decisions that congress makes on this crs2 issue could affect navy and marine corps capabilities navy and marine corps funding requirements and the shipbuilding industrial base background current amphibious and maritime prepositioning ships amphibious ships amphibious ships are one of four principal categories of combat ships that traditionally have helped define the size and structure of the us navy the other three are aircraft carriers surface combatants eg cruisers destroyers frigates and littoral combat ships and submarines1 the primary function of amphibious ships is to transport marines and their equipment to distant operating areas and enable marines to conduct expeditionary operations ashore in those areas amphibious ships have berthing spaces for marines flight decks and hangar decks for their helicopters and verticalshort take off and landing vstol fixedwing aircraft well decks for storing and launching their landing craft2 and storage space for their wheeled vehicles their other combat equipment and their supplies although amphibious ships are designed to support marine landings against opposing military forces they can also be used for marine landings in socalled permissive or benign situations where there are opposing forces us amphibious ships are navy ships operated by navy crews with the marines as passengers they are built to survivability standards similar to those of other us navy combat ships3 and are included in the total number of battle force ships in the navy which is the commonly cited figure for the total number of ships in the fleet4 amphibious ships are procured in the navys shipbuilding budget known as the shipbuilding and conversion navy scn appropriation account designations of amphibious ship classes start with the letter l as in amphibious landing todays amphibious ships can be divided into two main groups the socalled bigdeck amphibious assault ships designated lha and lhd which look like mediumsized aircraft carriers and the smaller but still sizeable lsd and lpd 1 the navy also includes mine warfare ships and variety of auxiliary and support ships 2 well deck is large garagelike space in the stern of the ship it can be flooded with water so that landing craft can leave or return to the ship access to the well deck is protected by large stern gate that is somewhat like garage door 3 to enhance their survivability in battle their ability to absorb damage from enemy weapons us navy ships are built with features such as extensive interior compartmentalization and increased armor protection of certain critical interior spaces 4 battle force ships are ships that are readily deployable overseas and which contribute to the overseas combat capability of the navy they include both active duty and naval reserve force combat ships as well navy and military sealift commandoperated auxiliaries such as oilers ammunition ships dry cargo ships and multiproduct resupply ships that transport supplies from shore to navy combat ships operating at sea crs3 type amphibious ships5 the lhas and lhds have large flight decks and hangar decks for embarking and operating numerous helicopters and vstol fixedwing aircraft while the lsds and lpds have much smaller flight decks and hangar decks for embarking and operating smaller numbers of helicopters the lhas and lhds as bigger ships in general can embark more marines and equipment than the lsds and lpds as of the end of fy2006 the navy included 33 amphibious ships 7 wasp lhd1 class ships commissioned between 1989 and 2001 each displacing about 40500 tons6 4 tarawa lha1 class ships commissioned between 1976 and 1980 each displacing about 40000 tons 12 whidbey islandharpers ferry lsd4149 class ships commissioned between 1985 and 1998 each displacing about 16000 tons 1 san antonio lpd17 class ship commissioned in 2006 displacing about 26000 tons and 9 austin lpd4 class ships commissioned between 1965 and 1971 each displacing about 17000 tons7 the navy organizes its amphibious ships into expeditionary strike groups esgs each esg notionally includes one lha or lhd one lsd and one lpd the amphibious ships in an esg together can embark marine expeditionary unit meu consisting of about 2200 marines their aircraft their landing craft their combat equipment and about 15 days worth of supplies each esg also notionally includes three surface combatants some or all armed with tomahawk cruise missiles one submarine and perhaps one or more p3 longrange landbased maritime patrol aircraft esgs are designed to be independently deployable strike capable naval formations but they can also operate in conjunction with carrier strike groups csgs to form larger naval task forces on average two or perhaps three esgs might be forwarddeployed at any given time 5 lha can be translated as landing ship helicoptercapable assault lhd can be translated as landing ship helicoptercapable well deck lsd can be translated as landing ship well deck lpd can be translated as landing ship helicopter platform well deck whether noted in the designation or not all these ships have well decks 6 for comparison nimitzclass nuclearpowered aircraft carrier displaces about 100000 tons and cruiser or destroyer displaces about 9000 tons 7 the navy also operates two blue ridge lcc19 class command ships as their designation suggests these ships were originally built as amphibious command ships in recent years they have evolved into general fleet command ships some listings of us navy ships include the two lccs as amphibious ships while others list them in separate category of command ships along with one other fleet command ship the coronado agf11 which is converted lpd crs4 maritime prepositioning ships todays maritime prepositioning ships are large military cargo ships that are loaded with combat equipment and supplies and forwardlocated to sea areas that are close to potential us military operating zones they are essentially forwardlocated floating warehouses most have rollonroll off roro capability which means that they are equipped with ramps that permit wheeled or tracked vehicles to quickly roll on or off the ship when the ship is at pier total of 36 us prepositioning ships controlled by the military sealift command msc store equipment and supplies for various parts of dod the 16 ships used primarily for storing marine corps equipment and supplies are called maritime prepositioning force mpf ships the 10 ships used primarily for storing equipment and supplies for the army are called the combat prepositioning force the remaining 10 ships used primarily for storing equipment and supplies for the air force navy and defense logistics agency are called logistics prepositioning ships this report focuses on the 16 mpf ships the 16ship mpf fleet is organized into three squadrons of five or six ships each each squadron stores enough combat equipment and supplies to equip and support meb for period of 30 days one squadron is normally forwardlocated in the atlantic or mediterranean one is normally forwardlocated in the indian ocean at diego garcia and one is normally forwardlocated in the western pacific at guam and saipan8 todays mpf ships are designed to support marine landings at friendly ports or ports that marines or other us or friendly forces have previously seized by force under the basic mpf concept of operations the mpf ships would steam into such port while marines would be flown into nearby friendly or seized airbase the marines would then travel to the port help unload the mpf ships unpack and marry up with their equipment and supplies and begin conducting their operations ashore mpf operations can be used to reinforce an initial marine presence ashore that was created by marine landing against opposing forces or to establish an initial marine presence ashore in permissive or benign landing environment the mpf concept permits mebsized marine force to be established in distant operating area more quickly than would be possible if the mebs equipment and supplies had to be transported all the way from the united states unlike prepositioning of equipment and supplies on the soil of foreign countries maritime prepositioning in international waters does not require permanent host nation access the mpf concept also provides degree of intertheater operational flexibility since an mpf squadron can be moved from one theater eg the mediterranean to an adjoining theater eg the indian ocean relatively quickly if needed to respond to contingency dod used the mediterranean and western pacific mpf squadrons to supplement the indian ocean mpf squadron in the 1991 gulf war operation desert storm and the more recent iraq war operation iraqi freedom 8 the maritime prepositioning ships serving the other military services are located principally at diego garcia crs5 todays mpf ships are dod sealift ships operated with civilian crews they are built to survivability standards similar to those of commercial cargo ships which are lower than those of us navy combat ships they are not included in the total number of battle force ships in the navy9 todays mpf ships are designated taks the t means the ships are operated by the msc the means auxiliary and the k means cargo the mpf fleet was established in the mid1980s it includes 13 ships tak 3000 through tak3012 that entered service with the mpf in 19841986 and three ships tak3015 through tak3017 that were added to the mpf fleet in 20002003 under the mpf enhancement or mpfe program so as to increase the storage capacity of the mpf fleet in accordance with lessons learned during the 1991 gulf war one mpfe ship was added to each squadron the 13 earlier mpf ships which each displace between about 44000 and 49000 tons are owned and operated by private companies under 25year charters ie leases to msc the three more recently added mpfe ships which each displace between about 50000 and 55000 tons are owned by the us government and are operated by private companies under contract to msc since fy1993 newconstruction dod sealift ships similar to the mpf ships have been procured not in the scn account but rather in the national defense sealift fund ndsf dod revolving fund that is outside both the department of the navy budget and the procurement title of the annual dod appropriation act ndsf funding is used for acquiring operating and maintaining dod sealift ships and certain navy auxiliary ships as of the end of fy2005 the mpf fleet included the following ships 5 cpl louis j hauge jr tak3000 class ships which were

converted into an mpfe ship and renamed the stockham11 amphibious and mpff forcelevel goals the navy is proposing to maintain in coming years fleet of 313 ships including 31 amphibious ships and 14ship mpff squadron12 the 31ship amphibious force is to include the following 9 lhd or lhatype largedeck amphibious assault ships 10 lpd17 class amphibious ships and 12 lsd4149 class amphibious ships the 14ship mpff squadron is intended to help implement new operational concept called sea basing which is discussed in the next section the squadron is to include 2 newconstruction amphibious assault

resupply ships and 3 mobile landing platform mlp ships sea basing concept the concept in general the navy and marine corps are proposing to implement new concept of operations for staging forces at sea and conducting expeditionary operations ashore with little or reliance on nearby land bases the concept is called enhanced networked sea basing or sea basing for short under the traditional concept of operations for conducting expeditionary operations ashore the navy and marine corps would establish base ashore and then use that base to conduct operations against the desired ashore objective under sea basing the navy and marine corps would launch direct and support expeditionary operations directly from base at sea with little or reliance on nearby land base13 key rationale for the sea basing concept is that in the future fixed land bases ashore will become vulnerable to enemy attack from weapons such as cruise missiles or shortrange ballistic missiles launching the operation directly from base at sea advocates of sea basing argue will enhance the survivability of the attacking navy marine corps force by putting the base out of the range of shorterrange enemy weapons and targeting sensors and by permitting the sea to be used as medium of maneuver for evading detection and targeting by longerrange enemy weapons and sensors second rationale for sea basing is that by eliminating the nearby base ashore the logistical middleman sea basing will permit the marine corps to initiate and maintain higher pace of operations against the desired objective thus enhancing the effectiveness of the operation third rationale for sea basing is that it could permit the marine force once the operation is completed to reconstitute and redeploy that is get back aboard ship and be ready for conducting another operation somewhere else more quickly than under the traditional concept of operations the sea base being referred to is not single ship but rather collection of ships including the mpff squadron other ships such as an aircraft carrier strike 13 for an indepth discussion of the sea basing concept see defense science board task force on sea basing

unanimously approved joint integrating concept jic document for sea basing15 approval of the jic gave seabasing dod recognition as key future us military capability and created more formal requirement for seabasing to be implemented in way that satisfies joint requirements rather than those of the navy and marine corps alone the seabasing concept must still complete dods joint capabilities

report states that the key performance parameters for the mpff squadron include among other things an ability to deliver ashore in period of 8 to 10 hours one marine brigade landing team blt by surface transportation from range of up to 25 nautical miles and second blt by air transportation ie vertically from range of up to 110 nautical miles the report states that affordability and industrial base considerations were key elements of the mpff squadron composition decision the squadron includes existing assets an lhd and two taks which reduces overall squadron procurement costs it also leverages hot production lines for two ship classes take and lhar which significantly reduces nonrecurring costs reduces technical and cost risk and takes advantage of learning curves during the production process the mpff squadron includes an additional vessel type mpff lmsr which is based on an existing design further reducing nonrecurring costs the mlp is the only new design platform included in the mpff squadron the mlp was also selected with affordability in mind as the vessel will leverage existing commercial technology in performing the mission21 the february 2007 report estimates the acquisition cost of the mpff squadron at 111 billion to 138 billion in constant fy2008 dollars the report states that this estimate includes test and evaluation outfitting and postdelivery costs but excludes the cost of additional shore facilities the report estimates the mpff squadrons lifecycle costs including disposal costs at 258 billion to 335 billion in constant

transport of marine corps and army forces and equipment the jhsv is to be 35 to 45knot shallowdraft intratheater transport ship similar to the leased commercial highspeed ferries that dod has used experimentally in recent years the navy also plans to procure sea basetoshore connector ssc ships for transporting personnel and equipment from the sea base to the shore area of operations the sscs would replace the navys current lcac aircushioned landing craft global fleet station gfs concept in connection with the sea basing concept and the concept of adaptive force packaging which refers to the ability of us naval forces to be split apart and recombined into force packages of various sizes and mission orientations so as to meet the needs of various contingencies the navy is proposing to establish what it calls global fleet stations or gfss 2006 navy operations concept document states that one method for furthering the navys contribution to national security will involve providing operational maneuver and assured access to the joint force while significantly reducing our footprint ashore and minimizing the permissions required to operate from host nations with sustainable logistics tail safely at sea sea basing leverages the ability to operate from international waters we are exploring innovative operational concepts that combine sea basing with adaptive force packaging that will further support national security and the combatant commanders objectives worldwide one such concept is the global fleet station gfs gfs is persistent sea base of operations from which to coordinate and employ adaptive force packages within regional area of interest focusing primarily on phase 0 shaping operations theater security cooperation global maritime awareness and tasks associated specifically with the war on terror gfs offers means to increase regional maritime security through the cooperative efforts of joint interagency and multinational partners as well as nongovernmental organizations like all sea bases the composition of gfs depends on combatant commander requirements the operating environment and the mission from its sea base each gfs would serve as selfcontained headquarters for regional operations with the capacity to repair and service all ships small craft and aircraft assigned additionally the gfs might provide classroom space limited medical facilities an information fusion center and some combat service support capability the gfs concept provides leveraged highyield sea based option that achieves persistent presence in support of national objectives additionally it complements more traditional csgesg training and deployment cycles23 the document describes hypothetical scenario in which future gfs is organized around an lpdtype ship that operates in the region for up to two years 23 us department of the navy naval operations concept 2006 washington 2006 pp 3031 crs11 in the scenario the lpdtype ship acts as host or support platform for sailors marines army personnel air force personnel and coast guard small boat unit24 march 20 2006 navy white paper on the gfs concept posted online by insidedefensecom states that the purpose of gfs is to establish base of operations from which to coordinate and launch variety of missions within regional area of interest focusing primarily on phase 0shaping and stability operations theater security cooperation maritime domain awareness and tasks associated specifically with the war on terror these activities range from traditional counter piracy mio and security patrols to mobile training teams mtts construction assistance medical outreach and information sharing by taking advantage of existing host nation basing arrangements it is anticipated that five fleet stations could be developed within the next five to seven years based upon the availability of trained personnel ships helicopters and equipment possible locations for these initial global fleet stations include guam or singapore gfs asia bahrain or uae gfs east africa arabian gulf diego garcia gfs south asia rota gfs west africa and key west gfs south and central america these locations were selected due to the availability of facilities that could support us military presence with dependents as pilot naval station key west could serve as the site for proof of concept each gfs is selfsustaining home base from which to conduct regional phase 0 operations ranging from theater security cooperation tsc activities to maritime interdiction and counterpiracy it is base from which tailored and adaptive force packages can be launched in response to humanitarian crises natural disasters and counterterrorism tippers it is center for intelligence and information fusion in support of enhanced maritime domain awareness and when networked with other fleet stations each gfs fusion center will serve as an intelligence feeder for global maritime intelligence integration most importantly these information fusion centers will offer increased regional maritime domain awareness to host nation partners and will provide timely queuing to interdict illegal transnational activities each gfs is base from which to sustain and deploy riverine units throughout the region whether in concert with mobile training teams and other phase 0 activities or to conduct missions in direct support of gwot surveillance mio maritime intercept operations combat insertion etc each gfs will serve as the logistics and c2 hq for regional expeditionary operations to include the basing of blue and gold crews to sustain high optempo operational tempo throughout the region with limited number of ships small craft helicopters and uavs unmanned aerial vehicles each gfs is home base for regional necc naval expeditionary combat command detachments consisting of seabees construction battalions or cbs salvage divers eod explosive ordnance disposal and security force personnel as well as small expeditionary medical and logistics teams it is also the hub for faos foreign area officers dedicated to supporting activities within the region tailored to the needs of the host nations involved further each gfs will leverage existing sofas status 24 us department of the navy naval operations concept 2006 op cit p 32 crs12 of forces agreements with other countries and mous memoranda of understanding to manage bilateral and multilateral cooperation as well as imet international military education and training funds and other incentive programs and will be the focal point for coordination with local representatives from the interagency international organizations and ngos non governmental organizations at minimum each gfs must include at least one expeditionary warfare ship lpdlsdhsv highspeed vessel capable of serving as mothercommand ship to transport variety of riverine craft and helicoptersuavs mobile training teams seabees and materiel medical teams and limited security force this ship should also provide sufficient c4i limited medical facilities and configurable classroom space to sustain phase 0 operations throughout the region initially one or two ffgs frigates to be replaced by lcss littoral combat ships would provide limited nsfs naval surface fire support miovbss visit board search and seizure aaw antiair warfare and asw antisubmarine warfare support as well as the ability

will be built at the ingalls shipyard that forms part of ngss the lhar design is to have enhanced aviation features compared to the basic waspclass design but would lack well deck making it the first amphibious ship in decades built without well deck the sacrifice of the well deck appears to be in part at least consequence of building enhanced aviation features and other improvements into the

to purchase these five ships28 the owners of some of these 13 ships reportedly believed in 2005 that the navy underestimated the market value of their ships and that buying out the leases on them would cost at least 500 million more than the navy has budgeted29 potential issues for congress lpd17 cost growth and construction problems the lpd17 program has experienced considerable cost growth and construction problems cost growth the congressional budget office cbo testified in july 2007 that the first lpd17 experienced cost growth of about 70 and was on perton basis the most expensive amphibious ship ever built for the navy30 when lpd17 procurement began followon ships in the class were estimated to cost roughly 750 million each estimated procurement costs for the followon ships subsequently grew to figures between about 1200 million and about 1500 million the navy estimates the procurement cost of the ninth ship at 17983 million relatively small portion of the cost growth in the program since its inception is attributable to the decision to reduce the programs sustaining procurement rate from two ships per year to one ship per year most of the programs cost growth is attributable to other causes31 28 christopher j castelli pentagon seeks authority on carl vinson lhar prepositioning ships inside the navy may 2 2005 geoff fein navy underestimated cost to buyout

numerous construction deficiencies32 the ship was commissioned into service on january 14 2006 in april 2007 it was reported that the first lpd17 had thousands of construction deficiencies33 the navy accepted delivery of lpd17 with about 11 million hours of construction work remaining to be done on the ship this equates to about 87 of the total hours needed to build the ship and with material costs included about 7 of the total cost to build the ship the navy accepted delivery of lpd18 with about 400000 hours of construction work remaining to be done on the ship this equates to about 33 of the total hours needed to build the ship the navy projects that it will accept delivery of lpd19 with about 100000 hours of construction work remaining to be done on the ship this would equate to about 08 of the total hours needed to build the ship the navy states that it accepted lpd17 in incomplete condition for four reasons it permitted the fleet to begin sooner the process of evaluating lpd 17 through operational use so as to identify problems with the lpd 17 class design that need to be fixed in followon lpd17s it avoided further delays in giving the lpd17s crew an opportunity to

for 10934 million the lpd17 programs total cost was also reduced by 40378 million due to the reduction in program quantity from an originally planned total of 12 ships to the currently planned total

shipyard sooner and thereby mitigated schedule and cost impacts on other ships being built at the shipyard other lpd17s lhd8 and ddg51s that would have resulted from having lpd17 remain in the shipyard longer it reduced the cost of the remaining construction work to be done on lpd17 because the work in question could be performed by repair shipyards that charge lower rates for their work than the construction shipyard of the approximately 160 million in postdelivery work performed on lpd17 108 million was for the 11 million hours of construction work remaining to complete the ship the rest was for postshakedown and other work that normally occurs after ship is completed and delivered to the navy34 this 160 million in work was funded through the postdelivery part of the outfittingpostdelivery ofpd line item in the shipbuilding and conversion navy scn account since ofdp costs are not included in ship end cost the reported end cost of lpd17 will understate the ships actual construction cost by 108 million the navy plans to fund postdelivery construction work on lpd18 and lpd19 through the completion of prioryear shipbuilding line item in the scn account line item that is included in ship end cost the government accountability office gao testified in july 2007 that the navy moved forward with ambitious schedules for constructing lpd 17 and the littoral combat ship despite significant challenges in stabilizing the designs for these ships as result construction work has been performed out of sequence and significant rework has been required disrupting the optimal construction sequence and application of lessons learned for followon vessels in these programs in the lpd 17 program the navys reliance on an immature design tool led to problems that affected all aspects of the lead ships design without stable design work was often delayed from early in the building cycle to later during integration of the hull shipbuilders stated that doing the work at this stage could cost up to five times the original cost the lead ship in the lpd class was delivered to the warfighter incomplete and with numerous mechanical failures resulting in lower than promised level of capability these problems continue today 2 years after the navy accepted delivery of lpd 17 recent sea trials of the ship revealed problems with lpd 17s steering system reverse osmosis units shipwide area computing network and electrical system among other deficiencies navy inspectors noted that 138 of 943 ship spaces remained unfinished and identified number of safety

2007 it was reported that secretary of the navy donald winter had sent letter to the chairman and chief executive officer of northrop grumman ronald sugar dated june 22 2007 expressing deep concerns about ngsss performance particularly in connection with the lpd17 program according to these news reports winters letter contained the following statements among others although not necessarily in the order shown below i am deeply concerned about northrop grumman ship systems ngss ability to recover in the aftermath of hurricane katrina particularly in regard to construction of lpd 17 class vessels i am equally concerned about ngss ability to construct and deliver ships that conform to the quality standards maintained by the navy and that adhere to the cost and schedule commitments agreed upon at the outset by both ngss and the navy even prior to katrina ngsss performance was marginal resulting in significant cost overruns that forces the navy to take delivery of the lpd17 with numerous outstanding deficiencies ngss inefficiency and mismanagement of lpd 17 put the navy in an untenable position by taking delivery of ships with serious quality problems the fleet has suffered unacceptable delays in obtaining deployable assets twentythree months after commissioning of lpd 17 the navy still does not have missioncapable ship these delays create further problems as work must be completed or redone by other shipyards that are not as familiar with the ships design the navy also took delivery of lpd18 uss new orleans in an incomplete fashion albeit more complete than lpd17 persistent shortcomings at the ngss yards are troubling and causing not only grave concern about the lpd program but also the lha and ddg1000 programs the navy does not wish to find itself in the same

performance by other contractors inadequate program management and oversight by the navy hurricane katrina and other factors what specific actions have ngss other contractors and the navy taken and what additional actions do they plan to take to avoid further cost growth and construction problems in the lpd17 program although the navy in the past has accepted delivery of ships that were not complete has the navy previously accepted delivery of ship with one million or more hours of shipyard construction work remaining to be done and if so when funding additional ships in fy2008 potential key issue for congress in marking up the navys proposed fy2008 budget is whether to procure an additional lpd17 andor one or two modified takes in fy2008 as discussed earlier the additional lpd17 is not currently in the navys shipbuilding plan and the two modified takes are currently in the plan for procurement in fy2009 and fy2010 supporters of procuring an additional lpd17 in fy2008 could argue that this is the top item on the navys fy2008 upl and that building this ship would give the navy force of ten lpd17s as called for in the navys 313ship plan supporters could argue that if congress decides that it has the funding available in fy2008 but perhaps not in future year to procure an additional lpd17 it should procure the ship in fy2008 even if the shipyard is not able to start work on it right 38 andrea shalalesa northrop says katrina exacerbated ship problems reuters july 10 2007 crs21 away because the shipyard will eventually be able to build it and because what will matter more in the long run is the presence of this additional ship in the force structure not the fact that it took longer than average to build opponents of procuring an additional lpd17 in fy2008 could argue that unless the navys budget top line were increased the 1700 million or so needed to procure the ship might have to come from other fy2008 navy programs disrupting these other programs and possibly creating operational risks for the navy in other areas opponents could argue that the shipyard that would build this ship the avondale yard near new orleans that forms part of ngss would not be able to start work right away on an additional lpd17 procured in fy2008 due to disruption of the yards workforce and work schedule caused by hurricane katrina consequently opponents could argue procuring this ship in fy2008 would amount to booking but not immediately building ship such an action they could argue would tie up 1700 million in budget authority that would not result in immediate obligations and expenditures supporters of procuring one or two modified takes in fy2008 could argue that this is the second item on the navys fy2008 upl and that accelerating these two ships from fy2009 and fy2010 where they are currently planned into fy2008 could release funding in the navys fy2009 and fy2010 budgets for additional ships or other programs supporters could argue that funding one or both of these takes in fy2008 in addition to the regular take for navy use that is requested in the navys fy2008 budget could improve economies of scale for these ships reducing their costs opponents of procuring one or two modified takes in fy2008 could argue that unless the navys budget top line were increased the 1200 million or so needed to procure the ship might have to come from other fy2008 navy programs disrupting these other programs and possibly creating operational risks for the navy in other areas opponents could argue that the 1200 million cost listed in the fy2008 upl for these two ships suggests that procuring one or two modified takes in addition to the regular take being procured in fy2008 will not significantly reduce their cost estimated cost of two takes in fy2008 upl as mentioned above the navys fy2008 upl includes as its second item two modified takes for the mpff squadron at an estimated combined procurement cost of about 1200 million implying unit procurement cost of about 600 million per ship the regular take that the navy wants to procure in fy2008 has an estimated procurement cost of 4561 million the difference in unit procurement cost between the regular take and the two modified takes raises potential oversight question for congress why does the navy estimate that the two modified takes in the navys fy2008 upl would be approximately onethird more expensive to procure than the regular take that the navy wants to procure in fy2008 at may 3 2007 markup meeting of the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee the representative bartlett crs22 the subcommittees ranking member stated the following in connection with the subcommittees decision to recommend 456 million in fy2008 for the procurement of an additional take for the mpff squadron mr chairman as we discussed earlier this week i would ask that as we move forward we continue to refine funding for take i understand that while the mark in title iii in the national defense sealift fund fully funds the procurement cost for an additional take in fiscal year 2008 the actual cost of an additional take in 2008 may be 122 million 145 million greater than the amount provided in the mark this is due to additional post delivery and outfitting costs which are separate from procurement costs and also due to material cost escalations not reflected in the baseline budget request for the fiscal year 2008 ship39 adequacy of 30 or 31ship amphibious ship force the navy and marine corps currently appear to disagree on whether 30 or 31 ship amphibious force would be adequate the marine corps has testified that it would prefer 33ship force so as to support required total force of 30 operationally available ships ie ships not in depotlevel maintenance and repair at any given point for forcible entry the marine corps requirement is single simultaneouslyemployed two marine expeditionary brigade meb assault capability one meb requires seventeen amphibious warfare ships however given the fiscally constrained environment the navy and marine corps have agreed to assume risk by only using fifteen historical amphibious ship availability rates dictate minimum of eleven ships of each of the current types of amphibious ship minimum of thirtythree total ships resulting in battle force that provides thirty operationally available amphibious warfare ships in that battle force ten aviationcapable big deck ships lhalhdlhar and ten lpd 17 class ships are required to accommodate the mebs aviation combat element40 the navy has testified that when the capabilities of the mpff squadron which includes three amphibious assault ships are taken into account force of 30 amphibious ships one fewer than the 31 called for in the 313ship plan is adequate the ability of our future fleet to meet the demand signal for amphibious forces must be viewed in the aggregate given the cost of ships today we cannot discount the value of ships procured to support prepositioned equipment prepositioned assets must be included in the overall force availability equation ignoring mpff as the lift component of an additional meb is would be incongruous with todays fiscal environment the capabilities provided by the mpff mitigate concerns regarding the operational availability of the assault 39 opening

marine corps before the senate armed services committee on marine corps posture march 29 2007 p 24 italics and underlining as in the original crs23 echelon force required to deliver 20 marine expeditionary battalion meb lift vehicle square footage and passenger requirements as reflected in our 30 year shipbuilding plan we believe 30 amphibious ships will meet these requirements when supported by and supporting the mpff41 may 2007 press report states navy and marine corps officials are engaged in major debate about the kind of fleet the sea service will need in the future but senior leaders are pledging to resolve their differences the debate focuses on the number of amphibious ships that will be built in future years as well as plans for new vessels designed to create bases at sea marine commandant gen james conway and chief of naval operations adm michael mullen recently agreed to come to grips with these issues conway told inside the navy on may 2 noting both sides need to understand each others philosophies were going to meet on that he said weve got meeting coming up as soon as mike mullen can get with us the meeting will be the next step in the process he said mullen made similar remarks the next day at senate armed services seapower subcommittee hearing on capitol hill the admiral said he and conway agreed there is requirement to have 30 amphibious ships operationally available in the future based on past experience the services estimate 33 ships would be needed to ensure 30 are always available mullen said now thats how weve done it historically mullen said but the navys shipbuilding plan maintains only 30 amphibious vessels from fiscal year 2015 onward which has sparked complaints from conway mullen told senators he has committed to providing the marine corps with the lift capability it needs but he seemed to suggest alternatives to buying more amphibious ships weve got to look at how were going to fight in the future and specifically how were going to move this 20 ie marine expeditionary brigades into the fight mullen said gen conway and i have agreed to figure out way together to make that work the fixes could include achieving higher availability rate for ships some of which would depend on the warning time involved in particular situations mullen said 41 statement of admiral michael g mullen chief of naval operations before the senate armed services subcommittee on seapower may 3 2007 p 12 crs24 the admiral also said new maritime prepositioning ships mpff vessels designed to form sea bases could help move marines to the fight in the future but mpff has been contentious subject the marine corps has argued civilianmanned unarmed mpff ships cannot provide the forcibleentry capability associated with amphibious warships sorting through these issues will not be easy but the outcome will have very important implications for plans to build sea bases with mpff ships mullen said the cost of the mpff squadron which mullen called significant has been source of tension with the marine corps because the navy argues it cannot afford to develop mpff ships without buying fewer traditional amphibious ships which carry marine forces further unlike amphibious warships the mpff squadrons amphibious vessels will lack active selfdefense systems and will not be operated by navy sailors conway has publicly argued mpff vessels will not provide forcibleentry capabilities and should not be considered part of the traditional amphibious fighting force known as the assault echelon further officials have discussed the idea of having the bigdeck amphibious ships associated with mpff sail with other amphibious ships in the expeditionary strike force and not with the unarmed civilianmanned ships vice adm jonathan greenert deputy chief of naval operations for integration of capabilities and resources acknowledged this discussion late last month but did not say how the navy views the idea its an option he told inside the navy on april 24 following congressional hearing greenert declined to predict the outcome of the talks i cant tell you how its going to come out because were having the debate he said and its more of discussion than debate debate would imply that theres only two ways to solve this were sitting down and going through the capabilities in the aggregate42 potential oversight questions for congress include the following what are the potential operational risks of having force of 30 or 31 amphibious ships rather than 33 what steps can be taken to mitigate these risks 42 christopher j castelli conway and mullen seek to resolve debate on future fleet inside the navy may 7 2007 crs25 what are the operational risks of having 15 operational amphibious ships for each meb rather than 17 stability of amphibious and mpff force level goals perhaps reflecting the apparent disagreement between the navy and marine corps regarding the required size of the amphibious force the navy has suggested that it might change its required numbers of amphibious and mpff ships the navys february 2007 report on the 30year fy2008fy2037 shipbuilding plan stated future combat operations may require us to revisit many of the decisions reflected in this report including those associated with amphibious lift as the navy embarks on production of the maritime prepositioning force in this fydp the navy will continue to analyze the utility of these ships in terms of their contribution to and ability to substitute for the assault echelon forces in the navys future battleforce inventory the current force represents the best balance between these forces available today however changing world events and resulting operational risk associated with the various force structure elements that make up these two components of overall lift will be analyzed to ensure the navy is not taking excessive risk in lift capability and capacity while there needs to be balance between expeditionary and prepositioning ships for meeting the overall lift requirement future reports may adjust the level of support in one or both of these solutions any adjustments made in these capabilities will have to be accommodated in light of the resources available and could require the navy to commit additional funding to this effort in order to support the overall balance of our shipbuilding program43 potential oversight questions for congress include the following when might the navy know whether it wants to change its required numbers of amphibious andor mpff ships how might these numbers change how much confidence can congress have in the stability of the navys current stated requirements for amphibious and mpff ships should congress take actions to hedge against the possibility of the navy changing its requirements for amphibious and mpff ships and if so what actions crewing of largedeck mpff ships the navy and marine corps have not yet determined what combination of civilian mariners and navy personnel will be used to crew the three largedeck 43 us navy report to congress on annual longrange plan for construction of naval

decks as naval auxiliaries usns manned with 100 civilian crew but develop the capability to timely and seamlessly convert them to warships uss in order to employ them during an international armed conflict the other option is to designate the big decks as warships uss upon initial commissioning and man them with mixed militarycivilian crews regardless of option when operating as warship the platforms will need navy commanding officer and selected senior staff this requirement may be met by mariners who are in the navy reserve ship crew not engaged in warfighting functions may remain civilian mariners performing propulsion ship auxiliaries and housekeeping type operations with both options the other ships in the squadron due to their roles and logistics centric activities may be permanently designated as usns throughout their employment precedence has been established for selected capabilities by ships such as the usns stockham and uss mount whitney44 potential oversight questions for congress include the following what are the potential cost and operational implications of manning options for the largedeck amphibious assault ships in the mpff squadron when do the navy and marine corps anticipate making decision on the manning strategy for these ships clarity of sea basing concept the february 2007 report to congress on the mpff program refers to sea basing as an emerging concept45 some observers have expressed concern about lack of clarity regarding the meaning of sea basing and consequently about what kinds of shipbuilding and other programs are needed to implement it for example robert work naval analyst at the center for strategic and budgetary assessments csba an independent defensepolicy research institute states the following in lengthy report on sea basing released in november 2006 seabasing is new defense buzzword of growing importance and prominence in both joint and naval circles unfortunately despite the increasingly common use of the term by both joint and naval planners alike there 44 report to congress maritime prepositioning force future or mpff program op cit p 14 45 report to congress maritime prepositioning force future or mpff program op cit p 2 crs27 still remains much mystery and misunderstanding about this important new concept indeed one of the key problems that has hindered meaningful debate and discussion about seabasing and especially the priorities revealed in its associated plans and programs is that its contemporary definition and the important ideas that support it are poorly understood except among the relatively small group of officers and planners who have been intimately involved with their development to make matters worse since its grand unveiling by the department of the navy don in 2002 the concepts definition has constantly changed for example in august 2005 the seabasing joint integrating concept jic defined seabasing as the rapid deployment assembly command projection reconstitution and reemployment of joint combat power from the sea while providing continuous support sustainment and force protection to select expeditionary joint forces without reliance on land bases within the joint operations area joa these capabilities expand operational maneuver options and facilitate assured access and entry from the sea however in the very month the seabasing jic was published the dod dictionary of military and associated terms amended through august 31 2005 defined seabasing as in amphibious operations technique of basing certain landing force support functions aboard ship which decreases shorebased presence moreover as is explained in this report both of these definitions and others like them are unduly restrictive incomplete confusing or all of these things partly as result there remains much uncertainty over exactly what seabasing is and over the current programmatic and budgetary direction of joint seabasing programs the current definition for seabasing and the direction of its programs are narrowly focused on one thing revitalizing the dons seabased operational maneuver and seabased expeditionary powerprojection capabilities which were allowed atrophy during the cold war the list of seabasing functions is much longer only if all of these seabasing functions are understood and compared can rational prioritization of planned seabasing improvements occur although seabasing concept development within both the department of the navy and the department of defense dod is focused on seabased operational maneuver and expeditionary powerprojection capabilities its disjointed development since the end of the cold war has only served to confuse an urgently needed open debate and discussion about the future of naval maneuver in general and amphibious operations in particular and the best mix of platforms to support both central to this debate is whether or not future forcible entry operations from the sea should be conducted from amphibious warships or commercialstandard mpff ships or combination of both and whether or not these operations should emphasize surface maneuver aerial maneuver or combination of the two the current understanding of both these issues need to be thoroughly questioned and reviewed46 january 8 2008 defense trade press article states 46 robert work thinking about seabasing all ahead slow washington csba 2006 pp iiiv crs28 the navy and marine corps have spent the past year working to better define the requirement for sea base operations looking at platform needs and how best to move warfighters and their equipment from ship to shore marine corps official said the cornerstone of the sea basing effort is the navys maritime preposition force future or mpff we learned lot in the last year in developing the requirement maj gen thomas benes director expeditionary warfare told defense daily in recent interview the two services took step back and spent lot more time reviewing the mpff he added we needed to define the requirement little bit more between the two services and we did that there is alignment between the commandant gen james conway and the cno chief of naval operations adm gary roughead they definitely understand and have given us guidance as to where we need to develop this benes said mpff is now going to be reinforcing capability to deliver meb marine expeditionary brigade from sea base47 affordability and costeffectiveness of sea basing one issue in assessing the cost of the sea basing concept concerns the accuracy of the navys procurement cost estimate for the newconstruction sea basing ships if these estimates turn out to be too low the sea basing concept would be more difficult to afford navy ship construction costs in recent years have risen more quickly than some anticipated several recent navy ships procured in recent years have turned out to be more expensive to build than the navy originally projected48 cbo believes the navy is currently underestimating the procurement cost of proposed ships49 in addition as previously discussed fully implementing the sea basing concept will involve procuring connector ships as well as research and development work to develop supporting sea basing technologies the costs of these development and procurement efforts are currently unclear making it difficult to assess the potential overall affordability of the sea basing concept 47 geoff fein navy marine corps gaining better understanding of sea basing requirements defense daily january 8 2008 48 see for example government

senior analyst on the navys 2008 shipbuilding plan and key ship programs before the subcommittee on seapower and expeditionary forces committee on armed services us house of representatives july 24 2007 crs29 although sea basing offers potential advantages in terms of eliminating vulnerable intermediate land bases enabling higherpaced operations ashore and permitting more rapid reconstitution and redeployment of the expeditionary force uncertainty regarding the total potential cost to implement sea basing makes it difficult to assess its potential costeffectiveness compared to alternative concepts for conducting future expeditionary operations ashore or compared to programs for meeting other unrelated defense priorities potential alternative concepts for conducting future expeditionary operations include making improvements to todays capabilities for conducting amphibious operations and making improvements to army capabilities for inserting airborne forces50 skeptics of the navys plan for implementing the sea basing concept could argue that the capability to be provided by the mpff squadron is more than what is needed for the navys contribution to the global war on terrorism gwot and of uncertain relevance to us participation in conflict with china in the taiwan strait area51 navy and marine officials disagree with this view see discussion below navy perspective regarding the affordability of the mpff squadron the february 2007 navy report on the mpff program states the mpff squadron will be affordable over its lifecycle research development acquisition operation and maintenance costs doctrine organization training materiel leadership and education personnel and facilities dotmlpf cost will be considered life cycle cost reduction will be stressed in the development of the one new design the mlp to ensure long term value to the navy and marine corps the navys independent cost estimating arm navsea code 017 led all aoa analysis of alternatives and post aoa cost analyses and produced all comparative cost estimates using approved navy and dod cost estimating practices the threshold and objective values below represent more affordable prepositioned lift and delivery of warfighting capability than other alternatives with the same or similar capability52 navy and marine corps officials argue that seabasing is relevant to spectrum of potential future operations ranging from humanitarian and disasterrelief operations to stability operations and major combat operations mcos in support of this argument they note the recent use of us naval forces in providing disaster 50 see also john p patch sea basing chasing the dream us naval institute proceedings may 2005 3843 51 for more discussion of these two issues see crs report rs22373 navy

prospective ability to expressed concerns about the navys potential ability to afford desired numbers of both mpff ships and ships for the regular amphibious force54 july 2007 cbo study compared the potential costs and capabilities of eight alternatives for deploying andor sustaining ground combat forces the navys proposed mpff squadron referred to in the cbo report as alternative e1 and seven other approaches the report states five of the alternatives would include some form of base at sea the other three would deliver forces and supplies by aircraft to examine the potential benefits of new technologies four of the alternatives would develop new systems rotorcraft able to carry greater payload of passengers and cargo and with longer range than existing rotorcraft and large airships with greater payloads than conventional aircraft the eight alternatives are grouped into two sets of four the first group of four alternatives e1 through e4 could both employ one brigade and sustain two brigades the second group of four alternatives s1 through s4 could only sustain two brigades that were already in place although the alternatives are generally structured to employ andor sustain ground forces that are similar in size their specific capabilities would vary considerably cbos analysis of those alternatives points to several general conclusions the planned mpff would provide capability similar to todays amphibious task forces but with improved responsiveness mebsized force could be ready one to two weeks earlier for conflict in the persian gulf or indian ocean region and with much smaller logistics presence required ashore alternative systems could provide lesser but still substantial improvements in capability at significantly lower cost than that of the mpff for example although alternative e3 adding seabased logistics to amphibious task forces would not improve response time it would offer most of the logistics improvements expected from the mpff but at less than onefifth of the cost 53 see for example geoff fein relief efforts in gulf demonstrate sea basing capability cno says inside the navy october 7 2005 nathan hodge marine corps commandant stumps for

achieving greater capabilities than those currently envisioned for the mpff would probably require significantly higher investment either larger numbers of systems or new more capable and therefore more expensive systems the alternatives examined by cbo in this study would satisfy the primary objectives of the third andor fourth of the joint chiefs of staff sea basing joint integrating concepts or jics lines of operation employment and sustainment respectively alternatives e1 through e4 are structured to provide shiptoshore delivery capacity sufficient to employ marine expeditionary brigade in 8 to 10 hours and to deliver enough supplies per day by aircraft to support the meb plus an army light brigade alternatives s1 through s4 are structured to deliver enough supplies per day by aircraft to sustain those two types of brigades the extent to which the alternatives meet the performance objectives for the jics other lines of operation varies55 csba perspective robert work of csba characterized sea basing in 2004 as rich mans approach to solving the access denial problem56 in his november 2006 report on sea basing work states that seabasing programs are being conceived of and pursued long before the full range of desired and possible joint seabasing capabilities have been adequately explored and debated the end result current seabasing plans are rather narrowly focused on two rather limited capabilities landing single brigade on hostile shore in 11 to 17 days from the go order and thereafter providing seabased logistical support for two early entry brigades until followon joint forces arrive it is true that these two key capabilities reflect the top level requirements identified in the aforementioned seabasing jic however these two capabilities reflect view of seabasing that rests upon questionable assumptions and analysis57 potential oversight questions potential oversight and policy questions for congress include the following if the procurement costs of the newconstruction ships in the proposed mpff squadron turn out to be higher than the navy estimates how might this affect the affordability of the sea basing concept when does dod intend to present to congress an estimate of the potential total cost to fully implement all aspects of the sea basing concept how does the current absence of such an estimate affect congresss ability to assess the potential affordability of sea basing or its potential cost effectiveness compared to potential alternatives 55 congressional budget office sea basing and alternatives for deploying and sustaining ground forces july 2007 ix 56 as quoted in otto kreisher sea basing air force magazine july 2004 material in brackets as in the article 57 thinking about seabasing all ahead slow op cit p iv crs32 for conducting future expeditionary operations ashore or compared to programs for meeting other defense priorities what is the potential applicability of the capability to be provided by the mpff squadron to the gwot or to other potential conflict or nonconflict scenarios would an ability to employ one surface marine battalion and one vertical marine battalion from sea base in period of 8 to 10 hours be worth the cost to field this capability what are the potential costs and merits of alternatives to sea basing for conducting future expeditionary operations ashore how do land bases and sea bases compare in terms of vulnerability to attack and cost to defend against potential attacks of various kinds what other defense programs might need to be reduced to finance the implementation of sea basing what are the potential operational risks of not implementing sea basing relationship to global fleet station gfs concept another potential oversight issue for congress concerns the global fleet station gfs concept and its relationship to the form of sea basing to be implemented with the planned mpff squadron potential oversight questions for congress include the following since the navy has stated that each of potential total of five gfss might be built around an lpd or lsdtype amphibious ship or around highspeed vessel hsv how might implementing the gfs concept affect planned deployments and forcestructure requirements for these kinds of ships what is the relationship between the gfs concept and the form of sea basing to be implemented with the mpff squadron can the gfs concept be viewed as sea basing light how might the existence of up to five gfss in various regions affect requirements for the planned mpff squadron or for the ships that are to make up that squadron is the navy proposing the gfs with the partial aim or hope that the concept will eventually take the place in navy planning of the mpffbased notion of sea basing coordination with other services on sea basing regarding interservice coordination in the development of sea basing the february 2007 navy report on the mpff program states joint force requirements are included and validated via the joint capabilities integration and development system jcids process the mpff cdd capability development document has been introduced and fully vetted crs33 to the joint community within jcids which will result in joint requirement oversight council jroc review in march 2007 additionally the mpff cdd provides traceability to the emerging seabasing concept and to associated capability gaps the seabasing capabilities based assessment functional needs assessment has identified capability gaps jroc approved november 6 200658 january 2007 government accountability office gao report states while dod has taken action to establish joint seabasing capability it has not developed comprehensive management approach to guide and assess joint seabasing gaos prior work showed that sound management practices for developing capabilities include involving top leadership dedicating an implementation team and establishing communications strategy dod is developing joint seabasing concept and various dod organizations are sponsoring seabasing initiatives however dod has not provided sufficient leadership to guide joint seabasing development and service initiatives are outpacing dods analysis of joint requirements dod also has not established an implementation team to provide daytoday management to ensure joint seabasing receives the focused attention needed so that efforts are effective and coordinated also dod has not fully developed communications strategy that shares information among the organizations involved in seabasing without comprehensive management approach containing these elements dod may be unable to coordinate activities and minimize redundancy among service initiatives dod has not developed joint experimentation campaign plan although many seabasing experimentation activities including war games modeling and simulation and live demonstrations have taken place across the services combatant commands and other defense entities overarching joint seabasing experimentation plan exists to guide these efforts because the us joint forces command has not taken the lead in coordinating joint seabasing experimentation although it has been tasked with developing biennial joint experimentation campaign plan for future joint concepts while the us joint forces command is in the process of developing the plan it is unclear the extent to which this plan will address joint seabasing or will be able to guide joint seabasing experimentation efforts without plan to direct experimentation dod and the services ability to evaluate solutions coordinate efforts and disseminate results could be compromised while service development efforts tied to seabasing are approaching milestones for investment decisions it is unclear when dod will complete development of total ownership cost estimates for range of joint seabasing options joint seabasing is going through capabilitiesbased assessment process that is intended to produce preliminary cost estimates for seabasing options however dod has not yet begun the specific study that will identify potential approaches including changes to doctrine and training as well as material solutions and produce preliminary cost estimates dod officials expect the study will not be complete for year or more meanwhile the services are actively pursuing variety of seabasing initiatives some of which are approaching milestones which will guide future program investments until total 58 report to congress maritime prepositioning force future or mpff program op cit p 16 crs34 ownership cost estimates for joint seabasing options are developed and made transparent to dod and congress decision makers will not be able to evaluate the costeffectiveness of individual service initiatives59 robert works november 2006 report on sea basing states that under circumstances should seabasing be viewed as naval concept that enables joint operations as maritime concept and key component of emerging forms of joint littoral warfare marked by the widespread use of guided weapons seabasing initiatives should be prioritized and pursued by joint organization therefore the 2004 decision by the office of the secretary of defense osd not to stand up joint project office for seabasing and to instead consign the concept to the new joint concept integration and development system process was serious mistake one only compounded by assigning the navy to be the lead agent for the seabasing joint integrating concept observations developed throughout this report suggest that osd should order thorough zero baseline review of the joint seabasing concept this review should take its basic guidance from the 2005 national defense strategy and the 200506 quadrennial defense review these two documents provide guidance that is broad enough to facilitate thorough and independent zero baseline seabasing review that is free of any preconceived notions or concepts in this regard while such review should consider all concept work and program definitions to date it is important that the review be in way constrained by them in this regard osd should not make the same mistake it made in 2002 when it directed the defense science task force on seabasing to use an existing naval seabasing concept as its start point it should instead direct the group conducting the review either newly formed joint project office on seabasing or group composed of retired combatant commanders to start from clean sheet of paper and to recommend the seabasing program with the highest joint payoff in the 21st century60 an october 2005 press article stated cultural differences between the services are one of the stumbling blocks holding up development of the us navys new sea basing concept former officer told group of industry representatives here last week greg cook us air force colonel who retired in august after working to develop sea basing plans and concepts for the joint chiefs of staff said the rolesandmissions debate centered on how different services and commands viewed the idea of squadron of large ships gathered as an operating base about 100 miles off an enemy shore 59 government

future naval planning if the air force operates from the sea isnt that what the navy does cook said the services view the sea basing concept in light of their own traditional missions the army looks at the idea as allowing for faster and greater strategic access via the highspeed shallowdraft connectors to transfer troops vehicles and gear between the ships and shore the air force doesnt see the concept as supporting its core competencies and is concerned about costs said cook former pilot for that services air mobility command the air force is not that excited about the idea he said the navy he said looks at sea basing as foundation of strategic access and power projection but the marine corps is looking at it simply as faster means to deliver marine expeditionary brigade to the fight special operations command sees it as highspeed mothership for rapid access while joint commanders have wider view regarding it as mobile base that provides options and flexibility that increases global presence and provides strategic access these things have to be worked out cook said the question of who should operate the ships is another issue he said61 potential oversight questions for congress include the following to what degree if any does the navymarine corps concept for sea basing conflict with emerging army or air force concepts of operation for conducting future expeditionary operations are the navy and marine corps taking potential army air force and special operations command requirements sufficiently into account in developing the sea basing concept how might the armys

numbers of amphibious ships and the option of procuring tenth lpd17 class ship the report states the budget request for fiscal year 2008 included funding for the ninth ship of the uss san antonio lpd17 class amphibious ship program the secretary of the navys 2007 report to congress on the longrange plan for construction of naval vessels calls for below threshold expeditionary warfare force specifically the plan would reduce expeditionary force size including reduction in the lpd17 class from total of 12 to 9 ships the committee is concerned that this plan does not provide the total

2005 2006 and 2007 marine corps leadership stated that class of 10 lpd17 ships was required to meet marine corps forcible entry requirements with acceptable risk the chief of naval operations has identified procurement of tenth lpd17 ship in 2008 as the navys top unfunded priority the committee is aware that construction for tenth lpd17 ship would not commence until fiscal year 2009 but

fund ndsf for various research and development activities including 678 million for the maritime prepositioning force future mpff this amount includes 49 million for amphibious assault replacement ships which are to be assigned to the mpff designated mpff lhar the navys concept for mpff operations indicates that these ships will be multimission vessels capable of afloat prepositioning sea basing operations in support of amphibious assault and routine operations in support of lesser contingencies mpff ships are planned to be operated by military sealift command crew however the mpff concept of operations differs sharply from current maritime prepositioning ships as result of the mpff contribution to the navys sea basing capability the mpff role to embark and deploy marines ashore while sustaining expeditionary warfare operations potentially exposes these ships and embarked marines to hostile fire the navy plans to protect the mpff ships through employment of the naval sea shield and therefore the navy does not plan to outfit mpff ships with self defense features the committee has expressed concern regarding the navys mpff survivability concept and in particular the navys proposal to eliminate the self defense features for the mpff lhar the restoration of the ships combat system would allow the mpff lhar to fill current shortfalls to the navys forcible entry lift capability the committee is aware that the department of the navy is continuing to review the military features for the mpff and that the navy expects to present the program plan to the joint requirements oversight council jroc later in fiscal year 2007 accordingly the committee directs the secretary of defense to submit report to the congressional defense committees within 30 days of the jroc mpff decision outlining the findings of the jroc the report shall include detailed vulnerability assessment of mpff for major combat operations the committee has been advised by the navy that the department of the navy will need to rephase into fiscal year 2009 certain mpff research and development efforts therefore the committee recommends decrease of 300 million for mpff research and development furthermore the committee does not agree with funding development and procurement for amphibious assault ships within the ndsf this ship type is specifically not included within the scope of sealift vessels eligible for ndsf defined within section 2218 of title 10 united states code therefore the committee recommends decrease of 49 million in pe 48042n and corresponding increase of 49

dock ship this ship is the final lpd17 class ship that the navy has in the budget the committee notes that the 313 ship fleet that the navy has stated as goal requires ten san antonio class ships and that this tenth ship was the highest priority listed on the navys unfunded priority list in an effort to achieve stability in the navys shipbuilding program by increasing throughput and helping the navy meet its stated requirement for lpd17 class ships the committee provides an additional 1700000000 for the procurement of tenth san antonio class amphibious transport dock ship page 228 regarding

the committee provides 1866110000 for the procurement of 3 additional take ships which is 1410000000 above the request in addition to providing stability this effort satisfies the second highest priority on the navys unfunded priority list this increase will allow the navy to buy out the take requirement for the maritime prepositioned force future while at the same time promoting stability to the construction yard and subvendors and achieving volume efficiencies page 390 senate the senate appropriations committee in its report srept 110155 of september 14 2007 on hr 3222 recommended approving the navys request for fy2008 procurement funding for the lpd17 and lha6 programs the committees report states the committee fully supports the cnos chief of naval operations goal of 313 ship navy as minimum requirement for the nation the committee however has serious concerns with the navys ability to deliver on the current shipbuilding program of record the navys track record for building ships on time and on budget has not been good the government accountability office gao has recently pointed out that the ships under construction at the beginning of the current fiscal year have experienced cumulative cost growth of almost crs41 5000000000 above their original budgets significant cost growth schedule delay or both have occurred in the lpd17 program littoral combat ship lcs program the take program as well as the nextgeneration destroyer and aircraft carrier programs while supportive of additional funding for shipbuilding the committee is very concerned that accelerating any of the current shipbuilding programs is unexecutable and would have the effect of just banking funds naval shipbuilding has been plagued with too frequent design changes requirements creep poor cost estimating and poor government performance in program management and contractor oversight under staffing of critical government oversight functions has also been major problem for the navy the committee believes that the acquisition changes proposed by current navy leadership is movement in the right direction however the committee would like to see some positive results in cost schedule and performance of the current program of record before supporting significant increases to the shipbuilding account page 133 conference the conference report hrept 110434 of november 6 2007
