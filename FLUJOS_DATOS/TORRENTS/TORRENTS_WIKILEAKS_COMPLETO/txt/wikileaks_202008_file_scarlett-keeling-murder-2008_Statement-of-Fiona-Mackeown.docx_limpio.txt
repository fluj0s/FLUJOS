statement of fiona mackeown 13th march 2008 my daughter has been victim of nexus between powerful criminals and some officers of the goa police the arrest of two petty criminals to my mind is certainly not completion of the investigations i do not have the resources or the strength to identify the powers behind this visible nexus but i hope the media and the the govt of india do investigate to get to the bottom of this nexus to my mind the case has neither been solved nor shall be solved by the goa police the events so far are just an extension of the original cover up by the police
