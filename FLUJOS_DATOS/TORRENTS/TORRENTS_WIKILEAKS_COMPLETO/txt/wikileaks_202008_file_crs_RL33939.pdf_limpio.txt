of the senate that are agreed to without objection by the chambers memb ership fundamental to the management of the contemporary senate these devices are typically employed to structure floor proceedings and to expedite the chambers business two general types of unanimous consent permeate senate operations simple and complex1 both types set aside the rules precedents or orders of the senate via the unanimous concurrence of all senators simple unanimous consen t request addr esses routine matters such as dispensing with quorum ca lls or requesting that certain staff aides have floor privileges to be sure there are occasions when simple unanimous consent request can have policy consequences such as an objection to setting aside an amendment or dispensing with the reading of an amendment simple unanimous consent requests have been used since the first congress for example senate rule adopted on april 16 1789 stated every bill shall receive three readings prior to its being passed and the president of the senate shall give notice at each whether it be first second or third which readings shall be on three different days unless the senate unanimously directs otherwise the focus of this report is on the complex variety their historical origin some benchmarks in their evolution and how th ey came to be reflected in the senates rulebook complex agreements establish tailormade procedure for virtually anything taken up by the senate such as bills joint resolutions concurrent resolutions simple resolutions amendments nominations treatie s or conference reports as two senate parliamentarians wrote there is fundamental difference between the senate operating under unanimous consent agreement and the senate operating under the standing rules whereas the senate rules permit virtually unlimited debate and very fewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33939crs2 2 floyd m riddick and alan frumin senate procedure precedents and practices washington gpo 1992 p 1311

senate burdett loomis continuedrestrictions on the right to offer amendments these agreements usually limit time for debate and the right of senators to offer amendments2 senators generally accept the debate and amendment restrictions common to most unanimous consent agreements larg ely for two overlapping reasons they facilitate the processing of the senates workload and they serve the interests of individual lawmakers based on trust and reached after often protracted negotiations unanimous consent agreemen ts are the equivalent of binding contracts that can only be changed or modified by unanimous consent origins it is not clear when the senate actua lly began to employ unanimous consent agreements to limit debate or to fix time for vote on measure perhaps the first instance occurred in the mid1840s on march 24 1846 senato r william allen d oh stated that the senate had been debating joint resolution concerning the oregon territory for more than two months and it was now time to proceed to final vote on the matter noting that the senate neither allowed for the previous question motion employed in the house to end debate nor adopted re solutions directing that vote should occur at specific time senator allen pointed out that it was the senates habit to have conversational understa nding that an end would be put to protracted debate at particular time3 senate colleague suggested that allen delay several days before making such request two days later senator allen again asked that the senate informally agree to fix definite day on which the vote might be taken4 the senate he said should simply refuse to adjourn until there is final vote action occurred on allens recommendation on april 13 1846 howev er consensus developed among senators that final vote on the joint resolution should occur three days later finally after spending ar ound 65 days debating the matte r the senate on april 16 enacted the joint resolution indeed if this was the first time that the senate employed something like unanimous c onsent agreement to end debate and precipitate vote on measure there is little question that these accords became both more commonly used and more sophisti cated in their pro cedural features by 1870 noted two scholars unanimous consent agreements were being used with some frequency these early unanimous consent agreements were as they are today timelimitation agreements that provided for the disposal of measure by specified time5 an april 24 1879 exchange illustrates the practical use of thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33939crs3 5 continued ed

21 aug 26 1890 p 9144 9 gamm and smith p 127accords for limiting debate and setting th time for vote the exchange is reminiscent of what occurs in todays senate the president pro tempore the chair will once more state the proposition and again ask the senate whether there be any objection to it the proposition is that at three oclock tomorrow all debate on this bill shall cease and the senate shall then proceed to vote upon the pending amendment or amendments that may be offered and finally on the bill itself without debate mr conkling that is right the president pro tempore is there objection to that understanding the chair hears none and it is agreed to6 bill managers apparently took the in itiative in propounding unanimous consent agreements their increasing use in subs equent decades led one senator roger mills dtx to complain that the senate reaches its vote on all questions like the historic diet of poland by the unanimous agreement of the whole and not by the act of the majority7 other issues associated with these early accords also sowed confusion among the membership many of the complaints stemmed from the fact that the early unanimous consent agreements were often viewed as an arrangement simply between gentlemen and could as president pro tempore once said be violated with impunity by any member of the senate8 to reduce the confusion the senate adopted new rule the 1914 senate rule rule xii the fundamental objective of rule xii was to clarify veral uncertainties associated with these senato rial contracts in the ear ly 1900s the senate took modest steps to reduce some of the confusi on associated with unanimous consent agreements such as requiri ng these accords to be submitted in writing to the desk read to the chamber and printed on the title page of the daily calendar of business as long as they were operative9 more changes were in the offing however two overlapping factors explain why the senate agreed to formal rules change to govern these accords first there we re couple of ambiguities ssociated with these accords that continued to arouse contention and confusion past precedents simply did not adequately address these recurring probl ems second riveting event senator was caught by surprise when unanimous consent agreement was entered into underscored the need for form rule rule xii to clear up issues associated with these gentlemens agreements httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33939crs4 10 congressional record vol 29 mar 3 1897 p 2729 11 congressional record vol 42 jan 10 1907 p 878 12 congressional record vol 49 dec 6 1913 p

the matter of ambiguity there were two principal issues first could these agreements be changed or modified by another unanimous consent agreement second could the presiding officer enfor ce these accords today both principles are accepted as procedural givens not so several decades ago for example on march 3 1897 senator george hoar rma stated i think it is very serious indeed under any circumstances to set the precedent of revoking unanimous consent agreement by other unanimousconsent agreements10 as another example one of the senates institutional leaders henry cabot lodge rma argued if it is to be supposed that unanimousconsent ag reements are to be modified we shall soon find it impossible to get unanimousc onsent agreement i think nothing is more important than the rigidity with wh ich the senate preser ves unanimousconsent agreements11 or as senator joseph ogorman dny stated has it not been established by the precedents of this body that unanimousconsent agreement could not be impaired or modified either by another unanimousconsent agreement or by an order of the senate12 to be sure other senators contended that these compacts could be modified by anothe r unanimous consent agreement as to the enforcement of these acco rds presiding officers took different positions as one presiding officer observed it has been the universal ruling of the chair that the chair can not enforce unanimousconsent agreement but that it must rest with the honor of senators themselves13 on another occasion the president of the senate asked what is the pleasure of the senate whether he shall enforce the agreements entered into by unanimous c onsent or not senator john sherman r oh replied that the chair should enforce the agreement with respect to the bill under consideration the chair then aske d in similar cases what is the pleasure of the senate senator eu gene hale rme provided th is answer well cross that bridge when we reach it14 contrarily vice presidents charles fairbanks and james sherman were not timid about enforcing unanimous consent agreements at times15 sundry other issues were so associated with thes compacts for example senators argued about whether moti on to recommit bill violated unanimous consent agreement to vote on the bill16 some senators said that if they were not present when unanimous consent agr eement was proposed colleagues could object for them in response senator thomas ma rtin va the ostensib democratic floor leader stated when unanimous consent is asked unless objection is made from

kern portrait of floor leader in first among equals outs tanding senate leaders of the twentieth century richard baker and roger davids on eds washington cq press 1991 pp 810 it is notable that the adopti on of senate rule xii in 1914 corresponds to the general time period when the position of floor leader formally emerged in the senate rule xii provided the floor leader with an important procedural tool to manage the chambers business 18 congressional record vol 49 jan 10 and 11 1913 pp 13241329 13541357 1388 1395 19 congressional record vol 51 jan 16 1914 p 1757floor of the senate by sena tor who is present he can not leave his vote here to be recorded against it the senate can not do business by proxy that way17 the surprise factor senator reed smoot rut was caught offguard when unanimous consent agreement he opposed was agreed to the issue involved 1913 bill s 4043 to prohibit interstate commerce in intoxicatin g liquors unanimous consent agreement was properly made and announced by the pr esiding officer senator smoot who was present in the chamber had planned to object but was momentarily distracted and failed to lodge timely dissent for the next two days the senate debated the legitimacy of the unanimous consent agreement and whether it could be modified by another unanimous consent agreement in the end the presiding officer submitted the question of legitimacy to the senate which voted 40 to 17 with 37 members not voting to instruct the chair to resubmit the unanimous consent agreement to the senate when this was done senator smoot objected to the accord quickly another unanimous consent agreement on the liquor bill was propounded by senator jacob gallinger rnh and it was accepted by the senate18 rule xii in short uncertainties and controvers ies influenced the senate on january 16 1914 to dopt formal rule to govern unanimous consent agreements there was relatively little debate on rule xii the major cont roversy involved whether these compacts could be modified by nother unanimous consent agreement unsurprisingly senator lodge argued against the new rule on the ground that to permit any subsequent changes to unanimous consent agreements would only lead to delays in expediting the senates business senator charles thomas dco responded it seems to the most illogical thing in the world to say that the senate of the united states can unanimously agree to something and by that act deprive itself of the power to agree unanimously to undo it19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33939crs6 20 the relevant part clause 4 of senate rule xii states request by senator for unanimous consent for the taking of final vote on specified date upon the passage of bill or joint resolution shall be submitted to the senate for agreement thereto til after quorum call ordered for the purpose by the presid ing officer it shall be disclosed that quorum of the senate is present and when nimous consent is thus given the same shall operate as the order of the senate but any unanimous consent may be revoked by another unanimous consent granted in the manner prescribed above on one days notice 21 riddick and frumin senate procedure p 1312by vote of 51 to 8 the senate adopted rule xii20 two critical portions of the rule stipulate that 1 unanimous consent agreements are orders of the senate which means that the presiding officer is charged with enforcing their terms and 2 the senate by unanimous consent could chan ge unanimous consent agreement as orders of the senate nimous consent agreements are now printed in the senate journal they are also printed in the senates daily calendar of business as noted earlier and the congressional record modern practice in subsequent decades the senate witnessed increasing use of unanimous consent agreements the contemporary senate regularly operates via the terms of unanimous consent agreements they are used on every type of measure or matter that comes before the sena and at least since the postworld war ii period all party leaders and floor managers have ex tensively relied on them to process the chambers business during the major ity leadership of senator lyndon johnson d tx 19551960 unanimous consent agreemen ts were often comprehensive in scope eg identifying when measure is to be taken up when it is to be voted upon for final passage and what procedures apply inbetween these two stages conclusion today in period of heightened i ndividualism and partisanship unanimous consent agreements tend to be piecemeal such as establishing debate limits on number of discrete amendments wit hout limiting the number of amendments or specifying time or date for final passage of the legislation still compared with the compacts promulgated during the early 1900s todays accords are often broader in scope more complex and involve more procedural detail large body of precedents has even evolved to govern how unanimous consent agreements are to be interpreted and applie d in various situations21 in short unanimous consent agreements are essential to the processing of the senates workload and protecting the procedural prerogatives of individual senators
