within the boundaries of national monuments as they were on january 20 2001 except where allowed by the presiden tial proclamations that created the monuments supporters of this language f eared that

section 1003 of the alaska national interest lands conserva tion act anilca pl 96487 currently prohibits leasing or other development leading to production of oil and gas on anwr lands which were then known as the arctic national wildlife range unless authorized by congress thus the committees report language generally was viewed as barring the use of funds for preleasing studies and other preliminary work related to oil and gas drilling in anwr the report of the senate committee on appropriations did not contain this prohibition conferees on the fy2003 interior appropria tions bill included language in the joint explanatory statement stating that th ey do not concur with the house proposal concerning funding for the energy and min erals program this change from the house report language has been interpreted by some as potentially making available funds for preliminary work re lated to development in anw r however as notedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31306crs10 the prohibition contained in anilca remains in effect so the ability to use money in the bill may not be clear with respect to particular preleasing activities grazing the fy2003 interior appropriati ons law provides for the automatic renewal of grazing permits and leases that expire are transferred or waived during fy2003 and that were issued by the secret ary of the interior or the secretary of agriculture the automatic renewal continues until the permit renewal process is completed under applicable laws and regulations including any necessary environmental analyses the terms and conditions in expiring permits or leases would continue under the new permit or leas until the renewal pr ocess is completed except for certain agriculture permits under the senate bill provision in previous appropriations laws contained similar language for the secretary of the interior but not for the secretary of agri culture this contr oversial provision was advocated as necessary to address heavy ag ency workloads

with indian tribes the consultation process took place during much of 2002 through joint tribaldoi trust reform task force the great majority of commenting tribes opposed the bitam proposal and many

ccpi is along the lines of the clean coal technology program which has completed most of its projects and has been subject to rescissions and deferrals since the mid1990s the administration had requested 1500 million for ccpi for fy2003 as part of 2 billion tenyear commitment but had not recommended deferral from previously appropriated clean coal tec hnology program funds the cctp has been funded separately from the other fossil rd programs the administration had sought to consolidate it with coal rd programs under fossil energy research and development under the proposal the cctp would have r eceived additional appropriations but would have recei ved 400 million in fy2003 from previously deferred budget authority to continue w ith several projects that are still active however the

naturallyoccurring salt domes in louisiana and texas in which more than 570 million barrels of crude oil are stored the purpose of the spr is to provide an emergency source of crude oil which may be tapped in the event of presidential finding that an interruption in oil supply or an interruption threatening adverse economic effects warrants drawdown from the reserve sharp increases in the price of oil begi nning in the spring of 1999 spurred calls for drawdowns from the reserve the clinton administration authorized some exchanges and swaps of oil from the spr and also instituted program to accept roughly 28 million barrels as royaltyin kind rik payments for production from federal leases acquiring oil for the spr by rik avoids the necessity for congress to make outlays to finance direct purchase of oil however it also means loss of revenues to the treasury in so far as the royalties are paid in wet barrels rather than in cash in midnovember 2001 president bu sh ordered that the spr

navajo and hopi indian relocation onhir was reauthorized for fy19952000 by pl 104 301 the 1974 relocation legislation pl 93531 as amended was the end result of dispute between the hopi and navajo tribes involving land originally set aside by the federal government for reserva tion in 1882 pursuant to the 1974 act lands were partitioned between the two tribes members of one tribe who ended up on the other tribes land were to be relocated onhir classifi families as relocated when they occupy their replacement home most relocatees are navajo large majority of the estimated 3477 navajo families formerly on the nd partitioned to the hopi already have relocated under the act but the house appropriations committee estimates that about 233 families almost all navajo have ye t to complete relocation including about 24 navajo families still on hopi par titioned land some of whom refuse to relocate the remaining families are not on hopi partitioned land but are in various stages of acqui ring replacement housing onhirs chief activities consist of housing acquisition and constructi on land acquisition and certification of families eligibility for relocation benefits for fy2002 onhir received appropriations of 151 million for fy2003 the administration proposed 145 million decrease of 657000 or 4 the senate house and c ongress approved the proposed amount of 145 million for much of the relocation period ne gotiations and litigation have proceeded among the navajo nation the hopi tribe the navajo families on hopi partitioned land and the federal governme nt on number of issues especially regarding hopi tribe claims against the united states in 1995 the united states and the hopi tribe reached proposed settlement agreement on h opi claims attached to the settlement agreement was separate accommodation agreement between the hopi tribe and the navajo families which provided for 75year leases for navajo families on hopi partitioned land the nava johopi land dispute settlement act of 1996 pl 104httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31306crs54 301 approved the settle ment agreement between the united states and the hopi tribe not all issues have been reso lved by these agreements however and opposition to the agreements and the leases is strong among some of the navajo families navajo fa milies with homesites on hopi pa rtitioned land faced march 31 1997 deadline for signing the leases acco mmodation agreements according to onhir 70 of the 73 navajo families th on hopipartitioned land had signed accommodation agreements by the end of september 1999 the hopi tribe has called for enforcement of relocation against navajo families without leases like the fy1997fy2002 in terior appropriations acts the fy2003 appropriations law would forbid onhir fro m evicting any navajo family from hopi partitioned lands unless replacement home we re provided this language appears to prevent onhir from forcibly relocatin g navajo families during fy2003 since the onhir has large backlog of relocatees who are approved for replacement homes but have not yet received them these relocatees would have priority in receiving replacement homes the settlement agr eement approved by pl 104301 however allows the hopi tribe under certain circumst ances to begin actions against the united states after february 1 2000 for failure to give the hopi quiet possession of all hopipartitioned lands if navajo families on these lands have not either relocated or entered into accommodation agreements with the hopi tribe the hopi tribe has not yet filed such quiet possession claim against the united states the tribe has agreed to wait while the us pursues legal actions against navajo who have neither signed agreements nor relocated but has sserted that

compared to actual expenditures of 107 billion the house committee on appropriati ons in fy2003 report language expressed concern about the controversies between the s mithsonian and benefactors control over si proper ties and exhibits one particular issue is the renaming of the air and space theater replacing the name of langley with corporate sponsor name the committee recommended reopening negotiations and requests review of all benefactor agreements within the last two years in addition the committee would like further review of the practices for compensation of smithsonian leadership two of the controversies concerning the smithsonian in previous years were resolved they involved the proposed cl osing of the smithsonian center for materials research and education scm re and the conservation and research center crc in front royal virginia on may 6 2001 in response to objections by scientists and others the smithsonian reversed its policy with regard to the crc and scmre and continued to maintain both centers the fy2002 interior appropriations law provided that an i ndependent blue ribbon science commission would be established and meet before any final decision about closing either the crc or the scmre the direction of sis research priorities is still of concern to congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31306crs57 table 13 smithsonian institution appropriations

from the interior and related agencies appropriations bill to the appropriations bill for the departments of labor health and human services hhs and education ed and related agencies the rationale for this transfer was that the office of library services the larger of the two components of imls is already under labor hhsed appropriations and having one single funding stream under one appropriation would make bookkeeping simp ler and reduce duplicative review for appropriations subcommittees the fy 2003 appropriation under laborhhsed appropriations for imls is 2455 million for both libraries and museums including earmarks for museums and libraries and 100 million for educating librarians for the 21st century initiative the oms portion of the appropriation is approximately 30 million compared to 269 million for fy2002 the office of museum services provides grants in aid to museums in the form of leadership grants museum conservation museum assessment and ge neral operating support gos to help over 400 museums annually to improve the quality of their services to the public among the questions congress continually considers is whether funding for the arts and humanities is an ppropriate federal role and responsibility some opponents of arts support argue that nea and neh s hould be abolished ltogether contending that the federal government should not be in the business of supporting arts and humanities other opponents argue that cu lture can and does flourish on its own through private support proponents of federal support for arts and humanities contend that the federal g overnment has long tradition of support for culture beginning as early as 1817 with congressi onal appropriations for works of art to adorn the us capitol some representatives of the private sector say that they are unable to make up the gap that would be left by the loss of federal funds for the arts others argue that abolishing nea and neh would curtail or eliminate the programs that have national signifi cance and purpose such as national touring theater and dance companies radio and television show s traveling museum exhibitions etc former president clintons committee on the arts in creative america 1997 recommended federal funding for nea nd neh at 200 per person by the year 2000 in contrast total funding for nea and neh now represen ts approximately 84 cents per person previous nea controversies although there appears to be an increase in congressional support for the nea the debate often recurs on previous questionable nea grants when appropriations are considered in spite of attempts to resolve these problems through previous statutory provisi ons the debate involved whether or not some of the grants given were for artwork that might be deemed obscene to date nea projects have been judged obscene by the courts on november 5 1996 federal appeals court uphe ld an earlier decision nea v finley ruling that applyinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31306crs59 the general standards of decency clau to nea grants was unconstitutional however in anticipation of congressional reaction to ne as individual grants nea eliminated grants to individuals by arts discipline with some exceptions on june 25 1998 the supreme court reversed the federal appeals court decision for nea v finley ca9100f3d 671 by vote of 8 to 1 stating that the nea can consider general standards of decency when judging grants for artistic merit and that the decency provision does not inherently interfere with first amendment rights nor violate constitutional vagueness principles congress enacted nea reform measures in past appropria tions laws among these reforms were increases in funding llocations from 35 to 40 to states for basic state arts grants and for grants to under served populations in addition language emphasizing arts education wa s included 15 cap was placed on nea funds allocated to each state exempting only those grants with national impact members of the house and nate were added to the national council on the arts both nea and neh were given specific au thority to solicit funding and to invest those funds in the fy2003 final appropriation the language is retained that

the south florid everglades ecosystem restoration both the house and senatepassed bills and the bush administration request had included 20 million as in recent years some of the fund is appropriated

conservation fund of which 50 million would have funded proposed cooperative conservation initiative this initiative sought to promote conservation through pa rtnerships that match blm nps and fws

to the appropriations process for fy2002 the bush administration did not use the framework of the csc but requested total of 126 billion for this group of programs congress used the category and

that the fy2003 request totaled 132 billion for programs in this category slight increase from fy2002 funding the housepassed bill provide d 144 billion the report accompanying the senatepassed bill states that the csc is not being used b ecause the budget act in which it was established has ex pired and there is budget resolution it also states that total funding for fy2003 under this bill meets

accounts or portions thereof providing appropriations to preserve and protect lands habitat wildlife and other natural resources to provide recr eational opportunities and for other purposes this

separate funding under conservation spending for fy2001fy2003 they include competitive grants for indian tribes fws neotropical migratory birds fs stewardship incentives program and national wildlife refuge fund fws in fy2003 the house senate and appropriations law pl 1087 did not contain calculations of funding for the csc the joint explanatory statement of the conference report on the enacted measure stated that funds in the law are derived from the csc but that most of the programs previously funded under that category are continued in fy2003 b the administration is seeking 30 million
