information about political candidates or urge voters to go to the polls are common campaign tactic anecdotal accounts suggest that the public often objects to the volume and frequency of these automated political calls also called auto calls or robo calls despite often negative anecdotal information about automated political calls they remain an inexpensive effective way to reach hundreds or thousands of voters quickly campaigns and groups often rely on automated political calls to respond to lastminute campaign developments in the 111 th congress hr 116 several bills hr 248 hr 372 hr

or otherwise regulated the calls the committee on house administration subcommittee on elections held an oversight hearing on automated political calls on december 6 2007 the senate rules and administration committee considered s 2624 at february 27 2008 hearing empirical research and data about automated political calls are extremely limited data from surveys and the federal election commission fec suggest that during the 2006 election cycle majority of american voters received automated political calls and that various political committees spent millions of dollars on those efforts despite media reports of strong public disdain for automated political calls the fec has received few recent formal complaints on the issue cases concerning automated political calls accounted

necessarily reliable indicator of public sentiment towa rd automated political calls the federal communications commission fcc reportedly does not track data about complaints it receives on automated

political calls generally include prerecorded messages that provide information about candidates or urge voters to go to the polls2 they are also used to announce events and solicit campaign volunteers the calls are an inexpensive way to reach large numbers of voters quickly the calls can therefore play an important role in getoutthevote gotv and votereducation activities those who oppose the calls generally argue that they are intrusive that too many calls are placed to individual voters or that they are too often used to convey negative information identifying those responsible for calls is also concern the federal election campaign act feca does not require detailed reporting about automated political calls 3 political committees also have few incentives to make information about automated calls public in addition to this lack of data from regulators and practitioners campaign tactics and political consulting receive limited scholarly attention academic research that does exist tends to focus on campaign strategists especially political consultants such as pollsters and media specialists by contrast those providing automated political calls socalled vendors often receive limited attention 4 empirical research about automated political calls is extremely limited data from one survey and the fec suggest that during the 2006 election cycle majority of american voters received automated political calls and that various political committees spent millions of dollars on those efforts despite media reports of strong public disdain for automated political calls the fec has received few formal complaints on the issue recently several bills introduced in the 110 th congress would have imposed additional regulations on automated political calls but would not necessarily apply to all circumstances in which the calls are used legislation on the topic has also been introduced in the 111th congress many of the concerns surrounding automated political calls are not about the calls themselves but about how those calls are used congress therefore has various options for addressing automated political calls if it chooses to do so at all aside from maintaining the status quo one relatively cautious option would be gathering additional data before choosing policy approach federal agencies and the oversight process could provide such information another relatively limited approach would be to encourage voluntary changes by prac titioners by contrast if congress chose to require policy changes it could add political calls to the do not call list or restrict the timing or number of calls finally congress could place additional disclosure or disclaimer requirements 1 r sam garrett served as the primary author of this report kathleen ann

campaigns from the outset however it is important to remember that not all automated calls containing political information are campaignrelated although automated campaign calls can be controversial many members reportedly find official franked automated calls useful according to one political consultant official automated calls have been used to announce town hall meetings solicit constituent input on votes and provide information about federal programs eg student loans5 house commission on congressional mailing standards staff reported similar uses for franked calls which have become increasingly common6 discussion at december 2007 hearing held by the committee on house administration subcommittee on elections suggested desire among some members to curtail unwanted campaign calls while preserving official calls

political calls are subject to relatively little federal regulation although approximately 20 states reportedly restrict or ban such calls or are attempting to do so7 fcc and fec regulations each place different restrictions on automated political calls the fec regulations apply only to political committees or individuals engaged in express advocacy which proposes election or defeat of federal candidates by contrast the fcc regulations appear to apply to all prerecorded or automated calls regardless of whether they are political or commercial regulations promulgated by both agencies require that automated political calls provide certain identifying information finally the federal trade commissions ftc national do not call registry exempts political calls therefore even individuals whose telephone numbers appear on the registry may still receive automated political calls 5 telephone interview with marty stone ceo stones phones conducted by r sam garrett november 14 2007 in addition to

automated political calls however the fec has determined that various requirements related to political advertising apply to automated calls8 in particular telephone banks are included in the definition of public communications form of political advertising that must contain certain information9 messages from telephone banks and other sources paid for by authorized political committees ie candidates principal campaign committees must contain what fec regulations refer to as disclaimer clearly stating that the committee paid for the communication 10 similarly messages not authorized by candidate committees eg by party committees must clearly state that candidate committee is not responsible for the call and must provide the full name and permanent street address telephone number or world wide web address of the person who paid for the communication11 the latter requirement also appears to apply to general public political advertising including telephone banks paid for by any person that expressly advocates the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidate or solicits funds12 the requirements discussed above suggest that automated political calls paid for by political committees ie candidate committees political action committees pacs or party committees must include disclaimers identifying the sponsor the same is true for other persons engaging in express advocacy advocating the election or defeat of particular candidates or fundraising however it is possible that entities other than political committees could avoid disclaimer requirements as long as they did not engage in express advocacy or fundraising related to federal candidates these entities or individuals also would not normally fall under fec jurisdiction to summarize automated political calls that propose election or defeat of federal candidates or solicit funds for those candidates appear to require disclaimers identifying the sponsor however these requirements do not appear to apply to calls that are not sponsored by political committees or that do not engage in express advocacy or fundraising for federal candidates therefore fec disclaimer requirements do not necessarily apply to 527s interest groups or other entities that make automated political calls 13 feca also requires political committees to report information about their spendingwhether on political calls or any other good or service specifically committees must itemize disbursements totaling more than 200 to single source 14 reports submitted to the fec must include the name and address of the payee date of payment and brief description of the purpose of disbursement however political committees are generally not required to use particular terminology when itemizing expenditures as long as their descriptions are specific enough to determine the 8 see for example federal election commission first general counsels report in matters under review mur 5584 and 5585

address how automated political calls should be described in expenditure reports16 this topic is discussed in more detail later in this report therefore although payments for automated calls must be disclosed committees are largely free to determine how they wish to characterize their expenditures on reports submitted to the fec unless committee chooses to be particularly specificwhich is unlikely because these disclosures are available to opponents and the mediafec reports do not necessarily indicate how much committees spend on automated calls or whether they purchase automated calls at all g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g5g152g150g150g158g151g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g5g152g150g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 tcpa generally prohibits calls made by automated telephone dialing systems to cell phones emergency lines certain hospital lines and other similar establishments 17 the tcpa also prohibits calls to residential telephone lines that use automated or prerecorded voices to deliver message except in an emergency or by order of the fcc exempting that call from the prohibition 18 when promulgating rules under the tcpa the fcc was required by congress to consider exempting calls made for noncommercial purposes19 in its order implementing the tcpa the fcc chose to exempt calls made for non commercial purpose from the prohibition on calls using prerecorded messages to residential telephone lines20 calls made by campaigns or other political organizations generally are considered to be calls made for noncommercial purpose21 though automated or prerecorded telephone calls and calls using automated telephone dialing systems including calls made to deliver political messages to residential telephone lines are not prohibited by fcc regulation or the tcpa these types of calls are subject to some regulation specifically prerecorded calls must clearly state the identity of the business individual or other entity responsible for initiating the call at the beginning of the message 22 furthermore prerecorded calls including those placed with automatic dialers autodialers must also state the telephone number for the business individual or entity responsible for initiating the call23 15 for example for authorized committees itemized descriptio ns such as phone banks are acceptable but getout thevote is too vague see 11 cfr 1043b3b 16 federal election commission statement of policy purpose of disbursement entries for filings with

used offensively or defensively as when criticizing an opponent or responding to criticism the calls are often employed in the final days before elections to mobilize or discourage voters when it is too late to purchase other services with lastminute campaign contributions according to one political consultant political committees are increasingly also turning to automated calls earli er during election cycles to solicit voter input through automated responses or to coincide with mailings and other messages 28 another consultant noted that automated calls can encourage eventattendance and other grassroots engagement29 automated calls are inexpensive few cents per call and can be quickly produced and implemented they also provide public officials or other activists with an ability to reach hundreds or thousands of voters in matter of hours30 however some campaigns reportedly are beginning to fear diminished impact on voters because of flood of auto calls just before elections31

the decision to make automated political calls but implementation typically rests with telemarketing firms some professional political consultants also specialize in automated calls data about the political consulting profession are frequently limited because consultants identify themselves by various titles are often self employed and frequently do both political and nonpolitical work all

automated political calls32 the groups research suggested that more than 1020 of the 129 firms are professional political consulting firms with the remainder primarily engaged in other business ventures33 the aapc figure is roughly consistent with 20062007 estimate compiled by dennis johnson professor of political management at george washington university and former political consultant johnson identified 28 telephone and direct voter contact firms operating in 20062007 but did not differentiate between firms offering automated calls versus other services johnson found however that voter contact is small subset of the political consulting industry particularly compared with more common specializations such as direct mail 126 firms media consulting 78 firms and pollingresearch 76 firms 34 although few firms specialize in automated political calls computer technology is reportedly making it easier for those without specialized knowledge to pursue political telemarketing35 one consultant asserted that bifurcation exists between professional political consultants and other firms or individuals offering automated calls he also suggested that limited knowledge among the latter group could account for technical problems associated with some calls such as late night or truncated calls and that an ability to place automated calls does not necessarily imply professional knowledge of how to use those calls effectively in campaigns36 of course consultants have incentives to suggest that their services are unique compared with competitors this report takes position on that viewpoint g21g153g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g7g156g157g146g150g138g157g142g156g561 comprehensive data about the total cost of or spending on automated political calls is publicly unavailable however some estimates based on anecdotal information are available for example 2007 campaigns elections ce magazine report estimated that the two major parties congressional campaign committees spent over 600000 on robocalls in nearly 50 congressional districts in the final week of the 2006 general election campaign 37 32 the aapc body was alternatively characterized as subcommittee and working gr

giesser november 19 2007 33 telephone interview with marty stone november 14 2007 the aapc figures were based on internet research and searches of industry trade publications such as campaigns elections magazine now politics this estimate appears reasonable but would be difficult to verify given the limited publicly available information using trade publications to infer information about the consulting industry is also common practice in academic research however in the absence of law or regulations defining political consulting or requiring detailed disclosure about the types of services political committees purchase and from whom it is unclear precisely how many firms that provide automated political calls are operating in the united states it is also unclear how much of their business volume reflects political calls 34 dennis w johnson place for amateurs how political consultants are reshaping american democracy 2nd ed new york routledge 2007 p 241 35 see for example

working from fec data spending on automated political calls is often unclear because of their prominent roles in mobilizing voters congressional campaign committee are possible sources for examining spending on automated political calls none of the four committeesthe democratic congressional campaign committee dccc democratic senatorial campaign committee dscc national republican congressional committee nrcc and national republican senatorial committee nrscappear to publicize information about their spending on automated political calls required information provided on their fec reports also provides little detail about how much the committees spent on automated political calls 38 in fact of 467 purpose of disbursement descriptions listed by the four party committees in 20052006 none used the terms automated calls robo calls prerecorded calls or other language clearly indicating automated political calls 39 the committees spent approximately 86 million on activities itemized with some variation of the term telemarketing but it is unclear what proportion of those expenses if any were for automated calls in addition large proportion of the telemarketing expenses were from one committee the dccc suggesting that others simply chose not to use the term frequently in their reports the 86 million figure also does not include other large disbursements that could represent automated calls including expenditures itemized as generic phone banks or using variations of the word telephone without additional information however the exact purpose of those disbursements is unclear some caveats are important to consider when interpreting the partyspending information first as noted above the party committees are not required to provide detailed information about automated political calls or any other expense in their fec reports indeed examples of acceptable itemized disbursements provided by the fec do not include references to automated political calls 40 second analyzing data from four party committees is simpler than doing so for hundreds or thousands of candidate committees pacs etc therefore the party committees provide snapshot of possible automated calls spending importantly however various other political committees also contract for automated political calls despite these limitations this brief case study reinforces the point that data on automatedcalls spending are elusiveeven when examining fec reports continued between tom jennemann correspondent campaigns elections and r sam garrett november 15 2007 that methodology would not account for payments to subcontractors or firms not known for making automated calls it also would not account for nondccc or nrcc spending 38 in response to crs request the fec provided totals for itemized expenditures by type of expense reported by the four committees during 2005 and 2006 fec press officer robert biersack provided the data via email november 8 2007 39 r sam garrett conducted this analysis although the fec data listed 467 different purpose of disbursement itemizations that figure overstates the total number of unique expenditures for example many itemized terms

of calls placed or the amount of money spent it is clear that many voters receive automated political calls the pew internet american life project and the pew research center for the people the press found that 64 of registered voters received automated political calls during the final stages of the 2006 campaign41 as table 1 below shows automated calls were the secondmostcommonly reported form of voter contact late in the 2006 elections however the poll did not include television or radio advertising only slightly higher proportion of respondents reported receiving direct mail than automated calls but more than twice as many respondents reported receiving automated calls compared with live calls home visits or email according to the pew data republicans were slightly more likely than democrats to report receiving automated calls half of the surveyed independents reported receiving calls preliminary data suggest that automated political calls will again be popular tactic in the 2008 elections according to march 2008 survey data in states that have already held primary or caucus fully 44 of voters have received robocalls 42 furthermore campaigns are now more reliant on

undecided ones etc therefore it is unclear how many calls were used for allegedly positive negative offensive or defensive purposes as with other data about automated political calls little or systematic information about voter reaction to automated calls is available however anecdotal accounts typically suggest strong public disdain for such calls particularly in states featuring several competitive elections in some districts during the 2006 elections some voters reportedly received 20 calls in single day 44 some sources cited far lower numbers eg 510 or fewer calls per day but reports indicated that these calls were nonetheless frustrating to recipients45 in missouri the state attorney general received more than 600 consumer complain ts regarding automated political calls

limited48 available data however suggest that automated calls have minimal effect on turnout political scientists donald p green and alan s gerber concluded have that despite anecdotal examples of small effects on turnout thus far none of the experiments using robo calls has been able to distinguish their effects from zero our best guess based on experiments involving more than 1 million voters in variety of settings places the vote production rate somewhere in the neighborhood of one vote per 1000 contacts but given the shaky state of the evidence robo calls may have effect at all 49 in the absence of additional research on auto mated calls much remains unknownincluding what effect if any calls containing negative information have on depressing turnout and what impact the calls might

is responsible for enforcing the feca requirements discussed at the beginning of this report even so campaigns often respond to perceived misconduct by opponents through political advertising or by encouraging media scrutiny rather than by pursuing formal enforcement of fec regulations in addition although the commission frequently receives telephone or mail complaints from the public regarding automated calls these individuals rarely followup by filing formal complaints 50 therefore although fec enforcement activity provides one measure of automated political calls it is not comprehensive indicator of all potentially objectionable behavior associated with those calls51 enforcement data are available for closed but not pending cases although they do not necessarily represent ongoing controversies data from these closed cases provide some measure of recent complaints concerning automated calls 52 overall the fec appears to receive few complaints about automated political calls specif ically in response to crs request the fec identified eight enforcement cases concerning automated political calls that were closed between october 2003 and february 200853 during the same period the fec closed total of 476 matters under review murs the term used to describe the commissions initial process for receiving and assessing complaints54 therefore just 17 8 of 476 of murs closed between october 2003 and february 2008 concerned automated political calls documentation in the commissions enforcement query system eqs shows that the fec either dismissed the complaints or declined to take additional action after investigation in all but two of the eight cases55 the agency accepted conciliation agreement in one of the remaining cases mur 5588 in the second case mur 5649 the commission referred the matter to its alternative dispute resolution adr program but rejected proposed conciliation agreement and dismissed the case after the candidate reportedly was indicted on

february 6 2008 this report assumes that the fecs number eight cases represents all closed enforcement cases related to automated political calls during the time period under consideration commission staff reportedly identified these cases through keyword searches that could indicate complaints about automated political calls crs research using eqs suggests that the number of relevant murs is indeed small crs keyword searches for variations of the term robo call revealed only five closed cases in the entire database some of whic h were already included in the listing provided by the fec

matter thereby creating possible conflict of interest56 to summarize the mur data suggest that automated political calls have been the subject of few formal complaints to the fec when complaints did occur the commission rarely decided to take enforcement action automatedcalls issues in those cases generally concerned an alleged failure to include disclaimers indicating who paid for the calls57 some complaints also alleged that automated dialers were used in push polling in which voters are presented with negative information about candidate under the guise of an opinion poll58 push polls are not illegal although many political professionals say they are unethical59 when deciding not to pursue additional action in these cases the fec generally determined that violation had occurred that the agency was unable to identify responsible party eg in the case of anonymous calls or that pursuing the cases was an inefficient use of resources 60 one possible explanation for the small number of enforcement cases is that the 2004 election cycle was the first in which the disclaimer requirement applied to telephone banks and some committees were unaware of the requirement61 as noted previously it is also possible that although the public and opposing campaigns often find automated political calls objectionable they choose not to file complaints or they are unable to establish that feca violations occurred fec enforcement data therefore are not necessarily reliable indicator of public sentiment toward automated political calls

restrict automated political calls or 3 regulate political calls generally which could include automated calls as this section explains the aapc has also proposed legislative recommendations about automated political calls the policy options section below discusses potential ramifications associated with these and other approaches the committee on house administration subcommittee on elections held an oversight hearing on automated political calls on december 6 2007 in addition to providing background information about campaign practices members and witnesses considered whether or if automated calls could be constitutionally restricted some members also emphasized the value of official franked automated calls to arrange telephonebased town hall meetings the senate rules and administration committee also held hearing on the calls and s 2624 on february 27 2008 discussion at that hearing emphasized voter and candidate frustration with the calls and whether the calls could

prerecorded calls that promote support attack or oppose federal candidates within 60 days of general elections or 30 days of primary elections the bill would have also set civil penalties enforced by

political calls under that provision automated messages would have had to include statement at the beginning of the call indicating candidate approval of the content of the recording 66 similarly hr

2007 that group according to one of its leaders agreed that by promoting legislation which includes prudent rules we could demonstrate our industrys commitment both to the responsible use of prerecorded message delivery and to the prohibition of irresponsible and abusive use of the technology68 the working group recommended requiring disclaimers within the first 10 seconds of calls electronic optout options for those receiving unwanted calls and accurate caller id information other recommendations propose limiting the number of daily calls political committee may sponsor and prohibiting misrepresentation or falsifying callers identity or purpose 69 at the same time the working group warned against restricting free speech though restrictive and overly sweeping laws70 william raney an attorney representing the aapc reiterated those positions at the house subcommittee on elections hearing in december 2007 71 in spring 2008 however the aapc reportedly began fundraising campaign appealing to thousands of consultants to help fund what it anticipates could be long legal fight over various state and congressional legislative proposals to regulate automated political calls72 according to raney despite the fundraising appeal the aapc continues to support reasonable regulation consistent with the aapcs stated position in raneys december 2007 testimony although the group opposes adding automated political calls to the national do not call registry 73 the aapc recommendations suggest desire by some political consultants to differentiate political professionals from generic vendor s who some consultants say have abused automatedcall technology crs takes position on the validity of that perspective some of the aapcs recommendations appear to be similar to existing federal requirements these include provisions relating to identifying the party making automated calls and providing information about how to request that the recipient not receive future calls however some of the existing requirements do not apply to political calls there also appears to be uncertainty about which regulations apply to political calls versus nonpolitical calls adopting regulations similar to those the aapc recommends could clarify which regulations apply to which calls and when they could also create consistency between timeofday restrictions on commercial calls and political calls 74 68 marty stone ceo stones phones email to r sam garrett november 15 2007 69 ibid 70 ibid 71 testimony of william raney in us congre ss house subcommittee on ections

congress could choose several approaches to regulating automated political callsor not to do so at all this section provides comments on various options it also discusses broader issues that are likely to affect whatever policy options congress chooses g15g138g146g151g157g138g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g21g157g138g157g158g156g561g19g158g152g561 congress could choose not to pursue additional regulation of automated political calls this option would likely be appealing to those who believe that the benefits of automated calls outweigh their negative consequences as noted previously those who favor automated political calls believe that they provide important information to voters automated calls can also be valuable for responding quickly to lastminute attacks some members also rely on automated calls for official franked communications if congress chose to maintain the status quo existing federal requirements would remain in place the states would be free to consider additional regulation as they choose campaign committees and others would likely continue their current campaign practices g9g138g157g145g142g155g561g3g141g141g146g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g6g138g157g138g561 congress might also choose to gather additional information before deciding on policy solution although automated political calls are believed to be unpopular little is known about how many calls are made how much money is spent on the calls how the calls affect voters and whether the calls are used illegally or unethically substa ntial information about the use of automated calls during the 2008 election cycle also remains illusive without such information it could be difficult to define the full extent of policy problems if any and to develop appropriate solutions federal agencies and the oversight process could provide useful additional data for example as noted elsewhere in this report because the fcc has not been directed to do so the agency reportedly does not maintain statistics on consumer complaints about automated political calls similarly although the fec can compile data about relevant complaints upon request it does not routinely release information about automated political calls congress could request or direct both agencies to maintain and release data about automatedcalls complaints through the oversight process or by making requests to academics or other researchers congress could also encourage more polling attention to automated political calls empirical data on public reaction to automated political calls and the effect of those calls on voter turnout is especially lacking gathering additional information through federal agencies or researchers could clarify whether automated political calls are merely annoying or whether they represent substantial public policy concern such research might also find that the issue is not as prominent as media accounts often suggest regardless of the findings defining the scope of the problem by gathering more information could make the policy response more precise on the other hand because of their personal involvement in campaigns and automated political calls lawmakers might feel that

determines that concerns surrounding automated calls are primarily about how the calls are used rather than the calls per it could choose to encourage different behavior v oluntary change would not necessarily require any legislative or regulatory action for example congress could use the oversight process or decisions by individual members regarding their own campaigns to encourage practitioners to release more information about how and when they make automated political calls to limit the number or timing of the calls or to curtail automated calls that criticize opponents voluntary approach could be attractive to those who believe that governmental intervention in campaigns is unnecessary perhaps more importantly despite anecdotal impressions there is clear standard for what constitutes objectionable content how many calls are too many etc it could be difficult to translate these subjective concerns into precise legislative proposals therefore congress might avoid legislation altogether by encouraging but not requiring practitioners to change their behavior however without legislative or regulatory action or strong public pressure those who make automated political calls would have few incentives to change their practices as the preceding discussion of the aapc code of ethics suggests existing norms among political consultants do not necessarily address automated political calls professional enforcement cases are reportedly rare there is also guarantee that political consultants are responsible for allegedly negative consequences stemming from automated calls therefore if congress chose to encourage voluntary changes it would need to carefully consider which behaviors and by whom it wanted to address

another agency more information about how automated political calls are used in campaigns as explained previously feca requires political committees to report spending exceeding 200 including on political calls however although expenses must be itemized fec regulations do not require substantial detail about those expenses as the brief case study highlighting the party committees spending shows automated calls or any other expe nse are not always clearly identifiable in fec reportseven when those reports are filed consistent with feca and fec regulations legislative action or an fec rulemaking would be necessary to require political committees to provide more information about how they use automated political calls such efforts might include requiring use of more specific terms or categories on fec reports than are currently required in 2006 the fec reconsidered its requirements regarding filing terminology75 after receiving only two public comments on the issue the agency largely declined to require additional detail at that time the commission noted that the term phone banks provided sufficient detail to itemize disbursement to vendor providing phone bank services76 the fec did not address other telephone expenses including automated political calls if congress wanted to require more specificity regarding reporting about automated political calls it could encourage the fec to reconsider its regulations on itemized disbursements77 congress could also 75 federal election commission statement of policy purpose of disbursement entries for filings with the

expenses could be added to the section of the law detailing itemized reports78 additional information about spending on automated calls or other details such as when the calls were made and why would provide greater transparency about what role automated calls play in campaigns on the other hand requiring detailed information about automated political calls would be largely at odds with current regulations campaign finance reporting emphasizes providing information about the source and amount of campaign money not how that money is used to execute campaign strategy perhaps most importantly unless congress chose to extend disclosure requirements to nonpolitical committees eg 527 organizations that are not registered as political committees new disclosure requirements would not necessarily apply to all organizations responsible for the calls g20g142g159g146g156g142g561g6g146g156g140g149g138g146g150g142g155g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 congress could also require those making calls to provide more information to recipients as noted previously some disclaimer requirements already apply to automated political calls which raises the question of whether additional enforcement measures or increased oversight surrounding enforcement is necessary even attempted enforcement can be difficult for example as the fec has noted in some enforcemen t cases field investigations do not necessarily reveal the identities of those responsible for launching anonymous automated calls therefore just as regulations do not necessarily address moral issues related to campaign ethics additional disclaimer requirements will not necessarily ensure that those intent on breaking the law provide truthful information when making automated calls79 there is however room for requiring additional disclaimers if congress chose to do so in particular existing disclaimer requirements do not necessarily apply to outside groups or individuals sponsoring calls that do not explicitly call for election or defeat of federal candidates or engage in fundraising if congress wanted disclaimer requirements to apply more broadly it could amend the definition of political committee in fecaa topic that is frequently controversialor place additional requirements on all entities using automated calls regardless of whether or not they are political committees doing so however potentially raises contentious issues that extend well beyond automated political calls these include questions about which groups and individuals should be regulated by campaign finance law and which political messages constitute campaign speech versus policyoriented speech

congresses propose or proposed to add automated political calls to the national do not call list the do not call bills would provide consumers with way of opting out of political calls this approach

occur relatively quickly while avoiding some of the complications of other policy options for example if political calls were defined broadly questions about which organizations were making the calls eg political committees versus outside groups would presumably be inconsequential by contrast questions about politicalcommittee status would likely affect some other policy options nonetheless any effort to restrict political calls including adding them to the do not call list could raise constitutional questions discussed below this option would also not address concerns about the content of automated political calls g20g142g156g157g155g146g140g157g561g157g145g142g561g22g146g150g146g151g144g561g152g155g561g16g158g150g139g142g155g561g152g143g561g5g138g149g149g156g561 congress could also limit automated political calls to certain hours of the day or restrict the number of calls made to single recipient several states have reportedly placed time or other restrictions on automated calls 80 the aapc recommendations also include limiting the number of calls political committees could make in one day to the same number this policy option could reduce the number of calls voters receive which appears to be significant concern in the debate over automated political calls however one challenge associated with this approach would be dete rmining how many calls are too many and what hours are acceptable in addition although this policy option could decrease the volume of calls voters receive eg if single entity could place only certain number of calls to the same person per day it would not necessarily reduce the frequency of calls for those voters who live in states that produce competitive campaigns in fact if groups were limited to certain number of calls it is possible that other organizations could emerge solely for the purpose of placing multiple calls to the same voters constitutional considerations speech issues that could affect this policy option are discussed

the highest degree of protection under the first amendment82 laws or regulations that would burden or prohibit such calls if they use automated dialers or prerecorde d messages therefore must

government interest and is the least restrictive alternative to serve that interest84 regulation that would ban the use of automated telephone dialing systems or prerecorded messages in political calls may place too high burden on core political speech to withstand such exacting scrutiny the first amendment protects speakers right not only to advocate their cause but also to select what they believe to be the most effective means for so doing85 the supreme court announced this principle in the context of invalidating state law that prohibited the use of paid workers to obtain signatures on voterinitiative petitions as an impermissible burden on political speech86 the court found that the law restricted access to the most effective fundamental and perhaps economical avenue of political discourse87 the supreme court also has noted that it is of moment that statute does not impose complete prohibition the distinction between laws burdening and laws banning speech is but matter of degree 88 accordingly though ban on the use of prerecorded messages or automated dialing systems would not prohibit all political calls if court finds that prohibiting the use of such technology would limit such calls to lesser degree such restriction could be considered an impermissible burden on the first amendment free speech rights of those placing political calls governments however are permitted to place reasonable restrictions on the time place and manner of speech so long as they are contentneutral narrowly tailored though not necessarily the least restrictive means and serve significant government interest though not necessarily compelling interest and leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information 89 laws that do not foreclose an entire medium of expression but merely shift the time place or manner of its use likely will be upheld so long as ample alternative channels for communication are left open90 in order to qualify for the less exacting reasonable time place and manner restriction analysis the law must be contentneutral it is important to note that restriction on the use of automated telephone dialers or prerecorded messages that applied only to political calls would likely be characterized as contentbased restriction on speech which would require strict scrutiny as described above91 contentbased discrimination could be avoided if the restriction encompassed all speech that utilized these technologies92 84 mcintyre v ohio elections commn 514 us 334 347 1995 when law burdens core political sp eech we apply

federal court has addressed the issue in decision that was subsequently reversed on unrelated grounds the united states district court for the southern district of indiana upheld the constitutionality of an indiana statute that bans the use of automated dialing systems unless the called party has given prior consent or the message is immediately preceded by live operator who requests consent to play the message93 the court found that the statute did not violate the first amendment because it was contentneutral and reasonable time place and manner restriction that left open ample alternative modes of communication94 the court distinguished the provisions at issue from other supreme court decisions that applied strict scrutiny to restrictions on the modes of delivery for speech because the statute applied to all speech regardless of content and did not single out political speech95 the decision of the district court was reversed by the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit96 the seventh circuit held that the district court should have abstained from deciding the case because the related state court action had been filed first important state interests were implicated and state courts were able to afford ample opportunity to address the federal questions raised by the case97 the case now awaits decision in brow n county circuit court an indiana state trial court98

political calls if it chooses to do so aside from maintaining the status quo relatively cautious option might be gathering additional data before choosing policy approach federal agencies and the oversight process could provide additional information another relatively limited approach would be to encourage voluntary changes by practitioners by contrast if congress chooses to require policy changes it could add political calls to the do not call framework or restrict the timing or number of calls finally congress could place additional disclosure or disclaimer requirements on political calls some of those options would likely involve sensitive questions about which groups and messages should be covered by campaign finance law constitutional considerations could also be factor
