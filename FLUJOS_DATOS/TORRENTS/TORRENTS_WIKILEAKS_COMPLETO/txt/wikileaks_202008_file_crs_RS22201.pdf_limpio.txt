all be examined carefully w ith particular attenti on given to the facts of each and that the court should refrain from tying itself to single test for evaluating establishment clause cases justice oconnor noted in one of her concu rring opinions that experience proves that the establishment clause cannot eas ily be reduced to single test and that different cases may call for different approaches1 in cases involving government actions targeted at particul ar individuals or groups imposing special duties or giving benefits oconnor seemed to indicate that the neutrality st should be used while the endorsement test would more appropriate in cases invol ving government speech on religious topics2 however she cautioned the court agai nst using single unified test for evaluating all establishment clause claims stating that such test could do more harm than good and that single test ris ks being so vague as to be useless3 an examination of her opinions reveals that she viewed all of the cases as very factspecific and required careful consideration by the court to determine whether an improper relationship existed between the government and religion the two types of cases di

display of religious symbols in lynch v donnelly the court found that citys ch ristmas display did not violate the establishment clause5 in reaching its decision the c ourt applied the threeprong test first articulated in lemon v kurtzman6 finding that the city had secular purpose for the display it did not impermissibly advance religion and it did not create an excessive entanglement between re ligion and government7 justice oconnor joined with the majority but wrote separate concurrence criticizing the courts reliance on lemon 8 in her concurrence oconnor observed that it has never been entirely clear how the three parts of the lemon test relate to the principles enshrined in the establishment clause and instead proposed to clarify lemon by focusing on institutional entanglement and on endorsement or disapproval of religion9 rather than asking whether particular action has secular purpose as under the first prong of the lemon test oconnor submitted that the pr oper inquiry under the purpose prong of lemon is whether the government intends to c onvey message of endor sement or disapproval of religion10 oconnor also questioned the courts prior interpretation of the primary effect prong of the lemon test stating that it is clear that the effect prong of the lemon test is properly interpreted not to require invalidation of government practice merely because it in fact causes even as primary effect advancement or inhibition of religion focusing instead on whether the practice in question has the effect of communicating message of government endorsement or di sapproval of religion11 later in county of allegheny v amer ican civil liberties union the court found that the display of creche inside county cour thouse did violate the establishment clause because it had the effect of promo ting or endorsing religious beliefs12 in allegheny the court appears to have ab andoned the test set forth in lemon in favor of the approachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22201crs3 13 the court did not in this case nor in subsequent cases expressly overrule lemon while the chief justice has questioned the fate of the lemon test the court has continued to apply the principles set forth in lemon in some recent cases while rejecting it in others see van orden v perry 545 us ____ 2005 031500 slip op at 6 june 27 2005 14 492 us at

concurrence in lynch 13 justice blackmun delivered the opinion of the court stating that since lynch the court has made clear that when evaluating the effect of government conduc t under the establishment clause we must ascertain whether the challenged governmental action is sufficiently likely to be perceived by adherents of th controlling denominations as an endorsement and by the nonadherents as disapprova l of their individual religious choices14 justice oconnor again joined the majority but wrote separate concurrence to further articulate her so called endorse ment test15 in her concurrence she wrote that in lynch she suggested clarification of the court s establishment clause doctrine to reinforce the concept that the establishment clause prohibits government from making adherence to religion relevant in any way to persons standing in the political community and that government violates this prohibition if it endorses or disa pproves of religion16 here in allegheny she found that the display of relig ious symbols in public areas of core government buildings runs special risk of making religion relevant in reality or public perception to status in the political community17 continuing her concurrence oconnor responded to criticism of the endorsement test justice kennedy criticized the test saying that it was inconsistent with the courts precedents and traditions because if it we re applied without ar tificial exceptions for historical practice it would invalidate many traditional practices recognizing the role of religion in our society18 oconnor responded by clarifying that under the endorsement test the history and ubiquity of practice is relevant not because it creates an artificial exception from that test on the contrary the history and ubiquity of practice is relevant because it provides part of the context in which reasonable observer evaluates whether challenged governmental practice conveys ssage of endorsement of religion19 justice oconnor concluded her defens of the endorsement test with the declaration that alternative test has been suggested that captures the essential mandate of the establishment clause as well as the endorsement test does and it warrants continued applicati on and refinement20 in capital square review and advisory board v pinette the court addressed the question of whether private unattended

group in the statehouse plaza did not violate the establishment clause but wrot separate concurrence ex plaining how the endorsement test applies not only to expression by the government itself but also to private speech that takes place in public forum created by the government22 justice oconnor acknowledged that there is cr ucial difference between government speech endorsing religion which the establishment cl ause forbids and private speech endorsing religion which the free speech and free exercise clauses protects23 but went on to say that the establishment clause imposes affirmative obligations that may require state in some situations to take steps to avoi d being perceived as s upporting or endorsing private religious message24 with respect to religious speech in public forum the main point of contention appears to be the point at which the government becomes responsible whether due to favoritism toward or disregard for the evident effect of religious speech for the injection of religion into the political life of the citizenry25 justice oconnor rejected the notion that the endorsement test should focus on the actual perception of individual observe rs and contended that the test creates more collective standard to gauge the objective meaning of the governments statement in the community26 she also stated that the reasonable observer must be deemed aware of the history and context of the community and forum in which the religious display appears27 justice oconnors final application of the endorsement test in this context came in her concurring opinion in mccreary county v americ an civil liberties union 28 the court applying lemon s threeprong test determined that the display of the ten commandments in several mc creary county courthouses vi olated the establishment clause the court primarily focuse d on the secular purpose prong of the lemon test declining the counties request to abandon the secular purpose prong of the test based on the assertion that tr ue purpose is unknowable29 justice oconnor joined the majority but in her concurrence wrote that the purpose behind th counties display is relevant because it conveys an unmistakable message of ndorsement to the reasonable observer30 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22201crs5 31 496 us 226 1990 32 496 at 248 33 id at 249 34 id at 250 35 id at 253 36 512 us 687 1994 the court

of the westside community schools v mergens the court held that the equal access act which requi res schools to make space available to all student groups including those with religi ous message after regu lar school hours did not violate the establishment clause31 justice oconnor wrote for the majority and upheld the act based on what appears to have been hybrid test incorporating both lemon and the endorsement test that she advocated in the cases discussed above oconnor first noted that the acts prohibition of discrimin ation on the basis of political philosophical or other speech as well as religious speech is sufficient basis for meeting the secular purpose prong of the lemon test32 she also noted that c ongress stated purpose to prevent discrimination against religious and other types of speech was also undeniably secular33 the second prong of the lemon test was addressed not in terms of primary effect but rather in terms of endorseme nt oc onnor stated that secondary school students are likely to understand that school does not endorse or support student speech that it merely permits on nondiscriminatory basis34 with respect to the third prong of the lemon test oconnor rejected the argument th at allowing the assignment of teacher or administrator to attend the meetings creates an excessive entanglement with the groups religious activities35 the court in board of education of kiryas joel village school district v grumet struck down special st ate statute that carved out separate school di strict for the village of kiryas joel religious enclave of satmar hasidim36 in so doing the court did not apply the lemon test but determined that the statute violated the establishment clause because it violated the require ment of government neutrality37 oconnor wrote concurring opinion approving of the courts use of the neutrality test calling the emphasis on equal treatment an eminently sound approach38 justice oconnor went on to espouse the dangers of setting fo rth unitary test for deciding all establishment clause cases stating that such test could do more harm than good and that single test risks being so vague as to be useless39 concluding her concurrence she noted that experience proves that the establishment clause cannot easily be reduced to single test and that differe nt cases may call for different approaches40

universitys argument that it c ould not provide funds to student newspaper written from christian perspective because doing so would violate the establishment clause41 the court based its determination on the fact that the funds were to be distributed through the universitys st udent activities fund saf program that distributes funds on religiously neutral basis and that neutrality is significant factor in upholding programs in the face of establishment clause attack42 in concurring opinion justice oconnor wrote that neutrality in both form and effect is one hallmark of the establishment cl ause and that if state refused to let religious groups use facilities open to others then it would demonstrate not neutrality but hostility toward religion43 however she went on to note that this case presented special conflict between neutrality and the prohibition on st ate funding of religious activities the resolution of which may not be possi ble with single unified test44 justice oconnor concluded her concurrence with the observation that the court did in this case what courts must do in many establishment clause cases focus on specific features of particular government acti on to ensure that it does not violate the constitution45 in mitchell v helms the court upheld program that provided educa tional materials to both public and private elementary and s econdary schools rejecting the argument that the provision of such materials to private religious schools violated the establishment clause46 because the lower court had determined that the program had secular purpose and did not create an excessive entanglement the court only addre ssed the primary effect prong of the lemon test47 in determining the primary effect the court focused on the neutrality principle whereby the court has uphe ld aid that is offered to broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion48 oconnor concurred in the judgment but wrote separate opini on denouncing what she called rule of unprecedented breadth for the evaluation of establishment clause challenges to government schoolaid programs49 justice oconnor interpreted the pluralitys approach to mean that government aid to religious schools does not have the effect of advancing religion so long as the aid is offe red on neutral basis and the aid is secular in content and stated her cont ention that while neutrality should be considered in an establishment clause analysis it should not be the sole criteria employed by the court in making constitutional determinations50
