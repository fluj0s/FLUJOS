rs21372 the european union questions and answers by kristin archick background on the european union after world war ii leaders in western eu rope and the united states were anxious to secure longterm peace and stability on th european continent and create favorable environment for economic grow th and recovery in 1952 six states belgium the federal republic of germany france it aly luxembourg and the netherlands established the european coal and steel community single market in these two industrial sectors that was controlled by an independent supranati onal authority in 1957 the treaty of rome established the eur opean economic community extending the common market to all economic sectors nd the european atomic energy community to ensure the use of nuclear energy for p eaceful purposes in 1967 these three formations collectively became known as the european community ec the ec first added new members in 1973 with the entry of the united kingdom ireland and denmark greece joined in 1981 followed by spain and portugal in 1986 the single european act modified the ec treaties in 1987 by increasing the powers of the european parliament and enabling the 1992 single market program to move forward at the beginning of 1993 the near completi on of the single market brought about the mostly free movement of goods servi ces capital and people within the echttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21344crs2 1 eleven members austria belgium finla nd france ireland italy germany luxembourg the netherlands spain and portugal adopted single european currency the euro on january 1 1999 greece joined in 2001 slovenia in 2007 and cyprus and malta in 2008 the 15 participating countries have common central bank and common monetary policy banks and many businesses began using the euro as unit of account in 1999 euro notes and coins replaced national currencies on january 1 2002eu institutions the european union is treatybased institutional framework that defines and manages economic and political cooperation among its 27 member states it is governed by several institutions the european commission is essentially the eus executive and has the exclusive right of legislative initiative it ensures that the provisions of the treaties are carried out properly the 27 commissioners are appointed by agreement among the governments of the member states for fiveyear terms each commissioner holds distinct portfolio eg agriculture the council of the european union council of ministers is comprised of ministers from the national governments as the main decisionmaking body it enacts legislation based on proposals put forward by the commission different ministers participate depending on the subject under consideration eg economics ministers could convene to discuss unemployment policy the presidency rotates among the member states for period of six months the european council brings together the heads of state or government of the member states and the president of the commission at least twice year it acts principally as guide and driving force for eu policy the european parliament consists of 785 members since 1979 they have been directly elected in each member state for five year terms the parliament cannot enact laws like national parliaments but has some co decision power with the council of ministers and can amend or reject the eus budget the court of justice interprets eu law and its rulings are binding court of auditors monitors the unions financial management number of other advisory bodies represent economic social and regional interestson november 1 1993 the treaty on european union maastricht treaty went into effect establishing the european union eu which encompasses the ec the european union consists of three pillars an expanded and strengthened ec common foreign and security policy and common internal security measures the treaty contains provisions that have resulted in the creation of an economic and monetary union emu including common european currency1 the european union is intended as significant step on the path toward greater political and economic integration on january 1 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu bringing membership to 15 states in june 1997 eu leaders met to review the maastricht treaty and consider the future course of eur opean integration the resulting amsterdam treaty increased the legislative power of the european parliament strengthened the eus foreign policy developed more coherent eu strategy to boost employment and integrated procedures for managing internal security in december 2000 eu leaders concluded the nice treaty to pave the way for further eu enlargement although it effectively set limit of 27 member states the nice treaty also set out internal institutional reforms to allow an enlarged union to function effectively critics argued however that the nice treaty established an even more complex decision making process thus the eu embarked on new reform effort in june 2004 eu leaders concluded work on constitutional treaty that would have simplified eu voting rule s and contained further changes to the eus governing institutions commonly referred to as the constitution it had to be ratified by all member stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21344crs3 2 for more information see crs report rs21618 the european unions reform process the lisbon treaty by kristin archick 3 conclusions of the european c ouncil copenhagen denmark june 1993through either parliamentary pproval or public refe rendums in order to come into effect the constitutions future was thrown into doubt following its rejection by french and dutch voters in the spring of 2005 some sugge sted that the difficulties with ratifying the constitution called into question further expansion of the eu given that considerable public opposition to the constitution was tied to concerns about eu enlargement in december 2007 eu leaders approved new reform treaty the lisbon treaty to essentially replace the proposed cons titution experts claimed the lisbon treaty preserved over 90 of the substance of th original constitution and would remove at least the technical obs tacles to further eu enlargem ent beyond 27 member states eu officials presented the lisbon treaty as document that coul d be ratified by parliaments thereby avoiding risky public referendums in most eu states except ireland which was required by law to hold public vote in june 2008 irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty fearing that it would reduce ireland s influence in the eu undermine irelands neutrality and eliminate its ability to set its own tax rates eu leaders have called on the ratification process to continue in other eu states and have given irish officials until october 2008 to propose way forward eu fficials hope that the lisbon treaty will still be able to enter into force before the next european parliament elections in the spring of 20092 process of enlargement the eu views enlargement as historic oppor tunity to help in the transformation of the countries involved extending peace st ability prosperity democracy human rights and the rule of law throughout europe the carefully managed process of enlargement is one of the eus most powerful policy tools th at has helped to transform the countries of central and eastern eur ope into more modern functioning democracies under article 49 of the treaty on the eur opean union any european country may apply for membership if it meets set of established political and economic criteria in addition the eu must be able to absorb ne w members so the eu can decide when it is ready to accept new member the criteria for eu membership require candidates to achieve stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy the rule of law human rights and respect for and protection of minorities functioning ma rket economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the union the ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political economic and monetary union3 accession talks begin with screening process to see to what extent applicants meet the eus 80000 pages of rules and regulations known as the acquis communautaire the acquis is divided into 35 chapters that range from free movement of goods to agriculture to competition detailed negotiations at min isterial level take place to establish the terms under which applicants will meet and imp lement the rules in each chapter the european commission proposes common negotiating positions for the eu on each chapter which must be appr oved unanimously by the council of ministers in all areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21344crs4

and administrative and judicial systems up to eu standards both at national and regional levels during negotiations applicants may request transition periods for complying with certain eu rules all candidates receive financial assistance from the eu mainly to aid in the accession process chapters of the acquis can only be opened and closed with the approval of all 27 member states periodically the commission issues progress reports to the council and european pa rliament assessing the prog ress achieved by the candidate country once the co mmission concludes negotiations on all 35 chapters with an applicant the agreements reached are incorporated in draft accession treaty which is submitted to the council for appr oval and to the european par liament for assent after signature the accession treaty must be ratified by each eu member and the candidate country this process can take two years the eu began accession negotiations in march 1998 with cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary poland and slovenia in december 1999 at its summit in helsinki finland the eu decided to open nego tiations with six others bulgaria latvia lithuania malta romania nd slovakia turkey was also formally recognized as candidate at helsinki but rema ined in separate category for several years as it sought to comply fully with the membership criteri see below at its december 2002 summit in copenhagen denmark the eu concluded accession talks with cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithua nia malta poland sl ovakia and slovenia the accession treaty was signed with these ten states on april 16 2003 and they acceded to the eu on may 1 2004 although brussels would have preferred prior political solution to the conflict over cyprus it stated that this was not precondition for the divided islands accession moreover athens had threatened to block any enlargement that excluded cyprus twin referendums on plan to reunify the island were he ld on apr il 24 2004 approximately 65 of turkish cypriot voter s in the north approved the plan but 76 of greek cypriot voters in the south reject ed it without settlement eu laws and financial benefits are applied only to the southern greek cypriot part of the island which is the internationally recognized state4 in december 2004 the eu c oncluded accession nego tiations with bulgaria and romania and on january 1 2007 these two nations formally joined the eu bringing the union to 27 member states and completing the fifth enlargement since 1957 the addition of these two nations stretches the borders of the union to the black sea and increases the population of the eu to over 490 million some restrictions in specific trade sectors and labor market access remain in place for both count ries as do further oversight mechanisms with respect to judicial reforms and combatin g corruption little progress in these problem areas has prompted calls for ongoing monitoring in both countries turkey and the western balkans

membership was rejected the eu recognized turkey formally as candidate at the 1999 helsinki summit but asserted that turkey still needed to comply fully with the eus political and economic criteria after some contentious bate among eu members over issues related to turkeys l ack of formal recognition of cy prus and whether privileged partnership short of full membership for turkey should be retained as future option the eu opened accession talks with turkey on october 3 2005 the eu maintains that the shared objective of the negotiations is accession but that it w ill be an openended process the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand formal negotiations between the eu and turkey on the acquis began in 2006 talks are expected to last at least decade meanwhile turkeys continued failure to recognize cyprus and its refusal to ope n its ports and airports to greek cyprus as required by turkeys customs union with the eu threatened early on to derail the accession process as compromise interim settlement the eu decided in december 2006 to partially freeze accession talks with turkey in eight chapters dealing with areas affecting the customs union talks were allowed to continue in the other 27 chap ters some negotiations with turkey resumed in 2007 but france under ne w president nicolas sarkozy blocked opening talks on the sensitive monetary uni on chapter in its november 2007 annual progress report on turkey the european commi ssion asserted that turkey continues to make progress on its political reforms but more work is needed especially in areas related to fundamental free doms although the commission expected membership talks to continue in 2008 it is clear that some eu members and many eu citizens remain wary about turkeys possible accession given its large size relatively poor economy and muslim culture5 in june 2004 the eu named croatia as candidate and opene d accession talks with that country on october 3 2005 following termination that cr oatia was cooperating fully with the international criminal tri bunal for the former yugoslavia icty macedonia was given candidate status in d ecember 2005 but has not yet secured start date for accession negotiations the remaining western balkan states of albania bosnia serbia montenegro and the region of ko sovo are all recognized as potential eu candidates although their accessi on prospects vary and are exp ected to take several years prospects for future rounds of eu enlargement the eu maintains that the enlargement door remains open to any european country that is able to meet the political and ec onomic criteria for membership the eu hopes that the possibility of membership will help accelerate reform and promote greater stability in those countries interested in even tually joining the eu ukraine and georgia for example have expresse d longterm eu aspirations on the other hand enlargement fatigue in the wake of the addition of 12 new members in two years has become serious i ssue in europe and some experts believe that enlargement may be reaching its limits in november 2006 the european commission released strategy on enlargement the strategy called for the eu to continuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21344crs6 6 the enlargement strategy is availabl at the european commissions website httpeceuropaeuenlargement also see the process of joining the eu on the commissions websiteenlargement but to take into account the uni ons integration capacity which refers both to applying rigorous conditiona lity with respect to candidate countries and to completing institutional reforms and financing arrangements to sustain the eus ability to function the strategy also called for the eu to honor its current co mmitments with prospective members but to remain cauti ous about assuming any new co mmitments moreover under the accession structure membership ta lks with any candidate country whose accession could have substantial financial c onsequences on the union as whole as turkey or ukraine would have can only be concluded after 2014 the scheduled date for the beginning of the eus next budget framework6 although the new lisbon treaty if ratifie d would eliminate the technical hurdle to enlarging beyond 27 members analysts note th at some newly elected european leaders and many eu citizens are cautious about furt her enlargement for the general public in europe apprehensions about eu enlargement seem to be driven by several concerns one is that the addition of nations with weak economies low incomes and high unemployment could wreak havoc with thei r own economies or prompt the influx of unwanted migrant labor second issue is th belief that some of the newest members have been admitted with less mature democratic institutions or glaring deficiencies in meeting eu standards another concern is with the overall identity of europe and what the union stands for the unions struggle with these issues has been highlighted by the possible admission of turkey large muslim state with culture considered by many europeans to be vastly different and not compatible with europe us perspectives successive us administrations and ma ny members of cong ress have supported eu enlargement believing that it serves us interests by spreading stability and economic benefits throughout the continent over the years key criticism has been that the process of eu enlargement was moving t oo slowly us busine sses believe they will gain access to larger more integrated eur opean market and see enlargement as forcing further reform of the eus regulatory policies some analysts posit that enlargement may also decrease overall useu tensions because many new members are more pro american especially those from the form er communist eastern europe the bush administration welcomed the eus enlargem ent in 2004 asserting that it would help strengthen the enduring partnership between the united states and europe some us officials are concerned th at european public worries about eu enlargement could hinder additi onal eu expansion especially to turkey and perhaps the balkans others argue that eu enlargemen t could have some ne gative implications for us interests some suggest for instance that political instability in number of central and eastern european countries may furthe r complicate the eus ability to be more cohesive actor on the world stage if freque ntly changing governments shift policy positions on the other hand others worry th at larger more confident eu with an economic output roughly equivale nt to that of the united states and growing political clout may increasingly rival us power and prestige
