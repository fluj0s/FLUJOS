december 17 2007 abstract gross domestic product gdp can be expressed as the product of ﬁve factors the total population the share of the overall population that is in the labor force the share of the labor force that is employed average labor hours per employee and gdp divided by labor hours which is labor productivity over long periods of time the employment unemployment rate has had little to do with variations in the rate of economic growth while the growth rate of the population has been gradually declining at times the eﬀect of declining population growth has been oﬀset by surges in the share of the population that is in the labor force as well as by increases in productivity growth so far in the 2000s overall economic growth can be mostly accounted for by just two variables population and productivity growth growth in the labor force between now and 2050 is expected to be an average of about 06 per year that combined with current productivity growth trends suggests future longrun economic growth somewhere between 21 and 24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22775 order code rs22775 december 17 2007 longterm economic growth sustainable goals brian w cashell specialist in

current productivity growth trends suggests futu re longrun economic growth somewhere between 21 and 24 if there is any one goal of economic po licy that has generally been considered paramount it is improving living standards traditionally achieving that goal has meant increasing the quantity of goods and services produced and the income generated as result of that production the size of the economy has considerab effect on economic policy economists generally believe that economic policy can influence the rate of economic growth in the short run but over long periods of time they have less confidence that policy can make significant difference even if there is doubt about the ability of policy to influence the longrun rate of economic growth there is doubt that the longrun rate of growth influences policy especially the overall levels of spending and taxes the rate at which the economy grows may also influence the gree to which policymakers seek to affect how income is distributed this report discusses how the level of gross domestic product gdp can be accounted for by the various fact ors that contribute to it in some cases these factors varyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22775crs2 in predictable ways and that reduces th difficulty of projecting longterm economic growth accounting for economic output gdp can be expressed as the product of number of variables that reflect the relationship between the overall population and the amount of work done gdp obviously depends on the population but the re lationship can be decomposed in way that may shed some further light the following equation shows the decomposition of gdp the equation shows that gdp can be expr essed as the product of five factors the total population the share of th overall population that is in the labor force the share of the labor force that is employed labor hours per employee and gdp divided by labor hours which is labor productivity from purely arithmetical standpoint it would seem that ne ither popula tion the size of the labor force the number of empl oyees nor the number of hours worked could have any effect on gdp if the population increased while the other variables remained unchanged the labor forceto population ratio would fall by an offsetting proportion leaving gdp unchanged similarly an increase in the size of the labor force would raise the labor forcetopopulation ratio but absent other changes the em ployeestolabor force ratio would fall the equation allows for an accounting of gdp but it doesnt make clear that the variables themselves are interdependent fo r example it is unlikely that an increase in the population would have effect on gdp only if an increase in the population had effect on the size of the labor force or on any of the other variables would the increase in population not result in more output simila rly an increase in the labor force would tend to result in more output unless all of the additiona l labor remained unemployed just as the level of gdp can be explai ned as the product of the variables shown above its growth rate can be explained as the sum of the growth rates of those same variables if for example the rate of popul ation growth increases and that growth doesnt affect the proportion that is in the labor for ce then the rate of growth of gdp would be expected to rise if the rate of population gr owth rises because of an increase in fertility however it would be likely to cause the share of the population in the labor force to drop temporarily until the boom reached working age it should also be kept in mind that only if gdp grows faster than the populati on will average living standards rise population growth population growth depends on three factors the birth rate the death rate and net immigration variations in the birth ra have generally been the most important cause of changes in the u s population growth rate the baby boom comprising those born betw een 1946 and 1964 contri buted to rise in the population growth rate to about 18 in the mid1950s it fell to less than 1 during much of the 1970s and 1980s only to rise again to 13 in the early 1990s due to what has been described as an echo of the baby boom in 2001 the population growth rate again fell below 1gdp populationlaborforce populationemployees laborforcehours employeegdp hours

ratio of the labor force to the population is known as the labor force partic ipation rate the labor force consists of those who are employed and those who are ac tively looking for work the share of the population that is in the labor force can vary with the age distribution of the population the share of the population that is of working age and also with the proportion of those of working age who want to work together with the gr owth rate of the popul ation the labor force participation rate determines the growth rate of the labor force the longterm trend has been for the participation rate to rise that rise can be traced to two developments in particular first was the aging of the ba by boom cohort the end of the baby boom caused population growth to slow somewhat but the aging of the baby boom caused the growth of the labor force to accelerate pushi ng up the participati on rate second was surge in the labor force participation rate of women between 1950 and 2006 the participation rate of women rose from 34 to 59 enough to more than offset the decline in the participation rate of men from 86 to 74 over the same period between 1950 and 2006 the overall pa rticipation rate ro from 59 to 66 employment rate the ratio of employment to the labor force the employment rate is simply the obverse of the unemployment rate most of the variations in the employment rate are cyclical in nature but there are some longer run influences as well the employment rate rises during economic expansions nd falls during contractions over the long run the economy tends towards full employment becau of demographic changes in the labor force however and other occasional shifts in the labor market that may make it more or less difficult to match job vacancies with workers the measure of what is considered by economists to be full employment may change somewhat over time1 there has been however general trend up or down in the long run so that over long periods of time this factor has little effect on the growth rate hours worked people work to be able to fford their consumption included in what people consume is leisure time as wages rise over time as they have tended to do in the long run the rise in the return to labor has two offsetting effects first the increased return to labor is an incentive to work more hours the increased return to labor however may also allow workers to put in fewer hours more leisure and earn the same income it appears from the data that these factors do not completely offset one another the average work week has tended to fall over the very long term the decline has been dramatic from 70hour work w eek in 1830 to 41hour work week in 20022 even in the more recent past the trend s been downward although the decline has been very slow between 1964 and 1999 average week ly hours worked fell by just 05 part of the downward trend has been due to the rise of the service sector and the increased hours of retail establishments increas ing the demand for parttime workers3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22775crs4 4 for more on productivity growth see crs report rl32456 productivity will the faster growth rate continue by brian w cashellproductivity productivity is measured as ra tio the ratio compares production gdp in the equation shown above to the hour s required to produce it in the short run over the course of the business cycle productiv ity growth tends to vary in predictable ways but over the long term changes in the trend rate of growth of productivity are less well understood the two main contributors to growth in labor productivity are rising capitallabor ratio whic h makes it possible for each worker to produce more in given period of time and technologi cal advances which may mean new methods of production new improved types of goods and services or even new ways of organizing the production process growth in the capital st ock tends to be fair ly steady and parallels growth in the overall economy what factors influence the rate of technological advance are poorly understood4 historical trends in growth table 1 presents statistical breakdown of the factors accounting for economic growth since 1950 the time intervals shown are not associated with either business cycle turning points ie the beginnings and ends of recessions or shifts in productivity growth trends but nonetheless the figures allow veral observations the first is that over longer periods of time the employment unemployment rate has had little to do with variations in the rate of economic growth the second is that the growth rate of the populati on has been gradually declining for that not to depress the overall economic growth rate over the l ong r it must be offset by increases in either the share of the popula tion working the number of hours they work or the rate of increase in productivity table 1 accounting for economic growth intervalpercentage change at annual rates in real

participation rate contributed significantly to overall grow th between 1960 and 1990 accounting for nearly half of economic growth during the 1970s some of that was offset by the effect of decline in average bor hours due in part to an increase in parttime workers productivity growth also declined in the 1970s but has since recovered somewhat sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22775crs5 5 mitra toossi new look at long term labor force projections to 2050 monthly labor review november 2006 pp 1939 6 crs report rl32456 productivity will the faster growth rate continue by brian w cashellfar in the 2000s overall economic growth can be mostly accounted for by just two variables population nd productivity growth looking ahead one reason for separating the different f actors that account for economic growth is the hope that doing so will provide some insights into what rate of growth to expect in the future some of the factors examined bove lend themselves to projection more than others over the long run absent any drama tic structural changes in labor markets it seems unlikely that the employment rate woul d have any significant effect on the overall growth rate neither would there seem to be any reason to anticipate change in average labor hours that would have substantial effect that l eaves population growth the labor force participation rate and productivity growth population growth is projected by the census bureau by matching assumptions about fertility and mortality ra tes to the age distribution of the population and adding in projected net immigration while life expectancy is projected to rise slowly the death rate is also expected to rise because of the aging of the babyboom cohort the census bureau projects that between now and 2050 th total population will grow an average of 08 per year using the census projection together wi th the current age distribution of the population and expected trends in labor for ce participation rates the bureau of labor statistics bls projects growth in the labor force between now and 2050 to be an average of about 06 per year5 bls expects the labor force participation rate of women to remain fairly steady but they project small decline in the participation rate of men that in combination with the aging of th babyboom cohort means the labor force is expected to grow more slowly than the overall population of all the variables examined here pr oductivity is probably the most difficult to project the sources of productivity are incompletely underst ood and ther is consensus explanation for past variations in its growth rate part of productivity growth is attributable to steady rate of investment and rising stock of capital but part is due to the rate of technological innovation there is little on which to base projection of the pace of technological innovation other than to assume that the current trend will continue6 there are some variables that might aff ect the outlook for economic growth one important one is what happens as the ba byboom generation ages if the current household saving rate of near zero is any indication they may be financially unprepared for retirement if retirements are postpone d the participation ra would be slightly higher and so would economic growth if there is switch to parttime employment however then average hours might fall s lightly continuation of the current productivity trend rate of growth in the 15 to 18 range combined with labor forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22775crs6 growth of 06 suggests that it would be reasonable to expect growth to average somewhere between 21 nd 24 over the long run
