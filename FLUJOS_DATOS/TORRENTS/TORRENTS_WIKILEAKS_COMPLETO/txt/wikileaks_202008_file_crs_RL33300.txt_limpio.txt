protections to reduce the variation and number of products in the market obra 90 limited insurers to selling ten standardized policies with precisely defined benefits the ten standardized policies simplified price comparisons and decision making for medicare beneficiaries and led to consolidation in the market with fewer products and sellers however some problems remained premium increases continued critics expressed dissatisfaction with the range of offerings claiming that the limited choices did not fully meet the needs of some beneficiaries and confusion persisted in some of the dimensions that were not addressed by the medigap reforms for instance in the methodology used to calculate premium increases over time there are several differences between the medigap experience and medicare part d when considering whether standardizing benefits might yield improvements in the part d market in contrast to medigap medicare part d is new and the market is likely to change dramatically in the coming years many observers expect that the medicare part d market will consolidate in subsequent years both in the number of carriers and the number and scope of products offered as carriers learn which products are most attractive to medicare beneficiaries and which ones are profitable strong federal presence in medicare part d and the additional complexities of prescription drug benefit when compared to supplemental insurance product also suggest that the experiences might not be entirely similar consequently the policy decision should include considerations about not only whether and how to standardize benefits but also when to do so contents medigap 1 background 1 obra 90 and ssaa 94 2 result of reforms 3 continuing problems 3 decision making and the number of

beneficiaries face large number of choices from numerous insurers offering multiple plans with different benefits similarly complex array of choices in the private supplemental medicare insurance medigap market was one of the factors leading to the medigap provisions in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 obra 90 and the social security act amendments of 1994 pl 103432 ssaa 941 this report highlights the lessons learned from the medigap experience and how they might provide insight into the current medicare part d market medigap background the history of medigap is noteworthy for its lessons in federal regulatory intervention in health insurance markets medigap plans have been in existence since the 1970s and have been sold by hundreds of insurance companies2 however dissatisfaction with the medigap market grew substantially over the years beneficiaries complained of marketing abuses by companies and agents where medicare beneficiaries were sometimes sold multiple medigap plans or plans that duplicated coverage that they already had through retiree health plans other plans offered very little value the multiplicity of offerings from numerous carriers also led to confusing array of medigap product choices for beneficiaries high premium increases compounded the dissatisfaction and congress responded to complaints of marketing abuses high pressure sales practices fraud and confusing array of choices by passing laws that set restrictions on the medigap market prior to 1980 states were solely responsible for regulating medigap but this changed when congress enacted public law 96265 section 507a known as the baucus amendment responded to widespread public dissatisfaction by establishing voluntary certification standards designed to encourage states to enact legislation that incorporated basic requirements established by the national 1 for additional information about medigap see crs report rl31223 medicare supplementary medigap coverage by jennifer osullivan 2 national association of insurance commissioners 1990 loss ratios for medicare supplemental insurance kansas city mo 1992 crs2 association of insurance commissioners naic medigap policies were required to meet minimum benefit package requirements return minimum portion of premiums to beneficiaries in the form of benefits called loss ratio and comply with various disclosure provisions including providing consumer guide and outline of benefits to prospective policyholders3 although the baucus amendment achieved many of its goals there continued to be large number of products sold in this market as there were limits on how many and what type of benefits could be offered in excess of the minimum standards4 beneficiaries found it difficult to comparison shop effectively in the face of hundreds of policy configurations obra 90 was designed to address this shortcoming obra 90 and ssaa 94 the primary changes in the medigap market were the result of the medigap provisions of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 most of which went into effect in 1992 and the social security act amendments of 1994 these laws addressed the problems in the market by 1 simplifying choices 2 promoting competition as means to hold down premium increases and 3 providing consumer protections the medigap reforms of obra 90 limited insurers to selling 10 standardized policies with precisely defined benefits5 the 10 packages designated through j were designed by an advisory group convened by the naic with plan being the most basic policy and plan j being the most comprehensive three of the packages plans h i and j offered some prescription drug coverage obra 90 required all medigap carriers to offer plan and carriers may choose to offer any of the other nine options to medicare beneficiaries at the carriers discretion obra 90 also contained numerous provisions designed to offer more consumer protections for medicare beneficiaries these protections include mandatory open enrollment periods limitations on preexisting conditions the requirement of free look provision to allow beneficiaries time to decide whether the medigap plan that they selected was appropriate for them limits on highpressure sales tactics and agent 3 loss ratio is defined as the proportion of benefit costs to premium revenue low loss ratio means that the amount of benefits paid is much less than the premiums received and so the insurer would be more profitable correspondingly high loss ratio value close to but less than one indicates that premiums barely cover the cost of benefits paid and so the insurer would be less profitable loss ratio greater than one would mean that premiums were insufficient to cover the cost of benefits the baucus amendment required minimum loss ratio of 60 for individual policies and 75 for group policies 4 gao medigap insurance law has increased protection against substandard and overpriced policies october 1986

medicare supplementary medigap coverage by jennifer osullivan for further details crs3 commissions and the creation of funds for beneficiary education in addition obra 90 also set limits for carrier profitability in an attempt to curb rapidly increasing premiums failure to meet standards would generate requirement for the company to issue premium refunds one of the protections introduced by obra 90 made it illegal to sell duplicate medigap coverage to beneficiaries but it also barred the sale of policies that duplicated other coverage to which beneficiary was entitled for instance through retiree health plan as result some insurers refused to sell medigap policies to beneficiaries who had any kind of retiree plan even when the retiree plan was very limited ssaa 94 amended the obra 90 requirements by narrowing the anti duplication provisions and clarifying the circumstances when insurers would be subject to financial penalties result of reforms the obra 90 medigap legislation attempted to simplify the medigap insurance market to provide consumer protections and choice to provide market stability and to promote competition and thereby slow down premium increases most of these objectives were satisfied the 10 standardized policies simplified price comparisons and decision making for medicare beneficiaries6 by 1999 about 107 million medicare beneficiaries more than onefourth of all medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in medigap policy7 complaints about carrier and agent abuses also declined substantially after obra 908 along with the reduction in the variety of medigap products came consolidation in the market following the 1992 implementation of obra 90 provisions there were fewer products and fewer sellers as many carriers with smaller market shares left the business9 over time the medigap market stabilized and in the decade following obra 90 there was little change in market share and the number of carriers with reported major detrimental impact on the insurance industry10 continuing problems despite the achievements of the medigap reform legislation contained in obra 90 and ssaa 94 some problems remained researchers found little effect on 6 ma

analysis of data in the gao report medigap current policies contain coverage gaps undermine cost control incentives gao02533t despite the efforts at standardization some have criticized the obra 90 reforms for falling short and allowing too much state leeway some insurers and consumer advocates have complained about inconsistent regulation across states and that variation in wording requirements and the presentation of policy forms resulted in less consistency than desired15 finally some confusion has remained in the market particularly in how ratings methodologies are applied in setting premiums and how this affects beneficiary choice medigap carriers can rate policies in three ways 1 using community rating without any age differentiation 2 with issueage rating or 3 with attainedage rating the choice of rating methodology has implications for the cost of the premium over time communityrated premiums do not change as the policy holder ages issueage premiums are based on the age of the beneficiary when the policy is issued and increase with inflation but not age attainedage premiums can be less expensive initially when purchased but increase as the beneficiary ages decision making and the number of choices the effect of having many choices on decision making is not fully understood traditional economic theory argues that more choices lead to greater satisfaction 13 ibid 14 while data on medicare beneficiaries choices across medicare drug plans are not yet available cms administrator mark mcclellan stated on february 8 2006 before the senate finance committee that the vast majority of part d enrollees have selected plans that offer something other than the standard benefit described in mma 15 lmb alecxih et can regulation improve longterm care insurance lessons from the medigap experience journal of aging and social policy vol 7 2 1995 crs6 since the decision maker can select the choice that is most closely aligned with the individuals preferences however some behavioral economists psychologists and others argue that the cost associated with having to evaluate each choice could offset the gains provided by achieving the best fit some research suggests that individuals faced with many choices may find that having more alternatives can be counterproductive particularly when the differences are small the prospect of having too many choices can be demotivating leading the decision maker to avoid making any decisions at all having more options may lead to less confidence that the decision makers choice is optimal and subsequently lower willingness to commit to single choice some recent empirical studies appear to support this theory one study found that plans that offered more 401k options had lower participation rates compared to plans that offered only handful of choices every ten funds added other things equal is associated with 15 to 2 drop in the participation rate16 another study found that while grocery store consumers were initially more attracted to booth displaying 24 jam choices higher percentage of consumers who saw only six choices subsequently purchased the jam by factor of 10 related work also showed that ex poste satisfaction was higher among those who had fewer than those who had more choices17 at the other extreme having too few choices can also inhibit participation if the limited choices available do not provide the decision maker with an improvement over the status quo then choosing not to participate will be optimal therefore other things being equal the more varied the preferences across the population the less likely that one choice will be optimal for the majority while these theories might partly explain the early enrollment experience of medicare part d the late enrollment penalty adds significant incentive whose effects have not yet been fully realized lateenrollment penalty helps to create and maintain broad base of enrollees so that pooling the collective experience can significantly reduce the average risk for all enrollees without such penalty beneficiary enrollment decisions would reflect an appropriate selfassessment of risk in the aggregate this could lead to premiuminflating spiral where only the highest risk beneficiaries choose to enroll leading to even higher premiums and riskier enrollees with each iteration although medicare part b is voluntary and offers one choice to participate or not the participation rate is 94 due in part to the late enrollment penalty18 the early experience with medicare part d enrollment may reflect both the demotivating aspect of having many choices as well as the fact that the late 16 g huberman and w jiang offerings vs choice by 401k plan participants equity exposure and number of funds journal of finance to appear

hospital insurance and federal supplementary medical insurance trust funds 2005 annual report crs7 enrollment penalty has not yet been imposed as of midfebruary 2006 about 24 of medicare beneficiaries who were not automatically enrolled or did not have other creditable coverage19 had signed up for medicare part d plan20 while more beneficiaries may enroll as the lateenrollment penalty deadline nears trying to make the decision in the face of an impending deadline may also elevate accompanying stress levels evaluating proposals to extend the open enrollment period before imposing the late enrollment penalty requires balancing complex set of costs and benefits to medicare beneficiaries insurers cms and taxpayers medicare beneficiaries who simply need more time to gather and incorporate information to assist in decision making would be wellserved by an extension of the open enrollment period however there are likely to be beneficiaries for whom the extension is simply an opportunity to delay the choice for these individuals the decision process would not change materially except that it would occur later additionally insurers calculated premiums based on expected enrollment linked to predetermined open enrollment period extending the signup period could affect the enrollment and the covered expenditures in biased manner if fewer beneficiaries enroll in the early part of the year there would be proportionally fewer covered costs incurred if this happened in random or unbiased manner however extending the open enrollment period might provide the opportunity for beneficiaries who were low risk those who did not use or expect to use many prescription drugs to postpone enrollment until the last possible minute providing an additional period during which late enrollment penalty would be in effect the effect of this scenario would be to create an enrolled population that differs from the one insurers projected when formulating their plans and bids standardization options for medigap and medicare part d the medigap market of the 1980s and the current medicare part d market both present the beneficiary with great many choices but the standardization approach applied to the medigap market through obra90 has limited parallels and applicability to the current medicare part d market before the medigap reforms there were federal restrictions on how vendors could structure their offerings 19 medicare beneficiary is not subject to part d late enrollment penalty if the individual is enrolled in another insurance plan that provides coverage of prescription drugs costs and the actuarial value to the individual equals or exceeds the actuarial value of the standard prescription drug coverage under part d plan that meets this criteria is deemed to be creditable coverage 20 out of 434 million total medicare beneficiaries 105 million were either dual eligibles 62 million enrolled in medicare advantage plan prior to 2006 43 million or retirees with creditable coverage 100 million of the remaining 229 million 49 million signed up for standalone plan and 05 million enrolled in medicare advantage drug plan as of february 13 2006 see kaiser family foundation policy brief tracking prescription drug coverage under medicare five ways to look at the new enrollment numbers february 2006 crs8 obra 90 required vendors to conform to 10 standardized medigap options plan through plan j that vary by the scope of covered services21 plan is the basic package that covers part hospital coinsurance for days 6190 in benefit period and 60 lifetime reserve days and 365 days of hospital care after the exhaustion of medicare benefits part b costsharing and the first three pints of blood the nine remaining plans b through j offer combinations of additional coverage including the part andor part b deductibles skilled nursing facility care emergency medical care in foreign countries athome recovery preventive care and part b excess charges22 therefore since the creation of standards vendors compete on dimensions other than covered services including price premiums and costsharing and customer service in contrast vendors participating in the medicare part d market have faced at least two constraints from the beginning of the program mma states that each part d eligible individual is entitled to obtain either the standard prescription drug coverage with access to negotiated prices23 or b alternative prescription drug coverage with at least actuarially equivalent benefits and access to negotiated prices24 25 thus vendors may vary their products and compete on premiums and costsharing requirements so long as they meet the actuarial equivalence test as determined by cms the early experience has shown that despite this constraint plans have found sufficient flexibility to vary their product offerings substantially second the mma also put guidelines in place regarding the scope of drugs that each plan must cover united states pharmacopeia usp as directed by mma produced model formulary that cms used to evaluate proposed plan formularies plans are required to cover1 at least two drugs in each therapeutic category and pharmacologic class described in the usp medicare prescription drug benefit model guidelines or an acceptable alternative 2 substantially all drugs in handful of classes dealing with mental health treatments3 at least one product representing each of 119 key drug types defined by usp and 4 majority or substantially all 21 the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl10533 added two high deductible plans to the 10 standard plans with the exception of the high deductible feature the benefit packages under the high deductible plans are the same as for plan f or plan h 22 prior to mma plans h and i also offered basic drug benefit and plan j offered an extended drug benefit but these drug benefits can not be included in any new policy sold after december 21 2005 23 the

dataframe news december 2005 given these variations standardization options for medicare part d would be quite different from the approach applied to the medigap market where covered services were grouped into 10 packages the major dimensions for consideration are beneficiary costsharing through deductibles coinsurance and copayment rates and levels and drug coverage through formulary design the interaction of these variables with the plans enrolled population projected drug consumption patterns negotiated prices efficiency of operation and desired profit level will determine the premium insurers can set for the products within these parameters potential standardized options can be loosely or more strictly defined standardized formularies can explicitly specify certain products or

to wide array of choices is common to both the medigap market in the 1980s and the current medicare part d market there are also notable differences between the two experiences market maturity medigap had long history prior to the federal interventions of the 1980s and 1990s while the market may have been confusing for beneficiaries at the time the market was mature and there were relatively few major changes from year to year in the number of products offered and the number of carriers in the business in fact the continuing diversity of offerings was defining characteristic of the market in contrast medicare part d is new and the market is likely to change dramatically in the coming years the plethora of current choices see table 2 may reflect deliberate strategy on the part of insurers to cast as wide net as possible to appeal to many different kinds of medicare beneficiaries many observers expect the medicare part d market to consolidate in subsequent years both in the number of carriers and the number and scope of products offered as carriers learn which products are most attractive to medicare beneficiaries and which ones are profitable under this scenario the choices

the sum across all regions because of duplicate counts source centers for medicare and medicaid services this abundance of choices is reflected in the diversity of plan characteristics the monthly premiums for part d plan can vary from 0 to 125 in the same crs12 region similarly beneficiaries in one region deciding between plans can face difference in the number of covered drugs that ranges from 626 to 336030 not only is the medicare part d benefit new but the existence of freestanding prescription drug product in the insurance market is also novel and the longterm viability of this market is unknown31 since most of the potential costsavings from increased availability and use of prescription drugs are likely to accrue to the insurers of parts and b through decreased hospitalization and physician visits there would appear to be an advantage for insurers that cover parts and b in addition to part d thus some industry observers have suggested that some companies may be offering freestanding part d plans to entice medicare beneficiaries who have traditionally preferred feeforservice over managed care for example medicare part c with the hope of converting them to managed care enrollees under the companies medicare advantage plan over time this would also result in fewer choices for beneficiaries in the future strong federal role regulation of the medigap industry has been and continues to be the province of states however unlike the medigap market prior to 1990 there will always be significant role for the federal government in the medicare part d market variation across insurance products including medigap is due in part to differences in state regulation medigap regulation is one of the only areas of insurance regulation where the federal government has imposed standard of consistency across states32 in contrast the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms reviews and approves every part d plan offered by every insurer thus problems that the medigap market faced such as duplicate coverage and lowvalue policies are unlikely to become problems that would require the legislation of standardized benefits under medicare part d transitional nature of the prescription drug market the market for prescription drug evolves continually as consequence of scientific legal and economic factors new research and innovation eventually leads to new drugs that can either expand the frontiers of medical science or provide alternatives to existing practices or products approved drugs eventually go off patent possibly leading to the introduction of generic competitors advances in scientific research may bring to light new information on the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs an actively managed formulary will change to reflect the entry of new medications as prices change with new competitors and practice patterns and as new evidence about drug effectiveness and safety becomes available in this light 30 avalere health llc dataframe news december 2005 31 former cms administrator tom sculley on march 20 2003 testified at hearing before the senate special committee on aging that drugbenefit only insurance plan doesnt exist in nature reflecting the rarity of such offerings 32 alecxih et crs13 standardization may be overly restrictive if there is not concomitant ability to revise and update formularies as situations change standardization issues standardizing benefits implies policy tradeoffs creating simplicity and ease of understanding needs to be balanced with restrictions on industry autonomy and market choices in addition the appropriateness of federal intervention in standardizing benefits must be weighed carefully when applied to nascent market the level of standardization determines many parameters in the policy debate obra 90 required the naic to develop 10 packages of benefits while proponents have touted the simplicity the 10 choices created others have argued that the packages are not sufficiently varied and that some beneficiaries are not wellserved by any of the choices for the medigap market consensus on part d standardization may also be difficult as to whether there is manageable number of standardized packages that can be agreed upon and the dimensions to be standardized the medigap experience with premium rating illustrates the difficulties and tradeoffs inherent in standardizing benefit obra 90 did not specify how carriers could set their premiums and as result three methods were used across medigap products beneficiaries and consumer advocates dislike attainedage rating since the premiums increase with age as incomes tend to decline in contrast most insurance carriers prefer to have the option to choose the rating methodology so that they can offer more choices and products in the market while the obra 90 and ssaa 94 reforms that led to standardized benefits stabilized the medigap market it is not clear that this action would have similar effect on the medicare part d market such an approach could be premature the problems in the medigap market were wellestablished and persistent the medicare part d market is likely to undergo significant changes as all parties beneficiaries insurers drug manufacturers pharmacy benefit manages cms learn about the new benefit and how it develops the medicare part d market will likely consolidate over the next few years and some insurers will exit while others enter the market however beneficiaries and plans are likely to face difficulties and challenges while the market moves through this transition intermediate interventions might help alleviate the difficulties associated with the great breadth and number of choices without placing restrictions on specific options before the optimal set of standardized packages are clearly identified whether such actions are most appropriately addressed through legislation or regulation will depend on the specific objectives one possible intermediate intervention would be to limit each plan sponsor to more than two offerings as suggested by draft call letter from cms to plans considering participating in 2007 while this restriction would reduce the number of choices it would also force companies that currently offer more than two choices to change their business practices33 33 j reichard medicare part d 20 fewer plans better service in 2007 cg continued crs14 given the uncertainty surrounding the market more information on what plans beneficiaries have chosen and which plans will continue to be offered in subsequent years will be important in determining the variety of choices under medicare part d consequently the policy decision should include considerations about not only whether and how to standardize benefits but also when to do so 33 continued healthbeat news at httpwwwcqcomdisplaydodocid2061095productid5bindernamehealthbeat 20060307 for other versions of this document see
