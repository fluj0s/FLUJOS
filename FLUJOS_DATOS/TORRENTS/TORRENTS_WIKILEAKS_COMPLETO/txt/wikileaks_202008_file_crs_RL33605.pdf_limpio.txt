of authorized generics has recently been the subject of considerable attention by the pharmaceutical industry regulators and members of congress alike an authorized generic sometimes termed branded flanking or pseudo generic is pharmaceutical that is marketed by or on behalf of brandname dr ug company but is sold under generic name although the availability of an additional competitor in the generic drug market would appear to be favorable to consumers authorized generics have nonetheless proven controversial some observers believe that authorized generics potentially discourage independent generic firms both from challenging drug patents and from selling their own products these perceived disincentives result from the provisions of the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 better know n as the hatchwaxman act this legislation provides independent generic firms with reward for challenging patents held by brandname firms that bounty consists of 180day generic drug exclusivity period awarded to the first patent challenger during the 180day period the brandname company and the first generic applicant are the only firms that receive authorization to sell that pharmaceutical at the close of this period other independent generic competitors may obtain marketing approval and enter the market ordinarily resulting in lower prices for generic medicines some commentators view the 180day exclusivity period as crucial incentive for generic firms to challenge patents held by brandname firms under this view the launch of an authorized generic during the 180day exclusivity period makes the recovery of litigation expenses more difficult in turn the possibility that brandname firm will sell an authorized generic during the 180day exclusivity period may decrease the incentives of generic firms to challenge patents in the first instance other observers believe that authorized generics benefit consumers by increasing competition in the generic market because the authorized generic is manufactured by the brandname firm and identical to its own product consumers may be enco uraged to switch to the lowercost authorized generic alternative authorized generics may also facilitate the settlement of patent litigation between brandname and independent generic firms as an historical matter certain of these settlement agreements have allowed authorized generics to enter the market and therefore promoted competition prior to the expiration of the relevant patent term recent judicial opinions have upheld fda practices allowing authorized generics as result of congressional interest however the federal trade commission has agreed to release report directed towards this issue although congress may wish to take action if the current allowance of authorized generics is deemed appropriate other possibilities include subjecting them to the 180day generic exclusivity period enjoyed by an independent generic firm or simply disallowing them altogether this report will be updated as needed

many years focused congressional attention upon the development and availability of prescription drugs recently the presence of authorized generic pharmaceuticals in the drug marketplace has been the subject of congressional concern1 an authorized generic is pharmaceutical that is marketed by or on behalf of brandnamed drug company but is sold under generic name the brandname firm may distribute the drug under its own auspices or via license to generic drug company the price of this authorized copy is ordinarily lower than that of the brandname drug 2 some sources refer to authorized generics as brandedflanking or pseudo generics3 authorized generics may be proconsumer in that they potentially increase competition and lower prices particularly in the shortterm they have nonetheless proven controversial authorized generics ordinarily enter the market at about the time the brandname drug companys patents are set to expire 4 some observers argue that such products may possibly discourage independent generic firms both from challenging drug patents and from selling their own generic products5 the potential diminution in independent generic incentives may in turn lead to less desire on the part of brandname firms to market authorized generics themselves this report presents an analysis of the innovation and public health issues relating to authorized generic drugs the report begins with review of the procedures through which independent generic drug companies receive government permission to market their products and resolve patent disputes with brandname firms it then provides

pharmaceuticals in the interest of public health8 under this regime the developer of new drug must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective before it can be distributed to the public this showing typically requires the drugs sponsor to conduct both preclinical and clinical investigations 9 in deciding whether to issue marketing approval or not the fda evaluates the test data that the sponsor submits in socalled new drug application nda prior to the enactment of the hatchwaxman act the federal food and drug law contained separate provisions addressing marketing approval for independent generic versions of drugs that had previously been approved by the fda 10 the result was that wouldbe independent generic drug manufacturer had to file its own nda in order to sell its product11 some independent generic manufacturers could rely on published scientific literature demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug by submitting socalled paper nda because these sorts of studies were not available for all drugs however not all independent generic firms could file paper nda12 further at times the fda requested additional studies to address safety and efficacy questions that arose from experience with the dr ug following its initial approval13 the result was that some independent generic manufacturers were forced to prove once more that particular drug was safe and effective even though their products were chemically identical to those of previously approved pharmaceuticals some commentators believed that the approval of an independent generic drug was needlessly costly duplicative and timeconsuming process14 these observers noted that although patents on important drugs had expired manufacturers were not moving to introduce independent generic equivalents for these products due to the level of resource expenditure required to obtain fda marketing approval15 8 crs report rl30989 the us drug approval process primer by blanchard randall iv 9

statute that has been described as complex and multifaceted compromise between innovative and generic pharmaceutical companies16 its provisions included the creation of two statutory pathways that expedited the marketing approval process for independent generic drugs the first of these consist of abbreviated new drug applications or andas an anda allows an independent generic applicant to obtain marketing approval by demonstrating that the proposed product is bioequivalent to an approved pioneer drug without providing evidence of safety and effectiveness from clinical data or from the scientific literature the second are socalled 505b2 applications which are sometimes still referred to as paper ndas like an nda 505b2 application contains full report of investigations of safety and effectiveness of the proposed product in contrast to an nda however 505b2 application typically relies at least in part upon published literature providing preclinical or clinical data the availability of andas and 505b2 applications often allow an independent generic manufacturer to avoid the costs and delays associated with filing fullfledged nda they may also allow an independent generic manufacturer in many cases to place its fdaapproved bioequivalent drug on the market as soon as any relevant patents expire 17 as part of the balance struck between brandname and independent generic firms congress also provided patent proprietors with means for restoring portion of the patent term that had been lost while awaiting fda approval the maximum extension period is capped at fiveyear extension period or total effective patent term after the extension of not more than 14 years 18 the scope of rights during the period of extension is generally limited to the use approved for the product that subjected it to regulatory delay19 this period of patent term extension is intended to compensate brandname firms for the generic drug industrys reliance upon the proprietary preclinical and clinical data they have generated most often at considerable expense to themselves 20

infringe those patents should that product be approved by the fda and sold in the marketplace the hatchwaxman act therefore establishes special procedures for re solving patent disputes in connection with applications for marketing generic drugs in particular the hatchwaxman act requires each holder of an approved nda to identify patents it believes would be infringed if generic drug were marketed before the expiration of these patents 22 the fda then lists these patents in publication titled approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations which is more commonly known as the orange book23 wouldbe manufacturers of independent generic drugs must then engage in specialized certification procedure with respect to orange booklisted patents an anda or 505b2 applicant must state its views with respect to ea ch orange booklisted patent associated with the drug it seeks to market four possibilities exist 1 that the brandname firm has not filed any patent information with respect to that drug 2 that the patent has already expired 3 that the generic company agrees not to market until the date on which the patent will expire or 4 that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture use or sale of the drug for which the anda is submitted 24 these certifications are respectively termed paragraph i ii iii and iv certifications25 an anda or 505b2 application certified under paragraphs i or ii is approved immediately after meeting all applicable regulatory and scientific requirements26 an independent generic firm that files an anda or 505b2 application including paragraph iii certification must even after meeting pertinent regulatory and scientific requirements wait for approval until the drugs listed patent expires 27 the filing of an anda or 505b2 application with paragraph iv certification constitutes somewhat artificial act of patent infringement under the hatchwaxman act28 the act requires the independent generic applicant to notify the proprietor of the patents that are the subject of paragraph iv certification29 the patent owner may then commence patent infringement litigation against that applicant if the nda holder demonstrates that the independent generic firms proposed product would violate its patents then the court will ordinarily issue an injunction that prevents the generic drug 22 21 usc 355c2 2004 23 see

the same date as the nda holders patents independent generic drug companies commonly amend their andas or 505b2 applications in this event replacing their paragraph iv certifications with paragraph iii certifications30 on the other hand the courts may decide in favor of the independent generic firm the court may conclude that the generic firms proposed product does not infringe the asserted patents or that the asserted patents are invalid or unenforceable 31 in this circumstance the independent generic firm may launch its product once the fda has approved its anda or 505b2 application in

pharmaceuticals with reward for challenging the patent associated with an approved pharmaceutical the reward consists of 180day generic drug exclusivity period awarded to the first anda applicant to file paragraph iv ce rtification during this 180day period the fda may not approve another anda containing paragr aph iv certification with respect to the same drug 32 notably the 180day generic drug exclusivity applies only to anda applicants and not to those filing 505b2 applications33 commentators have long referred to this provision as creating generic exclusivity or 180day exclusivity34 as originally enacted the hatchwaxman act allowed the brandname firm and the first independent generic applicant to shar the market for the first 180 days of generic competition at the close of this period other independent generic competitors could receive fda marketing approval because market prices often drop considerably following the entry of additional generic competition the first

improvement act of 200336 clarified that more than one patent challenger can enjoy generic exclusivity provided that certain conditions are met following the 2003 statute all first applicants are potentially entitled to the 180day generic exclusivity37 the statute defines the term first applicant to mean all applicants who on the first day on which substantially complete generic application with paragraph iv certification is filed did themselves file substantially complete generic application with paragraph iv certification 38 the statute therefore makes clear that multiple first applicantsthat is to say more than one generic that filed paragraph iv generic application on the same daymay each enjoy shared exclusivity the 180day generic exclusivity period is intended to ameliorate collective action problems that may arise with regard to pharmaceutical patent challenges39 stated less technically an independent generic firm that challenges patent must bear the expensive upfront cost of litigation if the independent generic firm is successful however the challenged patent is declared invalid with regard to the entire pharmaceutical industry any firmnot just the one who challenged the patentcould then introduce competing product to the marketplace understandably this forced sharing may undermin the incentives any one independent generic firm would possess to challenge brandname firm s patent the award of 180 days of generic exclusivity is therefore intended to allow successful patent challenger to capture an individual benefit for its effort in turn

behalf of brandname drug company but is sold under generic name41 authorized generics are thus similar to private label products which are manufactured by one firm but sold under the brand of another although private label products are commonplace in food cosmetic and other markets they have only recently attracted attention in the pharmaceutical industry42 current interest in authorized generics is largely due to shift in corporate strategies that has been traced to the early 1990s until that time many entrants in the pharmaceutical industry engaged exclusively either in selling brandname innovative drugs or in selling generic drugs several other brandname firms began to market authorized generics shortly before patents on their products were due to expire among such products were

and sold by dey lp43 many brandname firms did not continue to sell authorized generics at that time however reportedly due to lack of profitability44 one reason for the resurgence of authorized generics in the early 2000s is that physicians pharmacists and patients more rapidly switch to generic drugs upon their introduction to the marketplace than decade ago45 because the rate of generic adoption is much greater now brandname firms reportedly are more willing to genericize their own brands in order to capture share of that market46 the expanding generic adoption rate has also reportedly led to an industry trend where brandname houses acquire generic firms47 this development too may encourage authorized generics practice in the future in line with current trends number of

exclusivity period54 as antitrust attorney david balto explains the bounty from challenging patent is very important pharmaceutical patent litigation is multimilliondollar proposition but for the potential reward of sixmonth exclusivity that represents the vast majority of potential profits from generic entry many firms might forgo challenging patents55 for example the fda ruled that the generic manufacturer apotex was entitled to 180day exclusivity for its version of the antidepressant drug paxil in 2003 the brandname drug company glaxosmithkline introduced an auth orized generic version of paxil although apotex anticipated sales of up to 575 million during the 180day generic exclusivity period its sales were reported to be between 150 million and 200 million56 in 2004 filing with the fda attorneys for apotex asserted that the authorized generic crippled apotexs 180day exclusivityit reduced apotexs entitlement to about twothirdsto the tune of approximately 400 million57 in addition brandname firms commonly introduce authorized generics on the eve of generic competition without an independent generic patent challenger in the first instance brandname firms may themselves make diminished or delayed use of the authorized generic strategy as result the procompetitive benefits of authorized generics may be postponed or not realized at all should independent generic rivals become less willing to challenge patents held by brandname firms 58 on the other hand authorized generics potentially offer several benefits both to drug companies and to consumers authorized generics are commonly less expensive than the brandname drug the introduction of an authorized generic therefore allows lowercost product to be made available to the consumer59 as the fda opined in statement issued in july 2004 marketing of authorized generics increases competition promoting lower prices for pharmaceuticals particularly during the 180day exclusivity period in which the prices for generic

following patent expiration brandname firms may lose considerable market share indeed many health management organizations and insurance companies reportedly promote the use of generic substitutes for brandname medications once they become available61 absent participation in the generic market brandname firms may not be able to take advantage of investments they previously made with respect to their manufacturing facilities authorized generics therefore allow brandname firms to continue to employ their manufacturing faci lities at or near peak capacity even following patent expiration 62 authorized generics may also support the research and development efforts of brandname firms by providing them with additional revenue authorized generics may supply the brandname firm with an additional income source such as royalty on sales made by its generic subsidiary or contracting partner 63 these funds or some portion of them can potentially be employed in support of pharmaceutical innovation authorized generics may also facilitate settlement of patent infringement suits between brand name and independent generic firms judicial holding of patent invalidity may have severe impact upon brandname firm in terms of its lost revenue many observers also believe that patent litigation is an uncertain venture64 by settling patent litigation and allowing an anda applicant to produce an authorized generic brandname firms may potentially better manage risk such technique provides more stable revenue stream both in support of the brandname firms research and development activities and for its investors the generic company making an authorized generic can also benefit by not having to expend funds on litigation with an uncertain outcome or pursue an anda at the fda while expanding its product line acquiring manufacturing experience and gaining the firstmover advantage in the generic market 65 the use of authorized generics as litigation settlement mechanism also impacts consumers but in manner that is both less certain and likely varies on casebycase basis on one hand particular settlement agreements may provide for the sale of authorized generics years before the disputed patent is set to expire as result consumers may gain early access to lowercost alternative to the brandname drug on the other hand had the generic firm refused to settle and ultimately prevailed in the litigation then the ma rket would have been open to full competition even earlier the impact upon competition of litigation settlement likely depends upon number of complex factors including the strength of the patent the number of potential generic competitors and the precise terms of the litigation settlement agreement 61 kathleen kerr prescription hurdles need brandname drug

accompanied by legal challenges before the fda and the courts concerning this practice opponents of authorized generics have contended that the hatchwaxman acts generic exclusivity provisions should be understood as excluding authorized generics from the marketplace for the 180day period66 the fda has taken the opposite view however reasoning that the hatchwaxman act does not require brandname pharmaceutical company to file any sort of application in order to market the drug as an authorized generic 67 in turn the 180day period of generic exclusivity provided by the hatch waxman act only applies to anda or 505b2 applications with paragraph iv certifications as result the 180day generic exclusivity period does not bar authorized generics from entering the market two notable judicial opinions have recently upheld the fdas position favoring authorized generics in the first of these opinions teva pharmaceutical indu stries ltd v crawford 68 the court of appeals for the dc circuit found re asonable reading of the hatchwaxman act that would allow authorized generics to be barred by the 180day generic exclusivity period in that case independent generic manufacturer teva had previously entered into an arrangement with purepac pharmaceutical co the first paragraph iv anda applicant with respect to the drug gabapentin teva and purepac had agreed to share the 180day generic exclusivity period during that period however pfizer sold its own authorized generic version of gabapentin which was priced substantially below the price of its brandname drug 69 teva responded by petitioning the fda to prohibit the marketing of authorized generic versions of gabapentin during the 180day generic exclusivity period alternatively teva asserted that pfizer should be required to file supplemental nda snda before selling an authorized generic 70 according to teva the impact of the latter proposed ruling would lead to the same outcome as the first pfizer would be compelled to respect the 180day generic exclusivity period established by the hatchwaxman act the fda denied the petition resulting in teva lawsuit against the fda the district court confirmed the fda s views concluding that nothing in the statute provides any support for the argument that the fda can prohibit nda holders fr om entering the market with an authorized generic drug during the exclusivity period 71 teva then appealed to the court of appeals for the dc circuit which affirmed chief judge ginsburg began his opinion by obser ving that the hatchwaxman act did not stipulate the manner in which the holder of an appr oved nda must market its drug further prior to the enactment of the hatchwaxman act nothing in the food drug and cosmetic act prevented the nda holder from marketing an authorized generic the dc circuit thus saw the 66 see generic pharmaceutical association comment in support of citizen petition docket 2004p0075cp1 may 21 2004 available at httpwwwfdagovohrmsdoc

practice became unlawful when the congress passed statute that said nothing about that practice72 the court of appeals further rejected tevas functional interpretation of the hatchwaxman act according to teva the practice of authorized generics had developed only recently as routine brandname business strategy and therefore had not been anticipated by congress further authorized generics practice severely diminished generic incentives to challenge pharmaceutical patents according to teva then adhering to the literal terms of the statute would lead to an absurd result namely that the hatchwaxman act grants only meaningless exclusivity against subsequent anda filers rather than commercially effective exclusivity that runs against the nda holder as well 73 the dc circuit responded by reasoning that the balance between innovation and competition struck by the hatchwaxman act was quintessentially matter for legislative judgment such that the court must attend closely to the terms in which the congress expressed that judgment74 here chief judge ginsburg reasoned the statute was unambiguous although the hatchwaxman act barred the approval of subsequent andas for 180 days the statutory language simply did not speak to marketing arrangements made by the holder of the approved nda the court of appeals further observed that even in the event that an nda holder authorized generic the 180 day exclusivity period continued to bar other firms from marketing generic version of the drug as result authorized generic practice hardly rendered the hatchwaxman acts generic exclusivity provisions meaningless 75 in conclusion because the hatchwaxman act clearly does not prohibit the holder of an approved nda from marketing during the 180day exclusivity period its own brandgeneric version of its drug fda practices concerning authorized generics were affirmed76 second judicial opinion mylan pharmaceuticals inc v us food and drug administration 77 also concluded that the hatchwaxman act doe s not grant the fda the power to prohibit the marketing of authorized generics during the 180day exclusivity period 78 that case involved the pharmaceutical nitrofurantoin which is used to treat urinary tract infections when the fda approved paragraph iv anda filed by mylan pharmaceuticals inc to sell nitrofurantoin nda holder proctor gamble pharmaceuticals inc licensed third party generic firm to sell an authorized generic version of the drug mylan reportedly lost sales of tens of millions of dollars due to this arrangement 79 mylan challenged the fda approval of authorized generics practice before the us district court for the northern district of west virginia mylan appealed the district courts dismissal of its case to the court of appeals for the fourth circuit which affirmed citing the dc circuits decision in teva v crawford with approval the fourth circuit similarly concluded that the statute clearly defined the 180day exclusivity period only with

that although the introduction of an authorized generic may reduce the economic benefit of the 180 days of exclusivity awarded to the first paragraph iv anda applicant 355j5 biv gives legal basis for the fda to prohibit the encroachment of authorized generics on that exclusivity81 as result the district courts judgment was affirmed it is possible to criticize the statutory construction of both teva v crawford and mylan v fda in particular neither court of appeals stressed that the hatchwaxman act describes the 180day time frame as an exclusivity period82 the term exclusivity might be viewed as curious drafting choice in view of the ruling that generic firms must potentially compete alongside authorized generics during the 180day period on the other hand the notion of shared exclusivity that arose following the medicare modernization act amendments may be viewed as codifying congressional intent that multiple generic applicants may enter the market during the 180day marketing exclusivity period83 in addition many prescription drugs are available in number of different dosage forms and strengths under current hatchwaxman act practice each strength and dosage form is considered separate drug product for which distinct generic applicant can qualify for 180day exclusivity84 as result the term exclusivity may be considered to have particular meaning in the hatchwaxman actone that does not necessarily mean that independent generic firms will not face competition during the 180day period even in the absence of authorized generics of course these provisions may also impact the incentives that independent generic firms possess to challenge pharmaceutical patents in any event teva v crawford and mylan v fda currently represent the law of the land absent further judicial developments or congressional activity authorized generics will be judged as legitimate means for nda holders to market their products under the hatchwaxman act 85

expressed concerns about authorized generics practice jon leibowitz one of five ftc commissioners repor tedly stated that the introduction of an authorized generic will likely diminish incentives for generic firms to challenge patents and incur substantial development and litigation costs88 although the commissioner was said to be skeptical that authorized generics practice violated the antitrust laws he reportedly stated that he was persuaded that authorized generics may have competitive implications that could upset the waxmanhatch balance 89 the ftc is currently considering the authorized generics issue at greater length in response to written request by three us senators the ftc agreed to study how competition between paragraph iv generics and authorized generics during the 180day exclusivity period has affected shortrun price competition and longrun prospects for entry by paragraph iv generics90 the ftc will also address the impact of generic drug entry on the price of

unlikely to harm competition and can indeed benefit consumers94 the authors initially observed that authorized generics may potentially improve consumer welfare in several respects in particular by introducing price competition the authorized generic could reduce the average price of the drug and result in greater marketplace penetration95 because an authorized generic is identical to the brandname drug consumers who are loyal to the brandname drug may also be encouraged to switch to the lowercost authorized generic alternative 96 according to the berndt study because numerous factors determine the profitability of generic drugs the additional variable of authorized generics should not substantially impact the decision of an independent generic firm to file paragraph iv anda these factors include the possibilities that the independent generic firm was not the first paragraph iv applicant that the fda may not approve its anda and that other in dependent generic firms may sell the identical drug at different dosage level during the 180day exclusivity period 97 because independent generic firms have traditionally filed paragraph iv andas despite these risks the authors reason that it is not clear that one additional factor authorized generic entry is sufficient to discourage many patent challenges98 the report further observed that even with the entry of an authorized generic into the relevant market the expected profits may still suffice to induce patent challenges99 the berndt study additionally reported empirical findings that although the 180day exclusivity period significantly increased shortrun generictobrand price ratios it had scant impact upon longrun generictobrand price ratios stated differently once multiple generic products enter the market the historical existence of an earlier 180day generic exclusivity period had little effect upon drug pricing the authors conclude that high generic penetration and low generictobrand price ratios are achieved in the long run regardless of whether successful paragraph iv certifications occurred 100 the berndt study further addressed the concern that authorized generics may potentially delay generic entry according to the authors it has been argued that authorized generics will deter paragraph iv certifications and potentially delay generic entry most drugs however do not face paragraph iv certification historically only about 20 percent have if the anticipation of authorized generic entry decreases incentives for paragraph iv certifications for the drugs that do face paragraph iv certification it will do so in those cases with the least lik elihood of success as result generic entry will not be delayed for most drugs if any 101 to elaborate on this latter point the report reasoned that authorized generics may also lead to the salutary effect of reducing wasteful litigation according to the authors independent generics 94 id at 1 95 id at 16 96 id at 13 97 id

time as result the paragraph iv certifications that may be deterred by the pr ospect of authorized generic entry would most likely have lower likelihood of success than average102 because such litigation is less likely to lead to improved consumer access to independent generic drugs any potential discouragement of this litigation due to authorized generics practice is unlikely to impact competition and public health the berndt study explained some of the contentions of the berndt study may be subject to criticism first while it is true that the percentage of andas with paragraph iv certifications is relatively low that set of challenged patents are most likely the ones with sufficient sales to attract generic interest103 in turn the challenged patents are likely to have disproportionate impact upon public health second although experience with authorized generics has thus far been limited some commentators believe that this practice is growing 104 if so the marketplace presence of authorized generics may not amount merely to one risk among many but rather certainty finally although successful patent challenge may not have much impact upon drug prices years after the patent was scheduled to expire anyway such challenge ordinarily allows generic competition to take place earlier than had the patent not been invalidated105 the judicial holding that pharmaceutical patent is invalid has significant short and mediumterm consequences including lower consumer expenditures on that dication but also the innovators diminished ability to recoup research and development costs achieving the socially optimal balance between innovation and competition ultimately remains difficult policy question that authorized generics practice renders even more complex

reiffin of the us commodity future trading commission and michael r ward member of the economics faculty of the university of texas at arlington concluded under current fda regulations the branded firm is not prohibited from producing an authorized generic drug during the exclusivity period as in the analysis above the introduction of branded generic drug will reduce the successful litigants

the validity of patents in some cases107 in reaching this conclusion reiffin and ward explained that relatively few authorized generics had been introduced in the united states because the decision of an independent generic firm to submit paragraph iv anda occurs prior to patent expiration the authors asserted that it seems reasonable to assume that the branded firms action in the instances in which it took place was not anticipated by independent generic producers at the time they began the anda process 108 their report therefore develops an economic model representing stylized version of pharmaceutical industry characteristics and economic intuition109 although the reiffin and ward model is complex its analysis is founded upon the notion that earlier entry by firm into generic market implies greater economic rents for that firm110 generic firms essentially compete to obtain the largest rents by being the first market entrant followed by diminished rewards for achieving second place further diminished rewards for third place and so on as additional firms commence sales the authors analysis reveals several salient points about authorized generics practice under their model the anticipated entry of authorized generics should crowd out more than one independent generic firm111 second the primary effect of branded generic strategy is to transfer rents from the consumer to the patent holder112 finally the effect of authorized generics upon generic drug prices is according to reiffin and ward less significant for larger markets than smaller ones113 some of the reasoning of the reiffin and ward study also is not immune to criticism the authors are undoubtedly correct that past experience with authorized generics may not suggest the future impact of this practice given the reported resurgence of authorized generic introductions in recent years 114 nonetheless at least with respect to some medications there has been shortage of firms willing to compete in generic markets despite knowledge of potential competition for example on june 9 2004 the fda authorized fourteen firms to market bayers cipro cirprofoxacin115 similarly on july 29 2004 thirteen firms received fda approval to market generic versions of pfizers diflucan fluconazole116 due to the possibility of shared 107 id at 2829 two other studies reached similar conclusions one study written by

amendments to the hatchwaxman act as recently as 2003 118 authorized generics were not subject to discussion at that time the rise of this practice as well as the vigor of the debate surrounding it suggests both the pace of change within the industry and the prominence of the pharmaceutical industry within the national public health system as discussion of authorized generics continues congress may wish to have sense of its legislative options should congress conclude that authorized generics are appropriate then it may simply take action the opinions of the dc and fourth circuits suggest that as currently drafted the hatchwaxman act does not allow the fda to restrict the ability of brandname firms to sell or approve of authorized generics119 absent legislative input the fda may be unlikely to alter its interpretation of the hatchwaxman act in this respect in the future if congress instead believes that authorized generics practice may instead disrupt the bounty system established by the hatchwaxman act one option is to require brandname firms to file supplemental nda or similar application with the fda120 this filing would then place the brandname firm in the same category as generic applicants who did not qualify as the first to file in turn the 180day generic exclusivity period would then apply to the authorized generic alternatively congress could simp ly disallow authorized generics practice at least during the 180day generic exclusivity period notably whether the 180day generic exclusivity period strikes an appropriate balance between encouraging patent challenges and ensuring prompt access to generic medications is itself contested proposition within the pharmaceutical industry121 discussion of the authorized generics issue may also prompt further reflection on the basic structure of incentives within the hatch waxman act current interest in authorized generics reflects longstanding congressional concern for the appropriate balance between innovation and competition within the pharmaceutical industry although academic inquiry into authorized generics practice remains in its early phases it is notable that knowledgeable commentators have reached disparate views of the benefits or detriments of this practice some observers stress that authorized generics benefit consumers by providing enhanced access to lowercost alternatives to branded drugs while others express 117 see supra notes 3638 and accompanying text 118 medicare modernization and improvement act pl 108173 117 stat 2066 2003 119 see supra notes 6881
