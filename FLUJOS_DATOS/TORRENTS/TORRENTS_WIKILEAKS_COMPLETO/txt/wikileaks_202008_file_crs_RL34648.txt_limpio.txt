earmarks by at least half for fy2008 appropriations relative to fy2005 and 2 place them only in statutory text not report language in january 2007 the administration issued its own definition of earmark whose language and perhaps meaning evolved over time in office of management and budget omb memoranda final definition appears to have been established in eo 13457 but its meaning probably is

congressional earmark and congressionally directed spending item with bush administration definitions for earmark 5 bush administration policy regarding congressionally originated earmarks an overview introduction1 budgeting has been defined as the allocation of scarce resources2 it involves choices about how to raise revenues and allocate resources among alternative purposes locations and recipients these choices frequently are made in an environment of competing views about the public interest leading one scholar to conclude that conflict is endemic to budgeting3 conflict may arise for example because federal policy makers often have different priorities about the sources and uses of public funds some priorities may be based on policy makers views on the proper role of government the offices and positions in government they hold or the constituencies they represent policy makers also may have different views on who decides in the federal budget process one such area of budgetary conflict has concerned earmarking specific definitions for the term earmark and related terms like congressional earmark and presidential earmark vary considerably and are controversial4 nevertheless all of the terms relate to the use of discretion to allocate funding or other benefits to one or more specific purposes entities or geographic areas during the 110th congress the house of representatives the senate and the george w bush administration defined the terms congressional earmark congressionally directed spending item and earmark respectively in addition the house senate and president provided directions for how congressionally originated earmarks are to be handled during the budget process in january 2008 for example the president announced he would veto future appropriations bills that did not cut the number and funding of administrationdefined and identified earmarks by half relative to fy2008 the president also issued executive order eo 13457 which directed that agencies should not fund nonstatutory earmarks except under some 1 justin murray information research specialist in the knowledge services group provided research support for this report

josseybass 1999 p 30 4 for clarity references to specific terms in this report are shown in italics crs2 conditions5 omb subsequently directed agencies on how to implement the eo after enactment of fy2009 continuing and regular appropriations these are the latest in series of developments that began in early 2007 when the president made proposals regarding earmarks originated by congress and the office of management and budget omb issued series of memoranda and took corresponding actions to implement the presidents policy this report provides an analysis of bush administration policy regarding congressionally originated earmarks focusing primarily on the veto threat and eo and related issues for congress6 to provide context and an analytical foundation the report first discusses conceptual definitions of earmarkrelated terms it then examines potential explanations of why earmarking might occur and several concerns that have been expressed about earmarking because the bush administration expressed interest in congressionally originated earmarks before the 110th congress the report briefly reviews previous administration policy statements and proposals subsequent sections discuss and analyze the administrations veto threat and executive order the report culminates with potential issues for congress including the potential for developments to affect the roles of congress and the president in the budget process because the eo formally will remain in effect unless it is revoked some of these issues may continue to be relevant after the swearing in of the next president furthermore because bush administration policy was articulated in some detail aspects of the policy may be relevant to future discussion of federal budgeting and earmarking issues conceptions about earmarking any discussion of earmarks cannot escape the matter of definitions7 as noted earlier specific definitions for the term earmark and related terms like congressional earmark congressional directive presidential earmark administration earmark executive branch earmark and directed spending vary 5 executive order 13457 protecting american taxpayers from government spending on wasteful earmarks 73 federal register 6417 jan 29 2008 6 additional topics concerning bush administration policy regarding congressionally originated earmarks are not addressed in detail in this report these topics include 1 omb memoranda and their directions to agencies for fy2007 and fy2008 2 agency responses to the omb memoranda 3 analysis of the evolution meanings and potential implications of several versions of the administrations definition of earmark 4 comparison of administration and congressional definitions of earmarkrelated terms 5 administration actions related to earmarks or lack of earmarks in fy2007 and fy2008 appropriations 6 creation and implementation of an omb earmarks website and database and 7 the legal status of congressionally originated nonstatutory earmarks 7 throughout this report earmarkrelated terms are used in relation to spending provisions due to the focus of bush administration activities on the same subject some observers however might use the term formally or colloquially to apply to tax or tariff benefits and other forms of federal assistance or benefits crs3 considerably and are controversial8 nevertheless all of the terms relate to the use of discretion to allocate particularized benefits subsets of funding or other resources or benefits through law nonstatutory direction eg report language which is not legally binding or administrative action eg making budget proposal or awarding contract or grant to one or more specific purposes entities or geographic areas practices like earmarking have been used for decades if not centuries to make decisions regarding the allocation of public resources9 but concerns also have been expressed at the same time congress its members and presidents have asserted the prerogatives of their respective constitutional and statutory authorities and pursued their budget policy preferences earmarks or similar practices that result in functionally equivalent outcomes might be originated by members of congress the president or agencies or possibly jointly congressionally originated earmarks earmarks may be included by the house or senate or at the initiative of member or committee of congress in appropriations authorization or revenue bills which when enacted have the force of law many appropriationsrelated earmarks commonly are included in report language and joint explanatory statements the latter documents do not have the force of law but typically accompany legislation and communicate to agencies congressional intent expectations directions understandings exhortations and warnings10 in some instances provisions within report language and joint explanatory statements may be incorporated expressly or by reference into the text of statute making them legally binding11 presidentially and agencyoriginated earmarks presidential and agency earmarking may be less familiar than congressional activity yet appears to be functionally equivalent for example former omb official reportedly said that as he recalls presidents use earmarks much as 8 single definition of the term earmark or other earmarkrelated term has been embraced by all practitioners and observers of the appropriations revenue and budget processes contributing factor to the difficulty of defining the term and its variants is that the mere act of budgeting allocating subsets of resources or benefits to specific purposes entities or geographic areas could be considered by some observers to be form of earmarking regardless of whether the allocation is being done by congress the president or an agency official for background on the definition issue see crs report 98518 earmarks and limitations in appropriations bills by sandy streeter 9 for example see us government accountability

or program or 4 facilitated by using discretion to make entities or geographic areas eligible to receive benefits the president political appointees career civil servants or combinations thereof may be involved in any of these activities during and after the fy2008 appropriations process for instance some members of congress reportedly have viewed actions by the president and executive agencies as amounting to earmarks13 joint or hybrid earmarks an earmark may be included in bill or report language at the prompting of the white house or an agency at any point in the legislative process joint origination also may occur with regard to presidents or agencys plans and actions for budget execution eg after discussions between members of congress and agency officials or the president instances such as these might raise questions about whether an earmark should then be considered congressionally or presidentially originated or alternatively be considered hybrid the concept of joint or hybrid earmark suggests that it may not be simple matter to categorize earmarking decisions definitively as the exclusive domain of one branch of government or another definitions in the 110th congress during the 110th congress the house senate and bush administration have defined terms like congressional earmark congressionally directed spending item and earmark and provided some direction for how congressionally originated earmarks according to these definitions are to be handled in the budget process various definitions developed by the house senate and bush administration are listed in table

earmarking there are several potential explanations of why congress the president or an agency might earmark resources or benefits these could include members of congress representing constituents in their electoral jurisdictions14 congress fulfilling its constitutional obligation to exercise the power of the purse and sometimes to prevent encroachment by other branches of government15 congress defining or constraining the scope of an agencys or the presidents ability to exercise control of the allocation of public funds and resources16 congress providing flexibility to agencies to adapt to changing conditions by not prescribing earmarked allocations in law and instead earmarking through report language17 congress inviting and facilitating interbranch communications about congressional intent and expectations agency needs etc18 congress the president or an agency supplementing or supplanting funding provided by nonfederal sources for activities or projects congress the president or

challenge individual spending items25 and earmarking is done in many instances for good and sufficient policy reasons but in more recent years the amount of earmarking has virtually exploded and the motivation behind the earmarks the nature of the earmarks has become more parochial and more political rather than based on legitimate policy differences between the two branches of government26 concerns and questions about activities that some observers see as presidential or executive agency earmarking include an explosion in contracting being engaged in by the administration especially contracting that is solesourced or not fully competitive27 and rapid growth in nobid and limitedcompetition contracts in recent years reportedly from 675 billion in 2000 to 2069 billion in 200628 perceived comparative lack of transparency for presidential earmarks because the information is hard to get for all the talk of bringing transparency to congresss work its earmarks compared with the presidents are relatively simple to find in spending bills and their companion committee reports29 and concerns about the use of discretion to allocate funds in ways not approved by congress such as

interest in congressionally originated earmarks for example the presidents budget proposal for fy2002 proposed to curtail congressional earmarking especially for special interest spending31 the next year the presidents budget proposal for fy2003 devoted considerable attention to earmarks originated by congress stating congressional earmarking mars meritbased processes for distributing the american peoples resources32 the budget volume contained agencyspecific discussions of the subject in addition it contained general statements characterizing the administrations views on the use of budgetary discretion by the president and agency officials on one hand versus the use of budgetary discretion by congress on the other the administration appeared to put less emphasis on earmarks in its budget proposal for fy200433 in subsequent years under its program assessment rating tool part initiative the administration focused on congressionally originated earmarks in specific areas in the parts first year for example an illustrative administration statement was that earmarked funding will not contribute to the programs longterm goals as set by the administration34 bush administration policy during the 110th congress during the 110th congress the subjects of congressionally originated earmarks and more generally the use of discretion in budgetary decision making garnered significant attention from both congress and the bush administration35 the house of representatives amended house rule xxi on january 5 2007 to define the term congressional earmark and the senate established new rule xliv on september 14 2007 to define congressionally directed spending item see table 1 both chambers also adopted requirements for the disclosure of congressionally originated

bush administration actions prior to eo 13457 in various forums during january and february 2007 the president proposed that congressionally originated earmarks should be cut by at least 50 in number and funding in fy2008 appropriations relative to fy2005 and longer included in nonstatutory report language36 omb subsequently issued several memoranda to the heads of executive branch agencies that articulated administration policies defined the term earmark in several iterations and required agencies to take certain actions specifically an omb january 2007 memorandum provided an official administration definition for the term earmark see table 137 in addition to the definition the memorandums attachment b provided full page of additional guidance on the definition which arguably was an inseparable part of the definition for example attachment b said congressional direction that places restrictions on some portion of administrationrequested funding would count as an earmark38 nevertheless terms and expressions in the definition including circumvents merit based competitive otherwise curtails and control critical aspects were left undefined or partially defined the memorandum also directed agencies and omb to identify and publicize information about congressionally originated earmarks on the internet in order to call on congress to reduce earmark numbers and funding relative to fy2005 three weeks later an omb february 2007 memorandum instructed agencies on how to handle nonstatutory congressionally originated earmarks for the fy2007 budget based on ombs interpretation of the fullyear continuing resolution for fy200739 according to the chairmen of the house and senate appropriations 36 presidential proposals that congress reduce the number of earmarks by 50 and cease placing earmarks in report language were made in rose garden press conference on jan 3 2007 in the 2007 state of the union message on jan 23 2007 and in the presidents budget proposal

elements of the administrations january 2007 definition released in ombs january 2007 memorandum the omb january 2007 memorandum provided the most comprehensive explanation to date of the meanings of

the absence of nonstatutory earmarks section ii of the memorandum told agencies to apply authorized discretion using transparent and meritbased determinations to achieve program objectives consistent with the purpose of the statute and administration policy including the presidents budget viewed in concert with the omb january 2007 memorandum the february 2007 memorandums use of terms may have had implications for how to understand the administrations definition of earmark in the january 2007 memorandum and the administrations characterizations of its own budgetary decision making among other things section ii appeared to leave open the possibility of overlap between the terms meritbased and consistent with administration policy in some contexts starting in march 2007 omb followed up on its january 2007 memorandum by establishing an earmarks website in succeeding months the website presented an expanding database of administrationdefined and identified earmarks corresponding to fy2005 appropriations fy2008 appropriations fy2009 appropriations and several past authorization measures41 the websites explicit purposes were among others to establish benchmark for measuring whether congress achieved the presidents cut in half goal for fy2008 and to encourage and inform the debate over how taxpayers money is spent42 the homepage of the website also included as its first paragraph somewhat different definition of earmark from the one published in january 2007 see table 1 with the posting of individual earmarks in ombs database it became possible to observe how the administrations definition of earmark was implemented in practice many of the administrations designations of items as earmarks focused on congressional specification in bill or report language of receiving entity or geographic location congressionally specified items that previously had been requested by the administration did not appear to be included in the database other items in the database fell outside the category of specifying recipient or geographic location however43 for example the datasets of fy2005 appropriations and authorization 39 continued congressional ear mar ks

if all such instances are included in the database may 2007 memorandum provided another somewhat different administration definition of earmark see table 145 the may memorandum instructed agencies to closely track earmarks during the fy2008 appropriations process to measure whether congress met the presidents goal final action on fy2008 appropriations occurred in late 2007 with enactment of the department of defense appropriations act 2008 pl 110116 and the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 on january 29 2008 omb posted summary tally of administrationidentified fy2008 earmark

crs14 earmarks50 issued the next day eo 13457 outlines what appear to be three explicit purposes 1 reducing the number and funding of earmarks originated by congress 2 making their origin and purposes transparent and 3 including congressionally originated earmarks in the text of bills instead of other documents eo 13457 then instructs that agencies should not fund nonstatutory earmarks except when required by law or when an agency has itself determined project program activity grant or other transaction to have merit under statutory criteria or other meritbased decisionmaking the order also provides new definition of earmark this time however the definition was provided in document with binding force on agencies see also table 1 the term earmark means funds provided by the congress for projects programs or grants where the purported congressional direction whether in statutory text report language or other communication circumvents otherwise applicable meritbased or competitive allocation processes or specifies the location or recipient or otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to the funds allocation process for all legislation enacted after january 29 2008 eo 13457 requires agency heads to take all necessary steps to ensure that agency funding decisions for any earmark are based on the text of laws and not based on variety of nonstatutory means including any other nonstatutory statement or indication of views of the congress or house committee member officer or staff thereof agency funding decisions for any earmark are based on authorized transparent statutory criteria and meritbased decision making51 and oral or written communications concerning earmarks shall supersede statutory criteria competitive awards or meritbased decisionmaking the executive order also outlines the process by which agency heads are required to handle congressional communications about nonstatutory earmarks communications are required to be received in writing in order to be considered in addition they are required to be posted on the internet by the receiving agency within 30 days unless otherwise specifically directed by the head of the agency without delegation after consultation with the director of the office of management and budget 50 the transcript of the speech is available at httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases 2008012008012813html 51 the executive order requires decisions to be made according to instructions in the omb february 2007 memorandum which in the absence of congressionally originated nonstatutory earmarks directed agency decision making to be consistent with the purpose of the statute and administration policy including the presidents budget in areas of authorized discretion crs15 analysis of eo 13457 eo 13457 taken in the context of other administration action related to earmarking policies52 appears to reflect comprehensive articulation of the administrations 1 definition of earmark and 2 views on the appropriate roles of congress and the president in the allocation of resources and benefits for public purposes53 among other things it could be argued that the executive order reflects view that congressional allocation of resources and benefits for public purposes often leads to wasteful spending if it does not leave to the president and his administration discretion to make certain funding allocations based on its interpretations of merit competition and statutory criteria54 in this view congressional direction that would fully limit the presidents or an agencys discretion for example congressional specification of location or recipient in statute or report language would appear to be automatically considered an earmark it could also be argued that the administrations various definitions have used terms such as control and manage to mean the administrations use of discretion to allocate funds in ways that comport with the administrations views of competition and merit without certain restrictions terms such as merit and restrictions are left undefined or partially defined however the administration has not explicitly articulated its position on the appropriate roles of congress and the president in the allocation of resources and benefits for public purposes number of more specific observations might be offered about aspects of eo 13457 both when viewed alone and in combination with the presidents veto threat in the 2008 state of the union speech budgeting roles of congress and the president if agencies comply with eo 13457 as written the eo might alter the effectiveness of nonstatutory 52 it is not clear whether the various earmark definitions included in the omb memoranda or on ombs earmarks website should be regarded as equivalent iterative or authoritative expressions of administration policy at the time they were issued from the available documents however it seems possible that the administration might view the different versions as being substantively equivalent this could be the case because the various versions have not been explained by omb to be different definitions in earlier memoranda have not been withdrawn or revised and one memorandum issued in may 2007 indicated that omb and agencies would continue to use prior definition used in the collection of data from fy2005 upon which the fy2008 50 cut goal was based nevertheless it is likely that the definition promulgated in eo 13457 is the final version for more on executive orders see crs report rs20846 executive orders issuance and revocation by tj halstead 53 to the extent the administration views the definitions it has used as equivalent ie having substantive changes in meaning see table 1 specific terms contained within the definitions might have equivalent meanings eg the administration and the executive branch control and manage allocate and manage and control critical aspects and properly allocate 54 quotation is from the white house see 2008 budget fact sheets document p 3 of pdf file available at httpwwwwhitehousegovinfocusbudgetbudgetfy2008pdf and from omb see fact sheet balanced budget by 2012 earmark reform p 2 of pdf file available at httpwwwwhitehousegovombpubpress2007factsheet_010307pdf crs16 earmarking by congress agencies typically have felt an obligation to comply with these congressional directives in place of these practices the eo could be used to attempt to reverse roles with members who seek nonstatutory earmarks making formal requests of agencies and possibly the white house according to the eo agency funding decisions but not necessarily white house decisions are to be made in the manner set forth in section ii of the omb february 2007 memorandum under the memorandum decisions are required to be based on 1 statutory criteria such as funding formulas eligibility standards and meritbased decisionmaking which often leave considerable discretion and 2 in areas of significant discretion meritbased determinations the basis for meritbased determinations is not further defined in the eo or february 2007 memorandum except that decisions in areas of significant discretion would be required to be consistent with the purpose of the statute and administration policy including the presidents budget given various estimates of the extent of earmarking originated by congress the resources involved are considerable likely amounting to billions of dollars at the same time the resources constitute only small percentage less than 1 of the annual federal budget nearly 3 trillion in estimated outlays for fy200855 extent and manner of earmarking when viewing the eo and veto threat in combination one could argue that the administration appears to be calling on congress to both 1 legislate in detail in statute when allocating resources and benefits instead of providing general lump sums in law and then being more specific in report language and at the same time 2 not legislate in detail too much or risk veto it could also be argued that the process described in eo 13457 might strengthen the presidents discretion influence and control over agency decision making which may change the relationship between congress and the executive agencies in combination the eo backed up by presidential vetoes if effective could be used in an attempt to limit congresss legislative activities that concern resource allocation to only statutory text such scenario also may leave uncertain the efficacy of many if not most other means that congress has developed for overseeing and influencing agency resource allocation activities white house role in agency decisions it is not possible to predict how eo 13457 might be used in practice or might change interbranch dynamics should it be strictly implemented the eos framework however appears to allow the white house to become the arbiter of decisions about whether to honor nonstatutory earmarks if it wished to do so for example omb could influence the processes for deciding the merit of nonstatutory earmarks the omb director has role in determining whether to publicly disclose congressional requests or recommendations on the internet and is provided the authority in the eo to issue additional but unspecified instructions to agency heads it is conceivable that the eo if it increases white house influence in agency decision making might be used by president as leverage at any point in the legislative process regarding presidential nominations or in other realms of interaction among congress agencies the president and perhaps also nonfederal 55 us executive office of the president office of management and budget budget of the us government fiscal year 2009 washington gpo 2008 p 139 crs17 actors public disclosure or nondisclosure of nonstatutory earmark requests and by implication the prospect of agency or administration decisions on the requests could also occur only after consultation with the omb director as the eo is implemented over time however experience might provide information on what ombs role or roles will be in practice agency consideration of nonstatutory earmarks eo 13457 does not require agencies to disregard nonstatutory earmarks rather the eo states that agencies should not commit obligate or expend funds on the basis of earmarks included in any nonstatutory source italics added even if an agency viewed nonstatutory earmark as having merit under two explicit circumstances statutory criteria or other meritbased decisionmaking the eo does not strictly prohibit the agency from funding the nonstatutory earmark therefore these two explicit exceptions to the direction that agencies should not commit obligate or expend funds would appear to be only subset of the potential exceptions to the administrations policy about whether or not to fund nonstatutory earmark for example if nonstatutory earmark were considered by an agency to have merit it appears that decision to fund the earmark might still be made on the basis of administration policy including the presidents budget pursuant to section 2aiis citation of the omb february 2007 memorandum or in response to input from omb or the white house received under the eos section 2b and 2c provisions administration definition of earmark the eos definition of earmark is not precise congressional direction that specifies the location or recipient appears to be clear in how it has been and would continue to be applied other language in the definition however relies on largely undefined terms and expressions that might allow for an expansive interpretation if the administration wished to use one56 specifically the eo definition provides two additional criteria that would classify purported congressional direction whether in statutory text report language or other communication to be an earmark the additional criteria are congressional direction that 1 circumvents otherwise applicable meritbased or competitive allocation processes or 2 otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to the funds allocation process with regard to the first omb has made statements that formulation of the presidents budget proposal is meritbased and competitive allocation process statement during press briefing by omb director jim nussle in which he compared administration budget formulation with congressional earmarking is illustrative were very transparent about all our proposals theyre out there for the world to see now on the internet especially these proposals are justified with number of detailed evidence sic behind them to justify exactly why we want to spend the programs where we want to spend them theyre also meritbased and often competitively bid most often competitively bid and they have the ability for congress to pick and choose unfortunately congress doesnt always 56 for example the order does not define the terms circumvents otherwise applicable meritbased competitive otherwise curtails manage and the executive branchs statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to the funds allocation process crs18 do that with its earmarking process there are many that are airdropped in into report language and nobody sees until the last moment that congress hasnt even voted on or doesnt even consider in open forum or open hearing so i think its much different situation and we have scrubbed through our budget for those kinds of situations and have removed them where we thought that was the case but we believe that the congress needs to change its ways on earmarking57 if the eo definition of earmark as congressional direction that circumvents otherwise applicable meritbased or competitive allocation processes were interpreted in light of such administration statements the definition might leave open the possibility of an expansive interpretation being applied for example it may be that the definition could include within its ambit congressional direction that diverges from the presidents annual budget request the second criterion relating to congressional direction that curtails the ability of the executive branch to manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to the funds allocation process also is not precise and could be interpreted expansively if the administration wished to do so potential implications for nonstatutory reprogramming it is not clear what impact if any eo 13457 would have on nonstatutory reprogramming directions imposed by congress on agencies reprogramming typically refers to an agency shifting funds among activities within an appropriations accounts lump sum resulting in an allocation different from what was contemplated at the time appropriations were enacted eg based on agency budget justification documents and other representations58 congressional reprogramming directions eg limiting how much can be shifted from one activity to another requiring congressional notification or approval are often included in report language and as such may not be legally binding appropriations committees have used reprogramming for decades to maintain oversight of agency activities and ensure that agencies allocate resources consistently with congressional intentions while at the same time balancing an additional priority of giving agencies flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances rather than embed restrictions in law which might be difficult and cumbersome to change in timely way59 it is not clear whether the administrations definition of earmark could be applied to reprogramming requirements and restrictions

appropriations act 2009 into law60 the act included 3 of the 12 regular appropriations acts for fy2009 longterm continuing appropriations resolution cr for the remaining 9 regular appropriations acts providing funds through march 6 2009 and supplemental appropriations act for disaster relief and recovery61 leading up to enactment the president did not make any specific veto threats to fy2009 appropriations bills in statements of administration policy saps on the basis of administrationdefined earmarks three weeks after enactment of the legislation on october 23 2008 omb issued instructions to the heads of executive agencies on how to implement the fy2009 consolidated appropriations act in accordance with eo 1345762 criteria for funding statutory earmarks in cr ombs memorandum addressed several subjects first the memorandum told agencies that in implementing the continuing appropriations resolution 2009 division of the law agencies are legally obligated to fund an earmark as defined under the eo only under certain conditions in implementing the continuing appropriations resolution 2009 the fy09 cr agencies are legally obligated to fund an earmark only if the project program or grant is an earmark that meets all three of the following criteria 1 was in the statutory text of the fy08enacted appropriation including earmarks that were statutorily incorporated by reference 2 was of continuing nature rather than of onetime nonrecurring nature and 3 could not be carried out by funding the earmark in the remainder of fy09 following the expiration of the fy09 cr if congress ultimately decides to provide continued funding in fy09 for that earmark63 the memorandum explained that if an earmark does not meet all three criteria then during the fy09 cr period an agency must only fund the earmark if the agency has itself determined that it has merit under statutory criteria or other meritbased decisionmaking this instruction referred to the eo and its incorporation by reference of directions included in section ii of the omb february 2007 memorandum 60 pl 110329 122 stat 3574 61 for detailed information and legislative history see crs report

httpwwwwhitehousegovombmemorandafy2009m0903pdf 63 ibid p 1 emphasis in original crs20 the memorandum further explained ombs third criterion which directed agencies to be restrictive in how they fund statutory earmarks since congress has directed agencies in section 110 of the fy2009 cr to implement only the most limited funding action of that permitted agencies shall not fund during the fy09 cr period those fy08 statutory earmarks that were of continuing nature if such earmarks could still be funded in the remainder of fy09 following the expiration of the fy09 cr if congress ultimately decides to provide continued funding in fy09 for those fy08earmarked projects and activities in other words if an agency were to fund such fy08 earmarks during the fy09 cr period then the agency would be infringing upon the prerogative of congress in the coming months to set fullyear fy09 funding levels in this regard congress in the fy09 cr did not direct agencies to fund the fy08 statutory earmarks during the fy09 cr period64 nonstatutory earmarks and the cr for purposes of the fy2009 long term cr the memorandum also addressed nonstatutory earmarks that were in the reports and other nonstatutory materials that concerned either the fy08 appropriations acts or the not yet enacted fullyear fy09 appropriations bills for those activities and programs that are funded by the fy09 cr the memorandum cited supreme court opinions that nonstatutory earmarks are not legally binding in addition the memorandum told agencies that in accordance with provisions of both eo 13457 and the cr they shall not fund nonstatutory earmarks during the fy09 cr period65 instead the memorandum directed agencies to follow the requirements of the eo restriction on new starts in the cr the memorandum concluded its discussion of the cr by noting that the fy2009 longterm cr included language prohibiting new starts omb suggested this prohibition would apply to some earmarks earmarks in supplemental and regular appropriations acts and executive branch disclosure the memorandum also directly addressed statutory and nonstatutory earmarks contained in the supplemental and three regular appropriations acts funding in these acts was not subject to the longterm crs various restrictions for statutory earmarks omb stated that agencies shall implement them in manner consistent with applicable law quoting the eo for nonstatutory earmarks the memorandum recited provisions of the eo that agencies are required to follow in the latter case it is not clear how or when agencies will work with omb to determine which nonstatutory earmarks will be made publicly available on the internet per the eos requirements and which will remain undisclosed by the executive branch subsequent to the eos required consultation between an agency head and the director of omb 64 ibid p 3 emphasis in original 65 in this context the memorandum cited the crs provisions that provided funding sec 101 and preserved congressional prerogatives to make final fullyear funding decisions by requiring only the most limited funding action in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities sec 110 crs21 potential issues for congress the articulation and evolution of bush administration policy regarding congressionally originated earmarks may have implications for congressional budgeting and earmarking practices working relations between congress and the president and working relations between congress and agencies the policy therefore may raise several general and specific issues for congress including the following what are the appropriate budgetary roles and responsibilities for congress the president agencies and the public in the us political system how should earmarks be defined identified and overseen what are the implications for congress of the bush administrations executive order 13457 what are the implications for congress of the omb earmarks website and database of congressionally originated earmarks might administration actions have consequences for congressional representational activities budgetary roles and responsibilities in the us political system congress the president and individual agencies all have roles in the federal budget process sometimes working together and sometimes at crosspurposes the constitution establishes basic framework for this interaction the framers of the constitution intended for congress the president and the courts to work together but also to jealously guard their own prerogatives in order to better achieve the varied purposes set forth in the preamble to the constitution in the words of james madison there would be under the constitution separation of the departments of power rather than complete separation of these departments however the principle called for connectedness and blending unless these departments be so far connected and blended as to give to each constitutional control over the others the degree of separation which the maxim of separation of the departments of power requires as essential to free government can never in practice be duly maintained66 under the constitution for example congress may use its power of the purse to specify through law in greater or lesser detail the process of how resources are to be allocated and distributed congress can also communicate to agencies through non statutory means such as report language for example congress might communicate its intent concerning how resources are to be allocated in circumstances when legislating in detail might become unwieldy galvanize opposition or constrain the ability of agencies to adapt to changing circumstances 66 federalist 48 in james madison alexander hamilton and john jay the federalist papers p 308 see also federalist 47 p 302 crs22 in taking either of these actions statutory or nonstatutory congress may affect the decisions that the president and individual agencies make by 1 expanding or diminishing opportunities to use discretion 2 increasing or decreasing transparency of presidential decisions or actions and 3 increasing or decreasing the independence of federal agencies from presidential influence and policy preferences the congressional decisions and processes might also leave greater or lesser amounts of discretion to agencies in executing the law and allocating resources the president in turn could potentially influence congressional decision making through tools such as the veto power annual spending proposals that are required by law arguably superior access to and control over information from agencies and the ability to influence public opinion the president may also influence decisions made by agencies through appointments of senior officials subject to senate confirmation and the use at times of other levers to control agency decisions which at times have been restricted by congress67 in some respects agencies are sometimes caught in the middle between congress and the president in their efforts to control and influence the purpose design and implementation of public policy68 from another perspective agencies also 67 for example

1977 and louis fisher presidential spending power continued crs23 sometimes wield influence or autonomy in constraining and helping to shape the actions of congress and the president in concert with coalitions of diverse stakeholders in the broader political system69 the administration has stated that congressionally originated earmarks are awarded through congressional political process favoring those who have direct access to elected officials or indirect access through lobbyists70 the administration has juxtaposed this perspective with view of presidential and agency decision making that is subject to competitive or meritbased process to ensure higher priorities are funded first71 this raises other questions for example is budgetary decision making in the white house among political appointees or among career civil servants less political than in congress or is it political in different way what role does access to elected or appointed officials either directly or through lobbyists play in budgetary decision making in the executive branch given the apparent room for the exercise of discretion by congress the president and agency officials at various points in the budget process how should constitutional obligations and powers be reconciled with practical considerations and concerns how may diverse views about representation constitutionally prescribed responsibilities effectiveness efficiency equity transparency ethics and accountability be reconciled in addition the president proposed that congress stop including earmarks in report language and instead place them in statute he expressed his intention to enforce the proposal with his executive order congress and agencies have long history of using report language to guide agency decisions facilitate communications and accountability and provide more specificity in expectations about actions or funding interaction with agencies through report language at times may provide flexibility to agencies that would not be available if provisions were included in statute some observers see report language as allowing insufficient scrutiny in the legislative process as the administration has argued others however see report language as facilitating twoway communication between congress and agencies one analyst judged that controls in report language have proved to be helpful device in

agencies in terms of control over the design and implementation of public policies what are the potential consequences for relations and communications between appropriations committees and agencies if agencies ignore expressions of congressional intent related to earmarks under orders from the president will that have implications for how executive agencies respond to other communications contained in report language defining identifying and overseeing earmarks debates over earmark definitions and transparency have taken place for some time but generally accepted definitions of earmarkrelated terms appear to have been established73 over time however particular definition of earmark could become so widely used by observers that it becomes regarded as the authoritative definition notwithstanding other definitions74 if definition were broadly regarded as authoritative future developments and debate on earmarks might be influenced accordingly with resource allocation activities that fall under the definition more likely to be subjected to discussion and public scrutiny than activities that are excluded from this perspective it could be argued that if the administrations definition of earmarking as solely congressional activity is widely accepted future discourse and policy proposals may focus more and more on congressionally originated earmarks as opposed to earmarking by the president political appointees or career civil servants moreover potential interpretations and connotations of the definitions might also come to be viewed as widely accepted eg relating to concepts of merit and the appropriate processes for allocations of resources75 members of congress several presidents and interest groups have expressed diverse views regarding 1 the perceived merit of earmarking activities and 2 72 for discussion see crs report rl33151 committee controls of agency decisions by louis fisher 73 for example although the house and senate have both approved essentially identical written definitions for the terms congressional earmark and congressionally directed spending item the bush administration has used somewhat differing definitions in practice there have been some instances of disagreement about how to apply definitions to particular circumstances see for example john m donnelly critics decry limited definition of earmarks in defense bill cq today july 3 2007 available at httpwwwcqcom subscription required 74 examples of observers include the media watchdog groups academia politicians and the public at large 75 for example the administration has used the term circumvents in every iteration of its definition of earmark to characterize some congressional decision making most recently defining earmarks in the eo as including purported congressional direction that circumvents otherwise applicable meritbased or competitive allocation processes the word circumvent has been defined in two ways that might be relevant to the words usage in the administration definition 1 to make circuit around and 2 to manage to get around esp by ingenuity or strategem see merriamwebsters collegiate dictionary 11th ed springfield ma merriamwebster 2003 p 225 crs25 which actors in the us system of government should make decisions on how to allocate specific funds the definition of the term earmark has the potential to change the terms of debate and the options considered the evolution of the debate over earmark definitions therefore may have implications for the institutional capacities of congress and the president to carry out their constitutional responsibilities and advance their policy or procedural preferences in that light congress might consider the implications various definitions of earmark could have if they were widely accepted for 1 affecting the institutional capacities of congress the president and agencies to function effectively in the us system of government and 2 setting the terms of debate earmarking by the president and agency officials the president and agency officials can and often do make allocation and earmark decisions largely outside public view for example decisions oftentimes are made during budget formulation or during the budget execution process that may or may not be presented in agency budget justifications and reports to congress76 difficult issues such as whether any presidential or administration decisions to restrict link or condition awards of contract or grant funding to nongovernmental entities on the basis of their compliance or cooperation with presidential or administration policy preferences constitutes form of earmarking may arise77 with regard to resource allocation transparency in both decisionmaking processes and decision outcomes arguably would allow for scrutiny scrutiny in turn might confer some perception of merit for budget allocations that are able to withstand the scrutiny78 76 the use of discretion by president or an agency official might not be transparent outside the white house or an agency because decisions and their rationales might not be specifically highlighted or justified to congress or the public before funds are obligated after funds are obligated it can often be difficult to assess 1 instances when discretion was used by specific actors and 2 the factors that motivated or justified decisions on how to allocate and spend funds in some situations it may become difficult or impossible to define and identify specific allocation or earmarking behaviors by the president or agencies if these topics were of interest congress might consider several oversight options for discussion see crs report rl30240 congressional oversight manual by frederick m kaiser et and mathew d mccubbins and thomas schwartz congressional oversight overlooked police patrols versus fire alarms american journal of political science pp 165179 77 to the extent that such activities take place in the executive branch the activities arguably could be considered analogous to the administrations characterization of congressionally originated earmarking as placing restrictions on the allocation of funding see attachment b to the january 2007 memorandum for an example of allegations that the award of funds might have been conditioned upon certain actions see carol d leonnig hud questions go unanswered washington post mar 16 2008 p a4 78 the issue of transparency with homeland security grants might illustrate this tendency in 2006 the department of homeland securitys dhss announcement of funding allocations under the homeland security grant program hsgp was reportedly greeted with controversy due in part to perceptions of lack of transparency and concerns about whether funds were allocated

following year continued crs26 full or partial transparency it is not clear if the administration has included in its online database all instances of earmarks that agencies and the white house received through other communication pursuing that option might provide insight into how the administration and agencies respond to congressionally originated earmarks that are not contained in bill or report language and whether items were included on selective basis on the other hand it would not necessarily always be in the interest of agencies the white house or members of congress to disclose telephone letter and inpersondirected earmarks in the context of legislative negotiations among congress the president and agencies are congressionally originated earmarks being funded currently there is publicly available comprehensive source of information on whether or the extent to which congressionally originated earmarks are actually funded by agencies some information on this topic might be forthcoming in response to non statutory congressional directive to omb that was approved in the explanatory statement associated with the consolidated appropriations act 2008 which provided appropriations to omb specifically in its report for the fy2008 financial services and general government appropriations bill the senate appropriations committee directed omb to report to congress later than march 1 2009 regarding the extent to which executive departments and agencies that administer directed funding allocate the designated amounts to intended recipients at level less than the amount specified in any enacted bill or accompanying report describing such directed funding79 the senate report language was subsequently approved in the explanatory statement corresponding to the fy2008 omnibus appropriations measure80 past research 78 continued dhs secretary michael chertoff reportedly said he expected fresh controversy over whether money was allocated according to

herein see explanatory statement submitted by mr obey chairman of the house committee on appropriations regarding the consolidated appropriations amendment of the house of representatives to the senate continued crs27 suggests that if omb complies with the committees directive the resulting information may cite several kinds of instances in which congressionally directed spending items or congressional earmarks are not provided in the full amount to recipient including 1 if the president omb or an agency decides not to allocate funds to recipient ie disregards the congressional directive or earmark 2 if the president omb or an agency decides to reduce designated amount in light of set aside requirements or administrative fees81 or 3 if the president omb or an agency is unable to identify or find recipient or finds the recipient legally ineligible to receive funds executive order 13457 eo 13457 both alone and in combination with the presidents veto threat in the 2008 state of the union message may have implications for the congressional appropriations process and potentially other legislative activities it is not possible to predict how the eo will operate or be used in practice by the president omb and heads of agencies or whether the administration might seek to use the eos framework as source of leverage in bargaining in the legislative process if the eo were topic of congressional interest several general options might be explored82 given the undefined nature of some terms in the administrations overall definition of earmark as well as uncertainty how some aspects of the eo will operate or be used in practice congress could consider holding hearings or engaging in other information exchanges to clarify any questions of interest in response to the eo congress could include in statutory text what otherwise would have been nonstatutory earmarks alternatively congress could incorporate by reference in statutory text any items contained in nonstatutory documents if congress wished to strengthen weaken prevent repeal or otherwise alter the directions specified in the eo or the eo itself or influence the practices called for by the eo congress could consider legislating on the topic possibly using approaches such as 80 continued amendment to hr 2764 congressional record daily edition vol 153 book ii dec 17 2007 p h16048 both the

for more extensive discussion of the latter two bullets see crs report rl34373 earmarks executive order legal issues by thomas j nicola and tj halstead crs28 negotiation appropriations limitations83 revocation84 or delay of final action on fy2009 appropriations until after new president takes office potential omb earmarks website and database issues two factors that may influence whether given definition of earmark becomes more widely accepted or used include 1 ease of access to corresponding earmark data and 2 the extent of data that are made available ombs earmarks website and database which contain data on what the administration views to be congressionally originated earmarks are publicly accessible and are frequently cited in media stories on earmark issues the omb website gained further visibility after the administration announced that the websites fy2005 appropriations data would serve as the baseline for measuring progress toward the presidents goal of reducing earmarks for fy2008 and after the administration began to include language about earmarks prominently in its statements of administration policy regarding appropriations legislation the fy2008 disclosure lists of earmarks published in house and senate appropriations committee reports also have attracted considerable media attention85 data from the congressional reports however have not been aggregated by federal entities in way similar to the presentation on the omb website separately searchable website of funding for federal grant contract and loan awards that congress required omb to establish under the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 ffata became operational in december 2007 as usaspendinggov86 in the absence of supplementary information however it is not clear that users of the ffatarequired website would be able to determine whether an award was earmarked by congress the databases that feed into the website do not contain information to separate awards corresponding to congressionally originated earmarks according to congressional or administration definitions from awards that were originated by the president or agency officials if the ffatarequired website does not include earmark information then ombs earmarks website would appear to be the only federal government resource providing aggregate information on congressionally originated earmarks that is available to the public online versus accessing individual committee reports joint 83 see crs report 98518 earmarks and limitations in appropriations bills by sandy streeter 84 see crs report rs20846 executive orders issuance and revocation by t j halstead 85 for discussion of congressional disclosure requirements see crs report rs22866 earmark disclosure rules in the house member and committee requirements and crs report rs22867 earmark disclosure rules in the senate member and committee requirements both by megan suzanne lynch 86 pl 109282 for discussion see crs report rl34718 the federal funding accountability and transparency act implementation and proposed amendments by garrett l hatch crs29 explanatory statements and managers statements87 omb may then be in position to set some parameters for public debate on earmarks because the omb website is the most visible federal government resource for tracking aggregated totals of congressionally originated earmarks many observers may regard it as the authoritative source of information on earmarks generally reinforcing the perception that the administrations definition is the standard for public debate if congress considered these matters to be of interest it could consider several options along with their advantages and disadvantages option status quo the omb earmarks website and database presumably would continue to provide information to the public that reflects the administrations perspective on what does and does not constitute an earmark in light of administration statements that the websites purpose is in part to encourage and inform the debate over how taxpayers money is spent some would view it as means for the president to advocate his policy and budget process preferences and facilitate the actions of nongovernmental actors eg the media and public interest groups to exercise scrutiny over congress by performing additional analysis on the earmark data option congressional online database congress could consider the advantages and disadvantages of assembling its own centralized aggregated database in effect pursuing this option would present the public with an alternative source of earmark information in addition to the omb earmarks website based on congressional definitions of earmarkrelated terms and congressional disclosure lists option codification of omb website with different earmark related definitions congress could require omb to adopt different definition of earmark for use in collecting information from agencies and posting data on the omb earmarks website this option could allow for establishment of definition more in concert with the definitions in each chambers rules in order to provide greater consistency in terms of data collection debate and analysis of earmarks across branches of government the option also might constrain the presidents ability to use omb and agency budget offices and personnel to advance his proposals regarding congressionally originated earmarks critics of earmarking might argue that congressional definitions and practices do not allow for adequate scrutiny of congressional actions therefore critics of earmarking might support the presidents use of omb and agency resources to establish the administrations own definition and efforts to decrease the extent of congressionally originated earmarks some observers may also raise separation of powers questions if congress required omb to adopt different definition of earmark 87 joint effort by taxpayers for common sense and the sunlight foundation however might become another albeit nonfederal resource the two organizations developed website based on tcss designation of earmarks available at httpearmarkwatchorg that is intended among other purposes to guide citizen journalists to online resources on campaign finance lobbying and federal spending see httpwwwtaxpayernettcs pressreleases20070924emwatchpdf for tcss press release crs30 option eliminate omb earmarks website another option might involve limiting or cutting off funds for the omb website and database pursuing this option might be perceived to bring advantages and disadvantages similar to the codification option it also might engender negative reaction from the media and possibly the public option expand the ffata website information about congressionally originated earmarks might be made accessible through the ffatarequired website for example congress could consider the advantages and disadvantages of amending the ffata to require omb to incorporate its earmarks data into usaspendinggov integrating the data might address two objectives to provide the public with as much information as possible about federal awards and to enable the public to access that information from single website on the other hand by mandating that usaspendinggov include data from the omb earmarks database congress might be perceived as accepting ombs definition of earmark alternatively congress could consider amending the ffata to require incorporation of data from ombs earmarks website while also requiring that omb adopt congressional definitions of earmarkrelated terms this option with advantages and disadvantages similar to those discussed above might provide congress more control over the earmark data provided to the public through usaspendinggov finally congress could pursue an option of requiring the ffata website to include congressionally defined and identified earmarks without addressing the omb website this option is explicit in legislation that has been introduced88 pursuit of the option would result in two federal online sources of earmark information that might differ in part because of different underlying definitions in addition the ffata website would not necessarily capture all congressionally originated earmarks as defined by house and senate rules if any were not associated with federal awards such as grants contracts or loans possible representational consequences administration efforts to track congressionally originated earmarks and use the machinery of executive agencies to publicize its policy preferences arguably might affect congresss abilities to carry out representational activities that are an implicit component of its constitutional responsibilities the framers believed that the federal government needed to provide layers of representation that could incorporate national state level and more localized interests while providing institutional checks and balances between congress and the president in the federal government members of congress represent localized constituencies with interests and policy preferences that might or might not be perceived as aligned with broader national interests members of congress also act 1 individually 2 in their respective chambers and 3 between chambers through deliberation and the legislative process to come together to make laws for the nation president proposes his or her preferred program of policies and takes care that laws passed by congress are faithfully executed in doing so president may use discretion sometimes to advance his or her policy preferences the presidency has also been seen by many 88 s 3077 strengthening transparency and accountability in federal spending act of 2008 110th cong crs31 as representing broad national interests the combination of layered representation and interbranch checks and balances arguably assures that the preferences of national and local constituencies are addressed in the national policymaking process preferences may be addressed sometimes through broad laws and other times through the use of specific laws nonstatutory earmarks of benefits and resources and administrative decisions targeted to areas of congressional or presidential policy preference the requirements of eo 13457 and the omb earmarks website and database arguably subject the representational focus of congress to greater scrutiny than the presidents representational activities when viewed in isolation this might be seen as an attempt to pursue transparency in government funding decisions goal that has been advanced by some congressional and executive branch leaders depending upon how one perceives the executive order and the omb website fitting into the larger design of checks and balances however one might or might not see the longterm representational capacity of congress as being affected or impaired if the executive order were fully implemented or the omb website were continued in its current format for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34648
