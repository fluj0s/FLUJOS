medicare provisions at the time of enactment the congressional budget office cbo estimated that medicare spending would be reduced by 1164 billion over 5 years fy1998fy2002 and 3938 billion over 10 years fy1998fy2007 the bba was expected to achieve the target savings both by slowing the rate of growth in payments to hospitals physicians and other providers and by establishing new prospective

stated that actual medicare payment reductions resulting from bba 97 are larger than were intended when bba 97 was enacted some groups further contend that beneficiary access to care has been adversely affected as result it is difficult to determine the actual impact of the legislation due to the limited data that are currently available and the fact that number of the provisions have not been fully implemented the medicare payment advisory commissi on medpac and the general accounting office gao have reviewed existing information and find that in general bba 97 provisions have not impeded beneficiary access to care however they caution that continued review of the implementation of the law is warranted both the house and senate considered bills to mitigate the impact of bba

introduction on august 5 1997 the president signed into law the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 this legislation included medicare provisions that were intended to slow the rate of growth in that programs spending at the time of enactment the congressional budget office cbo estimated that medicare spending would be reduced by 1164 billion over 5 years fy1998fy2002 and 3938 billion over 10 years fy1998 fy2007 the bba was expected to achieve the target savings both by slowing the rate of growth in payments to hospitals physicians and other providers and by establishing new prospective payment systems ppss and other new payment methodologies for skilled nursing facilities home health agencies and other service categories in addition the measure established the medicarechoice program which expanded private plan options available to medicare beneficiaries and modified the way payments are made to health maintenance organizations hmos1 in march 1999 cbo revised its budget projections it lowered its medicare spending estimates by an additional 80 billion over the fy1998fy2002 period and 229 billion over the fy1998fy2007 period in july 1999 cbo projected further reduction of 11 billion over the fy1998fy2002 period and 21 billion over the fy1998fy2007 period the estimates made since enactment of bba 97 reflect number of factors many of which are only indirectly related to the bba provisions these include an improved economic forecast heightened antifraud and abuse initiatives slowdown in payments to providers and lower projected enrollment in the medicarechoice program2 impact of bba 97 number of health care provider groups have stated that actual medicare payment reductions resulting from bba 97 are larger than were intended when bba 97 was

participation or reducinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30347crs2 3 for further information see crs report rl30300 medicare beneficiary access to care the effects of the new prospective payment systems on outpatient hospital care home health care and skilled nursing facility care by carolyn mercktheir service areas attribute these actions to reductions in medicare payment rates and other bba changes it is difficult to determine the actual impact of the legislation due to the limited data that are currently available3 on october 1 1999 the ways and means health subcommittee held hearing on the impact of bba 97 provisions witnesses from both the medicare payment advisory commissi on medpac and the general accounting office gao testified on the information available to date medpac reported that it is difficult to sort out the effects of multiple changes in payment policies as well as the introduction of new prospective payment systems it noted that many of the bba changes have yet to be fully phasedin and that data to evaluate the impact of recent changes are not available in many cases medpac also noted that it was difficult to isolate the effects of changes in medicare policy from other changes in the health care system the following are some of medpacs key findings by service category hospitals inpatient services medpac testified that while industry reports somewhat overstate the negative impact of bba on hospital margins the reports do reflect the overall direction as was intended by bba the law reverses 6year trend of medicare payments rising more rapidly than the cost of treating medicare patients medpac has not seen convincing evidence that the changes to date have affected either quality or access to inpatient care but it will continue to monitor developments medpac cited its march 1999 report which concluded that the fy2000 update included in bba was appropriate however it recognized factors pointing to the need for caution in specifying future updates it also questioned whether the unusually low rate of cost growth observed in recent years can be sustained without adverse effects on quality hospitals outpatient services medpac reports that hospitals have not felt the impact of bba provisions because the pps that was to be implemented in 1999 will not be implemented until mid2000 medpac has increased its savings estimates of the impact of pps but suggests that certain hospitals may counter some of the reduction by coding services more accurately given that implementation of pps could have larger impact on some hospitals than others it recommended that the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs closely monitor the use of care to ensure that access to appropriate care is not compromised it also suggested that consideration be given to phasing in the system home health agencies hhas medpac cited the findings from recent gao study which showed that although 14 of hhas closed between october 1997 and january 1999 there were more agencies in existence at the beginning of fy1999 than at the beginning of fy1996 hospital discharge planners and others interviewed by gao reported few access problems however gao noted that beneficiaries who are more costly than average mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30347crs3 face difficulties in the future as agencies change their behavior in response to the interim payment system ips established by bba 97 the ips among other things established new methodology for limiting annual medicare payments to individual agencies through per beneficiary limits medpacs survey of hhas contained findings that were consistent with the claim that the ips has hampered access however it notes that changes in payment policy were occurring at the same time that hcfa was implementing other policies intended to reduce fraud and abuse including stepped up indepth case reviews by intermediaries it also cited the lack of clear eligibility and coverage guidelines it is therefore difficult to interpret the findings in its june report medpac was concerned about the tight timetable for implementation of the new pps system it recommended that congress explore the feasibility of excluding on budget neutral basis small percentage of patients who have intense service needs eg 2 from the aggregate per beneficiary limits skilled nurs ing facilities snfs medpac cited survey of hospital discharge planners by the office of the inspector general oig of hhs the oig report stated that serious problems in placing beneficiaries are not apparent although some snfs are changing their admitting practices in response to the new payment system the oig noted that half of those surveyed reported that they have begun requesting more clinical information about patients and are often assessing patients more directly before making admissions decisions the survey further reported that some medically complex patients had become harder to place this is consistent with medpacs concerns that payment weights under the new pps do not adequately account for the service needs of certain patients particularly those who require relatively high levels of nontherapy ancillary services and supplies its march 1999 report recommended refinement in the classification system hcfa has undertaken review of this potential problem physicians survey of beneficiary access to physicians services indicated few problems however medpac suggested that technical changes were needed in the sustainable growth rate system that determines annual updates in physician payments in order to avoid access problems in the future medicarecho ice mc plans while congress intended that the mc program expand beneficiaries health plan options to include preferred provider organizations provider sponsored organizations private feeforservice plans and medical savings accounts this has not occurred however enrollment in mc plans typically hmos has continued to grow medpac states that mc payment levels alone do not appear to have had much impact on either encouraging new plans to enter the market or encouraging existing plans to leave the market medpacs march report recommended that the secretary work with organizations offering plans to identify specific regulation or policy changes which could reduce the burden of compliance without compromising the objectives of the program it further recommended delaying the filing date for the adjusted community rate proposals and giving mc organizations the flexibility to tailor their benefit packages within their service areas finally it supported phasingin the risk adjustment payment mechanismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30347crs4 the gao testimony from october 1 1999 included the following observations home health agencies as noted in the medpac testimony above gao has found little evidence to date of impaired access to care gao points out however that the pps system is more appropriate tool for controlling program spending than the ips because it can align payments with patient needs gao notes that number of pps design issues remain and that the paymen t system will likely require continued adjustments even after its implementation next year skilled nursing facilities gao reports that some business decisions unrelated to the pps have contributed to fiscal difficulties for some corporations operating snfs while overall snf payment rates are likely to prove sufficient or even generous the distribution may be out of balance the current case mix adjustment method may not adequately ensure that providers serving high cost beneficiaries are paid enough potential access problem could result if medicare underpays for high cost patients outpatient therapy services for the vast majority of patients the caps are unlikely to curtail access whether caps restrict access for small share of nursing home residents is less straightforward needsbased system could better target payments toward patients who genuinely require more services than allowed under the caps medicarechoice plans bba provisions addressed the long recognized problem of excess payments to plans the net effect of the new provisions has been modest and on average has likely removed only portion of the excess payments built into the base rates further plan withdrawals are attributable to number of factors in addition to changes in mc payment rates critical to making mc payment modifications is the establishment of an appropriate base rate and risk adjustment mechanism that pays more for beneficiaries with serious health problems and less for relatively healthy persons pending legislation both the house and senate considered bills to mitigate the impact of bba provisions on providers these measures were
