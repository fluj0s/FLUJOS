from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to evelynsmithnoaagov christopher d miller christopherdmillernoaagov subject fwd confidential assessment of gc04203 date fri oct 24 102033 2003 dear evelyn and chris re proposal review gc04203 meko et synthesis of 19th century climate data for the united states from paleo archival and instrumental sources i have read the reviewer conflict of interest and confidentiality document and can state that i have conflict of interest and will abide by the confidentiality provisions etc i reviewed very similar proposal by this group 1 year ago and enclose my review of that proposal below the new proposal has taken into account my two main concerns from last time which were i that creation only of blended data set that contained time varying mixture of proxy and instrumental data would limit the usefulness because its quality would be time varying perhaps in an unquantified way and independent study of errors between proxy and observed data would be prevented and ii that the proposed work was not very innovative in terms of the applications for which the new information would be used both of these points have been addressed adequately and so i now rate it excellent 5 for scientifictechnical merit and high 5 for importancerelevance and applicability one issue that i would like to raise however is that the need for quantifying uncertaintyerror in the reconstructionsdatabase is not given much coverage in the proposal it is mentioned but not focused on for many applications testing models comparison with other reconstructions detection of unusual climate trendsevents explicitly quantified error estimates are essential these often change magnitude through time and thus should be estimated in such way as to allow this they may also change with time scale often being lower for eg decadal mean than for single years value and again the error estimation method should capture this i do not think that this issue detracts from the quality of the proposal instead i am mentioning it in the hope that this comment can be passed on to the proposers in the event that the project is funded so that they can be prompted into placing the appropriate emphasis on quantifying uncertainty apologies for being late yet again and best regards tim date thu 24 oct 2002 171431 0000 subject confidential assessment of gc03512 from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to irmadupreenoaagov cc tosbornueaacuk christopherdmillernoaagov dear irma and chris re proposal review gc03512 pi david meko 19th century data catalog first of all i confirm that there is conflict of interest etc now to my review 1 scientific merit rating good comments i completely agree with the rationale behind improving data sets of 19th century climate see my comments below on relevance to climate change programme and the proposers have identified the most relevant data sources available for the us the objectives and workplan are generally reasonable but i have rated it good rather than very good or excellent because it does not seem as scientifically innovative or challenging as it might some particular concerns are highlighted below i am very wary about the proposed approach of integrating the data sources together to produce single climate product obviously the data sources have to be used in combination for calibration of proxy data or for assessment of possibly dubious early instrumental data but combining them all into single product only will be very restrictive for future use assessment improvements much better would be to produce intrumentalonly series for whatever length is available and treering only series for the full length ie into the late 19th and 20th centuries despite the availability of instrumental data for these periods blending them into single analysis is of some but limited use and comparisons of different periods and with eg model simulations can only ever be done by taking into account error bars that vary dramatically in time and are only estimates of the true errors and the error estimates may be underestimates if based only on residuals or covariances during the 20th century mention is made of using the 19th century data to consider key issues such as difference between treering and ground borehole temperatures they differ more in the 19th century in terms of trend than in other centuries possibly taking into account landuse change mention is made of using the 19th century data to assess multicentury temperature reconstructions and why they differ these are issues of great importance mention is investigating seasonal dependence of temperature changes which are greater in existing temperature products during the 19th century than in the 20th century and which has important implications for the calibration of proxy including treering data against summer or annual data and the need to more clearly define the true seasonal response of proxy data despite these concerns the proposed work is certainly worthy of funding and the extra items of interest that i mention above could be achieved using the data generated here in some future project 2 relevance to climate change programme rating high comments the 19th century is certainly of particular importance not just for the reasons outlined in the proposal but also because this century shows some of the biggest disagreements in warming trend between various quasihemispheric temperature reconstructions and between proxy and instrumental data and between different seasons of instrumental data additional data sources are definitely required and additional digitisation homogenisation and intercomparison of data sets is necessary for these reasons work such as that proposed here is essential for helping to refine answers to questions such as how unusual is late twentieth century climate and detection of climate change signals against the noise of natural climate variability best regards tim
