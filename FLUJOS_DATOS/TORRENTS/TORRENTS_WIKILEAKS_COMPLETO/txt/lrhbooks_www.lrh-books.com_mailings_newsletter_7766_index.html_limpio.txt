bridge publications inc newsletter date communication and the rock it goes so far to say that if one person in this particular group right here right now was in thorough communication with all of russia and asia there wouldnt even vaguely be war get the idea somebody pandetermining it otherwise its all running off without communication everybody abandoning responsibility for it dont you see itll eventually generate into an individuation of some kind or another im not talking mysteriously when you abandon and dont know youve abandoned communication with an area for which you are basically responsible you are then going to get trouble from that area thats for sure and every place in the world that you are not aware of now has to some tiny degree potential threat for that particular reason if you could consider communication as kind of balm or salve that when spread liberally brings total calm and consider the areas where it is not to be those areas that things can go haywire in you will find one characteristic of the rock l ron hubbard excerpted from the first postulate lectures auditor plus pc versus bank solution of case an article by l ron hubbard from the first postulate lectures auditor plus pc versus bank tsk pshew bank got the idea if you get the idea of steam locomotive going up mountainside sweating along with string of boxcars and its wheels just spinning on the rails its not climbing any higher and sometimes sliding back but making forward progress along comes another steam locomotive and hooks onto the front of the existing locomotive and the two of them pour the throttles to it and put some sand on the track and both of them pull those boxcars over the hump got the idea there they go all right all right supposing the first locomotive which was already failing to pull it as soon as the new locomotive showed up simply says well help is here at last closed down his throttle and banks his fires were actually not muchmuch less going to pull it because now weve added whole locomotive as dead weight to the load now this will sometimes be your pc sitting there expecting you to clear him contribution he just shut off the throttle and banked the fires now that the helper has come along why hes all set the helper can just do it all see that supposing he went the opposite way and steamed up considerably and put his tie bar or whatever you call it in reverse and poured the steam to it heres the helper locomotive trying to go uphill full blast and here is the original locomotive going backwards downhill with full power which way do you think youre going to go in that respect boy youre sure going downhill in hurry auditor along with him see hell be very awbe pretty upset hes got big failure going here you see supposing the first locomotive the moment that new locomotive showed up became violently jealous why i can do this all myself i was doing all right he was going creakcreakslipslip right down the track backwards you get out of here whoever gave you orders to come around here to hell with you take him away someplace in other words noncooperative situation and just made the helping locomotive stand by idly and watch while he slid into the ravine behind him this happens too this is the other situation which wasnt envisioned particularly when those equations were first written auditor is given noresponsibility for whats going on by the remarks and attitudes of the pc and he is there but he just stands by and the pc kind of runs the session and goes out from under now this pc will very often insist on running service facsimile he will very often insist on running some computation that is making him uncomfortable and the auditor qsandas with him and hes just as wellas far as clearing is concerned or pulling over the humphe might as well just be sitting on siding blowing off idle steam while the pc runs backwards down the hill theres two different things here theres clearing him and helping them live and if youre going to clear them every now and then they wont have the idea at all that youre helping them live and youve got to have extraordinary arc in order to keep their hope up and keep them in there pitching keep little fire underneath that boiler and keep that throttle cracked open just little bit because you need it if youre going to clear him why why does all this happen if you improve his mockups on direct road to clear you improve the quality of the rock this you already know right so the only safe thing to do is as soon as youve opened the session gotten some goals straightened out the preclear got him oriented the session is going well is to instantly and immediately audit the rock get it out of the road and proceed with clearing thats the way you clear people l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture the rock the first postulate lectures definitions1 rock the primary aberrative object on preclears case communication and the rock auditor plus pc versus bank solution of case the first postulate lectures what existed before the beginning the 20th advanced clinical course of 1958 was the toughest and most exciting acc yet delivered the knowhow of clearing was in place and the most profound secrets of unraveling the reactive mind were being taught by lrh and drilled and learned to perfection by these students lrh had isolated an even more direct route to the most fundamental aberration of any being but he knew that in order to successfully guide preclear down that route the auditor himself would need not only topnotch auditing skills but comprehensive understanding of the bank and how it works thus on 14 july 1958 the 20th advanced clinical course opened in washington dc with fiftytwo auditors in attendance the stage was set for broadscale clearing to occur the likes of which this universe had never seen the technology that lrh personally taught these select fiftytwo auditors is now available to you in the first postulate lectures the discovery of the basic
