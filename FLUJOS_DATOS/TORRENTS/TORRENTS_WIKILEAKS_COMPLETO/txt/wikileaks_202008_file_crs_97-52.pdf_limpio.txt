of china as did the commission on broadcasting to the peoples republic of china in september 1992 third us government committee the us advisory commission on public diplomacy recommended in august 199 2 enhancing voa broadcasting to china in early 1993 the administration sought in its fy1994 budget request 30 million for the creation of surrogate service w hich was referred to as radio free asia on june 15 1993 the president announced his proposal for major consolidation of us nonmilitary international broadcasting includ ing the creation of new asian democracy radio throughout that year the 103 congress debated whether and how to broadcas trd into asia proponents of surrogate broadcasting into asia argued that 1 it woul d promote democracy especially in china where political repres sion and government control of news is strong 2 freer and more open c ountries would enhance us bilateral relations in asia and 3 the united states has an obligation to promote freedom around the world not just in europe opponents claimed that china i s much more open society with many sources of information unlike europe and the soviet union in the 1950s when radio free europeradio liberty rferl was established expanding voice of america voa broadcasts rather than creating surrogate service would be less expensive and s confrontational they contended reducing the possible reaction by asian governments of digging in their heels and moving even further away from democratic principles after numerous heari ngs and debates congress authorized the idea of radio free asia surrogate broadcas

the broadcasting service was incorporated on march 11 1996 as the asia pacifi c network radio free asia inc in the following months congr ess reasserted that radio free asia is the authorized name the first rfa broadcast took place on september 29 1996 broadcasting into china in manda rin the initial broadcasts of one hour at 700 am and one hour at 1100 pm included regional news and feature stories th chinese government reacted to the initial broadcasts with strongly worded letters of opposition to top level us governmen t officials as well as editorials in major ch inese newspapers claiming that the cia is behind the broadcast operation current status rfas uyghur wu and canton programs were added most recently in 1998 in response to the desire of congress under the radio free asia act of 1998 to increas broadcasting in other languages to china in additio n to mandarin and tibetan by the end of fy1999 rfa will be broadcasting 24 hours day into china 12 hoursday f mandarin 3 hoursday of cantonese 8 hoursday of tibetan and 1 hourday of uyghur from the beginning of rfa the chinese government vigorously opposed thi s surrogate broa dcasting asserting that the us is using broadcasting to impose its values on asian citizens and interfere in asian countries internal affairs china began jamming rfa mandarin broadcasts in most frequencies on august 18 1997 the government also began jamming tibetan broadcasts in early october 1997 earlier vietnam had begu n jamming t he vietnamese broadcasts in february 1997 and north korea also had begun jamming the korea n broadcasts in june 1997 the chinese government is also jamming rfas uyghur and cantonese broadcasts in all of these cases jamming has bee n continual but with varying degrees of effectiveness rfa currently is broadcasting into china via multiple transmission sites and on varying frequencies keeping the probability of china government jamming at minimum the broadcast entity has been successful in averting some but not all of the jamming in october 1998 rfa launched its website which provides the audio broadcasts as well as addi tional written material there is evidence that the vietnamese and chines governments have since tried to block internet access an d have been successful at blocking it in man places the bbgs january 15 1999 report to congress focused on th continuing efforts of rfa to counter the suppression of its programming 2httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9752crs4 continued2 105261 january 15 1999 other opinions were expressed from chinese listeners via four callin programs report to3

security difficulties in 1998 private research organiza tion was able to conduct audience surveys on chinese listenership of rfas mandarin broadcasts according to the threesite survey among all international broadcasters only voa and the bbc both of which have been on the ai r since the 1940s as well as the taiwan governme nt radio station had higher listenership than rfa 3 until 1998 all rfa trans mitter sites had been leased in 1998 and early 1999 rfa obtained permanent sites on the islands of saipa n and tinian respectively in the northern marianas although us broadcast sites in thailand and the philippines would b excellent transmission points for rfa both countries have blocked usage right given them in bilateral accords their reasons have to do with an unwillingness to anger china and some asean association of southeast asian nation governments an underlying principle for radio free asia hiring is that it is to be lea n organization full time employees initially were to number 109 but the staff totals in both the field and in washington have grown to 230 as result of increased broadcasts t china and the realization that the original staffing goals would not sustain more than token programming the president of rfa is richard richter formerly producer an d executive producer of news programs at abc cbs and weta dan southerland previously beijing bureau

omnibus consolidated appropriations act of 1997 arlier in the fy1997httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9752crs5 appropriations debate members of the house appropriations committee had expressed concern tha t rfa had not been operating within clear plan the committee requested rfa to submit plan prior to receiving grants under the f y1997 appropriations officials of the broadcast entity sent plan to congress in midseptember 1996 which th committee approved for fy2000 the administration has requested total international broadcastin g budget of 4526 million which includes 231 million for radio free asia the

estimate fy2000 231 million request issues for congress rfa proved to be an important so urce of objective information to the chinese after the nato bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade and the subsequent chines demonstrations at the us embassy in beijing in may 1999 radio free asia currently broadcasts for total of 28 hours day t he bbg plans to increase that figure to 34 hours by the end f fy1999 the issues facing the 106 congress are 1 authorization an dth appropr iation of increased funding to support rfas chinese language expansion 2 continual finetuning of programming and technical transmission support and 3 development of reliable audience surveys the clinton administration endorses the idea of expanding rfas budget an d capabili ties both the administration and many in congress believe that expandin g broadcasting into china is better way to promote democracy and human rights tha n denying china normal trade relation ntr trade benefits hr 2415 t he american embassy security act of 1999 would provide permanent authorization for rfa it would also repeal funding limitations for the broadcast entity for fy2000 the senate foreign relations authorization legislation s 886 woul d reauthorize rfa through fy2005 and would raise the limit on annual expenditures to 28 million in each of fy2000 and fy2001 the increase in funding in fy1998 allowed rfa to expand its transmission fro m saipan also increases in fy1998 and fy1999 allowed rfa to ex pand its broadcast hours and add new languages the fy2000 budget request of just over 23 million may allow rfa to expand its trans mission sites rfa officials believe that slight increase in funds in fy2000 would allow them to fully function as congress had intended in th international broadcasting act of 1994 i ncreased radio construction funds amounting to 209 million requested for fy2000 compared to 132 mill ion appropriated for fy1999 would benefit both rfa and voa activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9752crs6 some concerns regarding expanding the rfa budget exist lawmakers concerned with maintaining balanced budget view these increases as unnecessary expenditures that would tap into the surplus which is being eyed for social security or tax cuts furthermore because the proposed funding levels being debate d in congress is three times the fy1997 funding level some fear that such dramatic increase in short time span to an organization that is so young could lead to an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars b rfa others have cited the fact that numerous similar information sources already ar reaching china incl uding cnn they say that increasing rfa threefold likely would not result in proportionate increase in democracy promotion in china moreover organizations that promote uschina trade assert that this action will cause furthe r deterioration of uschina relations that could dampen the future growth of us exports in the after math of the may 7 1999 nato bombing of the chinese embassy i n belgrade rfas coverage of the bombing and demonstrations was extensive in it s mandar in cantonese tibetan and uyghur programs rfa reported apologies by th us and nato which the chinese media had failed to mention listeners wh responded to the callin programs were critical of both the us and the chines governmen ts handling of the demonstrations throughout the kosovo crisis rf reported on the suffering due to ethnic cleansing which the chinese media portrayed as product of nato bombing matter of ongoing inter est in congress is overlap duplication and coordination of voa and rfa according to allen heil deputy dire ctor of voice of america rfa and voa are closely coordinating and monitoring their activities in asia on september 12 1998 voa dropped its mandarin broadcast during 04000500 gmt the only hour of the day that it had been overlapping with the rfa broadcast rfa greed to broadcast during number of nonprime hours to avoid overlapping with voa voa and rfa w broadcast 12 hours each in mandarin for total of 24 hours per day jamming of us broadcasts into asia is concern of both administrators an d members of congress china government jamming of us international broadcasting both voa and rfareportedly has been ve ry effective especially in the cities according to voice of america and radio free asia officials they believe that increased funding will assist u s broadcasters in circumventing the jamming problem broadcast officials admit however that chinas jamming activity may increase prop ortionately to the increase in us broadcasting activity there neve rtheless listeners who have called in to the radio programs from every chinese province are evidence that rfa is reaching its audience
