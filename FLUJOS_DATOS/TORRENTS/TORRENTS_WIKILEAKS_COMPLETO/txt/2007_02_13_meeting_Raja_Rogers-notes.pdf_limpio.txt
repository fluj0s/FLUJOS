raja rogers meeting notes february 13 2007 raja rogers recording of the ramayana is completed michael sternfeld recorded it recording is available to be downloaded on ipod mp3 player etc it will be available at the raj want to talk about the national call center and how the phone should be answered stuart though t that they should mention the price of tm stuart this is particular to our area it works lot better when we do an intro on the phone 1520 min and then mention the price this qualifies the caller to see if they will seriously pursue it we tried not mentioning the price but it works better when we do this is consistent with gov recertification training where assistants put on video for intro and tell price etc we wrote up phone script and sent that to raja rogers and forwarded to the call center the governors who work at the call center are very articulate there is call center site in nh the raj and on west coast raja rogers what did sherry at the call center say about the centers that preferred not to mention the price stuart call center will have protocol for each center and they will go by that some centers want people to come to intro and then say course fee in the closing one consideration is that people drive long distance to come and may be surprised by the fee raja rogers not sure if we can accomplish that right away having separate protocol for each center what is everyone s opinion jeff moses why couldnt call center just take phone numbers and pass the numbers onto the govs in the center raja rogers the problem is that in some areas govs are covering millions of people like stuart and joans carol middle ground call ctr could give the price and include the citiassist info jim in orlando ive done it both ways in business its not normally good idea to allow potential customer to put the cost of the produc t up front in the sales process as an objection you dont want to put up money as an obstacle to learning tm good to get them into the setting of meeting with governor stuart based on our 2 yrs of experience when we first arrived here we took out lots of ads used to have average of 20 people at lectures the rate of people starting seem to be irrelevant to anything that was going on at the lecture never been our exp that its conve ntional sales closing situation the people most likely to start are those who were referred by meditator the other factors are intangible factors the affluent people at lectures thank us heartily and then we dont see them the one who starts is one who is more modest in their means who scrapes it together we were hoping that this issue could be approached individually by center maharishi has said that govs time should be used wisely and efficiently so having the call ctr is such blessing and it saves us time to have them give the intros and fees raja rogers i need to push the programmers of the call center database to customize the information about if the ctr wants the fee to be mentioned of course if person asks what the fee is we dont avoid it we tell them concerned about if govs set up lecture and spend 150 for that lecture if they dont have people starting after 34 times they cant financially afford to continue on im thinking about what we can do to have much higher likelihood of having people starting so we dont put strain on people who are doing the teaching dori can the call center do these things 1 make subject line on emails from call center the same 2 make the sender the same raja rogers i will try to get you the names of everyone who works there they all have different email addresses and not lot we can do about that but we can have the subject line the same dori can they also include the email address of every caller so we can send an invitation to lecture in addition to calling them oprah show raja rogers there was one lady on the show that was 70 yrs old and looks lot longe r she attributed it to her learning tm 25 yrs ago this increased our calls carol if you say may we have your email address to notify you of free upcoming events this is better than just asking directly for their email address it tells them the purpose for getting their email address raja rogers we are planning on taking the local tm center phone numbers off the wwwtmorg website for 2 weeks as test people can still call the local tm center via local phone book or via reference from the call center the feeling is that we will be better able to answer the phone s at the call center many numbers listed there are never answered helene is the call center referring people to look at the wwwtmorg website raja rogers thats the only way they reach the call center so they do see the site the city names will still be listed on the tmorg site alcine the reason why we can offer the citiassist program is because we are associated with fullyaccredited university this impresses them that this is regular bonified student loan program raja rogers send those pts and ill share them with the call center alcine there may be some research on whether people prefer to call local number or an 800 number sell yourself the first and then sell the benefits tell everyone to refer one person found old notes from maharishi from when the course fee was first increased the wealthy people dont go to the poor store they like designer everything they like to hear high price we are not trying to target the masses so we dont have to feel guilty about losing people by initially mentioning the course fee stuart so many people here are seasonal we instruct people here and we want them to have followup and we find that the numbers on tmorg are not valid raja rogers eventually we want to have all local numbers that work on the tmorg site jeff murphy any details on the
