procedures that currently apply to congressional consideration of foreign arms sales proposed by the president this includes consideration of proposals to sell major defense equipment defense articles and services or the retransfer to other nations of such military items in general the ex ecutive branch after complying with the terms of applicable us law principally contained in the arms export control act aeca is free to proceed with an arms sales proposal unless cong ress passes legislation prohibiting or modifying the proposed sale the traditional sequence of events for the congressional review of an arms sale proposal has been the submission by the defense partment on behalf of the president of preliminary or informal classified notification of prospective major arms sale 20 calendar days before the executive branch takes further formal action this informal notification is provided to the committees of primary jurisdiction for arms sales issues in the senate this is the senate foreign relations committee in the house it is the foreign affairs committee this notification practice stems from february 18 1976 letter of the defense department making nonstatutory commitment to give congress these preliminary classified notifications this letter also noted that this preliminary informal notification procedure might be deviated from should extraordinary circumstances require this to occur in that event the defense department committed itself to make every effort to explain the circumstances to the committees 1 it has been the practice for such informal notifications to be made for arms sales cases that would have to be formally notified to congress under the provisions of section 36b of the arms export control act aeca2 these informal notifications always precede the submission of the required statutory notifications but the time period between the submission of the informal notification and the statutory notification is not fixed it is determined by the president he has the obligation under the law to submit the arms sale proposal to congress but only after he has determined that he is prepared to proceed with any such notifiable arms sales transaction under section 36b of the arms export contro l act congress must be formally notified 30 calendar days before the administration can take the final steps to conclude governmentto government foreign military sale of major defense equipment valued at 14 million or more defense articles or services valued at 50 million or more or design and construction services valued at 200 million or more in the case of such sales to na to member states nato japan australia or new zealand congress must be formally notified 15 calendar days before the administration can proceed with the sale however the prior notice threshold values are higher for na to members australia japan or new zealand these higher thresholds are 25000000 for the sale enhancement or upgrading of major defense equipment 100000000 for the sale enhancement or upgrading of defense articles and defense services and 300000000 for the sale enhancement or upgrading of design and construction services so long as such sales to these countries do not include or involve sales to country outside of this group of nations commercially licensed arms sales also must be formally notified to congress 30 calendar days before the export license is issued if they involve the sale of major defense equipment valued at 14 million or more or defense articles or services valued at 50 million or more section 36c 1 letter of february 18 1976 from lt general hm fish usaf director defense security assistance agency to senator hubert h humphrey senate committee on foreign relations 2 22 usc 2776b

australia or new zealand congress must be formally notified 15 calendar days before the administration can proceed with such sale however the prior notice threshold values are higher for sales to nato members australia japan or new zealand specifically 25000000 for the sale enhancement or upgrading of major defense equipment 100000000 for the sale enhancement or upgrading of defense articles and defense services and 300000000 for the sale enhancement or upgrading of design and construction services so long as such sales to these countries do not include or involve sales to country outside of this group of nations furthermore commercially licensed arms sales cases involving defense articles that are firearms controlled under category i of the united states munitions list and valued at 1 million or more must also be formally notified to congress for review 30 days prior to the license for export being approved 15 days prior notice is required for proposed licences for sales to na to members australia japan or new zealand it has not been the general practice for the administration to provide 20day informal notification to congress of arms sales proposals that would be made through the granting of commercial licenses 4 congressional recess or adjournment does not stop the 30 calendarday statutory review period it should be emphasized that after congress receives statutory notification required under sections 36b or 36c of the arms export control act for example and 30 calendar days elapse without congress having blocked the sale the executive branch is free to proceed with the sales process this fact does not mean necessarily that the executive branch and the prospective arms purchaser will sign sales contract and that the items will be transferred on the 31st day after the statutory notification of the proposal has been made it would however be legal to do so at that time g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g6g146g156g138g153g153g155g152g159g138g149g561g139g162g561g12g152g146g151g157g561g20g142g156g152g149g158g157g146g152g151g561 although congress has more than one legislative option it can use to block or modify an arms sale one option explicitly set out in law for blocking proposed arms sale is the use of joint resolution of disapproval as provided for in sect ion 36b of the arms export control act under the aeca the formal notification is legally required to be submitted to the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and the speaker of the house the speaker has routinely referred these notifications to the house foreign affairs committee as the committee of jurisdiction as courtesy the defense department has submitted copy of the statutory notification to the house foreign affairs committee when that notification is submitted to the speaker of the house under this option after receiving statutory section 36b notification from the executive branch opponents of the arms sale would introduce joint resolutions in the house and senate drafted so as to forbid by law the sale of the items specified in the formal sale notifications submitted to the congress if member introduces such measure the aecas provisions expediting congressional action discussed below do not take effect 3 22 usc 2776c 4 similar notification requirements and reporting thresholds also apply to prospective retransfers of united states origin major defense equipment defense articles or defense services as stipulated in section 3d of the arms export control act aeca commercial technical assistance or manufacturing licensing agreements see section 36d aeca and leases or loans of defense articles from us defense department stocks see sections 62 and 63 aeca as with arms sales congress can block any of these re portable transactions by enacting joint resolution of disapproval as stipulated in the arms export control act aeca see 22 usc 2753 2776 2796

sale proposal if majority of either the house or the senate committee supported the joint resolution of disapproval they would report it to their re spective chamber in accordance with its rules following this efforts would be made to seek floor consideration of the resolution g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g156g561 at this point it is important to take note of procedures crafted to expedite the consideration of arms sales resolutions of disapproval since 1 976 section 36b2 of the arms export control act has stipulated that consideration of any resolution of disapproval in the senate under section 36b1 of the aeca shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 601b of the international security assistance and arms xport control act of 1976 pl 94329 90 stat 729 since 1980 this stipulation has also applied to resolutions of disapproval in the senate relating to commercially licensed arms sales under section 36c1 of the arms export control act the purpose of section 601b was to establish rules to facilitate timely consideration of any resolution of disapproval in the senate the rules set forth in section 601b supersede the standing rules of the senate and among other things do the following give the committee with jurisdiction the senate foreign relations committee 10 calendar days from the date resolution of disapproval is referred to it to report back to the senate its recommendation on any such resolution certain adjournment periods are excluded from computation of the 10 days make it in order for senator favoring disapproval resolution to move to discharge the committee from further consideration of the matter if the committee fails to report back to the senate by the end of the 10 calendar days it is entitled to review the resolution the aeca expressly permits discharge motion after 5 calendar days for sales to nato nato nations japan australia and new zealand make the discharge motion privileged limit floor debate on the motion to one hour and preclude efforts to amend or to reconsider the vote on such motion make the motion to proceed to consider resolution of disapproval privileged and preclude efforts to amend or to reconsider the vote on such motion limit the overall time for debate on the resolution of disapproval to 10 hours and preclude efforts to amend or recommit the resolution of disapproval limit the time one hour to be used in connection with any debatable motion or appeal provide that motion to further limit debate on resolution of disapproval debatable motion or appeal is not debatable the senate is constitutionally empowered to amend its rules or to effect rule change at any time the fact that an existing rule is in section 601 of the international security assistance and arms export control act of 1976 is not an obstacle to changing it by senate action alone should the senate wish to do so

motion to proceed to the consideration of joint resolution

committee as highly privileged generally this means that the resolution will be given precedence over most other legislative business of the house and may be called up on the floor without special rule reported by the rules committee unlike for the senate however the aeca contains provision for discharge of the house committee if it does not report on the joint resolution if reported and called up the measure will be considered in the committee of the whole meaning that amendments can be offered under the fiveminute rule nevertheless amendments to joint resolutions disapproving arms sales have apparently never been offered in the house the rules committee usually sets the framework for floor consideration of major legislation in the house of representatives however and could do so for joint resolution of disapproval upon receiving request for rule to govern co nsideration of such resolution the house rules committee could set time limit for debate exclude any amendments to and waive any points of order against the resolution if the house adopted the rule reported by the committee it would govern the manner in which the legislation would be considered superseding the statutory provision g8g146g151g138g149g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561 after joint resolution is passed by both the house and the senate the measure would next be sent to the president once this legislation reache s the president presumably he would veto it in timely manner congress would then have to muster twothirds majority in both houses to override the veto and impose its position on the president g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g23g156g142g561g152g143g561g17g157g145g142g155g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 congress can also block or modify proposed sale of major defense equipment or defense articles and services if it uses the regular legislative process to pass legislation prohibiting or modifying the sale or prohibiting delivery of the equipment to the recipient country while it is generally presumed that congress will await formal notification under section 36b or 36c of the arms export control act before acting in opposition to prospective arms sale it is clear that properly drafted law could block or modify an arms sale transaction at any timeincluding before formal aeca notification was submitted or after the 30day aeca statutory notification period had expiredso long as the items have not been delivered to the recipient country congressional use of its lawmaking power rega rding arms sales is not constrained by the reporting requirements of the arms export contro l act in order to prevail however congress must be capable of overriding presidential veto of this legislation for the president would presumably veto bill that blocked his wish to make the arms sale in question this means in practical terms that to impose its view on the president congress must be capable of securing twothirds majority of those present and voting in both houses there are important practical advantages however to prohibiting or modifying sale if congress wishes to do so prior to the date when the formal contract with the foreign government is signedwhich could occur at any time after the statutory 30day period these advantages include 1 limiting political damage to bilateral relations that could result from signing sales contract and later nullifying it with new law and 2 avoiding financial liabilities which the united states government might face for breaking valid sales contract the legislative vehicle designed to prohibit or modify specific arms sale can take variety of forms ranging from

or joint resolution the only essential features that the vehicle must have are 1 that it is legislation passed by both houses of congress and presented to the president for his signature or veto and 2 that it contains an express restriction on the sale andor the delivery of military equipment whether it applies to specific items or general categories to specific country or countries

the president also has the legal authority to waive the 30day statutory review period set out in the arms export control ac t for example if the president states in the formal notification to congress under sections 36b1 or 36c1 of the arms export control act that an emergency exists which requires the sale or export license approval to be made immediately in the national security interests of the united states he is free to proceed with the sale without further delay he must provide congress at the time of this notification detailed justification for his determination including description of the emergency circumstances which necessitated his action and discussion of the national security interests involved section 614a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 faa as amended 5 also allows the president among other things to waive provisio ns of the arms export control act the foreign assistance act of 1961 faa and any act author izing or appropriating funds for use under either the aeca or faa in order to make available during each fiscal year up to 750 million in cash arms sales and up to 250 million in funds not more than 50 million of the 250 million limitation on funds use may be made available to any single country in any fiscal year through this waiver authority unless the country is victim of active aggression not more than 500 million of cash sales or cash sales and funds made available combined may be provided under this waiver authority to any one country in any fiscal year to waive the provisions of these acts related to arms sales the president must determin and notify congress in writing that it is vital to the national security interests of the united states to do so before exercising the authority granted in section 614a the president must consult with and provide written policy justification to the house foreign affairs international relations and the senate foreign relations committees and house and senate appropriations committees in summary in the absence of strong majority in both houses of congress supporting legislation to block or modify prospective arms sale the practical and procedural obstacles to passing such lawwhether freestanding measure or one within the existing framework of the arms export control actare great even if the congress can pass the requisite legislation to work its will on an arms sale the president need only veto it and secure the support of onethird plus one of the members of either the senate or the house to have his veto sustained and permit him to make the sale it should be noted that congress has never successfully blocked proposed arms sale by use of joint resolution of disapproval although it has come close to doing so see textbox note below for detailed legislative history nevertheless

persian gulf crisis the george hw bush administration reportedly planned to make large arms sales of several advanced weapons systems to saudi arabia some reports placed the value of potential saudi arms package at over 20 billion during executive branch consultations with congress it became clear that there was significant opposition to such large and controversial arms sales package taking place so close to congressional adjournment when it would not be possible for congress to make careful review of it in response this bush administration submitted smaller arms package of about 7 billion for saudi arabia for formal congressional review in september 1990 this package was composed of only those weapons systems deemed most urgently needed by the saudis and ones for which the need for quick american procurement decisions was especially critical agreement was reached at the time between the bush administration and congress that final decisions on other major weapons sales to
