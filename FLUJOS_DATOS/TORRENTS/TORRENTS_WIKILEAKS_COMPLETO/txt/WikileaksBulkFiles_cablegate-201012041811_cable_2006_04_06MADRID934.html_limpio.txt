ref madrid 765 b madrid 783 classified by ambassador eduardo aguirre for reasons 14 b and d 1 u summary two years after it lost in the dramatic elections of march 14 2004 three days after the march 11 terrorist attacks spains main opposition party the partido popular pp finds itself outmaneuvered and either isolated with radical nationalists or forced to collaborate with the socialist government of jose luis rodriguez zapatero on the most important issues of spanish domestic politics even when the governing psoe socialist party was losing ground in opinion polls the statistics did not reflect any increase in popularity for the pp only fall in the government approval rating because of uncertainty about regional questions in catalonia and the basque country the recent ceasefire announcement by the basque terrorist group eta has raised the governments poll ratings significantly and marks monumental inflection point for the pp in its search for the critical swing votes at the center of the political spectrum combination of leadership and message problems has kept the pp from capturing the imagination of the spanish electorate along with consistent underestimation of the political skill of the zapatero government it may take an internal revolution in the party or significant recalibration of strategy for the pp to come back in the immediate future end summary to everything 2 c since losing the march 2004 elections the partido popular led by mariano rajoy and his team of veterans from the government of jose maria aznar has struggled to make headway against the ruling socialist party psoe and the government of jose luis rodriguez zapatero blaming the pp loss on the march 11 train bombings and the evil machinations of the socialists embassy pp contacts have consistently seemed to think that their election loss was really mistake massive misunderstanding on the part of the electorate ignoring the very real issues voters disagreed with them on the war in iraq which 90 of spaniards opposed and importantly the aznar governments handling of the march 11 attacks the party has spent the last two years trying to win support by harassing the zapatero government on everything it does including when it is cooperating with the usg 3 c pp contacts have told us that their party strategy has been to attack the government at every turn these attacks made ideological sense when the pp criticized the government on issues such as gay marriage education reform reducing the influence of the catholic church or even in opposing gos policy on cuba and venezuela however the pp also chose to take the government to task over spanish military presence in afghanistan and the participation of the spanish frigate alvaro basan in the us theodore roosevelt battle group in the persian gulf policies of this government which support us goals the pps attacks on these policies were therefore inconsistent with their own stated aims the hook 4 u according to numerous public opinion polls the pp made little or dent beyond its own base in the governments popularity with its attack strategy until truly divisive issue came about the reform of the catalan autonomy statute estatut in the catalan language as the catalans tried to declare in the legal document defining their relations with madrid that they constitute nation many spaniards wanted to know why the government seemed to be letting them pull out of the spanish nation they supposedly already belonged to in addition the new estatut was to give catalonia broad fiscal independence beyond what any other region of spain had ever been granted while the issue of the estatut did not worry all spaniards enough were concerned that government approval ratings began to fall this was exacerbated last autumn by floods of subsaharan wouldbe immigrants charging spanish borders at ceuta and melilla as well as by speculation that the socialist government was holding talks with basque terrorist group eta 5 u the estatut immigration and terrorism concerns gave the pp the hook it needed to be able to craft message that might help it benefit from the governments falling popularity rajoy catalan pp leader josep pique and madrid 00000934 002 of 004 national leaders such as pp secretary general angel acebes and parliamentary spokesman eduardo zaplana began speaking of national unity equality for all spaniards in other words special privileges for catalans and basques and joining together to put forth strong face internationally harkening back to the aznar days when the pp says spain had more prestige both within the european union as well as on the wider international stage nonetheless while government popularity continued to fall the pp did not pick up any support for itself with this message and now the eta ceasefire has diminished public concerns about negotiating with the basque group and raised zapateros poll numbers substantially by as much as eight percentage points in one poll 6 c interestingly pp leaders do not seem persuaded of the need to change the message influence the poll numbers or attract more swing voters zaplana told the ambassador on march 29 that the pp base would likely carry the party in any future elections once again reflecting the pp belief that the 2004 loss was oneoff fluke and that it was important to take care of that base in meeting with the ambassador acebes explained that the pps platform was one of spanish unity stable public administration and solid economic plan the pp claims repeatedly that this platform is one of principle whose correctness will be recognized in time by the electorate meanwhile it continues to paint picture of gloom and doom for the country under the zapatero with aznar claiming that the balkanization of spain is near with an independent catalonia and basque country it is true that the message and apocalyptic image rally the pp base zaplana spoke of base that is somewhat larger than psoes and most nonpp spaniards certainly do not want to see the break up of spain nevertheless the socialists poll numbers rise leadership 7 c key reason the pp was not able to capitalize on the psoe poll decline is its top leadership with personalities ranging from lackluster to radioactive the principal leaders of the pp were all close to former president jose maria aznar and are closely associated with the aznar era during the 2004 elections before the march 11 attacks association with aznar was positive given the presidents popularity his former vice president mariano rajoy was expected to sweep to victory as leader of the party but since the attacks the team has been tainted by the aznar governments handling of the aftermath of the march 11 bombings when it claimed that basque terrorist group eta was responsible and appeared to keep information on islamist involvement from the public 10 c rajoy is generally considered competent and intelligent leader but not especially charismatic acebes who was interior minister in march 2004 is viewed in particularly negative light because of his direct involvement in the handling of the attacks zaplana is also closely identified with the aznar legacy and is often criticized for his very conservative stance on most issues he recently commented in congressional debate on vice president maria teresa fernandez vegas wardrobe choices to feminist indignation see reftel for more on acebes and zaplana 9 c and then there is the everpresent former president jose maria aznar who carries only ceremonial title in the partido popular but who casts his large shadow over everything the party does see reftel b after an extremely successful eight years in office during which the spanish economy flourished and spains standing in the world increased substantially aznar stepped down as party leader and appointed mariano rajoy his successor because of his success he is still enormously admired within the party when aznar enters room full of pp activists hush falls over the crowd when aznar walked into book presentation for pp parliamentarian and selfproclaimed shadow foreign minister gustavo aristeguis latest book jihad in spain aristegui gave spontaneous speech on how aznar had been his inspiration in his first meeting with ambassador aguirre on december 15 2005 aznar claimed that he and his think tank faes were careful not to interfere in national political battles yet in reality at every opportunity aznar leverages his past influence including his access to highlevel usg officials to affect current political discourse and because of his cult status within the party ranks the current leadership of the party has difficulty setting the course underestimating the enemy madrid 00000934 003 of 004 10 c all of the leaders of the pp machine rajoy acebes and zaplana as well as former president aznar speak of president jose luis rodriguez zapatero with scorn and condescension zaplana told the ambassador that zapatero is full of himself and has too much confidence in his ability to maneuver politically particularly in an election campaign aznar called him weak and vacillating reftel b 11 c in reality while the question of whether zapateros policies are intelligent or correct is certainly open for discussion it is clear that the government has outmaneuvered the opposition on the two most controversial issues of this parliamentary session the catalan statute and the future of eta zapatero united at the last moment with the centrist catalan nationalist party convergencia i unio working all night with party leader artur mas to hammer out an accord agreeable to both sides and passable in parliament the pp opposed the agreement leaving it isolated in parliament with the ultranationalist catalan party erc the only two parties to vote against the text 12 c after the pp spent months accusing the government of negotiating with terrorists by talking to eta the group announced ceasefire using some of the least demanding language ever seen in its communiques polls indicate that swing voters are turning toward the government and around 64 of spaniards say the government should look into the possibility of peace negotiations and the pp should join in that effort the pp has found itself obligated to cooperate with zapatero in pursuit of peace with little hope of political gain if the ceasefire turns out to be permanent the zapatero government will get the credit for peace yet if eta begins demanding too much in negotiations and the pp turns against the process it could be blamed for the failure this supposedly weak president has managed completely to isolate the more politically experienced opposition on both issues and if as post suspects zapatero manages to keep negotiations with eta going until after the general elections expected in early 2008 or if he succeeds outright in bringing peace through negotiation he will be difficult to defeat given the continued strength of the economy and the prospect of the end of eta after almost 50 years of existence revolution 13 c given the rigid structure of political parties in spain barring internal party revolution it is nearly impossible for politicians to come to leadership in party without working their way through the ranks and spending years paying homage to their elders an internal pp revolution is not impossible however if the party continues to underestimate the governing party and fails to put forth strategy to win votes future election losses perhaps in 2008 will force radical change in the leadership in such case certainly acebes and zaplana would have to depart center stage and probably most of the former ministers from the aznar government 14 c there are several pp personalities who would be wellpositioned in the event of such revolution they are slightly more centrist on social issues solidly conservative on economic issues with wide crossover appeal to psoe voters all have extensive and successful experience in public administration alberto ruizgallardon consistently one of the most popular politicians in spain according to opinion polls the mayor of madrid has nonetheless not been in the inner circle within his own party and is despised by the far right wing of the pp he has challenged party orthodoxy on several occasions supporting nonconsensus candidates for leadership positions and criticizing his partys time in government after madrid lost its bid to host the olympic games in 2012 when several pp politicians outrageously blamed the loss on the psoe governments deteriorated relationship with the united states gallardon who had spearheaded the bid commented if anyone is to blame it is dont let anyone place the responsibility anywhere else i assume it all in his speech at the pp national convention in march 2006 he proposed that his party look at the possibility of neutralizing the radical discourse that is taking over and to reinvent it using moderating message to reassure the citizens we need to fight for the things we need to fight for but we cannot let dogmatic attitudes carry us away to dogmatism our place is with the people with their real madrid 00000934 004 of 004 concerns with statements such as these gallardon comes across to swing voters and to many socialists as principled rather than partisan after eight years as president of the madrid region and now three years as mayor he has extensive political and administrative experience his controversial urban renewal plan for madrid which has caused great upheaval on the highways and in the subways of the city is still wildcard as many madrilenos and embassy employees spend hours in traffic jams around construction sites all over the city if the work comes out well however the renewal of madrid could be strong positive for gallardons political ambitions francisco camps camps anointed by eduardo zaplana followed in his footsteps to become president of the generalitat valenciana valencia region and regional pp president since he was elected in 2003 he has fallen out with his former mentor and worked hard to forge his own political identity both within the generalitat and nationally after he worked across parties to agree on the reform of the valencia regional statute in 2005 he has become the pp poster child for bipartisan cooperation the partys proof on the national stage that it really can work with the opposition party though still relatively young his national stature has grown substantially and he seems good candidate to move into the pp national leadership in the event of major shakeup esperanza aguirre president of the madrid region as well as regional pp president aguirre has been very close to the current pp inner circle and sworn enemy of gallardon serving as aznars education minister during his first term and president of the senate during his second nonetheless she retains wider base and because of her regional experience certain distance that would likely allow her to take on leadership role in the party in time of change despite her ties to the old guard she describes herself as neoliberal but has advocated certain pragmatism on social issues when dealing with the zapatero government for example describing the pp leaderships insistence in taking the new gay marriage law to the constitutional court as politically inopportune because of her extensive political experience and national stature she could be good transition leader in redirected partido popular 15 c all three of these politicians are expected to rewin their positions in regional and municipal elections coming up in 2007 consolidating madrid and valencia as pp strongholds the current pp leadership hopes these elections will give the party the push it needs nationally to win national elections in 2008 in the two years left before the elections there may yet be surprises that would give the pp real advantage if eta negotiations break down or if the strong spanish economy falters the pp could find its chance to take votes away from zapatero with peace on the horizon and strong enconomy however on their current trajectory zapatero and psoe look wellplaced to win again perhaps even with an increased majority at that point the pp would have to start looking at these regional leaders to take it in new direction nationally aguirre
