regions policy issues for congress skepticism in the united states about the value of military exchanges with china has increased after the experiences in the 1990s crises like the plas missile exercises targeting taiwan in 19951996 mistaken bombing of the prc embassy in belgrade in 1999 and the f8ep3 collision crisis of 2001 and changes in the us policy approach since 2002 president bush has pursued closer relationship with the prc as the defense department gradually resumes the miltomil relationship in that context policy issues for congress include whether the administration has complied with legislation and has used leverage effectively in its contacts with the pla to advance prioritized list of us security interests while balancing security concerns about the plas warfighting capabilities crs8 congressional oversight one issue for congress in examining the military relationship with the prc is the role of congress including the extent of congressional oversight of the administrations policy congress could as it has in the past consider options to host pla delegations on capitol hill or meet them at other venues engage with the pla as an aspect of visits by codels to china receive briefings by the administration before andor after military visits hold hearings on related issues investigate or oversee investigations of prisonerofwarmissingin action powmia

seniorlevel discussions with france and other countries in the eu about the issue of whether to lift the embargo on arms sales to china he said certainly for the united states our statutes and regulations prohibit sales of defense items to china we believe that others should maintain their current arms embargoes as well we believe that the us and european prohibitions on arms sales are complementary were imposed for the same reasons specifically serious human rights abuses and that those reasons remain valid today10 at hearing of the house international relations committee on february 11 2004 representative steve chabot asked secretary of state colin powell about the eus reconsideration of the arms embargo against china as 10 department of state press briefing by richard boucher spokesman january 28 2004 crs9 supported by france powell responded that he raised this issue with the foreign ministers of france ireland united kingdom and germany and expressed opposition

joint defense conversion commission in china in october 1994 secretary of defense william perry and pla general ding henggao director of the commission of science technology and industry for national defense costind12 set up the uschina joint defense conversion commission its stated goal was to facilitate economic cooperation and technical exchanges and cooperation in the area of defense conversion however on june 1 1995 the house national security committee issued hrept 104131 for the national defense authorization act for fy1996 and expressed concerns that this commission led to us assistance to prc firms with direct ties to the pla and possible subsidies to the pla the committee inserted section to prohibit the use of dod funds for activities associated with the commission the senates bill had similar language on january 22 1996 conferees reported in conference report 104450 that they agreed to provision section 1343 in pl 104106 to require the secretary of defense to submit semi annual reports on the commission they also noted that continued usprc security dialogue can promote stability in the region and help protect american interests and the interests of americas asian allies nonetheless they warned that congress intends to examine whether that dialogue has produced tangible results in human rights transparency in military spending and doctrine missile and nuclear nonproliferation and other important us security interests then in the national defense authorization act for fy1997 pl 104201 enacted in september 23 1996 congress banned dod from using any funds for any activity associated with the commission until 15 days after the first semiannual report is received by congress in light of this controversy secretary perry terminated the commission and informed congress in letter dated july 18 1996 past reporting requirement also in 1996 the house national security committee issued hrept 104563 for the national defense authorization

benefitted us interests in early 1999 under the clinton administration the washington times disclosed the existence of gameplan for 1999 ussino defense exchanges and pentagon spokesperson kenneth bacon confirmed that an exchange program had been under way for years13 representative dana rohrabacher wrote letter to secretary of defense william cohen saying that after reviewing the game plan it appears evident that number of events involving pla logistics acquisitions quartermaster and chemical corps representatives may benefit pla modernization to the detriment of our allies in the pacific region and ultimately the lives of own service members he requested detailed written description of various exchanges14 in december 2001 under the bush administration senator bob smith and representative dana rohrabacher wrote to secretary of defense donald rumsfeld expressing concerns about renewed military contacts with the prc they contended that military exchanges failed to reduce tensions evident in the ep3 crisis lacked reciprocity and provided militarilyuseful information to the pla they charged that the clinton administration largely ignored the spirit and intent of legislation governing military exchanges with the pla including violation of the law by allowing the pla to visit the joint forces command in august 2000 and as initiators of the legislation they reminded rumsfeld of the congressional restrictions15 prohibitions in the fy2000 ndaa enacted on october 5 1999 the fy2000 national defense authorization act ndaa set parameters to contacts with the pla section 1201 of the ndaa for fy2000 pl 10665 prohibits the secretary of defense from authorizing any miltomil contact with the pla if that contact would create national security risk due to an

the secretary of defense rather than an authority in congress or outside of the defense department is also required to submit an annual written certification by december 31 of each year as to whether any military contact with china that the secretary of defense authorized in that year was violation of the restrictions at hearing of the house armed services committee on march 9 2006 admiral fallon commander of the pacific command raised with representative victor snyder the issue of whether to modify this legislation to relax restrictions on contacts with the pla16 skeptics say that it is not necessary to change or lift the law to enhance exchanges while the law contains prudent parameters that do not ban all contacts third option would be for congress or the secretary of defense to clarify what type of miltomil contact with the pla would create national security risk due to an inappropriate exposure at hearing of the house armed services committee on june 13 2007 deputy under secretary of defense richard lawless contended that limitations in the law should not change the pla objects to the us law claiming that it restricts the militarytomilitary relationship required

for the larger security relationship with the prc the law did not specify whether the report shall be unclassified andor classified in the report submitted in january 2001 on past miltomil exchanges the pentagon stated that as matter of policy all exchange activities are conducted at the unclassified level thus there is data included on the section addressing pla access to classified data as result of exchange activities on june 8 2001 deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz signed and submitted an unclassified report on the miltomil exchanges in 2000 under the clinton administration

agreed to it on december 21 2005 leverage to pursue us security objectives objectives at different times under the clinton and bush administrations dod has pursued exchanges with the pla to various degrees of closeness as part of the policy of engagement in the bilateral relationship with china the record of the miltomil contacts in over ten years can be used to evaluate the extent to which those contacts provided tangible benefits to advance us security goals the pentagons last east asia strategy report issued by secretary of defense cohen in november 1998 placed comprehensive engagement with china in third place among nine components of the us strategy it said that usprc dialogue was critical to ensure understanding of each others regional security interests reduce misperceptions increase understanding of prc security concerns and build confidence to avoid military accidents and miscalculations while calling the strategic nontargeting agreement announced at the

open discussion complement the broader effort to engage the prc reduce the likelihood of miscalculations regarding crossstrait issues deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz told reporters on may

when opportunities arise so wed like to enhance those opportunities for interaction but we believe that to be successful we have to have principles of transparency and reciprocity its very important that theres mutual benefit to both sides the more each country knows about what the other one is doing the less danger is there i believe of misunderstanding and confrontation22 in agreeing to discuss resumption of miltomil contacts secretary of defense donald rumsfeld told reporters on june 21 2002 that assistant secretary of defense peter rodman would talk to the pla about the principles of

mistake miscalculation and misunderstanding if these militarytomilitary exchanges actually lead to our gaining insights into chinese thinking and policies and capabilities and the like and they can gain insights into ours then it doesnt mean well necessarily agree on everything but it at least means that as were making our policies were making them on the basis of accurate information23 in march

greater openness and transparency in its military capabilities and intentions promote stable uschina relations increase mutual understanding between us and pla officers encourage china to play constructive and peaceful role in the asia pacific region to act as partner in addressing common security challenges and to emerge as responsible stakeholder in the world debate us security objectives in miltomil contacts with china have included gaining insights about the plas capabilities and concepts deterrence against pla use of force or coercion against taiwan or us allies reduction in tensions in the taiwan strait strategic arms control weapons nonproliferation in countries such as like north korea iran and pakistan closer engagement with top prc leaders freedom of navigation and flight preventing dangers to us military personnel operating in proximity to the pla minimizing misperceptions and miscalculations and accounting for american powmias skeptics of usprc miltomil contacts say they have had little value for achieving these us objectives instead that they contend that the contacts served to inform the pla as it builds its warfighting capability against taiwan and the united states which it views as potential adversary and seemed to reward belligerence they oppose rehabilitation of pla officers involved in the tiananmen crackdown they question whether the pla has shown transparency and reciprocated with equivalent or substantive access and urge greater attention to us allies over china from this perspective the ups and downs in the military relationship reflect its use as tool in the bilateral political relationship in which the prc at times had leverage over the united states thus they contend realistic appraisal of the nature of the pla threat would call for caution in military contacts with china perhaps limiting them to exchanges such as strategic talks and senior level policy dialogues rather than operational areas that involve military capabilities former us army attache in beijing wrote in 1999 that under the clinton administration militarytomilitary contacts allowed pla officers broad access to us warships exercises and even military manuals he argued that many of the military contacts between the united states and china over the years helped the pla attain its goals in military modernization he called for limiting exchanges to strategic dialogue on weapons proliferation taiwan the korean peninsula freedom of navigation missile defense etc he urged policymakers not to improve the plas capability to wage war against taiwan or us friends and allies its ability to project force or its ability to repress the chinese people24 he also testified to congress in 2000 that the pla conceals its capabilities in exchanges with the united states for example he said the pla invited general john shalikashvili chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to see the capabilities of the 15th airborne army in may 1997 but it showed him highly scripted routine furthermore the pla allowed 24 larry wortzel why caution is needed in military contacts with china heritage foundation backgrounder december 2 1999 crs15 secretary of defense cohen to visit an air defense command center in january 1998 but it was hollow shell of local headquarters it was not the equivalent of americas national command center that was shown to prc leaders25 in 2000 randy schriver former official in the office of the secretary of defense discussed lessons learned in conducting military exchanges during the clinton administration and argued for limiting such exchanges schriver assessed seniorlevel talks as exchanges of talking points rather than real dialogue but nonetheless helpful he considered the mmca successful confidencebuilding measure not knowing the ep3 aircraft collision crisis would occur less than one year later in april 2001 he also said it was positive to have pla participation in multilateral fora and to expose younger pla officers to american society however schriver said that the united states failed miserably in gaining window on the plas modernization gaining neither access as expected nor reciprocity failed to shape chinas behavior while allowing china to shape the behavior of some american ardent suitors and failed to deter the plas aggression while whetting the plas appetite in planning against potential american adversary he disclosed that the pentagon needed to exert control over the pacific commands contacts with the pla with the secretary of defense issuing memo to set guidelines he also called for continuing consultations with congress26 warning of modest expectations for military ties and that such exchanges often have been suspended to signal messages or retaliate against perceived wrong action former deputy assistant secretary of defense kurt campbell contended in late 2005 that security ties can only follow not lead the overall bilateral relationship27 after serving as deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs in the bush administration randy schriver observed in 2007 that military engagement with china has continued to pursue the same modest limited agenda that has been in place for close to 20 years despite highlevel visit by secretary of defense robert gates in november 200728 proponents of military exchanges with the prc point out that contacts with the pla cannot be expected to equal contacts with allies in transparency reciprocity and consistency they argue that the miltomil contacts nonetheless promote us 25 larry wortzel director of the asian studies center at the heritage foundation testimony on chinas strategic intentions and goals before the house armed services committee june 21 2000 26 randy schriver former country director for china in the office of the secretary of defense during the clinton administration and later deputy assistant secretary of state for east

defense attache at the rank of brigadier general or rear admiral have contacts at levels lower than the top pla leaders and are subject to strict surveillance in china in addition to chances for open intelligence collection the military relationship can minimize miscalculations and misperceptions and foster prous leanings and understanding particularly among younger officers who might lead in the future proponents caution against treating china as if it is already an enemy since the united states seeks chinas cooperation on international security issues there might be benefits in cooperation in military medicine to prevent pandemics of diseases like avian flu during the epidemic of sars severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 it was pla doctor dr jiang yanyong who revealed the prc leaderships coverup of sars cases at premier pla hospitals29 since the early 1990s congress and the defense department have viewed china as the key to getting information to resolve the cases of powmias from the korean war citing several exchanges in 1998 commander of the pacific commands visit that included the first foreign look at the 47th group army us navy ship visit to shanghai and naval consultative talks at naval base coronado the us naval attache in beijing wrote that the process of mutual consultation openness and sharing of concerns and information needed to preclude future misunderstandings and to build mutual beneficial relations is taking place between the us and chinas armed forces especially in the military maritime domain he stressed that the importance of progress in this particular area of the sinoamerican relationship cannot be overestimated30 two former us military attaches posted to china maintained in report that regardless of whether it is highlevel dod delegation or functional exchange of medical officers the us military does learn something about the pla from every visit they advocated that the united states should fully engage china in measured longterm militarytomilitary exchange program that does not help the pla improve its warfighting capabilities they said the most effective way to ascertain developments in chinas military and defense policies is to have faceto face contact at multiple levels over an extended period of time thus they argued even though the pla minimizes foreign access to pla facilities and key officials the united states has learned and can continue to learn much about the pla through its longterm relationship31 another former us military attache in beijing from 1992 to 1995 acknowledged that he saw many pla drills and demonstrations by showcase units and never any unscripted training events nonetheless he noted that in august 2003 29 john pomfret doctor says health ministry lied about disease washington

1999 31 kenneth allen and eric mcvadon chinas foreign military relations stimson center october 1999 crs17 the pla arranged for 27 military observers from the united states and other countries to be the first foreigners to observe pla exercise at its largest training base which is in the inner mongolia region under the beijing military region he wrote that by opening this training area and exercise to foreign observers the chinese military leadership obviously was attempting to send message about its willingness to be more transparent in order to promote friendship and mutual trust between chinese and foreign armed forces32 however in second pla exercise opened to foreign observers the dragon 2004 landing exercise at the shanwei amphibious operations training base in guangdong province in september 2004 only seven foreign military observers from france germany britain and mexico attended with americans if invited33 retired pacom commander dennis blair cochaired task force on the uschina relationship its report of april 2007 recommended sustained high level military strategic dialogue to complement the senior dialogue started by the deputy secretary of state in 2005 and the strategic economic dialogue launched by the secretary of treasury in 200634 perspectives the center for naval analyses found in study that us and prc approaches to military exchanges are diametrically opposed thus raising tensions at times while the united states has pursued bottomup effort starting with lowerlevel contact to work toward mutual understanding and then strategic agreement the prc has sought trickledown relationship in which agreement on strategic issues results in understanding and then allows for specific activities later the study said that the pla leadership regards the military relationship with the us as political undertaking for strategic reasons not freestanding set of military initiatives conducted by military professionals for explicitly military reasons fundamentally the military relationship is vehicle to pursue strategic political ends while recognizing that using the military relationship to enhance military modernization is extremely important to the pla the study contended that it is not the key motive force driving the plas engagement with dod the report also argued that because the pla suspects the united states uses the military relationship for deterrence intelligence and influence it seems ludicrous for them to expose their strengths and weaknesses to the worlds sole superpower it noted that using reciprocity as measure of progress is sure to lead to disappointment35 32 dennis blasko bei jian 0308 did anyone hear the sword on the inner mongolian plains rusi chinese military update october 2003 33 xinhua

crs18 us security interests with lessons learned fundamental issue in overall policy toward china is how to use us leadership and leverage in managing prudent program of military contacts that advances and does not harm prioritized list of us security interests the pentagon could pursue such program with focused control by the office of the secretary of defense with consultation with congress and public disclosures and in coordination with allies and friends in the region such as japan south korea australia and singapore such program might include these objectives communication conflict avoidance and crisis management the various incidents of direct confrontation between the us military and pla might call for greater cooperation with china to improve communication conflict avoidance and crisis management analysts in china have studied the governments strengths and weaknesses in crisis management in light of the ep3 crisis in 200136 the crisis over the ep3 collision incident showed the limits in benefits to the united states of pursuing personal relationships with pla leaders the consultations under the military maritime consultative agreement mmca as well as the presidential hotline from the beginning of the crisis prc ruler jiang zemin pressed the united states with hardline stance while pla generals followed without any greater inflammatory rhetoric37 during his second visit to china as pacom commander in december 1997 admiral prueher said that i remember wishing i had your telephone number in response to pla naval officers question about pruehers thinking during the taiwan strait crisis in 1995199638 after becoming ambassador to china in december 1999 prueher was nonetheless frustrated when the ministry of foreign affairs and the pla would not answer the phone or return phone calls in the immediate aftermath of the ep3 collision crisis in april 200139 still some believe there could be benefits in fostering relationships with pla officers both at the senior level and with younger future leaders while in beijing in january 2004 the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general myers said that its always an advantage to be able to pick up telephone and talk to somebody that you know fairly well the relationship that i have with general liang chief of general staff the relationship that defense secretary rumsfeld has with his counterpart general cao is going to be helpful in that regard40 likewise visiting 36 authors discussions with governmentaffiliated research organizations in china in 2002 37 crs report rl30946 chinaus

about maritime and air safety there was agreement on communication during crises or rules of engagement despite the 2001 crisis the defense department encountered difficulties with the pla in discussions under the mmca including simply setting up meetings and pla objections to us activities in chinas claimed 200nautical mile exclusive economic zone eez even beyond the territorial sea up to 12 nautical miles from the coast42 in early 2005 us defense and pla officials held special policy dialogue to discuss policy disputes and end an impasse in talks over safety and operational concerns under the mmca the separate discussions continued in the defense policy coordination talks dpct held in washington in december 2006 the first combined exercise held under the mmca search and rescue exercise sarex did not take place until the fall of 2006 after eight years of discussions by 2007 the mmcas status and value were in greater doubt and mmca working groups or plenary meetings took place that year on february 2526 2008 in qingdao pacoms director for strategic planning and policy j5 usmc major general thomas conant and pla navy deputy chief of staff zhang leiyu led an annual meeting under the mmca the first since 2006 the pla sought to amend the mmca the us side opposed pla proposals to discuss policy differences at the mmca meetings and to plan details of future military

referred to using network of retired admirals who had commanded pacom and had met with pla commanders44 after stafflevel preliminary discussions in 2003 under secretary of defense douglas feith formally proposed hotline for crisis management and confidence building with the pla at the dct in february 2004 however the pla did not give positive signal until defense ministerial conference in singapore in june 2007 when lt general zhang qinsheng deputy chief of general staff said that the pla would discuss such hotline during secretary of defense robert gates visit to china in november 2007 the pla agreed in principle to set up defense telephone link dtl with the pentagon the two sides signed an agreement in february 2008 another area for possible improved communication and prevention of accidents is air traffic control in china which is controlled by the pla air force in december 2006 the pla suddenly shut down the busy pudong international airport near shanghai and at least three other airports under the nanjing military region ostensibly for training45 transparency reciprocity and informationexchange critics of military exchanges with china have charged that the united states gained limited information about the pla while granting greater access to the pla than the access we received related question in the debate has concerned the extent to which the issues of reciprocity and transparency should affect or impede efforts to increase mutual understanding with the pla according to the pentagons report submitted to congress in january 2001 in 1998 the pla denied requests by the us air force chief of staff general ryan to fly in an su27 fighter see integration of the su27s into units and see progress in development of the f10 fighter also in 1998 the pla denied us request for secretary of defense cohen to visit chinas national command center still the pla requested access to us exercises showing warfighting capabilities with two cases of denial by the pentagon in 1999 pla requests to send observers to the us armys premier national training center ntc at fort irwin in california and to the red flag air combat training exercise at nellis air force base in nevada see entry on pla delegations visit in march 1999 regarding controversial access to the us armys ntc visits by pla delegations in the 1990s included those in november 1994 and december 199746 then in december 1998 the us army reportedly resisted pla request for greater unprecedented access to the ntc in 1999 because the pla asked for access 44 forum on evolving and

direct access the 3rd infantry division mechanized and the 82nd airborne division in training exercise army officials reportedly felt pressured by admiral prueher at pacom and secretary cohen to grant the request in the end the pentagon announced on march 17 1999 that it denied the plas request47 the defense departments 2003 report to congress on prc military power charged that since the 1980s us military exchange delegations to china have been shown only showcase units never any advanced units or any operational training or realistic exercises48 however rand study in 2004 argued that the dods statement appears to be inaccurate rand reported that between 1993 and 1999 us visitors went to 51 pla units pla delegations visited 71 us military units between 1994 and 1999 the report recommended that the best way of dealing with the reciprocity and transparency issue is to remove it as an issue it called for proper planning and focus on educational exchanges49 in 2005 the prc did not allow us forces to observe the major combined pla russian military exercise peace mission 2005 and prohibited us participation in the multilateral humanitarian exercise in hong kong to which us forces had joined for years in the past50 still pacom commander admiral fallon invited pla observers to the us valiant shield exercise that brought three aircraft carriers to waters off guam in june 2006 in august 2007 the us observers were not invited to monitor the prcrussian combined exercise peace mission 2007 nonetheless us participants in contacts with the pla have reported gaining insights into

to flare since the mid1990s with many observers fearing the possibility of war looming between the united states and china two nuclear powers the bush administration maintains that it has managed balanced policy toward beijing and taipei that preserves peace and stability nonetheless in april 2004 assistant secretary of state james kelly testified to congress that us efforts at deterring chinas coercion might fail if beijing becomes convinced that it must stop taiwan from advancing on course toward permanent separation from china51 kelly also noted that the prc leadership accelerated the pla buildup after 1999 the pentagon reported to congress in may 2004 that the pla has accelerated modernization including missile buildup in response to concerns about taiwan52 under the taiwan relations act tra pl 968 that has governed us policy toward taiwan since 1979 congress has oversight of the presidents management of the crossstrait situation under the rubric of the one china policy53 while considering contacts with the pla the united states after the 19951996 taiwan strait crisis has increased arms sales to and ties with taiwans military54 policy considerations include offering arms sales and cooperation to help taiwans selfdefense securing leverage over beijing and taipei deterring aggression or coercion discouraging provocations from beijing or taipei and supporting cross strait dialogue and confidencebuilding measures in educational exchanges with the pla questions have concerned whether to allow pla officers to attend us military academies colleges or universities and how that change could affect attendees from taiwans military and whether to allow attendees from taiwan at pacoms asia pacific center for security studies apcss concerning the apcss courses in honolulu the bush administrations policy change to allow attendance from taiwan has affected the plas attendance and interactions among the us prc and other asian militaries in november 2001 the department of defense directed apcss to allow people from taiwan to participate in courses and conferences acknowledging the potential difficulty for continuing participation by the

defense treaty of 1954 terminated at the end of 1979 and the tra does not commit the united states to defend taiwan the tra states that it is us policy among other points to consider any nonpeaceful efforts to determine the future of taiwan including boycotts or embargoes threat to the peace and security of the western pacific region and of grave concern to the united states to provide taiwan with arms of defensive character making available to taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable taiwan to maintain sufficient selfdefense capability to maintain the us capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security or the social or economic system of the people on taiwan there is question about the extent of the us role in supporting crossstrait dialogue in shanghai in july 2000 visiting secretary of defense cohen said that the clinton administration viewed the newlyelected president chen shuibian of taiwan as offering hope for crossstrait reconciliation cohen stepped out of the narrow miltomil context and met with wang daohan chairman of the prcs association for relations across the taiwan strait arats this meeting raised questions about the us role in more actively encouraging crossstrait talks cohen said that chen showed flexibility after becoming president and that there was window of opportunity for changes56 in contrast in beijing in february 2004 visiting under secretary of defense feith said he did not discuss the contentious issue raised by pla leaders at length concerning referendums in taiwan an issue over which the prc threatened to use force feith said he did not discuss the issue because it was not defenserelated57 there are complications in consideration of the question of taiwan in the us prc military relationship not discussing taiwan leaves the primary dispute subject to misperception or miscalculation however linking the taiwan question can raise tensions and frustrations over disagreement that military exchanges cannot solve 2007 study coauthored by former pacom commander dennis blair called for 55 authors

tensions across the taiwan strait58 the pla has suspended military exchanges in retaliation for steps in us policy toward taiwan especially continued arms sales however even as the pla signaled its displeasure and urged us cooperation in peace and stability in the taiwan strait suspensions of military exchanges have played counterproductive role by raising usprc tensions moreover the prcs implicit linkage has targeted the us navy in particular precisely the service advocating engagement with the pla after taiwans president chen shuibian proposed in june 2007 that taiwan hold referendum on membership in the under the name taiwan on the day of the next presidential election scheduled for march 22 2008 beijing opposed it as step toward taiwans jure independence while joining the prc in opposing the referendum the bush administration continued the us policy of providing some security assistance to taiwan after notifications to congress of arms sales to taiwan in september and november 2007 the prc protested by refusing to hold militarytomilitary exchanges including an annual mmca meeting scheduled for october 2007 the prc also denied port visits at hong kong in november 2007 by us navy minesweepers in distress uss patriot and uss guardian and by the carrier group led by the uss kitty hawk for the thanksgiving holiday and family reunions leading to official protests by the pentagon to the pla after sailing away from the denied port call in hong kong toward japan the uss kitty hawk sailed through the taiwan strait raising objections in china with claims in prc media of the strait as chinas internal waterway when asked at news conference in beijing on january 15 2008 visiting pacom commander admiral keating said we dont need chinas permission to go through the taiwan strait its international water we will exercise our free right of passage whenever and wherever we choose as we have done repeatedly in the past and well do in the future two days later when asked whether ships need the prcs permission to sail through the taiwan strait chinas foreign ministry spokesperson did not reject the idea of permission from beijing while claiming the strait as highly sensitive area weapons nonproliferation despite past engagement with the pla to seek cooperation in weapons nonproliferation the united states continues to have concerns about prc entities and has repeatedly imposed sanctions secretary of defense cohen visited china and urged its commitment to weapons nonproliferation china did not join in the usled proliferation security initiative psi announced by president bush in may 2003 to interdict dangerous shipments there is debate about the policy of the bush administration in engaging china and the pla in multilateral effort to achieve the dismantlement of north koreas nuclear weapons and nuclear programs in april 2003 china hosted trilateral talks among the united states china and north korea then china hosted the first round of sixnation talks in august 2003 that also included japan south 58 dennis blair and carla hills cochairs of task force at the council on foreign relations uschina relations an affirmative agenda

pyongyang the seriousness of the tensions and warn against provocative actions beijing has hosted additional rounds of sixparty talks after the third round prc leaders hosted north koreas defense minister in july 2004 there have been questions about whether china has been adequately assertive in using its economic and political leverage over north korea and whether china shares the us priority of the complete verifiable and irreversible dismantlement not just freeze of north koreas nuclear weapons programs china nonetheless has stated the common goal of nuclearfree korean peninsula and demonstrated its displeasure with north korea after its missile and nuclear tests in 2006 including during cmc vice chairman guo boxiongs visit in the united states in 200659 strategic nuclear and space talks as for strategic nuclear dialogue the clinton administration had included nuclear forces as priority area for expanded military discussions including during the visits to china in 1998 of secretary of defense cohen and president clinton in his visit to china in 1998 president clinton announced bilateral agreement not to target strategic nuclear weapons against each other but it was symbolic and lacked implementation since then concerns have increased about chinas modernizing strategic nuclear force and its first use policy including whether it is subject to debate in july 2005 pla major general zhu chenghu dean at the plas national defense university told western journalists in beijing that if the americans draw their missiles and positionguided ammunition into the target zone on chinas territory i think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons and he included the plas naval ships and fighters as chinas territory zhu added that if the united states is determined to intervene in taiwan scenario we will be determined to respond and we chinese will prepare ourselves for the destruction of all cities east of xian an ancient capital city in northcentral china of course the americans will have to be prepared that hundreds of or two hundreds of or even more cities will be destroyed by the chinese zhu also dismissed chinas first use policy saying that it applied only to nonnuclear states and could be changed60 chinas experts argued that zhus comments reflected chinas concerns about the challenges presented by us defense policy and nuclear strategy for chinas

relationship with china and the war on terrorism senator bob smith and representative dana rohrabacher wrote secretary of defense rumsfeld in late 2001 to express concerns about renewed military contacts with china in part they argued that china is not good prospect for counterterrorism cooperation because of concerns that china has practiced internal repression in the name of

the defense powmia office and other senior us military leaders to china and improved overall bilateral relations the united states was not able to announce progress in obtaining cooperation from the pla until 2008 in april 1992 military official in eastern europe supplied report to then secretary of defense dick cheney alleging that several dozen american military personnel captured in the korean war 19501953 were sent to camp in the northeastern city of harbin in china where they were used in psychological and medical experiments before being executed or dying in captivity72 in may 1992 the state department raised the issue of powmias with the prc saying it was matter of the highest national priority and in june 1992 the senate select committee on powmia affairs received information from the russian government indicating that over 100 american pows captured in the korean war were interrogated by the soviet union and possibly sent to china73 the united states also presented to the prc list of 125 american military personnel still unaccounted for since the korean war who were believed to have been interrogated in the soviet union and then sent to china china responded to the united states that it did not receive anyone on that list from the former soviet union74 but that response apparently did not address whether china received american military personnel from north korea or china itself transferred them upon returning from north korea and southeast asia in december 1992 senator robert smith vice chairman of the select committee on powmia affairs disclosed that officials in pyongyang admitted that hundreds of american pows captured in the korean war were sent to china and did not return to north korea according to smith north korean officials said that chinas pla operated pow camps in north korea during the korean war and the cold war and detained americans in chinas northeastern region moreover north korean officials told smith that some american pows could have been sent to the soviet union for further interrogations smith advocated that the us government press the prc government for information on pows rather than accept the prcs denials that it had pows or information about them saying this is where the answers lie75 the 71 department of defense news release china provides world war ii us aircraft crash sites february 8 2001 72 melissa healy

2004 that the government declassified the first batch of over 10000 files in its archives on the prcs foreign relations from 1949 to 1955 however this step apparently excluded wartime records and
