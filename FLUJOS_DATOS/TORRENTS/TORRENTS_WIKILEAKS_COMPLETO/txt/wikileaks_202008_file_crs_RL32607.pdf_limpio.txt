diplomacy background and the 911 commission recommendations summary while the 911 terrorist ttacks rallied unprecedented s upport abroad for the united states initially they also heightened the awareness among government officials and terrorism experts that significant number of people especially within muslim populations harbor enoug h hatred for america so as to become pool for terrorists over time it became clear that for the global war on terrorism to succeed sustained cooperation from around th world would be required in the years prior to september 11th both congress and the various administrations downplayed the importan ce of funding public diplomacy activities and in 1999 abolished the primary public di plomacy agency the us information agency usia public diplomacy often was viewed as less important than political and military functions and theref ore was seen by some legislators as pot of money that could be tapped for fundi ng other government activities even prior to the 2001 attacks number of decisions by the bush administration including refusing to sign onto the kyoto treaty the international criminal court the chemical weapons ban and the antiballistic missile treaty damaged foreign opinion of the united states after the decision to go to war with iraq foreign opinion of the united states fell sharply not only in the arab and muslim world but even among some of americas closest allies some foreign policy and public diplomacy ex perts believe that using public diplomacy to provide clear and honest explanations of why those decisions were made could have prevented some of the loss of support in the war on terrorism many us policymakers now recognize the importance of how america and its policies are perceived abroad former under secretary of state for public diplomacy and both chairmen of the 911 commission expressed the view that public diplomacy tools are at least as important in the war on terrorism as military tools and should be given equa l status and increased funding as result of the 911 commission recommendations congress passed the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 s 2845 pl 108458 which included provisions expanding public diplomacy activities in muslim populations at the same time some be lieve that there are limits to what public diplomacy can do when the problem is not forei gn misperception of america but rather disagreements with specific us foreign policies major expansion of us public diplomacy activities and funding cannot change that they say

1998us public diplomacy background and the 911 commission recommendations introduction public diplomacy is the promotion of am ericas interests culture and policies by informing and influencing foreign popula tions immediately after the september 11th terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon the bush administration found itself in not only military but also public diplomacy war on terrorism an early realization of the importance of words and cultural understanding surfaced when president bush soon after the attacks named the us response operation enduring crusade name that was quickly changed when experts pointed out that it could be interpreted by muslims as being inflammatory1 in 19992000 according to the 2003 pew survey more than 50 and as high as 83 of foreign populations around the wo rld held favorable views of the united states2 perhaps because of complacency with our position in the world and with the end of the cold war congress and past administrations downplayed the importance of funding public diplomacy activities3 public diplomacy was viewed as having lower priority than political and military functions and receive d less funding while more money went to other activities deem ed more important or more popular with constituents funding levels for public diplomacy dropped considerably during the late 1990s due in part to the conso lidation of broadcasting entities in fy19944 and the abolishment of the us information agency in october 19995 signs according to some that public diplomacy was not highly valued after the 2001 attacks people around th world expressed shock and support for the us government since then how ever negative attitudes about america have increased and become more intense not just within muslim populations buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32607crs2 6 see poll results gallupusa today february 27 2002 and the ten nations impressions of america poll zo gby international april 11 2002 7 pew study p 19 8 americas image slips but allies share us concerns over iran hamas by the pew global attitudes project june 13 2006 p 1worldwide6 the iraq war begun in march 2003 exacerbated negative opinions of america in virtually every country po lled both traditional allies and non allies7 since the beginning of the iraq war r ealization emerged that strong negative public opinion about the united states could affect how helpful countries will be in the iraq war and in the separate war on terrorism moreover negative sentiment might assist terrorist groups in recruiting new members therefore in recent years sense of urgency to utilize public diplom acy to the maximum extent possible has been expressed by top level official s think tanks and the 911 commission the 108th congress weighed in on the importance of public diplomacy by including public diplomacy measures in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 to pr omote free media in islamic countries scholarships for muslims to attend amer icansponsored schools public diplomacy training in the department of state and establish an international youth opportunity fund within an existing organization such as the united nations educational science and cultural organization unesco these initiatives will take some time to show any impact whether they can gene rate sufficient good will to effectively counter terrorism however remains to be seen the 109th congress has not passed any legisl ation authorizing any changes in public diplomacy but has increased public diplomacy funding see chart below meanwhile 2006 pew survey concluded that the war in iraq is continuing drag on opinions of the united states not only in predominately muslim countries but in europe and asia as well favorable opini ons of the united states have fallen in most of the 15 countries surveyed8 background on public diplomacy history the us government first officially acknowledged its use of public diplomacy activities in the early years of the 20th century when president woodrow wilson created the committee on public information to disseminate information overseas during world war i in 1941 when world war ii broke out president roosevelt established the foreign information service to conduct foreign intelligence and propaganda the next year president roosevelt created the office of war information owi which aired the first voice of america voa program on february 24 1942 in europehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32607crs3 9 named for the two primary sponsors of the legislation were representative karl mundt republican from south dakota and senato r alexander smith republican from new jersey 10 congressional record january 16 1948 p 243 11 congressional record january 16 1948 p 244 12 congressional record statement by senator alexander smith january 16 1948 p 246 13 the radios had been funded ostensibly th rough contributions from the american publicthese activities were carried out without any authority or recognition provided by congress popularly referred to as the smithmundt act9 the us information and educational exchange act of 1948 pl 80402 provided the first overarching legislation authorizing broadcasting and cu ltural activities althoug h they had already been going on throughout the 1940s according to senator smith this bill is an attempt to give legisla tive authority to certain activities that have been carried on by the state department si nce the close of the war it is really the consolidation of the activities of the state departments division of cultural relations the office of interamerican affairs and the socalled office of war information10 in asserting how inadequate the us government had been at being understood in europe and countering russias hostile information campaign against the united states after the war senator smith described his intentions for the legislation this does not mean boastful propaganda but simply means telling the truth11 there must be distinct setup of the socalled informational service on the one hand which may conceivably have ce rtain propaganda implications and may even become involved politically and on the other hand we must set apart by itself the socalled educational exchange service which if it is to be truly effective must be objective nonpolitical and above all have possible propaganda implications12 over the years several public diplom acy reorganizations and policy changes have occurred largely for two reasons to reduce cost or to increase effectiveness in 1953 president eisenhower created the us information agency usia in the reorganization plan 8 as authorized by the smithmundt act of 1948 at the time of its creation usias role was primarily to admin ister the broadcasting and information programs referred to by some at the time as the propaganda activities the educational exchange programs remained within the department of state to avoid any charges of propagandi stic intent as recommended by senator fulbright who had already sponsored legislation on establishing cultural exchanges at about the same time radio free eu roperadio liberty rferl began broadcasting in 1950 under the clandestine auspices of the central intelligence agency which had been created in 194713 the board for international broadcasting bib was created in 1973 to fund and oversee rferl operations rferl

activities according to the office of budget and mana gement omb funding increased over the following years and peaked in fy1994 to nearly 15 billion largely due to costs associated with the consolidation of th broadcasting entities the presidents fy2007 budget request of nearly 16 billion if enacted would set the record for us government public diplomacy expenditu res significant

costly perhaps than buildup of military strengthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32607crs6 activities public diplomacy primarily consists of three categories of activities 1 international information programs 2 educational and cultural exchange programs and 3 international nonmilitary broadcasting the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs administers the bureau for international information programs and the bureau for educational and cultural affairs while the broadcasting board of gove rnors manages and oversees international broadcasting the international information

ch develops professional cultural and youth programs with non profit american institutions including voluntary community organizations inte rnational exchange programs often are viewed as low cost low risk and effective ways of promoting the american culture abroad drawbacks include the length of time and high cost to change attitudes of significant portion of foreign populati on since the program touches only few people at time as opposed to broadcas ting where thousands of people can be reached instantaneously in past years some concerns that had surfaced regarding exchanges included the lack of tracking system to prevent exchange program participants from overstaying their visas in the united states changes in students study focus students who might enroll in aus exchange program to study

effectivene ss with the knowledge attained conclusion public diplomacy is one of numerous tool s that the united states has used since the early 20th century to promote us interests abroad over the decades since its formal authorization by the smithm undt act of 1948 views have fluctuated between vigorously supporting public diplomacy as highly valuable foreign policy tool and disparaging it as government program with constituency and uncertain longterm benefits after the end of the cold war many in congress questioned the expense and abolished the usia moving public diplomacy into the department of state where it could be more closely coor dinated with other foreign policy tools since the terrorist attacks in 2001 many in congress have advocated an increase in public diplomacy funding to win the hearts and minds of muslims and perhaps help prevent future attacks the 911 commission report agreed with significantly increasing the budget and status of public diplomacy as has been done with the military some foreign policy experts and mbers of congress have cautioned however that public diplomacy is only g ood if the message is credible recent worldwide polls show that the
