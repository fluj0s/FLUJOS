institutions funding us participation jonathan sanford specialist in international political economy foreign affairs defense and trade division summary since 1945 the united states has contri buted 98 b illion to the imf and the multilateral devel opment banks mdbs and it has subscribed an additional 966 billion in callable capital the procedures th united states uses to fund its financial support for these institutions varies from orga nization to organizati on and are described in this report the report will not be updated the united states is member of six international financial institutions ifis the international monetary fund imf wo rld bank asian development bank asdb african development bank afdb european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd and interamerican development bank idb1 all told since 1945 the united states has contributed the equivalent of 98 billion to the ifis and it has also agreed to provide another 966 billi on in callable capital2 the latter is legal obligation of the united states but as noted below only about 12 of the total s been appropriated this report discusses the ways the united states funds its participation in the imf and the multilateral development banks mdbs the ifis differ in the ways they financehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22134crs2 3 for information about replenishment agreements being considered by congress in 2005 see crs report rs22133 multilateral development banks current authorization requests and crs report rs22092 the world bank international development associations 14th replenishment 20062008 their operations consequently the procedures the united states uses to fund its financial support for each ifi also varies from organization to organization this report has two parts first it disc usses how us contri butions are negotiated and authorized second it explains the proce dures the united states uses to appropriate funds or otherwise approve us financial support for the ifis authorizing us contributions negotiating an ifi funding plan for the most part there is little difference in the way the administration negotiates or congress authorizes new us contributi ons to the ifis the treasury department manages us participation in these international agencies from time to time the major ifi member countries assess the adequacy of an ifis financial resources if they decide that it needs more money for its operations they will negotiate new funding plan in recent years recipient countries have also been included in some of these negotiations the agreed funding plan is laid before an ifis board of executive directors bed where its endorsement is more or less automatic the plan is then submitted to the ifis members for their approval in the unite d states and most other major countries legislative action is needed to authorize pa rticipation in new funding plan in some cases supermajority vote of the member c ountries 85 in the case of the imf is required to put the plan into effect since th us vote is generally larger than 15 the united states can block approval of funding plans it oppo ses us participation is not needed before funding agreements for i da and other concessional mdb programs can go into effect3 particular nomenclature is used in this process the individuals who represent their countries in the negotiations are called deputies an imf funding plan is called quota increase when countri make their contributions they are said to subscribe to the plan in the case of the world ba nks international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd and the other marketb ased loan windows of the regional mdbs new funding plan is called capital increase countries are also said to subscribe when they make their contributions to an mdb capital increase for the world banks international development ssociation ida and the cessionalrate loan windows of the other mdbs however new funding plan s are called replenishments countries make contributions to these plans authorization legislation only once since 1980 has an ifi authorization bill been enacted by congress through the regul ar order process as separate freestanding legislation that one exception was the 1989 interamerican development bank idb capital increase which effected longsought reforms in the way the idb conducted its operations notwithstanding congress has approved legisl ation since 1980 authorizinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22134crs3 4 the mdbs marketbased loan windows i brd and the ordinary capital windows of the regional mdbs borrow money in world capital markets at the prevailing market rates and relend it with small markup to their borrowers the mdbs usually borrow at interest rates only slightly higher than those their major mber countries pay when they borrow money or float bonds the mdbs pay their operating costs and build reserves using the net difference between the interest they pay to borrow in cap ital markets and the interest mdb borrowers pay when they borrow from them contributions fro m the united states and other member countries do not pay the salaries of mdb sta ff or other mdb operating costs 5 in order to help assure the mdbs advantag eous access to the commercial market their member countries subscribe most of their contributions in the form of callable capital kind of guarantee backing it can only be used to pay off mdb bondholders if an institution goes bankrupt the bank would have to liquidate all its reserves and other resources before asking its members to pay in portion of their callable capital sufficient to retire the remaining claims of its bondholders calls would be on pro rata basis with each country being expected to pay in its proportion based on its ownership share in the institution to cover the remaining sum owed to bondholders 6 the mdbs must exhaust their existing resources before they may call upon their member continuedus participation in eight replenishments of the world banks ida two capital increases of the ibrd five quota increases for the imf and numerous capital increases or replenishments of the other ifis in each case the authorization legislation was included in another measure the annual foreign ope rations appropriations act larger omnibus appropriations act or budget reconciliation bill which needed to be passed in several cases special rules or parliamentary devices were used to shield the authorization language from floor amendment when th larger bill was under house or senate consideration the senate foreign relations committee has exercised jurisdiction in the senate for mdb authorization bills for imf legisla tion it shares jurisdiction with the senate banking committee in the house the committee on financial services has exercised jurisdiction for all ifis appropriations for us contributions marketbased loan programs before 1981 congre ss regularly appropriated money to cover paidin and th callable portions of us capital subscriptions to the mdbs some 12 billion was appropriated roughly 8 b illion for the world banks ibrd and 4 billion for the idb and asdb4 similar appropriations were made for the ebrd or afdb before 1981 as the united states was not then member of those banks the asian development bank asdb the 12 billion is year money available for disbursement on th order of the secretary of the treasury if the ibrd idb or asdb were to issue call for payment of callable capital5 since the fiscal 1982 foreign operations appropriations bill wa s adopted in 1981 money has been appropriated to pay for callable capital instead the appropriations committees include language in the foreig n operations appropriations bill each year authorizing the secretary of the treasury to subscribe to specified number of callable shares worth specified amount of money for each ifi the new arrangement was adopted in part because most analysts belie ve call on callable capital is very unlikely6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22134crs4 6 continued countries for the callable capital needed to pay their outstanding bondholders the outstanding debt of each mdb is sizable however the bt is payable over many years and the amount due each year to bondholders is relatively modest unless an mdb misses an interest payment the repayment of its debt is not accelerated regardle ss of the institutions financial condition as of 2003 for example the world banks ibrd had borrowed 108 billion to fund its loan program of this amount about 146 billion was scheduled to mature during the next fiscal year and it was scheduled to pay about 35 billion in interest to its bondholders in 2003 the bank had equity reserves and paidin capital worth about 38 billion in addition to the net fair market value 118 billion of its outstanding loans the bank could go almost two years on the basis of its equity before it needed to solicit payments of callable capital the us ownership share in the ibrd is about 17 assuming that loans were sold to raise money to repay creditors and borrowers paid the bank anything for outstanding loans the ibrd would have to sustain some 85 billion in losses exhausting its equity and depleting the 8 billion already appropriated to cover the us share in 47 billion call on callable capital before any new us money would need to be appropriated to fund additional calls on callable capital in other words the bank could continue servicing its debt for four and onehalf years before any of the callable capital subscribed since 1980 would be needed experience shows that developing countries usually default on their debt payments to bilate ral official creditors nd to commercial creditors before they cease making payments on their mdb debt consequently the international financial crisis that would accompany any call on callable capital not to mention one requiring new us appropriations would be very large more concern would likely be paid in that context to issues affecting the worlds majo r banks and credit markets than to the mdb portion of the crisis 7 the budget deficit is determined by the net relationship between the governments outlays and its income though budget authority was appropr iated in the old system money for outlays was budgeted for callable capital because outlays were anticipated 8 the mdbs members subscribe portion of thei r capital contributions as paidin capital in fixed ratio different for each bank with the ca llable share the banks now generally put this money in their reserves as additional protection against prospective call on callable capital 9 the mdbs fund their concessional loan progra ms with direct contributions from their member country governments the international deve lopment association ida and the comparable programs in the regional mdbs lend to the worlds poorest countries at little or interest charge and with very long repayment periods conseque ntly it is impractical for them to fund their continuedthere were also functional reasons for th change before the present arrangement was adopted the members of congress would occasionally advocate that major cuts should be made in the budget authority inte nded for callable capital claiming erroneously that these cuts would reduce the budget deficit7 because of these cuts the amount appropriated for callable cap ital were sometimes insuffi cient to match the amount appropriated for paidin capital leading to s ituations where money appropriated for paid in subscriptions could not be used fo r want of the matching callable capital8 the present arrangement avoids these difficulties without lessening the effective control which congress exercises over us pa rticipation in these programs if there were call on the callable capital the us has subscribed without appropriati ons since 1981 the administration would need to ask c ongress to appropria the funds concessional loans and grants for the ida and other similar mdb programs congress is asked annually to appr opriate funds to pay for the us share of their current replenishment plan9 the united states does not actually transfer the fullhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22134crs5 9 continued operations through commercial borrowing it woul d cost the donor countries more to subsidize the interest charges for such bo rrowing than it does for them to make their payments directly to ida and the other programs 10 the method the imf uses to fund its lending operations is hybrid involving both borrowing and direct payments by member country govern ments on few occasions notably the oil facility in 19745 the supplemental financing f acility in 197981 and the strategic reserve facility in the late 1980s and 1990s the imf has borrowed money on marketrelated terms from governments or central banks and relent t hose funds with an appropriate markup however the imf funds the bulk of its loan operations with money borrowed through the quota process from the treasuries of its major member countries 11 countries subscribe small portion of their quot as in usable world currencies and the rest in their own national currency the imf deems that only portion currently about 46 of the money subscribed as quotas is usable the imf cannot readily use the national currencies subscribed by most developing countries to fund its loan programs these currencies are not readily acceptable in world markets and their use would likely cause major shifts in their exchange values hurting the economies of the countri that issued them consequently the imf borrows most of the money it uses to fund its an operations from the countries such as the united states japan britain or th countries of the euro zone whose currencies are most readily acceptable in world markets sum of its annual contribution to an mdb rather the secretary of the treasury pledges that the united states will contribute sp ecified amount the money being payable on particular schedule arrang ed beforehand by the donor countries and the mdb notionally the contributions from donors ar supposed to match roughly the pattern of disbursements for mdb loans the banks rarely disburse the full amount at the time their loans are approved rather disburse ments occur as work goes forward on the project or program funded by the loan the mdbs draw down their donors pledged contributions at roughly comparable pace consequently in the us congressional budget process only portion of the budget au thority ba appropria ted each year for the ida and other similar programs is scored as requiring outlays during that fiscal year the remaining outlays are laid to future years as the mdbs draw upon their donors contribution pledges international monetary fund before 1980 the united states generally treated any increase in its imf quota as an exchangeofassets that is to say the us treasury department considered that once an increas in the us quota had been authorized it could swap assets with the imf draw on the us quota in exchange for new us credit in the fund without dditional action by congress countrys quota in the imf is basically line of credit that it extends to the imf10 the fund may borrow against that line of cr edit whenever it needs money to finance its own loan programs11 countries receive new cred it on the imfs books when their currencies are used in this ma nner so net transaction is deemed to have occurred from an accounting perspective as practical matter though the lende r country provides the imf with usable cash while the imf provides th country with an interest paying credit imf loans called purchases carry interest rates called the rate of charge which are slightly higher than the averag its major member countries pay when theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22134crs6 12 the borrowers must buy useable currencies from the imf because foreigners will not accept their currency to fund purchases and settle debt furthermore by the time countries come to the imf for help their currency is falling in value compared to the dollar euro pound sterling yen or other usable currencies often even their own citizens do not wish to hold their currency even if the borrowers currency loses value during the period after it receives its imf loan it must repay the imf the same value in interna tional currency when it repurchases its currency from the imf borrow money commercially technically the imfs borrowers purchase internationally acceptable currencies with an equal value of their own currency12 as the imf receives repayments repurchases from its borrowe rs it pays back the countries whose quota resources were used to fund the loan the imf pays interest called rate of remuneration to the countries whose quota resources are us ed in its operations the imf pays for its operating costs and builds retained earnings with the net difference between the interest it pays to borrow quota resources and the interest that borrower countries pay when they borrow from it quota payments from the united states and other member countries are not used to pa the salaries of imf staff or other imf operating costs the appropriations committees were not sa tisfied in the late 1970s with the exchangeofasset method for funding us par ticipation in the imf they maintained that appropriations were necessary to meet the requirement in the us constitution that money shall be drawn from the treasu ry but in consequence of appropriations made by law article i section 9 the tr easury department argue d by contrast that it had the authority to make quota transfer s to the imf under existing law that any arrangement would be unworkable if an appropriation were needed every time the imf sought to draw against the us quota nd that some members of congress might seek to use the money intended for an imf quota subscription for other purposes if it were included in the annua l appropriations bill compromise was agreed to in 1980 which sought to satisfy these concerns under the current arrangement congress must pass an appropriation as well as an authorization before the united states may subscribe to an new quota resources in the imf however the appropriation consists solely of budget authority outlay authority is provided consequently the appropriation committees have control comparable to that exercised by the authorizing committees over the size of the contingent liabilities the united states assumes through additional quota subscripti ons outlays are available in the appropriation to attract interest in their possi ble alternative use money can be readily paid to the imf when it needs to draw against the us quota on the basis of the exchangeofassets perspective on these tran sactions payments back to the united states as the imf restores funds previously drawn against the us quota are available for reuse by the imf on future occasion ra ther than being treated as miscellaneous receipt of the us treasury as are repayments for foreign aid which would require new appropriations before the im f could draw them again
