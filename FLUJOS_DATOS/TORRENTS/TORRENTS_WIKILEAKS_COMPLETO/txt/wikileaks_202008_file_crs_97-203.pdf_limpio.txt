obligations7 and to mak payments out of the treasury for specified purposes appropriation s represent the amount s that agencies may obligate during the period of time specified in the law annual appropriations are provided in appropriations acts mos t permanent appropriations are provided in substantive law major types f appropriations are regular supplemental and continuing budget authority is legal authority to incur financial obligations that normally will result in the outlay of federal govern ment funds major types of budget authority are appropriations borrowing authority and contract authority budget authority also includes the subsidy cost of direct and guaranteed loans but excludes the portion of loans that is not subsidized budget resolution is concurrent resolution passed by b oth houses of congress but not requiring the signature of the president setting forth the congressional budget for each of five fisca l years it includes various budget totals and functional allocations discretionary spending is budget authority provided in annual appropriation acts other than appropriated entitlements entitlement authority is legal authority to make payments to any person or unit of government that meets the eligibility criteria established by law as such i t represents legally binding obligation on the part of the federal government entitlement authority can be the result of either annual or permanent appropriatio n acts federa l funds are all monies collected and spent by the federal government othe r than trust funds federal funds include general special public enterprise an d intragovernmental funds mandatory direct spending includes budget authority provided in laws other than appropriations b entitlement authority and c the food stamp program rescission is the cancellation of budget authority previously enacted supplement appropriation is budget authority provided in an appropriations act in addition to regular appropriations already provided trus t funds are funds collected and used for carrying out specific purposes an d programs according to the terms of trust agreement or statute such funds are not available for general purposeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97203crs30 the annual congressional budget resolution sets aggregate spending targets for budget8 functions house and s enate committees must initiate and report legislation that will achieve these targets typically appropriation committees develop proposals to meet discretionary spending levels through appropriation bills likewise authorizing committees develo p proposals to mee t mandatory spending levels these proposals are often reported by separate authorizing committees and combined into single omnibus reconciliation billappendix b scope of the

dhhs and established9 as an independen t federal agency on march 31 1995 within the lhhsed bill however the ssa merely was transferred from dhhs to the status of related agency the operation of the social security trust funds is considered offbudget of the 8179 billion total fo r lhhsed departments and agencies in fy1997 the ssa accounted for 3956 billion or 484 of the total the ssa amount represents 363 billion for designated onbudge t activities and 3593 billion for offbudget activitiesfirst some dol dhhs and ed programs receive automa tic funding without congressional intervention in the annual appropriations process these program s receive funds from permanent appropriations and trust funds instead this process accounts for the difference between the lhhsed b ill total of 2872 billion and the agency total of 8179 billion in fy1997 social security benefits unemploymen t compen sation medicare railroad retirement and student loans are the majo r programs in this group9 second mandatory programs account for the difference between the lhhs ed total of 28 72 billion and the subtotal of 747 billion for discretionary funds in fy1997 although annual appr opriations are made for these programs the amounts provided must be sufficient to cover program obligations and entitlements t beneficiaries for these programs as well as the prog rams funded through trust funds and permanent authorities most changes in funding levels are made throug h amendments to authorizing legislation rather than through ppropriation bills federal administrative costs for these programs typically are subject to annual discretionary appropriations however these programs include temporary assistance for needy families tanf the new welfare reform program supplemental security income black lung payments and social services block grants as well as general non earmarked fund support for medicare and medicaid finally small number of dhhs programs are funded in other appropriations
