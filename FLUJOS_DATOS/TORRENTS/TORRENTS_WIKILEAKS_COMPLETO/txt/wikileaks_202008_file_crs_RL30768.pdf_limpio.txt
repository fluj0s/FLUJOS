involving china and organized groups with interests outside the parameters of that consensus remained at the margins of the policy process with the breakdown of this consensus in 19891990 organized interests began to voice their opinions more vigorously especially in areas of policy differences initially these policy differences were played out through the vehicle of legislation to oppose renewal of chinas mostfavorednation mfn trade status later as mfn legislation appeared less viable legislative alternatives and interest group activity on china proliferated since 1992 congress has considered and in many cases has passed legislation targeting china in other areas including abortion human rights prison labor chinese students nuclear and missile nonproliferation international broadcasting tibet taiwan hong kong espionage religious freedom and military relations each of these issues was accompanied by an assortment of interest groups arguing for or against in addition the explosive growth of the internet in recent years has expanded the reach and potential influence of even the smallest of groups organized interests with skeletal staff and website can now command greater attention than before chinese student organizations and dissident groups highly influent ial in the months following the tiananmen square crackdown of 1989 seem to have lost this visibility and influence and groups focusing on religious or moral values such as the christian coalition and the family research council after having increased their influence through the 1990s have taken noticeably lower profile after their peak activity in 199798 many other interest groups appear to have become increasingly influential in the us decision making processes on china tibetan activist groups human rights organizations democracy advocacy groups the taiwan lobby non proliferatio n groups the american business community and public policy research groups have all remained active and influential in policy decisions on china absent demonstrable changes in chinas policies in the character of uschina relations or in the curren t nature of political discourse in the united states organized interest groups can be expected to continue to exploit policy differences in ways likely to further affect us policy decisions on china httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30768contents overview of

uschina policy interest groups and their influence 19892000 introduction in recent years successive us republican and democrat administrations have had great difficulty in fielding comprehensive and coordinated policy toward china that not only clearly defines and promotes us national interest s but also attracts widespre ad domestic support to great extent the stage for current us policy difficulties was set by the 1989 tiananmen square crackdown from which china has never recovered in the eyes of most americans several factors and policy trends in the past decade have opened the way for nongovernmental organizations ngos and other organized interest groups to play more active role in the us china policymaking process first it is hard to overstate the significance of the tiananmen square crackdown of june 4 1989 as the defining moment for the decade that came after it in us policy toward china the collapse of the soviet union and with it chinas strategic importance as counterweight to soviet power may well have resulted in an eventual reassessment of us china policy in any case during the 1990s but it is tiananme n that ultimately ruptured the american policy consensus on china and suggested that the political liberalization accompanying chinas program of economic reform had abrupt ly ended the demise of the consensus in effect ended congressional support for administration initiatives on china that had characterized the us policy process through much of the 1980s since tiananmen congress and the executive branch have clashe d repeatedly over us policy toward china both the bush and clinton administrations generally stressed policies of engagement toward china while their congressional critics have tended to push for firmer more sanctionoriented approach beginning in 1990 congress brought this pressure to bear largely through the vehicle of annual renewal of chinas mostfavorednation mfn treatment now known as normal trade relations or ntr either by voting to withdraw chinas mfn trade status or by placing further conditions on it this issue came to head in debate leading to the 106th congress passing legislation hr 4444 to give permanent normal trade relations pntr to china president clinton signed the bill into law on october 10 2000 pl 106286 meanwhile during the 1990s congress has placed increasing emphasis on diverse and separate initiatives that have had implications for uschina relations including measures on human rights nonpr oliferation trade taiwan religious freedom national security and other issues at each stage of the process ngos and organized interest groups have promoted their own points of view among growing policy differences attempting to maximize their influence over decisions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30768crs2 this fluid and uncertain atmosphere in the american political scene has proven fertile ground for range of interest groups and individuals competing for influence over us policy decisions involving china in reviewing some of the key issues on which these groups have had the most effect it is difficult to tell whether the groups themselves have contributed to the policy divergences over china in the past decade or whether they merely exploited differences that have occurred for other reasons the apparent individual effectiveness these groups have had in influencing policy decisions has waxed and waned depending on the issues involved the strength of the group or individual and the overall atmosphere in uschina relations at the time their collective effectiveness however appears to have grown in the past decade in general the most successful have either spent significant time developing relationships with members of congress or have been able to mobi lize broad spectrum of american public opinion in support of their interests this paper makes generalized observations about the role of nongovernmental organizations ngos and other organize d interest groups in us policy toward china over the last decade and provides information about selected ngos in order to set the context for this discussion the paper first presents broad overview of issue trends in us china policy during the bush and clinton administrations and discusses the role of interest groups generally on major issues and policies relating to china during this period drawing overall conclusions based on these observat ions finally the paper provides pertinent information about selected groups overview of trends in uschina policy after the rocky road to uschina normalization of relations ended with the signing of the communique on arms sales to taiwan in 1982 consensus prevailed in us policymaking on china until 1989 during which congress generally supported white house initiatives potentially troublesome issues arose during this brief period tibet human rights the spiritual pollution campaign and other chinese government crackdowns but overall china was seen to be proceeding inexorably in the right direction with its implementation of dramatic economic reforms and incremental political change the united states for its part was preoccupied with domestic economic issues and much time in us government debate was given over to battles over the federal budget this situation had changed dramatically by the end of the first year of the bush administration in 1989 and us policy consensus on china has been illusiv in the decade since then interest groups and ngos have been able to work well within and in some cases have contributed to this dynamic in addition to the significant changes in american policy factors the recalculation of chinas potential role as us strategic asset and the reassessment that china was moving in the right reform direction other trends in the past decade have facilitated the growth of organized interest groups in the us policy process one trend has been simply the growing number of issues on the uschina agenda in 1990 early in the breakdown of the us policy consensus on china us china policy differences were aired throug h the vehicle of the annual debate over chinas mostfav orednation mfn status while essentially an irrelevant issue in the 1980s the question of chinas mfn status took on increasing importancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30768crs3 1 the week prior to house floor debate on june 20 1997 representat ive david dreier included in the congressional record the text of letter he had received from the rev billy graham in support of mfn for china congressional record june 20 1997 p h 4123 2 text is from june 3 1998 letter to president clinton by speaker of the house newt gingrich and representatives bill archer and phil crane 3 senator tim hutchinson quoted in the congressional quarterly june 6 1998 p 1519beginning in 1990 and peaked in 1992 when congress came closest to revoking or placing further conditions on chinas mfn status after this highwater mark the annual mfn debate faded markedly in importance although it still served as focal point for interest group activity on other issues until 2000 when congress passed legislation to give china this trade status permanently president clintons 1993 decision to link chinas mfn status to human rights progress appears to have been pivotal catalyst in mfns declining importance confronted with the real possibility that the president in 1994 might sign bill withdrawing chinas mfn status congress appeared less vigorous in pushing to revoke or condition china s mfn status instead beginning in 1994 members broadened their search for more specific more targeted legislative alternatives each year the possible alternatives grew and the search for appropriate policy approaches opened the door for ngos and other interest groups to become more influential in advancing ideas and alternatives along with the increasing complexity of the legislative agenda on china second trend since 1989 has been the blurring of traditional party line alliances within the congress the 1990s saw the shifting and regrouping of unusual congressional coalitions on the specific question of chinas mfn status and on the broader issues surrounding us china policy to cite but one example in the 105th congress in addition to conservative republicans and religious organizations from the right of the political spectrum opponents of extending mfn trade status to china included liberal democrats labor interests and human rights organizations more often associated with the left of the political spectrum mfn proponents included party centrists pro business conservatives liberal free traders and others in the religious community1 the issue of free trade versus the desire to penalize china for various human rights infractions and contain its military power proved pivotal differences were particularly sharp between socalled social and economic conservatives in the republican party some senior republicans for instance stated that americas best strategy for promoting lasting democratic change in this repressive society china is through the free exchange of goods and services in the context of an open mfn trade relationship2 others concluded however that multinational corporations have too much influence in the china debate there has been an unholy alliance between big business the clinton administration and certain republicans who have adopted the tradeatanyprice approach3 in related trend china has increasingly come to be viewed as potential security threat to various us interes ts by some in the pentagon and us intelligencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30768crs4 4 ornstein norman and elder shirley interest groups lobbying and policymaking congressional quarterly washington dc 1978 p 224 cited in oleszek walter and davidson roger congress and its members congressional quarterly washington dc 2000 p 337 communities and by growing group in congress but some who share this view such as the heritage foundation also championed pntr for china further complication to the legislative agenda has involved the attitude of key congressional committ ees those that are important in consideration of punitive measures such as the house banking committee the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee have traditionally had majorities who favor insulating us trade and economic policy decisions from other us policy goals these committees are subject to their own constituencies including business economic and agricultural interests and they can act as potent obstacle in blocking proposed enforcement mechanisms that other organized interests seek to put in place these committees have often blocked more punitive measures or moderated them arguably third factor leading to the rise of organized interest group activity on china in the past decade has been the notable animosity and partisanship that developed between the republican more conservative congresses elected since 1994 and the clinton white house in an environment that included presidential impeachment proceedings policy accord even on relatively benign issues has been difficult in addition in the early clinton years many in the foreign policy community considered the new administration to be so focused on domestic economic issues that it lacked an international leadership strategy or agenda on questions involving china with which us relations have been tense and troublesome throughout the decade and with which the united states appears to have growing substantive differences this perceived leadership deficit may have contributed to policy differences ngos and us policy toward china groups need congress and congress needs groups4 before examining the role of ngos and other organized interest groups in the past decade of us policymaking on china it would be useful to consider some general principles that may govern these groups and their interaction with us policy processes some general observations throughout american history organized interest groups have been feature of the political landscape from the very birth of the republic groups were formed to oppose taxation abolish slavery advocate rebellion advance ideas elect candidates and affect policy by their very nature groups form in response to perceived need this perceived need may be overarching to educate the uninformed to respond tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30768crs5 5 oleszek p 349 6 in 1991 and 1992 both houses passed legislation to place further conditions on chinas eligibility for mfn status in both cases hr 2212 1991 and hr 5318 1992 were vetoed by president bush in both cases the house overrode the veto but the senate did nota physical or moral crisis or to remedy serious national leadership weakness often the perceived need is more parochial to get better tax break to build support for certain view or in some other way to further the groups vested interests regardless the perceived need is there also group can form not only to further its own interests but to prevent some other group from furthering its interests at the first groups expense thus groups tend to breed other groups or as one specialist puts it each move to protect groups interests is likely to prompt countermove5 nor are groups static things groups with seemingly divergent interests and opposing ideologies can still form an alliance in pursuit of shared goal once these coalitions have achieved the objective the marriage quickly can be dissolved the last decade of american decision making on china appears to be an encapsulation of this group dynamic through much of the 1980s there was us policy consensus on china and groups that had interests outside the parameters of that consensus remained at the margins of the policy process with the breakdown of consensus in 19891990 organized interests were able to begin to exploit areas of policy differences throughout his presidency from 19891992 president bushs defense of executive prerogative over legislative action created an atmosphere that effectively empowered more organized groups groups that were able to combine forces and work through an increasingly receptive congress to pursue alternate objectives to those set by the president initially these policy differences were played out through the vehicle of legislation to oppose renewal of chinas mfn trade status later as legislation to restrict chinas mfn status appeared less viable legislative alternatives and interest group activity on china proliferated into other areas since 1992 when chinas trade status was most in jeopardy6 cong ress has considered and in many cases passed legislation targeting china in such areas as abortion human rights prison labor chinese students nuclear and missi nonproliferation international broadcasting tibet taiwan hong kong espionage religious freedom and military relations each of these issues was accompanied by an assortment of ngo interests arguing for or against with the election of republican congress in 1994 the first republican house in 40 years ideological and in some cases partisan differences fueled the china debate further added to this the explosive growth of the internet and with it the possibilities for electronic outreach and lobbying has expanded the reach and potential influence of even the smallest groups few groups matter how tiny are now without their own electronic home pages organized interests with skeletal staff and website can now appear muscular commanding dramatically greater attention than would have been the case just few years ago groups new to the china business such as the family research council or with minimal staff such as the us china policy

become increasingly involved in decisions on china the discussion below provides information about how some of the key groups active at one time or another over the past decade have affected us policy decisions chinese dissident and student groups in the united states although organizations represent ing students and scholars from china had existed in the united states since the early 1980s the number of these organizations increased dramatically in the year following the tiananmen square demonstrations and crackdown of 17 chinese student and scholar organizations surveyed in october 1990 13 of them had been formed since march 19897 in the immediate aftermath of the tiananmen square crackdown members of the chinese dissident community became visible and articulate advocates in the american policy process arguing persuasively for initiatives in support of human rights and political freedoms in china they were particularly influential in and involved with efforts to protect chinese students studying in the united states at the time of the tiananmen crackdown as one of his actions in response to the crackdown president bush in june 1989 directed that sympathetic review be given to any chinese student studying in the united states who requested visa extension initially congress gave broad support to the presidents actions8 but sentiments to take further steps were encouraged by the continuing harsh actions of chinese leaders on june 9 1989 for instance deng xiaoping and much of the rest of chinas top leader ship appeared in public to congratulate troops involved in the crackdown the chinese government also began issuing arrest warrants for student leaders and chinese dissidents involved in the demonstrations in the ensuing weeks the american press gave widespread attention to these actions and to the plight of chinese in the united states who would have to return to china when their visas ran out international human rights organizations and groups of chinese students streamed to capitol hill to testify on the newly repressive atmosphere in china making their case directly to american legislators and government officials in the ensuing months many members of congress came to believe that the presidents actions on behalf of chinese students were not sufficient and that students may be jeopardized by having to request visa extension thus implying to beijing that they feared to return consequently several legislative measures were considered to expand upon the presidents action and offer greater protection to the studentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30768crs7 9 the amendment passed by vote of 970 10 the house adopted the conference report unanimously on november 19 4030 the senate adopted it by voice vote on

received strong bipartisan supp ort on july 11 1989 the senate majority and minority leaders senators george mitchell and robert dole jointly sponsored an amendment to pending immigration bill s 358

both houses10 chinese activist groups mounted an effective and wellorganized lobbying effort to gain congressional support for this legislation when representative pelosi first introduced the bill in the house members of chinese activist groups met with congressional staff and deployed to help seek cosponsors for the bill as the legislative process unfolded these groups provided relevant

highly active during this time were the independent federation of chinese students and scholars ifcss and human rights in china hric both formed in 1989 ifcss was founded in july 1989 as direct

naturalization service and us state department officials to discuss implementation of policies to benefit chinese students in the united states throughout this period tensions on china policy between the president and the congress were growing administration officials opposed any congressional effort going beyond president bushs stated sanctions saying that such efforts would interfere with the presidents flexibility on foreign policy in the face of growing reports of abuses in china presidential rhetoric on china remained mild and administration officials were seen by their critics as increasingly tempering their negative comments about beijings actions with positive references about chinas continuing importance to us interests rupture november 21 1989 january 4 1990 on november 21 1989 the consensus on uschina policy quickly began to unravel when after congress adjourned for the year preside nt bush vetoed several key pieces of legislation concerning china13 among those bills was hr 2712 the emergency chinese adjustment of status facilitation act the most broadly supported and benign bill on china that had passed during the year which president bush pocketvetoed on november 30 1989 in his veto message concerning the measure the president announced that he thought the bill was wholly unnecessary since he already had sufficient authority as presid ent to provide the protections called for in the legislation moreover the preside nt stated that even as he was vetoing the bill he was directing the attorney general to act administratively to implement the bills provisions in later statement about the veto the president was quoted as saying i want to keep control of managing the foreign policy of this country as much as i can and i didnt think that legislation was necessary14 in addition to the two vetoed bills throughout december 1989 in congress absence the president continued to waive or elected not to impose sanctions and other measures that

legislation in one sense the veto was gratuitous in another sense the override effort is equally gratuitous15 chinese activist groups lobbied congress heavily on this issue on behalf of the viewpoint

past decade and in this effort he has had strong supporters in the us congress19 his and his exiled communitys initiative to gain international support for tibets cause appeared to begin in 19861987 when series of meetings between tibetan and western supporters in new york washington and london launched what has become known as tibets international campaign20 the goal of this campaign was to garner western and principally us support for tibets situation and ultimately to bring this international pressure to bear on beijing to make satisfactory political concessions as result of this new strategy congress in 1987 began to put pressure on the white house to protect tibetan culture and accord tibet greater status in us law despite beijings strong objections two events of particular importance occurred in 1987 first on september 21 the dalai lama made his first political speech in the united states at the invitation of the congressional human rights caucus in that speech the dalai lama made fivepoint proposal for resolving the tibet question that was wellreceived in the united states and had significant consequences on congressional attitudes toward tibet second nonbinding measures were put into place that year declaring that the united states should make tibets situation higher policy priority and should urge china to establish constructive dialogue with the dalai lama21 this language not the first that congress had passed regarding tibet22 nevertheless marked the beginning of significant increase in congressional activity on tibets status23 from this

tibetan activists also can be seen in the debate during recent years over establishing the position of us special envoy for tibet with ambassadorial rank congress began considering measures to establish this position early in the clinton administration in introducing such measure in 1994 senator claiborne pell stated he believed it was necessary to further focus administration attention on

special envoy to have ambassad orial rank and to actively promote negotiations between the dalai lama and the chinese government us administration officials opposed these provisions primarily because of concerns about the creation of an ambassadorial rank position for an entity tibet that the united states recognizes as part of china rather than as an independent country in its own right on october 31 1997 in move seen as compromise to appeal to proponents of the special envoy position secretary of state madeleine albright designated special coordinator for tibetan issues within the state department and named gregory craig to serve in the position concurrently with his job as director of policy planning although the new special coordinator position did not come with ambassadorial rank its creation nevertheless suggested there would be higher level of official attention on issues involving tibet consequently the 105th congress dropped the special envoy provision from subsequent legislation on january 20 1999 the position of special coordinator for tibet was assumed by julia taft us assistant secretary of state for population refugees and migration assistant secretary taft

funding which listed tibet as separate country president reagan signed the legislation into law28 in his remarks however the president said i note that tibet is listed as country in section 8 the united states recognizes tibet as part of the peoples republic of china i interpret tibets inclusion as separate country to be technical oversight29 in other respects however the consistent pressure of interest groups often working through legislative vehicles has contributed to us administrations being forced to acknowledge however subtly the tibetan activist position thus president george bush in 1991 became the first us president to meet with the dalai lama while president bill clinton met with the dalai lama several times although these meetings were deliberately kept lowkey and informal

involving tibet its primary goals concern tibets politi cal and international status specifically to help tibet regain independence from china which the itc regards as an illegal occupying power through its work the itc hopes to create sufficient international support for tibet to force china to begin serious talks with the dalai lama about tibets future status the itc has offices in washington and amsterdam although it occasionally receives small grants for instance from the national endowment for democracy the itc is largely dependent on donations from private individuals the committee of 100 for tibet in similar vein the committee of 100 for tibet formed in 1992 seeks to put tibet on the international agenda and to encourage international support for free independent

government needed to improve its record on human rights for example or needed to release political prisoners arrested during the tiananmen demonstrations but throughout the bush and clinton administrations the american concept of human rights in china acquired more complex character partly through the efforts of relevant interest groups in the last decade issues considered under the

organizations often share common goals with other groups mentioned elsewhere in this paper that represent issues that arose later in the policy debate religious groups the tibet lobby and democracy

demise of the soviet union left us policymakers searching for new framework for pursuing foreign policy objectives by the early 1980s officials in the reagan administration members of congress from both parties and others had come to believe that the united states needed to make more concerted effort to promote democratic ideals abroad35 consequently in 1983 the national endowment for democracy

for moderation and engagement in us china policy religious groups throughout the bush and clinton administrations political activism by conservative christian groups has been continuing feature of the american political scene such groups appear to have become more outspok in recent years on matters where moral values are seen to be at stake us china policy is one of these areas two key influential groups in this movement have been the christian coalition and the family research council the christian coalition the christian coalition founded in 1989 by pat roberts on was still relatively unknown as political actor early in the bush administration by 199394 however under the executive directorship of ralph reed the christian coalition had become visible and controversial presence on the american political scene putting particular emphasis on grassroots activism voters guides and candidate questionnai res the coalition specialized in helping to elect candidates who were sympathetic to the groups values and ideology the family research council frc the family research council frc was part of the group focus on the family from 19881992 until the two parted company in october 1992 under president gary bauer who served in the reagan administration for eight years the family research council after 1992 became more formidable presence on the political scene while emphasizing similar values issues as the christian coalition the frc also seems to have had more involvement in foreign policy matters including those involving china throughout much of the 1990s the primary china focus of the conservative christians appeared involved in working to keep restrictions in place on us funding for international family planning programs china had been particular target of these efforts since 1984 when the reagan administration at the 2nd international conference on population in mexico city established the requirement that the population fund unfpa provide concrete assurances that it is not engaged in or does not provide funding for abortion or coercive family planning programs concern at the time was highest over china because of allegations that had recently surfaced about its coercive family planning practices41 during the bush administration slight majority in congress tried to resume funding for unfpahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30768crs18 42 at press conference in august of 1997 the christian coaliti ons new president don hodel announced that combating international religious persecution would be the coalitions top legislative priority and he

s 1164 the china policy act of 1997 introduced on sept 11 1997 44 among the groups opposing or working to moderate pending legislation on religious persecution were the united church of christ the national council of churches the world alliance of reformed churches and the billy graham evangelistic associationthrough foreign aid authorization and appropriations bills in 1989 congress specified that population assistance funds should go to unfpa in the fy90 foreign operations appropriations bill president bush vetoed the measure in part because of this inclusion and the provision was removed in 1997 during the 105th congress the frc christian coaliti on and other conservative christian groups became significantly more involved in the american china debate than during the previous decade keeping to tradition they remained active on antiabortion issues as these related to legislation involving china in addition these groups became particularly active on two other issues religious persecution and chinas mfn status42 partially as result of this involvement by conservative christian groups the congressional debate on china beginning in 1997 drew on attitudes involving morality and values and these attitudes have persisted to an extent into 2000 the clinton administration was singled out for particular criticism for its policies in tandem with the more direct involvement of conservative christian elements in the policy process beginning in 1997 congressional efforts expanded upon measures targeting china for its coercive family planning practices representative tillie fowler introduced hr 2570 bill that would have required the united states to deny visas to any chinese national or chinese government official who credibly could be determined to have been involved in either establishing or enforcing population policies resulting in forced sterilization or forced abortion similar measure was introduced in the senate by senator abraham43 ultimately neither measure was enacted although both bodies held hearings and the house passed an amended version of hr 2570 the debate on international religious persecution highlighted important differences in the american religious community between many mainstream religious groups on the one hand and the frc christian coalition and other conservative religious organizations on the other many members of religiousaffiliated groups such as the national council of churches and the national association of evangelicals were supportive of concerns about religious persecution but worked to moderate pending legislation and in some cases actively opposed pending bills44 these moderating sentiments were not shared by the coalition the frc or other similarly inclined conservative christian groups partly as

would have imposed sanctions against countries engaged in religious persecution but the bill faced key objections from some members because of its traderelated sanctions notably from members of the house ways and means committee which has jurisdiction over trade issues as result the bills proponents elected to compromise and the bill was reintroduced on september 8 1997 with minor changes including the deletion of provision linking countrys religious tolerance with us support for its wto membership on march 25 1998 the house international relations committee marked up the bill adopting an amendment by chairman gilman the gilman amendment added language about the xinjiang autonomous region in china formerly east turkestan whic h is the home of large numbers of muslim uighurs established definitions and separate remedies for category 1 persecution officially sanctioned or conducted by the government and category 2 persecution not officially sanctioned and softened the presidential waiver authority restrictions both houses ultimately passed the legislation and it was signed into law on october 27 199845 conservative christian groups also became involved in the debate over renewing chinas mfn statu s in 1997 as result the annual trade debate became heavily laden with moral values arguments tangible evidence of this involvement came in the form of letter made available during the mostfavorednation mfn renewal debate in 1997 which specifically linked religious persecution of chinese christians with renewal of chinas mfn status the letter signed by key leaders of conservative christian organizations including the christian coalition and the family research council made clear the differen ces of opinion these groups had with christian missionary groups in china46 other members echoed these beliefs during the mfn debate during floor debate representative richard gephardt stated that the debate was about principle and value and belief47

christian coalition on foreign affairs issues particularly in the china debate both groups maintain extensive web sites each of which illustrates the particular focal issues of its host the coalitions website contains an issue positions section but appears to concentrate on more traditional valuesbased issues such as education and school prayer the frc on the other hand moves beyond these traditional subjects and in addition to religious persecution includes foreign affairs and military readiness as among the issues in depth on which it is active issues involving china are cross referenced to all three of these areas in the groups web site and hotlinks to other related web sites are provided on issues involving the debate over chinas trade status written products advertised in these sites include materials on chinas laogai prison system religious persecution in china china as security threat to the united states and chinese espionage in the united states the frc website also contains extensive information on contacting congress empirical evidence suggests that the influence of the religious right in the us china debate reached zenith in 199798 although still active these groups have adopted lower profile in american policy debates in 19992000 both the christian coalition and the family research council have had key leadership changes within the past two years with the departure of ralph reed from the coalition in 1997 and gary bauer who went on extended leave of absence during his exploration for presidential bid from the frc in january 1999 the new president of the coalition kenneth l connor and the new executive vice president charl donovan serving in their current positions since september 2000 both have good conservative credentials but it is unclear whether they can muster the kind of political clout and visibility for the coalition that reed enjoyed think tanks and other public policyresearch groups independent research and educational groups socalled think tanks have been an important source of influence and information on us policy toward china since before normalization of relations in 1979 these groups are distinctive from academic research institutions many of which also influence american decisions and actions involving china in the extent of their focus on public policy research which makes them particularly relevant to many us policymakers these groups generally seek to bring together in conferences and working group sessions researchers and specialists in the academic community members of the business community and us and foreign government policy makers to confer about current issues and problems often the endresult is published work pamphlet book or journal analyzing the results of the discussions and setting forth list of policy recommendations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30768crs21 50 quote from national committee materials httpwwwneuserorghistoryhtmfunding is constant preoccupation of public policy think tanks money comes from various sources in some cases from us government contracts as with rand and similar federal contract research centers but more gener ally from corporate or private contributions foundation grants and to lesser extent sale of the organizations publications while many of the interest groups discussed elsewhere in this paper are advocacy groups seeking to influence congressional decision making on china on specific issue or on behalf of deeplyheld conviction or category of people public policy research groups generally seek broader roles in the policy process although all these organizations describe themselves as private nonprofit nonpartisan institutions emphasis added each tends to be associated with particular political point of view and sometimes with particular political party these institutional inclinations become clearer on examination of their boards of directors and advisors the chairs of their working groups the participants in their conferences and their sources of funding given these ideological predispositions think tanks influence in the policy process may be cyclical rising and falling depending on whether its values are shared by the current administration or congress national committee on uschina relations ncuscr some public policy research groups start from the premise that further sinoamerican contacts will improve mutual understanding they seek to foster exchange and dialogue both among policymakers and among those outside the governmental community and they provide forum for debate discussion and research on related issues one of the most wellknown and influential of these groups is the new yorkbased national committee on uschina relations hereafter referred to as the national committee another signif icantly smaller and newer than the national committee is the washingtonbased us china policy foundation the foundation founded by group of scholars and leaders in the business civic and religious communities the national committee came into being in 1966 long before us china normalization in 1979 at time when americans knew little about china and there was official and little unofficial contact between americans and chinese national committee officials state that the human and written resources they provided in those early years were among the few available on china as the uschina relationship changed so did the national committees role in the 1960s the committee provided information and encouraged public discourse about china in the 1970s by its account it handled all subsequent to 1972 exchanges between the united states and china prior to normalization of relations in 197950 beginning in the 1980s the committee initiated projects involving multiple cities

specializing in china and asia and prominent business leaders51 as the committee points out its membership includes over 700 people who represent many points of view but share the belief that increased public knowledge of china and uschina relations enhances international understanding and contributes to the effective conduct of foreign policy52 the nature of the organization and the people associated with it means that unlike with some of the other ngos it can be difficult to point to an issue or an instance where the committees input had decisive influence on particular policy decision rather the committees focus is directed more toward the overall policy process than can be demonstrated by debate on any single issue national committee board members officers and members routinely testify at congressional hearings on china participate in briefings for us government officials and prepare briefing materials for delegations visiting china53 national committee publications such as its china policy series are wellknown among policymakers in recent years the national committee has been primarily involved in what has come to be called the track 2 dialogue an attempt to supplement faltering official uschina talks with unofficial but highlevel visits by former us government officials and others with influence in the policy process54 the national committee continues to be involved with congr essional delegation trips to china providing access information and funding critics have sometimes cited the national committee as being excessively pro engagement and unwi lling to endorse broad punitive sanctions or to give sufficient recognition to china as potential longterm security threat in 1997 for instance when allegations surfaced about illegal campaign contributions by chinese government sources the national committee received negative public scrutiny and criticism for having paid for congressional trips to china after having received money

others the economic pull of potentially vast china market has prompted business commu nity involvement in us china policy since the formative days of the relationship the uschina business council for instance prominent group influencing uschina policy was formed in 1973 following the nixonkissinger opening to china but chinas crackdown in tiananmen square during the first year of the bush administration drove many investors away from the china market eroded business confidence in chinas economic potential and made it difficult for business groups to defend us relations with china given the negative domestic and international view of china in the aftermath of tiananmen square one in the business community wanted to be an apologist for chinese leaders actions in the words of one busine ss representative65 in the first years after tiananmen square then the business community tended to keep low profile leaving president bush to defend uschina relations and ultimately protect american business interests by 1991 partly in response to efforts in congress to withdraw or place further conditions on chinas mfn trade status business groups became more active in trying to protect chinas trade status by the mid1990s the investment climate in china also had improved noticeably circumstance which traditionally has spurred heightened business community activity on china issues66

activities in support of us government policies conducive to expanded uschina commercial and economic ties67 the council works regularly and primarily with us administration officials on problems and issues involving its constituency and holds number of annual conferences and regular meetings to discuss policy issues the council was strongly affected by the business communitys disillusionment with chinas potential after the 1989 tiananmen square crackdown during the succeeding two years the council lost twothirds of its members and it only began to recover with chinas renewed economic prospects in 199394 by the year 2000 the council had regained its membership and it now has about 260 member corporations council representatives maintain that only two of the approximately 30 staff are involved in public advocacy with congressional offices on issues involving china and that most representations to congress are carried out by member corporations nevertheless in recent years the council has played an active role in the debate over mfn and pntr trade status for china council president robert kapp has testified in support of chinas trade status before congressional committees on numerous occasions in recent years68 the business coalition for uschina trade the business coalition for uschina trade the coalition is relative newcomer to the us china policy scene it was established in 1991 the first year that chinas mfn trade status appeared to be in jeopardy 1991 article describes the original founding members of the coalition to be 75 major trade groups and corporations whose goal was to help bolster president bush in his efforts to maintain chinas trade status69 according to coalition spokes man the primary founder of the group was the emergency committee for american trade ecat which was founded in 1967 to lobby against import quotas but in recent years has been active in efforts to protect chinas mfn trade status70 four core organizations remain at the center of the coalition ecat the uschina business council the business roundtable and the american chamber of commerce the coalition stands out for its primary focus on protecting chinas

relations concerns allegations involving transfers of weapons of mass destruction and mediumrange ballistic missiles primarily to pakistan and to countries in the middle east iran is reported to have been steady customer of chinese weapons having purchased small numbers of sa2 surfacetoair missiles f7 combat aircraft fastattack patrol boats and c 802 antiship cruise missiles in may 1998 in response to earlier nuclear weapons tests by india on may 11 and 28 1998 pakistan tested its own nuclear weapons dramatically announcing its new status as nuclear power these tests have been cited by some members as positive proof that china has violated its agreements and has assisted pakistan in its nuclear weapons program carneg ie endowment for international peace continuing concerns about chinas weapons sales and nuclear weapons programs have given arms control and nonproliferation groups natural congressional audience for the most part these groups have served as sources of information on technical and scientific aspects ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30768crs28 74 in addition to its widely read journal foreign policy which contains regular articles on china in april 1999 the endowment published book devoted to china chinas changing nuclear posture 75 on january 12 1998 president clinton signed the required certifications to implement nuclear cooperation agreement with china citing that there had been clear assurances from china on nuclear nonproliferation issues the actual uschina nuclear cooperation agreement was signed in 1985 but cooperation had occurred under the agreement primarily because of concerns over chinas proliferation activities 76 congressional record july 23 1991 p s10640 77 one example is hres 188 measure introduced by representative gilman which found the delivery of chinese c802 cruise missiles to iran to be destabilizing and therefore violation of the iraniraq nonproliferation act of 1992 during floor consideration the house adopted amendments which among other things recommended that the united states not issue any visa to chinese nationals involved in weapons proliferation reps porterdreiermatsui the house passed the amended hres 188 on november 6 1997 by continuedweapons systems and comparative studies of chinas force structure with that of other countries the carnegie endowment for international peace the endowment is perhaps the oldest and best known of these groups founded in 1910 with gift from andrew carnegie the endowment works on broad range of policy issues of which nonproliferation is only one the endowment is governed by distinguished board of trustee s of varying backgrounds including william donaldson chair former secretary of defense william perry form er senator bill bradley and leslie gelb while the endowment does not generally take institutional positions its non proliferation experts programs and publications have been routinely cited by members of congress in floor statements that describe details of chinas nuclear weapons program missile development and weapons sales74 us administration officials have tended to argue that china is reassessing its weapons sales and assistance policies and that its overall record has been steadily improving administration officials cite series of decisions by china in support of this argument accession to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt in 1992 to abide by the missile technology control regime mtcr in 1993 to sign the chemical weapons convention csc in 1996 to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty and in 1997 to join the zangger committee of npt exporters75 congressional critics however bolstered by independent information from non proliferation groups have charged that the adminis trations confidence in chinas nonproliferation policies is misplaced in 1991 congressional concerns about chinas international weapons sales prompted members to begin to include adherence to nonproliferation regimes as one of the additional conditions china should meet before having its mfn trade status renewed in 1992 for instance senator joe biden expressed his concern in the annual debate over chinas mfn status saying if china continues to behave as rogue elephant on weapons proliferation we should be prepared to retaliate with clear and unequivocal messagedenying china most favorednation trade status76 in succeeding years measures targeting chinas weapons proliferation activities have been introduced either as components of mfn related bills or as separate freestanding measures77 in september 1999 congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30768crs29 77 continued vote of 4148 78 the resolution was hconres 53 introduced by congressman tom lantos which the house passed by vote of 3960 on may 2 1995 and

conference on june 30 1998 according to white house transcript of his remarks the president said i had chance to reiterate our taiwan policy which is that we dont support independence for taiwan or two chinas or one taiwanone china and we dont believe that taiwan should be member in any organi zation for which statehood is requirement so i think we have consistent policy among the resolutions

included senseofcongress language that china should not be allowed to join the mtrc without meeting certain conditions and requiring the administration to submit report by january 31 2000 on chinas adherence to the mtcr the taiwan lobby discussion of the role that interest groups play in influencing us china policy would be complete without mention of this group the loosely defined taiwan lobby is the group of activists considered by many observers to have the most consistent and indepth influence in the us china policy process consisting of taiwan govern ment officials members of the business community groups of american citizens of either taiwanese or chinese ancestry and usbased groups advocating indepe ndence for taiwan the amorphous protaiwan group appears deeply commit ted to representing various interests not necessarily mutually reinforcing involving taiwan at every relevant point in the american policy process the taiwan lobby was critical factor in 1995 for instance when congress passed resolution urging the president to invite taiwans president lee tenghui to the united states78 this invitation reportedly contributed in large part to the 1996 taiwan strait missile crisis the most confrontat ional crisis in uschina relations since normalization of relations in 1979 involving livefire missile exercises by china and the corresponding american dispatch of two carrier battle groups to the area in the 105th congress 19971998 taiwan interests promoted the passage of resolution urging taiwans unconditional admittance to the world trade organization wto bill requiring the united states to develop plans for theater missile defense tmd system for taiwan 79 and several resolutions reaffirming and clarifying us support for taiwan in conjunction with president clintons three noes statements in shanghai which some interpret ed as change in us policy toward taiwan80 in the 106th congress taiwan interests were reflected in the taiwan security enhancement act hr 1838s 693 bill designed to enhance ustaiwan military communication and cooperation and strengthen taiwans security httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30768crs30 concluding observations several observations can be made after examining us china policy over the past decade and the activities of organized interest groups in the policy process first the changes that the us policy debate has undergone in recent years suggest that uschina relations are not likely to improve or become less controversial over the near term while essentially policy of consensus in the 1980s questions about the direction of us policy over china became controversial and divisive within few months of the tiananmen square crackdown in 1989 and have generally remained that way since longstanding issues invol ving nonproliferation national security and human rights have only grown in importance within the us policy debate over the past decade socalled sovereignty issues tibet xinjiang and most importantly taiwan continue to be divisive and potentially destabilizing issues in the relationship from this perspective it would appear that political circumstances will continue to provide opportunities for organized groups who have vested interests in these issues to seek to influence us china policy another observation on interest group activity over the past decade has to do with personnel and perceptio n the perception is that the expansion of interest groups focusing on china in recent years approximately 50 of the groups listed in this reports appendix were formed since 1980 represents an everwidening circle of disenchantment with or vested interest in the current direction of us china policy in fact this perception may be somewhat skewed since some groups have overlapping memberships and advisory boards in some cases new group has been formed by members of other groups representing similar interests as in the case of the business coalition on uschina trade in order to focus more attention on given issue although several groups with duplicate memberships working the same issue from different angles can create more of an impression on the policy process than if only one group were working those issues it does not necessarily follow that dissatisfaction with the policy process is growing only that the number of interest groups is growing and that they are becoming more sophisticated in their activities second set of observations relates to three points raised initially in this report as being among the reasons for rising interest group activity the first of these is particularly important the shift of the debate over the past decade from the single issue of extending chinas mfn status to growing proliferation of issues unrelated to mfn although decisions approving extensions of chinas mfn status became more or less routine beginning in 1993 they did serve as catalysts for consideration of various alternative us government proposals on measures involving china policy but the 106th congress passage of legislation to grant china permanent normal trade relations status may change the dynamic of interest group activity busines s and labor groups heretofore involved heavily in the china mfnpntr debate may find both their influence and their solidarity wane with the disappearance of their chief issue other interest groups usually able to count on leveraging the annual trade debate for their own particular goals could find it much more difficult to initiate new policy measures absent this regular legislative vehicle in sense the annual china trade debate served both as unifying element and as kind of force multiplier for divergent interest groups having disappeared as an issue thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30768crs31 implication for interest groups might be increasing fractionalization among groups with divergent interests competing for policy influence two other reasons cited for rising interest group activity over the past decade are also subject to possible change over the near term the blurring of traditional party and ideological lines and the animosity and partisanship that comes with divided us government between democratic congress and the bush white house and particularly between conservative republican congress and the clinton white house these systemic sometimes sharp policy differences make it difficult to tell whether the views and actions of interest groups were contributing factor to policy divisi on or whether groups were merely exploiting policy differences that already existed in any event this policy dynamic also may change dramatically after the american elections in novem ber 2000 with subsequent implications for interest group activity and influence these issues are important for making future judgements about the role and effectiveness of nongovernmental organized interest groups absent demonstrable changes in chinas policies or in the nature of the american political process there are few forces apparent on the horizon that seem capable of making us policy debates on china over the near term significantly smoother than they have been over the past decade the result will be that these issues will continue being problematic for uschina relations for american policymakers and the political process and indirectly for internal chinese policies
