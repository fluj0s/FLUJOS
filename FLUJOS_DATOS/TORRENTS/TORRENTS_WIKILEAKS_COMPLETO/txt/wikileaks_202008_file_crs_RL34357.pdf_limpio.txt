medicaid maintain substantial home equity amount of 500000 background the deficit reduction ac t of 2005 dra pl 109171 amended the social security act to exclude from medicaid eligibility for nursing facility or other longterm care services certain individuals with an equity interest in their home of greater than 500000 u nder dra the stat may elect without regard to medicaids requirements concerning statewideness and comparability to substitute an amount that exceeds 500000 but does not exceed 750000 these dollar amounts are increased beginning in 2011 from yeartoyear based on the percentage increase in the consumer pri ce index cpi for all urban consumers all items united states city average r ounded to the nearest 1000 the secretary establishes process for waiving this provision in the case of demonstrated hardship the homes of individuals whos spouse child under age 21 or child who is blind or disabled as defined by the s ection 1614 of the social security act and lawfully resides in the i ndividuals home are excluded proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation that would limit the allowable home equity amount to 500000 for all states by eliminating the state option to increase the equity limit to number betw een 500000 and 750000 starting in 2011 this limit would be adjust ed by the cpi inflation factor hhs estimates that the proposal would sa ve 80

april grady hinda chaikind and evelyne p baumrucker medicaid redesign acute care benefits for optional ltc groups background eligibility for medicaids longterm care services such as nursing home care or range of home nd communitybased supportive services is limited to beneficiaries who meet statedesigned assessments for functional need and financial standards the assessment for functional need examines physical andor cognitive functioning that evaluates whether applicants would require the level of care provided in an institution eg nursing facility intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded or hos pital financial st andards refer to variety of optional eligibility pathways including pathways that allow states to cover people with long term care needs who have income above 74 of the federal poverty level fpl which is equivalent to th level of cash payments unde r the supplemental security income program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34357crs5 beneficiaries who are enrolled in medicaid because they need longterm care services also are generally entitled to range of acute care benefits eg hospital care physician services re habilitati on private duty nursing home health services case management among many others that state offers as long as these services are medically necessary for dual eligible s individuals enrolled in both medicare and medicaid medicaid covers just those acute care services that are not covered by medicare often referred to as wrap around services proposal the presidents budget would tablish state plan amendment option to allow states to offer modified benefit package of acute care services for selected longterm care benefi ciaries states would be given the authority under this provision to expand on the draflexibility to adapt private sector health insurance benefit packages to better meet the needs of specific medicaid beneficiary groups the dra option is modeled on benefit packages available under schip ie fehbp preferred provider option coverage for stat employees the largest commercial hmo in state or secretaryapproved coverage hhs estimates that by redesigning acute care benefits dicaid would save 20 million in fy2009 and 650 million over the fy2009fy2013 period reports currently other crs repor ts address this topic medicaid repeal secti on 1932a2special rules background to control costs and quality of care many states contract with managed care organizations to deliver serv ices to medicaid beneficiaries these arrangements can include contracts with health maintenance organizations hmos primary care case management pccm progra ms and prepaid health plans phps which vary in the comprehensiveness of services they provide and the degree of financial risk assumed in the managed care contracts prior to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba pl 10533 federal medicaid laws contained provisions that limited states ability to use managed care including requirements regarding freedom of choice of provider for beneficiaries st atewideness ie all covered services must be available statewide and comparability ie the amount duration and scope of any services available to one individual must be available to all individuals in the same eligibility category special waivers were required to override these rules bba added section 1932 to the medicaid stat ute this provision gave states the option of requiring medicaid beneficiarie s covered under states medicaid plans to enroll with managed care entity without waiver specific groups identified in section 1932a2 were exempted from mandatory enrollment in managed care including children under age 19 with speci health care needs defined as those eligible for the supplement security income or ssi program children eligible for the title v maternal and child health block grant program children under 18 who meet the ssi disability standards who require institutional care but receive car outside the institution and for whom the

beneficiaries have the freedom to choose their medical care providers compara bility refers to requirement that services be comparable in amount duration and scope for all persons in each eligibility group statewideness refers to the requirement that states provide services on statewide basis rather than in only portion of the state 5 prior to passage of the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 state had to obtain section 1115 or section 1915b freedomof choice waiver from the secretary of hhs if it wanted to require medicaid recipi ents to enroll in managed care programthose receiving foster care or adoption assistance under title ive or who are in foster care or otherwise in an outofhome placement other exempted groups include individuals who are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid indians are also exempted from mandatory enrollment in medicaid managed care plans unless the participating managed care entity is the indian health service or certain indian health programs operated by indian tribes tribal organizations or urban indian organizations proposal the presidents fy2009 budget repeals section 1932a2 this change would allow states to require th currently exempted populations identified above to enroll in medicaid managed car programs covered under medicaid state plans hhs estimates that by repealing th section 1932a2 special rules medicaid would save 100

managed care an overview and key issues for congress by elicia j herz medicaid extend secti on 1915b waiver period background section 1915b of the social security act gives the secretary of hhs the authority to waive certain medicaid program requirements including statewideness comparability of services and freedom of choice of provider4 to allow states to establish mandatory managed care programs that restrict the providers from whom beneficiary may obtain covered services or that create carve out delivery system for specialty care as long as such programs do not reduce beneficiary access and quality of care5 section 1915b waiver programs are ge nerally approved for twoyear period and must be cost effective cannot cost more than what the medicaid program would have cost without the waiver they may not be used to expand eligibility to individuals not otherwise ligible under the medicaid state plan but cost savings achieved under the waivers may be used to provide additional services ie those not typically provided under the state plan to medicaid beneficiaries proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to extend the section 1915b waiver renewal period from two years to three years hhs estimates that the proposal would have cost impact in fy2009 or over the fy2009fy2013 periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34357crs7 reports for more information on medicaid managed care see crs report rl33711 medicaid managed care an overvi ew and key issues for congress by elicia j herz medicaid replace best price with budget neutral rebate background under medicaid drug manufactur ers that wish to have their drugs available for medicaid enrollees are required to enter into rebate agreements with the secretary of hhs on behalf of the states under the agreements pharmaceutical manufacturers must provide state medicaid programs with rebates on drugs paid on behalf of medi caid beneficiaries the formulas used to compute the rebates are intended to ensure that medicaid pays the lowest price that the manufacturers offer for the drugs rebate calculations depend on the type of drug for single source and innovator multiple source drugs basic rebate amounts are determined by comparing the average manufacturer price amp for drug the average price paid by wholesalers to the best price which is the lowest price offered by the manufacturer in the same period to any wholesal er retailer nonprofit or public entity the basic rebate is the gr eater of 151 of the amp or the difference between the amp and the best price add itional rebates are required if the weighted average prices for all of given manufact urers single source and innovator multiple source drugs rise faster than inflation for noninnovator multiple source drugs basic rebates are equal to 11 of the amp proposal the presidents budget seeks legi slation to eliminate the best price from the rebate formula for single s ource and innovator multiple source drugs changing the best pricebased formula to flat rebate this change is intended to be made in budget neutral manner hhs ex planatory materials describe the proposal as way to simplify drug rebate calculations and as way to allow private purchasers to negotiate lower prices without affec ting medicaid drug costs hhs estimates that the proposal would have cost imp act in fy2009 or ove r the fy 2009 fy2013 period reports for

however are limited to federal upper limit ful the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra established that fuls pplying to drugs available from multiple sources generic drugs for the most part be recalculated by cms to be equal to 250 of the average manufacturers pr ice amp the average price paid by wholesalers to manufacturers as reported to cms by the manufacturers those ful formulas however

components of the new ful formula have been issued in proposed federal rule the rule has been contested andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34357crs8 cms is prohibited from implementing its provisions until the court hears the case and makes final determination of its legality proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation that would build on changes made by dra to achieve dditional savings in the medicaid program the proposal would reduce the fuls on multiple source drugs from 250 of the amp to 150 of the amp of the lowest priced drug in the group hhs estimates that the proposal would save 195

enhance third party liability background third party liability tpl refers to the legal obligation of third parties individuals entities or programs to pay all or part of the expenditures for medical assistance furnishe d under medicaid in genera l federal law requires medicaid to be the payer of last resort meaning that all other available third parties must meet their legal obligation to pay claims before the medicaid program pays for the care of an individual states are required to take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services available under the state medicaid plan if state has determined that probable liability exists at the time claim for reimbursement is filed it generally must reject the claim and return it to the provider for determination of the amount of th irdparty liability referred to as cost avoidance if probable liability has not been established or the third party is not available to pay the individuals medical expenses the state must pay the claim and then attempt to recover the amount pa id referred to as pay and chase states are generally required to cost void claims unless they have an approved waiver that allows them to use the pay andchase method however there are two statutory exceptions to this rule in the case of prenatal and preventive pediatric care states are required to use pay and chase in the case of medicaid beneficiary whose parent provides medical suppor t eg health insurance coverage via an employer as part of child support order being enforced by the state the st ate must use pay and chase if provider has not been paid under the medical support arrangement within 30 days in some cases medicaid beneficiary may be required to reimburse the state for medicaid expenses paid on his or her behalf to facilitate such reimbursement the state may place lien on the medicaid beneficiarys property with certain exceptions federal law gene rally prohibits states from imposing medicaid liens onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34357crs9 the property of living beneficiaries in contrast federal law permits medicaid liens on the estates of deceased beneficiaries in wider variety of situations proposal the presidents budget seeks legislati on to allow states to avoid costs for prenatal and preventive pe diatric claims where third party is responsible collect for medical child support where health in surance is derived from noncustodial parents obligation to provi coverage and recover medicaid expenditures from beneficiary liability settlements hhs estimates that the proposal would save 35 million in fy2009 and 470 million over the fy2009fy2013 period reports currently other crs repor ts address this topic medicaid modify asset verification background the social security administration is piloting financial account verification system in field offices located in new york and new jersey that uses an electronic asset verification system to he lp confirm that individuals who apply for supplemental security income ssi bene fits are eligible the process permits automated paperless transmi ssion of asset verification requests between ssa field offices and financial institutions pa rt of this demonstration involved comprehensive study to measure the value of such system for ssi applicants as well as recipients already on the payment rolls the study identified small percentage about 5 percent of applicants and r ecipients who were overpaid based on this financial account verificati on system the tma abstinence education and qi programs extension act of 2007 pl 110 90 applied the ssa demonstration to medicaid for the period of oct ober 1 2007 through september 30 2012 proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to provide technical corrections to the demonstration and extend it permanently hhs estimates that the proposal would save 82 milli on in fy2009 and 12 billion over the fy2009 fy2013 period reports currently other crs re

on the financial nd actuarial status of the funds such requirement exists for the medicaid program which doe s not have trust fund and is financed with state dollars and federal general revenues proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to increase transparency through the publication of an annual actua rial report hhs estimates that the proposal would have cost impact in fy2009 or over the fy2009fy2013 period reports currently other crs re ports address this topichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34357crs10 medicaid implement cost allocation background because of the overlap in ligible populations states often undertake administrative activitie s that benefit more than one program under the former aid to families with dependent children afdc cash welfare program afdc and medicaid program eligibility were linked and many afdc families also qualified for food stamps as result stat often collected necessary information for all three programs during single eligibility interview or performed other shared administrative tasks and charged the full am ount of the cost to afdc as matter of convenience since the federal gove rnment reimbursed states for 50 of administrative expenditures for all three programs total federal spending was not affected by the way in which states allocated the programs common administrative costs when congress replaced afdc with the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant program in 1996 the 50 federal match for expenditures related to cash welfare assistance ended and the automatic link between cash welfare and medicaid eligibility was severed later hhs clarified that states are required to allocate common administrative costs for tanf medicaid and food stamps based on the relative benefits deri ved by each program remaining issue of controversy stems from the fact that tanf block grants are calculated in part on the basis of pre1996 federa l welfare spending including any amounts received by states as reimbursement for common administrative costs as result tanf block grants are higher in many states than they would be if common administrative costs attributable to medicaid and food st amps were excluded from block grant calculations to compensate congre ss has permanently reduced federal reimbursement for food stamp administrative costs in most states by flat dollar amount that reflects the administrative cost s attributable to food stamps that are included in states tanf block grants the annual reductions total about 200 million congress has not reduced federal reimbursement for medicaid administrative costs in similar manner proposal the presidents budget seek s legislation to recoup medicaid administrative costs included in states tanf block grants hhs estimates that the proposal woul d save 280 million in fy2009 and approxima tely approximately 18 billion over the fy2009fy2013 period reports see crs report rs22101 state medicaid program administration brief overview by april grady medicaid implement medicaid payforperformance incentives background the budget act of 1997 mandated performance monitoring as tool for ensuring the delivery of quality services in

by medicaid and schip programs on voluntary basis to assess the quality of carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34357crs11 proposal the presidents budget proposal would seek legislation to require states to monitor and report on medicaid performance measures aimed at improving quality of care program integrity and efficiency and would link performance to federal medicaid grant awar ds reporting would begin in fy2009 with threeyear phasein for the performance m easures beginning in 2012 states that fail to meet performance thresholds would be subject to federal medical assistance percentage fmap or medicaid grant award re ductions depending on the performance measure these reductions would remain in effect until the state meets the designated thresholds for specific performance measures budget documents further indicate that performance measures curren tly being considered include increasing estate recovery collection rates and reducing the prevalence of daily physical restraints in nursing
