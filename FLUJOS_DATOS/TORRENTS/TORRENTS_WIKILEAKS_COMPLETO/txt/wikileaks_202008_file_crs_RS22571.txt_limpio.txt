of 2007 hr 6 fred sissine resources science and industry division april 4 2007 abstract hr 6 would use revenue from certain oil and natural gas policy revisions to create an energy efficiency and renewables reserve the actual uses of the reserve would be determined by ensuing legislation variety of tax spending or regulatory bills could draw funding from the reserve to support liquid fuels or elec tricity policies the house budget resolution hconres 99 would create deficitneutral reserve fund nearly identical to that proposed in hr 6 the senate budget resolution sconres 21 would create three reserve funds with purposes related to those in hr 6 however the senate version has more specifics about efficiency and renewables measures and it would allow reserve fund use for responsible development of oil and natural gas order code rs22571 updated april 4 2007 the strategic energy efficiency and renewables reserve in the clean energy act of 2007 hr 6 fred sissine specialist in energy

development of oil and natural gas background hr 6 was introduced by the house democratic leadership to revise certain tax and royalty policies for oil and natural gas and use the resulting revenue to support reserve for energy efficiency and renewable energy the bill is one of several introduced on behalf of the democratic leadership in the house as part of its 100 hours package of legislative initiatives conducted early in the 110th congress title i proposes to reduce certain oil and natural gas tax subsidies to create revenue stream to support energy efficiency and renewable energy1 title ii would modify certain aspects of royalty relief for offshore oil and natural gas development to create second stream of revenue to support energy efficiency and renewable energy2 1 detailed description of existing oil and natural gas tax provisions is available in crs report rl33763 oil and gas tax subsidies current status and analysis by salvatore lazzari 2 detailed description of existing and proposed oil and natural gas royalty provisions is continued crs2 strategic energy efficiency and renewables reserve title iii of hr 6 creates budget procedure for the creation and use of strategic energy efficiency and renewable energy reserve under which additional spending for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs can be accommodated without violating enforcement procedures in the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended bill purpose and permitted reserve uses the stated purpose of the bill is to reduce our nations dependency on foreign oil by investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency specifically section 301 of the bill would make the revenue in the reserve available to offset the cost of subsequent legislation that may be introduced 1 to accelerate the use of domestic renewable energy resources and alternative fuels 2 to promote the utilization of energyefficient products and practices and conservation and 3 to increase research development and deployment of clean renewable energy and efficiency technologies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22571 budget adjustment procedure for uses of the reserve the budget adjustment procedure for use of the reserve is set out in section 301 b the procedure is similar to reserve fund procedures included in annual budget resolutions3 it would require the chairman of the house or senate budget

exceed the amount of increased receipts for that fiscal year as estimated by the congressional budget office attributable to hr 6 initial revenue estimates for the reserve according to the congressional budget office cbo the proposed repeal of selected tax incentives for oil and natural gas would make about 77 billion available over 10 years 2008 through 2017 the proposed changes to the royalty system for oil and natural gas are estimated to generate an additional 63 billion this would yield combined total of 14 billion for the reserve over 10year period4 the cbo estimates 2

and natural gas incentives would dampen production cause job losses and lead to higher prices for gasoline and other fuels opponents also complained that the proposal for the reserve does not identify specific policies and programs that would receive funding proponents of the bill countered that record profits show that the oil and natural gas incentives were not needed they also contended that the language that would create the reserve would allow it to be used to support variety of rd deployment tax incentives and other measures for renewables and energy efficiency and that the specifics would evolve as legislative proposals come forth for to draw resources from the reserve the bill passed the house on january 18 by vote of 264163 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22571 related action on the budget resolution in general the budget resolution would revise the congressional budget for fy2007 it would also establish the budget for fy2008 and set budgetary levels for fy2009 through fy2012 in particular the house resolution hconres 99 would create single deficitneutral reserve fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy that is virtually identical to the reserve described in hr 6 in contrast the senate resolution sconres 21 would create three reserve funds which identify more specific efficiency and renewables measures and would allow support for responsible development of oil and natural gas house version of the budget resolution hconres 99 on march 28 the house passed hconres 99 by vote of 216210 for fy2007 it would allow for additional funding for energy function 270 above the presidents request that could be used for research development and deployment of renewable and alternative energy section 207 would create deficitneutral reserve fund that fulfills the purposes of hr 6 to facilitate the development of conservation and energy efficiency technologies clean domestic renewable energy resources and alternative fuels that will reduce our reliance on foreign oil senate version of the budget resolution sconres 21 on march 23 the senate passed sconres 21 its version of the budget resolution in parallel to the house resolution section 307 of sconres 21 would create deficit neutral reserve fund that could be used for renewable energy energy efficiency and responsible development of oil and natural gas in addition section 332 would create deficitneutral reserve fund for extension through 2015 of certain energy tax incentives including the renewable energy electricity production tax credit ptc clean renewable energy bonds and provisions for energy efficient buildings products and power plants crs4 further section 338 would create deficitneutral reserve fund for manufacturing initiatives that could include tax and research and development rd measures that support alternative fuels automotive and energy technologies and the infrastructure to support those technologies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22571
