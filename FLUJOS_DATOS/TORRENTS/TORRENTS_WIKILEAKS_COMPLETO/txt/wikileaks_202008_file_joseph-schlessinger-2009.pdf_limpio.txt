claimed were theirs were immediat ely given back to its rightful inventors at the weizmann institu 12 joseph schlessinger and imclone inexplicably filed an appeal against this ruling which was

of extraordinary breadth adding that joseph schlessinger displayed great relu ctance to acknowledge the facts 34 judge buchwald also stated we find schlessingers accoun t of this conversation not credible for several reasons first ne arly twenty years have passed since the conversation occurred such that we doubt schl essinger remembers its details especially considering the contorted testimony schles singer offered on crossexamination in which he seemingly attempted to remember those details that would bolster his own case134 judge buchwald stopped just short of accusing joseph
