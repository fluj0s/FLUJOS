implementation act hr 23721 the bill would lower or eliminate certain threshold barriers bstention and ripeness ofte n encountered by land owners asserting takings claims against local governments in federal court in the senate similar provisions appear in s 1028 the citizens ccess to justice act pending before the senate judiciary committee the provisions of hr 2372 first appeared in the 105th congress as hr 1534 passed by 248178 and as portion of s 2271 which failed to move forward on the senate floor after 5242 clotur vote 60 votes required2 s 1028 contains another approach to modi fying the process by which property rights claims are asserted one that applies solely to actions against the united states this second tack would expand the jurisdiction of fe deral district courts and the us court of federal claims cfc so that plaintiffs complaining of property rights infringement could assert in the same court their claims for compensation and their claims seeking to have the federal action invalidat ed generally plaintiffs cannot do this under current jurisdictional statutes the jurisdiction expansion approach appeared in the 105th congress as hr 992 passing the house 230 180 and as portion of s 2271 originally hr 1534 which as noted above was not passed3 this report compares hr 2372 as it passe d the house with s 1028 as introduced findings and purposes only s 1028 contains statements of congressional findings and purposes for example the bill asserts that property rights have been abrogated by government actions that the limited jurisdiction of the district courts and cfc preventhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20513crs2 property owners from obtaining full relief and that there is need to define what constitutes final decision by local landuse authorities loweringeliminating threshol d barriers in federal court as noted both hr 2372 and s 1028 address the abstenti on and ripeness barriers to litig ating claims involving real property in federal court both apply to such claims principally brought under the takings clause of the constitution when asserted against local governments under 42 usc section 1983 or when asserted agai nst the federal govern ment finally both bills disavow any intent to change substantive takings law as for abstention the bills st ate different conditions for wh federal district court can abstain from exercising jurisdiction in realpropertyrelated section 1983 action against local government also hr 2372 st ates that district courts shall not certify statelaw questions for state court resolution unless certain factors are present s 1028 says merely that these factors may be considered as for ripeness each bill defines in very similar terms procedural point at which local landuseregulating body would be deem ed to have made final decision and thus to have satisfied the final decision requirement in the s upreme courts standard for ripe taking claim for example hr 2372 states that fina l decision by the local body exists once meaningful application has been disapproved nd if available one appeal and one waiver also if the initial disapproval explains in writing the development on the property that would be approved the landowner to achieve ripeness must submit another meaningful application taking into account that explanation and have that resubmission be disapproved fo llowed by one appeal and one waiver finally if review is required by the localitys elected offici als the landowner must either be denied review or have the application disapproved ppeals and waivers need not be applied for if doing so would be futile each bill would eliminate the current ripeness rule that before coming to federal court takings plaintiff must exhaust his her state avenues for obtaining compensation s 1028 makes plaintiff liable for the local governments attorneys fees if the taking claim is not substantially justified for takings claims against the united states only the initial steps above need be followed to ripen claim written explan ation appeal to elected officials expansion of district court and cfc jurisdiction as noted only s 1028 addresses this issue the bill would eliminate th current 10000 cap on property rights claims against the united states brought in district court at the sa time the bill would empower the cfc to hear claims seeking i nvalidation of acts of congress or federal regulations where they affect property rights in sum the bill would create for property rights claims concurrent ju risdiction between these two c ourts all appeals of actions brought under the bill would be to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit attorneys fees may be awarded by the court to prevailing plaintiff notice to owners each bill provides that whenever federal agency limits the use of private property in way that may be affected by the bill the agency must notify the property owner of the procedures for obt aining just compensation under the bill
