selfexecuting rules reported by the house committee on rules walter j oleszek government and finance division house rule x assigns the committee on rules jurisdiction over the order of business of the house the panels most noteworthy responsibility is to issue order of business resolutions these are usually called rules special rules or less commonly special orders chamber adoption of these rules accomplishes two main objectives it permits the house to take up measures that ty pically lack convenient rightofway to the floor and it defines the procedural playing field for example time for debate and the structure of the amendment proce ss for considering legislation the committees important scheduling role has meant that congressional scholars and others have classified rule s in various ways for example an open rule affords any lawmaker an opportunity to offer amendments to bill so long as they are in compliance with the houses standing rules cl osed rule forbids anyone from offering amendments with an exception sometimes made for amendments recommended by the committee that reported the measure startin g about twentyfive years ago in response to developments such as increased partisanship and uncertainty with respect to how long or controversial the amendment process on the floor might be the rules committee began to issue more procedurally imaginative and complex rules definition of selfexecuting rule one of the newer types is called self executing rule it embodies twoforone pro cedure this means that when the house adopts rule it also simultaneously agrees to dispose of separate matter which is specified in the rule itself for instance selfexecuting rules may stipulate that discrete policy proposal is deemed to have passed th house and been incorporated in the bill to be taken up the effect neither in the house nor in the committee of the whole will lawmakers have an opportunity to amend or to vote separately on the selfexecuted provision it was automatically agreed to wh the house passed the rule rules of this sort contain customary or boilerplate language such as the amendment printed in section 2 of this resolution or in
