children and family court advisory and support service paper for the board meeting on 09 march 2007 monthly finance update aim and purpose 11 to update the board on cafcass latest financial position including details of the expenditure and balance sheet to january 07 and the results of the quarter 3 forecasting exercise action for the board 21 to note the latest financial position and the results of the quarter 3 forecasting exercise overview 31 cafcass total annual budget is 106012m this consists of baseline resource budget of 1008m cafcass income of 0225m one off change funding of 469m and one off funding of 0297m relating to post qualification training and supervised child contact centres 32 based on 0506 expenditure levels all other things being equal cafcass began the year with budget pressures of 35m to 45m 33 based on the q3 forecasts submitted by budget holders in january cafcass is projecting an outturn of breakeven this represents reduction on the quarter 2 forecasts and marks the significant progress that has been made across cafcass to address and control the significant budget pressures faced at the beginning of the year and the rising demand experienced during the year 34 number of significant financial and operational risks remain and these are being carefully monitored and managed the forecasts continue to be produced excluding the impact of the pension liability 35 there have been significant movements in the january balance sheet 36 cafcass has drawn down all of its cash allocation for the year and 200607 cash spend can be contained within this years cash budget there remains some risk associated with the level of carried forward cash commitments in 200708 at this stage we have not been notified of our 200708 budget settlement therefore at this stage this cannot be quantified this continues to be carefully managed 4 the management accounts 41 table 1 provides details of budget actual expenditure and forecast expenditure by expense category table 2 provides details of budget actual expenditure and forecast expenditure by budget holder regiondepartment 42 the tables show expenditure in january of 87m against budget of 98m an underspend in the month of 11 the cumulative expenditure to date is 841m against budget of 867m an under spend of 26m 30 against budget 43 the underspend in january and to date is largely as result of profiling issues with respect to the change program the overspend in the month showing against the regions is as result of the pay award arrears expenditure includes arrears april to jan jan budget covers jan costs only and is offset by the underspend against central where the accrual was previously held 44 the underspend on national office to date is largely as result of slippage on the change programme however there are also considerable underspends on case recording it kld and communications whilst there will be some catch up in the final two months in general this reflects an overall reduction in the forecast outturn for these areas 45 regional expenditure to january is in line with budget and the q3 forecasts are showing small overspend against budget 1 over the same period national office is showing an 18 underspend against budget however q3 forecasts shows 4 underspend against budget at year end 5 quarter 3 forecast 51 cafcass undertakes quarterly forecasts all budget holders were required to submit quarter 3 expenditure forecast based on the position as at december 2006 by 26th january 2007 the results of this exercise are shown in table 1 and 2 table 2a provides comparison of quarter 2 and quarter 3 forecasts by budget holder 52 in addition to showing the quarter 2 and quarter 3 results table 2a also shows regions rolling activity position as at december 2006 the rolling activity target is calculated by taking all activity ie referrals in the last 12 months and converting the work into staffing target based on the workload policy overall cafcass budgets currently stand at 100 of the current workload level this is in line with the quarter 3 forecast of 1 overspend on regional spend 53 again the position within regions varies ne and em are reporting breakevenunder spend yet they are currently funded below the 200607 level of activity nw and so are showing an overspend explained by the fact that activity is greater than budget yh wm and london are reporting overspends yet are currently funded above 200607 activity levels east and sw are reporting an underspend which is consistent with the fact they are currently budget in excess of 200607 activity levels the financial and activity targets need to be considered against the service performance and backlogs in particular 54 based on the forecasts submitted by budget holders cafcass is forecasting an underspend of 0253m at quarter 3 55 finance has undertaken detailed review of the forecasts submitted taking into account 0607 spend to date and the risks identified by budget holders additional risks of approximately 055m have been identified based on the q3 submissions cafcass is forecasting an outturn of between 03m underspend and 03m overspend as there remains some risks of slippage particularly relating to it overall at quarter 3 cafcass is forecasting breakeven position at quarter 2 cafcass were forecast position of between breakeven and an overspend of 06m 56 the main area of expenditure risk continues to be secflexible workforce expenditure whilst regions have put in place systems to supportdeliver this reduction due to the nature of the sec contract and volatile demand this does still present significant risk 57 the risks outlined as part of the quarter 2 forecasts still remain valid ie demand slippage on the it change program and the pension liability the impact of which is not included within these forecasts 6 the balance sheet 61 the cafcass balance sheet is analysed and reviewed on monthly basis table 3 provides summary of the balance sheet as at january and comparative data against the previous board report balance sheet november and also against the 0506 yearend 62 further it fixed asset additions were made in december and january there was net increase in total fixed assets from 4526m in november to 4599m in january after accounting for accumulated depreciation diminutions and cost of capital charges to date 63 current assets increased from 2455m in november to 2613m in january as result of an increase in the bank balance due to timing differences there were other significant movements in current assets 64 creditors decreased from 7195m in november to 6859m in january this decrease is the net effect of gradual reduction due to the forthcoming yearend in the level of accruals held and an increase in payroll costs due to the recent salary uplift 0506 accruals continue to decrease and currently stand at 0875m in january the majority of 0506 accruals relate to disputed and outstanding accommodation costs 65 provisions are reviewed on monthly basis and decreased from 0284m in november to 0256m in january due to resolutions being reached on three areas 66 the cafcass pension liability continues to be reported as at 31 march 06 ie 58449m the position as at 31 march 2007 cannot be predicted the value will only be available after the yearend when the 0607 frs 17 valuations have been completed all forecasts produced during 0607 will assume movement in the pension liabilities and use the 0506 values as the most accurate estimate available 7 cash 71 table 4 summarises the cash budget actual drawn down and actual spend for 0607 72 in july 2007 revised cash profile was submitted to dfes including the one off funding and further 03m additional funding for child contact services and pq training the budget submitted represented the most realistic estimate of cash spend at that time the revised cash budget was 106221m shortfall of 16m against cash allocation the shortfall represented the savings target in 0607 in cash terms 73 following further discussion with change budget holders revised cash profile was submitted to the dfes in january 2007 factoring in the latest information available cash spend in 200607 will be containable within the cash budget 74 the cash spend to date is in line with the drawdown with cash balances minimised the actual draw down in january is 06m less than the revised cash profile this represents timing differences in profiled spend much of this relates to the change programme 75 during 0607 cafcass month end cash holdings have been within the dfes tolerance limits they have however been higher than in previous years this is direct result of the high levels of uncertainty in the spending of the one off funding 8 compliance bugetary delegation purchase orderspayment performance 81 over the year we have seen steady and gradual increase in po compliance this peaked in december 84 by invoice value january performance has returned to november levels as at the end of january compliance is 72 by invoice numbers and 74 by invoice value the only outlier in the month is legal and the there are specific reason for this relating to the nature of invoices processed po compliance issues continue to be monitored on monthly basis 82 in line with all government departments cafcass must pay bills in timely manner in 0506 cafcass achieved performance of 815 against the 100 target this area has been targeted for improvement in 0607 with monthly statistics issued to budget holders the year to date figures small improvement on 0506 levels 821 further work will need to be undertaken to identify and address the issues in addition we are looking at ways in which measurement of this target can be improved as the current method does not factor in disputed invoices or posting delays the target continues to be to move towards 9095 which would be in line with other government departments sharon reed head of strategic finance audit 27 february 2007 pic
