the president signed into law the fy1998 appropriations act for usda and related agencies pl 10586 hr 2160 on november 18 1997 the house and senate gave final approval to the 4955 billion measure on october 6 and 29 respectively two days after signing the bill the president exercised his lineitemveto authority by canceling funds for five agricultural research projects for total savings of 19 million congress has 30 calendar days to disapprove the cancellations once it returns in late january 1998 the fy1998 measure provides 36 billion less than the fy1997 act which is 28 billion below the administration request for fy1998 close to the houseinitially passed level of 4945 billion and nearly 1 billion below the senatepassed level most of the difference between fy1998 and fy1997 funding requirements is accounted for by lower funding needed for food and nutrition programs resulting from changes made by the 1996 welfare law among the major provisions in pl 10586 are new appropriation of 1886 million for sales commissions to private insurance companies participating in the federal crop insurance program full funding level was 2025 million 22 increase in funding for conservation operations compared with an administrationrequested increase of 165 over fy1997 funding and acreage enrollment in the conservation reserve program was unaffected 150 million cap on the nonappropriated export enhancement program which recognizes 159 million in savings for fy1998 an increase in spending above both the house and senateproposed levels for the rural development mission of usda albeit

appropriations budget authority 30 appropriations for fy1998 us department of agriculture most recent developments the president signed into law the fy1998 appropriations act for usda and related agencies pl 10586 hr 2160 on november 18 1997 the house and senate had given final approval to the 4955 billion measure on october 6 and 29 respectively two days after signing the bill the president exercised his lineitemveto authority on the measure by canceling funds for five agricultural research projects for total savings of 19 million in fy1998 budget authority congress has 30 calendar days to disapprove the cancellations once it returns in late january 1998 usda spending at glance the us department of agriculture usda carries out its widely varied responsibilities through approximately 30 separate internal agencies staffed by some 100000 employees usda is responsible for many activities outside of the agriculture budget function hence spending for usda is not synonymous with spending for farmers see figure 1 total usda outlays for fy1997 were just under 53 billion by far the largest outlay within the department 360 billion 67 of total outlays in fy1997 was for its food and nutrition programs primarily the food stamp program the costliest of all usda programs various child nutrition programs and the women infants and children wic program total fy1997 outlays also included 89 billion 12 for farm and foreign agricultural services within this mission area of usda are the programs funded through the commodity credit corporation eg commodity support payments the conservation reserve program and certain trade programs crop insurance farm loans and foreign food aid programs another 42 billion 8 was spent on an array of natural resource and environment programs nearly threefourths of which funds the forest service which is funded through the interior appropriations bill not the agriculture appropriations bill and the balance for number of conservation programs for farm producers usda programs for research and education 18 billion in outlays for fy1997 rural development 943 million marketing and regulatory activities 690 million meat and poultry inspection 574 million and departmental activities 306 million accounted for the balance of usda spending figure 1 mandatory vs discretionary spending approximately threefourths of total usda spending is classified as mandatory which by definition occurs outside the control of annual appropriations eligibility for mandatory programs is written into authorizing law and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law currently accounting for the vast majority of usda mandatory spending are the food stamp program and child nutrition programs the farm commodity price and income support programs the federal crop insurance program and the conservation reserve program crp although they have mandatory status the food and nutrition programs are funded by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs supplemental appropriations generally are made if and when these estimates fall short of required spending an annual appropriation is also made to reimburse the commodity credit corporation for losses it incurs in financing the commodity support programs historically the farm commodity price and income support programs were significant portion of the usda budget spending levels among these programs were erratic and unpredictable making total usda spending highly variable however this is expected to change in future years as result of the enactment of the 1996 farm bill which caps spending on direct payments to program crop producers the other 25 of the usda budget is for discretionary programs which are dependent upon funding in annual appropriations acts among the major discretionary programs within usda that are funded by the annual agriculture appropriations act are its rural development programs research and education programs agricultural credit the supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic the public law pl 480 international food aid program meat and poultry

2160 by voice vote the senate agreed to hr 2160 as amended on september 3 on nov 20 the president exercised his lineitemveto authority on five research projects congress has 30 days to vote on disapproval of the item vetoes once it returns in january the fy1998 appropriations act for usda and related agencies pl 10586 the fy1998 appropriations act pl 10586 for usda and related agencies was signed into law on november 18 1997 providing 4955 billion in budget authority for fy1998 this level is 36 billion less than fy1997 and 28 billion below the administration request for fy1998 in total budget authority in pl 10586 is close to the housepassed level of 4945 billion and is nearly 1 billion below the senatepassed level of the 4955 million made available in the fy1998 act 358 million is for mandatory programs 72 and 1375 billion for discretionary accounts see table 1 for history most of the difference between fy1998 and fy1997 funding is accounted for by lower funding needed for food and nutrition programs because of changes resulting from the 1996 welfare law the house and senate passed separate versions of fy1998 appropriations for usda and related agencies on july 24 1997 hr 2160 and s 1033 accounting for most of the 1 billion difference between the house and senatepassed versions was that the senate provided 900 million more than the house for food stamp contingency reserve conferees adopted the 100 million food stamp reserve in the housepassed bill two days after signing the bill the president exercised his lineitemveto authority on the measure by canceling funds for five agricultural research projects for total savings of 19 million congress has 30 calendar days to disapprove the cancellations if it chooses once it returns in late january 1998 see the section on agricultural research education and economics for more information on the line item vetoes floor efforts to eliminate federal subsidies for crop insurance coverage of tobacco and to reduce the federal reimbursement of delivery costs to private crop insurance companies were unsuccessful in both chambers similar efforts in the house to curb spending for sugar and peanuts were also defeated following is review of the major provisions of pl 10586 compared with the earlier house and senatepassed versions of the measure the fy1998 administration request and the fy1997 enacted level including supplementals commodity credit corporation outlays for the farm commodity programs and certain farm export programs and conservation programs are funded through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the ccc is revolving financing mechanism within usda through which it supports more than dozen specified commodities including grains cotton milk sugar peanuts and tobacco the formulas that determine payments under these programs are made by longterm farm legislation and benefits have to be provided to any participating producer the ccc also serves as funding mechanism for several usda export subsidy programs including the export enhancement program export credit guarantees and the market assistance program and for an array of conservation programs including the conservation reserve program the wetlands reserve program and the environmental qualities incentive program see agricultural trade and food aid and conservation below for more details on these programs in past years outlays of the ccc have been highly variable and tended to fluctuate based on crop market conditions the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 pl 104127 the 1996 farm bill replaced the program of making direct payments to participating producers when market prices fall below target level with predetermined and declining market transition payments to eligible producers over 7year period consequently ccc outlays are expected to be less variable in future years the administration estimates that ccc outlays will be 96 billion in fy1998 up 19 billion from fy1997 outlays of 77 billion because cccfunded programs are classified as mandatory spending they do not require appropriations to the ccc for annual program outlays instead the ccc borrows funds from the treasury to fund its operations however because ccc outstanding borrowing cannot exceed 30 billion the annual appropriations bill usually contains funding for reimbursement of ccc net realized losses so that the ccc can repay its debt to the treasury and not exhaust its borrowing authority hence the 784 million requested by usda for fy1998 and provided in pl 10586 is not reflection of what ccc spending is expected to be in fy1998 but instead is more reflection of ccc losses for fy1996 year in which outlays were relatively low because crop prices were strong although the farm commodity programs do not require an annual appropriation opponents of these programs frequently offer floor amendments to the appropriations bill in an attempt to effect changes in farm commodity policy separate amendments were offered and defeated when hr 2160 was first considered on the house floor that would have modified the authorizing statutes for the sugar and peanut price support programs also defeated on the house floor were amendments to eliminate the nonrecourse loan program for sugar and to reduce the price support level for peanuts from 610 per ton to 550 per ton senate floor amendment to increase the assessment on tobacco marketings from the current 1 rate to 21 in order to fund youth smoking program within fda was defeated on the senate floor crop insurance the federal crop insurance program is administered by usdas risk management agency current law requires usda to offer basically free catastrophic insurance to producers who grow an insurable crop this coverage pays producers 60 of the estimated market price of the commodity on losses in excess of 50 of normal crop production any producer who opts for catastrophic coverage has the opportunity to purchase additional insurance coverage at subsidized rate most policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurance companies that are reinsured by usda there are basically four sources of federal expenditures on the program usda absorbs large percentage of the program losses compensates the reinsured companies for portion of their delivery expenses subsidizes the premium paid by participating producers and pays the salaries and expenses of its administering agency within usda program losses and the premium subsidy are mandatory expenditures which are funded through usdas federal crop insurance fund because crop losses caused by natural disasters are impossible to predict outlays of the fund are difficult to budget hence the administration requests and the fy1998 appropriations act provides such sums as are necessary which usda estimates at 1584 billion the delivery expenses of the program and the salaries and expenses of usdas risk management agency are discretionary and require specific annual appropriation current law requires that the federal reimbursement to the insurance companies for their administrative expenses come from mandatory accounts until fy1998 usda estimated that an appropriation of 2025 million was required in fy1998 to reimburse companies at the current rate of 28 of premiums pl 10586 concurs with the house provision of 1886 million or approximately 27 reimbursement rate the senatepassed bill would have provided the full 2025 million required to fund the reimbursement at its current rate although the usda budget request contained request for full funding the administration did indicate plans to submit legislation to reduce the reimbursement rate to 245 to fund other risk management initiatives to date legislation has been submitted congress might consider legislation in 1998 that would convert the federal reimbursement to private companies to being mandatory expense however such move would require an equivalent offset from the crop insurance fund or some other mandatory account attempts to eliminate federally subsidized crop insurance for tobacco were defeated in the house appropriations committee and on the house and senate floors proponents of the amendment contend that the elimination of subsidies for tobacco growers is consistent with federal health initiatives to reduce tobacco consumption opponents say that it would unfairly penalize family farmers who are growing legal crop two separate floor amendments one to reduce the crop insurance reimbursement to private companies by 237 million to be transferred to wic and another to reduce the reimbursement by 10 million to be transferred to fda were both defeated on the house floor senate amendment to withhold 4 million of the reimbursement until usda implements plan to reduce the administrative and operating costs of private companies as required by the 1996 farm bill was adopted on the senate floor but was not included in the enacted version agricultural credit usda serves as lender of last resort for family farmers unable to obtain credit from commercial lender formerly through its farmers home administration but now through its farm service agency usda provides direct farm loans and also guarantees qualified loans from commercial lenders which are used to finance the purchase of farm real estate and help producers meet their operating expenses and to financially recover from natural disasters under budget rules adopted in 1990 federal agencies are required to estimate the cost of making direct or guaranteed loan and record that cost as budget outlay for the loan the cost of making loan is directly related to any interest rate subsidy provided by the government as well as projection of anticipated loan losses caused by farmer nonrepayment of the loans the fy1998 usda appropriations act continues the recent trend of focusing large portion of usdas farm loan resources toward loan guarantees rather than direct loans as requested by the administration pl 10586 concurs with the senate provision of 1024 million in loan subsidies which is nearly 5 million more than the administration request and 66 million more than the house level the fy1998 enacted funding level will support an estimated 294 billion in direct and guaranteed usda farm loans compared with 308 billion in fy1997 the administration request of 283 billion and the house level of 285 billion of the total loan authority provided in pl 10586 23 billion would be for guaranteed loans 19 billion in guaranteed farm operating loans and 400 million in guaranteed farm ownership loans the biggest difference between the house and senate versions of the measure with respect to farm credit was the amounts authorized for direct loans the enacted version like the senate version increases authority for direct farm ownership loans from the fy1997 level of 50 million to 60 million while the house version would have reduced authority to 31 million direct farm operating loans will remain at the fy1997 level of 495 million conservation pl 10586 provides 7899 million in budget authority for conservation programs administered by usdas natural resources conservation service nrcs this is an increase of more than 19 million from fy1997 but less than the 822 million requested by the administration major proposed changes by the administration would reflect implementation of the 1996 farm bill or changes in emphasis or priorities the housepassed version of hr 2160 rejected many of these proposals holding overall funding at 7594 million while the senatepassed version generally supported the proposals and provided 8256 million budget authority is provided for about 25 of all conservation funding the balance are mandatory programs funded through the ccc one major mandatory conservation program the conservation reserve program is administered by the farm service agency natural resources conservation service nrcs within nrcs the core conservation program and the primary source of technical assistance to producers and landowners is conservation operations co pl 10586 provides 633 million for conservation operations 23 million higher than the housepassed level but almost 100 million less than the senatepassed version the fy997 level had been 6197 million and the president had requested an increase of 103 million to 722 million the act earmarks funds for numerous activities the largest being the grazing lands initiative which would receive 15 million the conference committee report did not include the housepassed language prohibiting spending on three specified unauthorized initiatives but section 727 in the general provisions title of the final act prohibits reprogramming of funds for new activities without prior notification to both appropriations committees it also rejects the administration proposal to add watershed surveys and planning separate line item totalling 123 million in fy1997 into the co account the housepassed version which would have provided 610 million for co did not specify spending for technical assistance it identified three initiatives that would be prohibited from receiving further funding until justifications and reprogramming are approved by congress by contrast the senatepassed bill contained almost 730 million for co and the committee expected nrcs to spend at least 80 million to provide technical assistance in support of watershed activities committee reports from both chambers identified numerous earmarks pl 10586 also provides 101 million for watershed and flood prevention operations which supports construction of small watershed projects and places 50 million limit on funding for technical assistance so that more than half the funding would be spent on projects it provides 34 million for the resource conservation and development rcd program which provides planning and implementation funding in approved multicounty areas the conference committee called on nrcs to submit an operating report for the allocation of rcd funds within 30 days of enactment pl 10586 also provides 3 million to the outreach for socially disadvantaged farmers effort the administration budget for fy1998 had proposed reduction in the watershed and flood prevention program from 101 million to 40 million usda stated that this reduction would be largely offset by supplemental appropriations in fy1997 of 63 million for disaster assistance that was provided through the emergency watershed operations program as subsequently enacted in the fy1997 supplemental appropriations law pl 10518 this program received total of 166 million in fy1997 the housepassed bill not only rejected the administration proposal to reduce funding in the watershed and flood prevention program but also limited funding for technical assistance to 50 million the committee specified several projects it expects to continue also the house rejected the administration request to increase funding for the rcd program the senate appropriations committee adopted the administration level of 40 million for the watershed program while identifying numerous watershed projects on which it expects activity and also agreed to increase funding for the rcd program almost to the level proposed by the administration five other conservation programs administered by nrcs are funded as mandatory spending not subject to annual appropriations through the ccc as result of provisions in the 1996 farm bill under the administration request their overall program level would have grown from 343 million in fy1997 to 427 million in fy1998 the largest proposed increase was 45 million increase to 164 million for the wetlands reserve program to enroll 212000 acres under permanent and temporary easements and longterm agreements that protect and enhance wetland values other programs with administrationproposed increases in program levels were grants to states under the farmland protection program from 2 million in fy1997 to 18 million in fy1998 payments to producers receiving market transition payments under the conservation farm option from 2 million to 15 million and payments to farmers who implement approved plans under the wildlife habitat incentive program from 20 million to 30 million the program level for the environmental quality incentive program mandatory costsharing program which supports structural and land management practices will remain at 200 million congress did not address any of these programs farm service agency fsa conservation programs the fsa operates the largest conservation program the conservation reserve program crp under the crp landowners enter into contracts usually 10 years in duration to retire highly erodible and environmentally sensitive lands from production in return for annual payments and technical assistance crp was made mandatory program funded through the ccc in the 1996 farm bill the program level was estimated to grow from 1774 billion in fy1997 to 1903 billion in fy1998 while appropriated funding was estimated to decline from 83 million to 23 million appropriated funds have been used to pay certain program support costs the administration proposed that the crp claim future budget savings of 25 million annually if congress authorizes regular program for haying and grazing on crp acreage once every 3 years in return for 50 reduction in market transition payments in those years the conference agreement did not comment on the crp therefore separate legislation would be required to authorize the request however the house appropriations committee report expressed support for crp and called for more emphasis of partial field enrollments implementation of an enhancement program and report from the usda inspector general on the low acceptance rate for land bid into the crp during the most recent signup in washington state the senate bill and report did not comment on the crp two programs for responding to natural disasters the emergency conservation program and the flood risk reduction program received funding in pl 10586 the administration did not propose appropriations in its fy1998 request however the emergency conservation program received 70 million in the supplemental appropriations for fy1997 pl 10518 appropriations for the forest service another agency in usda are addressed with the other major federal land management agencies in the fy1998 interior appropriations act see crs report number 97206 appropriations for fy1998 interior and related agencies for more information for more information on usda conservation issues see crs issue brief 96030 soil and water conservation implementing the 1996 farm bill agricultural trade and food aid programs usda administers several programs that provide food aid overseas and promote exports of us agricultural commodities within usda the foreign agricultural service fas is primarily responsible for these programs although some foreign food aid programs are administered by the us agency for international development usaid the general sales manager in fas is responsible for administering food aid and export credit guarantee programs as well as the export enhancement program and the market access program both of which are not subject to annual appropriations for the most part pl 10586 maintains fy1998 funding for agricultural trade and food aid programs at enacted fy1997 levels the presidents budget for fy1998 had requested an estimated program level of 684 billion for fas pl 480 foreign food aid and ccc export credit guarantees that program level would have entailed budget authority of 1645 billion the spending measure for agriculture provides program level of 681 billion and budget authority of 172 billion the approximately 76 million difference in budget authority between the presidents request and the enacted level for fy1998 results from the spending measure providing 89 million more for pl 480 and 15 million less for fas than the president had requested the housepassed bill recommended program level of 6941 billion for these same programs and budget authority of 1719 billion the senate version recommended program level of 6969 billion with budget authority of 173 billion amendments were offered in both chambers to reduce or eliminate market access program map spending but none was passed since the conference does not address map spending will remain at 90 million the level authorized in the 1996 farm bill pl 10586 does cap the export enhancement program eep at 150 million the level recommended in the senate bill house appropriators had capped eep spending at 205 million while the president had requested the full amount authorized in the fair act 500 million cutting eep from the requested level to 150 million results in reductions in overall budget authority of 159 million this reduction shows up as scorekeeping adjustment at the bottom of table 3 at the end of this report map and eep are classified as mandatory spending programs and are not subject to annual appropriations foreign agricultural service fas fass primary aim is to maintain and expand foreign markets for us agricultural products the agency maintains worldwide agricultural intelligence and reporting service that reports and analyzes foreign agricultural production marketing and policies for the purposes of assisting us agricultural exporters in addition fas is responsible for carrying out us agricultural trade policy negotiating to reduce foreign agricultural trade barriers and implementing programs of international cooperation the fy1998 act provides 1313 million for fas with additional transfers of about 43 million the presidents fy1998 budget called for an fas program level of 1509 million1465 million in directly appropriated funds and 34 million in transfers from other usda programs fass budget includes funds to support agricultural export market development and promotion which includes approximately 28 million in funding for the foreign market development or cooperator program fmdp fass appropriation is identical to the house passed provision and the level made available in fy1997 public law 480 or food for peace pl 480 provides longterm concessional sales of food title i through direct loans humanitarian commodity donations title ii and grant food aid for development to lowincome developing countries title iii title i is administered by usda titles ii and iii are administered by usaid pl 10586 provides program level of 1112 billion for all of pl 480 and budget authority of 1063 billion title i increases slightly while titles ii and iii remain essentially at the 1997 levels the administration had requested budget authority of 967 million to support pl 480 program level of 990 million for pl 480 in fy1998 which is 117 million less than the fy1997 enacted program level all of this reduction would have come from title i according to usda estimates reduced fy1998 funding for pl 480 would support the same volume of commodities made available in fy1997 32 million metric tons the housepassed bill however maintained pl 480 funding at essentially the same level as in fy1997 fy1998 appropriations for pl 480 title i would be only 3 million less than fy1997 while titles ii and iii would be kept at about the fy1997 level pl 10586 contains senatepassed amendment that bans provision of us food aid to north korea unless provided through the humanitarian assistance programs of the world food program and other nongovernmental entities food for progress this program provides commodities to governments private voluntary agencies nonprofit agricultural organizations cooperatives or intergovernmental organizations for use in developing countries and emerging democracies committed to introducing and expanding free enterprise food for progress can use title i funds to procure commodities and pay transport costs it can use commodities if any in ccc inventories under section 416b of the agricultural act of 1949 or it can use ccc funds to procure and ship commodities when section 416b commodities are unavailable the presidents budget assumes that 103 million73 million for commodities and 30 million for noncommodity costswill be used for food for progress in fy1998 the program level for fy1997 was 113 million pl 10586 makes recommendation as to the level of funding for food for progress ccc export credit guarantees these programs provide ccc guarantees for the repayment of commercial loans to finance the sale of us agricultural exports to developing and middleincome countries that are short on foreign exchange the enacted fy1998 spending measure like the house and senatepassed versions provides the full amount57 billionrequested by the administration for export credit guarantees this is the full amount authorized in the 1996 farm bill of this amount 200 million is to be allocated to countries classed as emerging markets as part of the additional 1 billion in export credit guarantees for these countries mandated by the farm bill the legislation provides 5275 million to cover loan subsidies and 3820 million to covers administrative expenses of the export credit guarantee programs export credit guarantees are covered by the federal credit reform act of 1990 which established ccc export loan program account appropriations to this account are used to cover lifetime subsidy costs associated with the loan guarantees as well as administrative expenses market access program map map previously the market promotion program funds market development and market promotion efforts on costsharing basis of nonprofit agricultural trade organizations state and regional trade groups and private companies the 1996 farm bill prohibits providing direct assistance to foreign firms and to any firm that does not qualify as small business under the small business act the administration estimates program level of 90 million for map in fy1998 the maximum authorized by the farm bill map is popular in the agricultural community but the program was targeted for elimination as corporate welfare by coalition that includes certain members of congress consumer groups and policy groups amendments proposing either to eliminate or cut map funding were defeated when fy1998 appropriations were debated

agricultural export and food aid programs rural development the fy1998 agriculture appropriations act provides 2088 billion to support wide array of rural development programs administered by usda this amount is greater than what would have been provided in the house and senatepassed bills by 47 million and 9 million respectively rural development funding in pl 10586 is also 84 million more than in fy1997 but 925 million below the administrations fy1998 request the fy1998 act provides 652 million for the rural community advancement program relatively new block grant program it also provides 541 million in rural rental assistance 45 million for rural housing assistance grants 4 billion under the rural housing insurance fund 7 million for the alternate agricultural research and commercialization aarc revolving fund and 12 million for the distance learning and medical link program rural community advancement program rcap the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 pl 104127 authorized the establishment of the rural community advancement program rcap which consolidated twelve existing programs two of which were newly authorized by the act into three funding streams housing and community facilities water and waste disposal and business and cooperative assistance in addition it gives each states rural development director the authority to transfer up to 25 of states funding among the three categories of assistance but limits the amount that may be transferred nationally from any one of the three categories to 10 further the act mandates the establishment of stateadministered rural development block grants under the act state governments may receive 5 of the rcap funds to administer directly an additional 5 is available to states on 2 to 1 matching fund basis pl 10586 appropriates 652 million for rcap activities this is 8 million more than the 644 million proposed by the senate and 37 million less than the 689 million requested by the administration the housepassed version of the appropriation bill did not provide funds for rcap but sought to appropriate funding for its activities under three separate accounts rural businesscooperative assistance programs rural housing assistance programs and rural utility assistance programs see sections below pl 10586 allocates the 652 million in fy1998 funding 37 million below the administration request among the three funding streams as follows 5772 million for water and waste disposal assistance compared with the administration request for 608 million and the senate level of 568 million 27 million for community facilities and housing assistance compared with 30 million in the administration request and senatepassed bill and 48 million for assistance to businesses and cooperatives which concurs with the senate level and is 2 million below the administration request in addition the act earmarks certain portion of these funds for colonias 20 million from water and waste disposal assistance technical assistance 15 million from water and waste disposal assistance technical assistance for rural transportation in connection with economic development projects 500000 rural business and cooperative assistance rural empowerment zones and enterprise communities 20 million technical assistance for water projects administered by national organization under the circuit rider program 5 million from water and waste disposal account and rural alaskan native villages 15 million from water and waste disposal account the act transfers all unobligated and obligated balances for the following programs from prior years into the rcap account rural water and waste disposal grants rural water and waste disposal loans emergency community water assistance grants solid waste management grants community facilities grants community facilities loans rural business enterprise grants rural business and industry loans program and local technical assistance and planning grants rural housing service rhs the rhs is one of three services under the jurisdiction of the usdas under secretary for rural development the mission of the rhs is to assist rural residents and communities to obtain adequate and affordable housing and access to needed community facilities the rhs programs include grants and loans for rental housing assistance and mutual and selfhelp housing pl 10586 provides 4 billion in direct and guaranteed loan authority for section 502 very low to moderate income housing loans borrowers 30 million for section 504 housing repair loans 20 million for section 538 guaranteed multifamily housing loans 15 million for section 514 farm labor housing 129 million for section 515 rental housing 600000 for site loans 587 million for selfhelp housing land development loans and 25 million for credit sales of acquired property the act also extends the life of section 515 multifamily housing loans from 30 to 50 years and allows the restructuring of section 515 loan repayments based on 50year amortization schedule the fy1998 appropriations act provides total subsidy level of 226 million for the rural housing insurance fund program account which supports an estimated loan program level of 4219 billion the house proposed subsidy level of 219 million supporting loan activity level of 4169 billion the senate proposed subsidy level of 224 million supporting loan activity level of 35 billion in addition the act appropriates 541 million in rental assistance as proposed by the senate this is 47 million more than proposed by the house the conferees also agreed to provide 2 million for rural community fire protection grants as proposed by the house the senate recommended 13 million funding level pl 10586 establishes 541 million funding level for rural housing assistance this is the same amount proposed by the senate and 47 million more than the 493 million requested by the house the administration requested 1305 billion in budget authority for rhs for fy1998 an 87 million increase over fy1997 housepassed version of the usda appropriations act would have made available 1241 billion for rhs activities 64 million less than requested by the administration the senatepassed version of the bill would have provided 1252 billion for rhs activities 36 million above fy1997 also the senatepassed bill would have supported an rhs loan authorization level totalling 352 billion which is 680 million less than requested by the administration and 630 million less than the house bill rural businesscooperative service rbcs this is the second of three services under the jurisdiction of the under secretary for rural development the mission of the rbcs is to promote economic development and job creation in rural areas the fy1998 appropriations act provides 17 million in loan subsidy level for the rural development loan fund this is the same amount proposed by the house and less than the 192 million proposed by the senate in addition the act appropriates about 6 million for the cost of rural economic development loans the earlier housepassed version of the bill would have appropriated 1004 million for rbcs activities for fy1998 this is 395 million more than requested by the administration 36 million more than included in the senate bill and 44 millon less than appropriated in fy1997 most of the difference between the house bill the administration request and the senate bill is because the administration and the senate bill proposed shifting funds for the rural businesscooperative assistance program to the rural community advancement program alternative agricultural research and commercialization corporation aarc the aarc which is within the rural businesscooperative service makes equity investment in rural businesses developing alternative nonfood nonfeed uses for agricultural and forestry materials and animal byproducts pl 10586 appropriates 7 million for aarc revolving fund activities the administration budget request and the senate bill proposed funding level of 10 million for fy1998 3 million more than what was appropriated for fy1997 the housepassed bill did not provide fy1998 funding for aarc activities the house report language encouraged the corporation to fund its fy1998 operations with repayments to its revolving fund as intended by congress when the program was authorized rural utilities service rus this is the third of the three divisions under the jurisdiction of the under secretary for rural development the rus administers electric and telephone programs of the former rural electrification administration and water and waste disposal programs of the former rural development administration pl 10586 funds most rus activities under the rcap program rusrelated rcap activities total 577 million in the conference agreement the president had requested 1257 million for rus programs 555 million below fy1997 primarily because the administration shifted water and waste loans and grants to the rural community advancement program rcap the senate bill concurred with this shift and provided 117 million for rus for fy1998 the housepassed bill provided 6985 million to the rus because the bill did not concur with the funding request for rcap and instead proposed funding most of the rcap programs under the rural utilities assistance program under rus the act provides total subsidy level of 36 million for rural electrification and telecommunications loans program account 4 million more than the 32 million proposed by the house and approximately 1 million less than the 35 million proposed by the administration distance learning and medical link dlml the distance learning and medical link program within rus is designed to provide incentives to improve the quality of phone services and to provide rural hospitals and schools access to advanced telecommunications services and computer networks the act appropriates 125 million for the dlml program 5 million more than fy1997 but 84 million below the administration request the funds can be used for grants or loans house report language urged usda to give careful consideration to education and training uses of the funds including the training of those moving from welfare to the work force distance learning and medical link funds would continue to be administered by the rus food and nutrition programs the fy1998 agricultural appropriations act pl 10586 provides total of 372 billion for food and nutrition programs in fy1998 this level is approximately the same as that recommended by the house is 923 million less than the original senate proposal and is 26 billion less than the administration request most of the difference lies with the final law provision for food stamp contingency reserve of 100 million as recommended in the house bill instead of the 1 billion proposed by the senate and the 25 billion requested by the administration the total amounts requested by the administration and congress and contained in the final version of pl 10586 are less than the amount appropriated for these programs in fy1997 originally estimated at 405 billion this is because pl 10586 reflects the first full fiscal year of savings from food stamp and child nutrition program reductions made by the 1996 welfare reform law and better economic conditions major policy changes were envisioned by the amounts contained in the final law despite the fact that the congress approved and the president signed budget reconciliation measure on august 5 1998 that contains changes to the food stamp program that are expected to increase that programs fy1998 costs food stamps pl 10586 provides 2514 billion in budget authority for the food stamps program and for nutrition assistance for puerto rico this is 24 billion less than the administration request of 2755 billion the same amount proposed by the housepassed bill and about 960 million less than the 261 billion proposed in the senatepassed bill the administration request included proposed 25 billion contingency reserve fund for food stamps the house bill provided 100 million contingency reserve the amount provided for fy1997 and in the finally approved bill the senate bill proposed 1 billion contingency reserve an amendment proposing to increase the fy1998 food stamp appropriation by 25 billion was withdrawn during house floor debate the balanced budget measure signed by the president on august 5 1997 contains changes to the food stamp program that accommodate an agreement between the white house and republican congressional leaders to provide an additional 15 billion in spending for the program over the next 5 years intended to moderate some of the 233 billion in net reductions through fy2002 in food stamp spending enacted under last years welfare law the budget law makes changes primarily to provisions affecting eligibilitywork requirements for ablebodied nonelderly persons without dependents cbo estimates that the changes will increase food stamp spending by 211 million in fy1998 which could mean higher spending for the program in fy1998 than is provided for in the appropriations law greater than anticipated participation declines in the food stamp program in fy1997 however suggest that original estimates of spending for the program in fy1998 may be overstated this may provide enough of cushion so that the amount provided in the appropriations act which is based on these estimates would be sufficient to cover the additional cost of the budget agreement wic and child nutrition major changes were contained in the administration budget and congressional appropriations for wic and child nutrition programs combined funding recommended for child nutrition programs for fy1998 777 billion is much lower than fy1997 spending 865 billion primarily because of the cuts made to the child and adult care food and summer food programs by the 1996 welfare law an amendment proposing to restore funding that was eliminated in 1996 for school breakfast startup grants was defeated during floor consideration of the senate appropriation measure s 1033 an amendment offered during house floor debate on hr 2160 to increase wic funding by 24 million by reducing funds for crop insurance commissions also was defeated pl 10586 adopted the houseproposed appropriation of 3924 billion for the wic program for fy1998 it also contained the house provisions prohibiting any wic or other child nutrition program funding from being used for studies and evaluations the final law amount for wic is an increase of 1182 million above fy1997 wic funding and 184 million less than the administration request congressional appropriators expect that the final wic funding will maintain fy1998 program participation at the fy1997 monthly average level of 74 million participants for fy1998 the administration proposed to fully fund wic at level of just over 41 billion this was estimated to provide service to the 745 million women infants and children the administration projects are eligible and likely to participate if full funding were provided the administration request included 100 million contingency reserve fund in case unexpected costs or overly optimistic economic assumptions require more funding than originally anticipated as happened in fy1997 neither the house nor senatepassed appropriations measures approved this reserve up to 12 million of the fy1998 wic appropriation may be used to carry out the wic farmers market nutrition program for fy1997 the administration requested supplemental appropriation for wic because of an unexpected shortage of funding due to higher than expected participation and food cost increases an increase of 76 million was approved in the fy1997 supplemental appropriations act pl 10518 the final appropriation split the difference in the total amounts recommended by house and senate bills for child nutrition programs ie school lunch school breakfast child and adult care food summer food etc it provides total of 7768 billion instead of the 7767 billion proposed by the house and 7769 billion proposed by the senate the 3 million provided by the senate and recommended by the administration for nutrition studies and surveys was dropped in the conference agreement both the house and senatepassed bills funded the center for nutrition policy promotion at 22 million the fy1997 level instead of the 25 million requested by the administration and both provided this funding under food program administration instead of the separate appropriations account requested the house bill provided 5 million for nutrition education and training net grants 125 million more than fy1997 and 5 million less than the administration request explicit funding for net was provided in the senate bill but 4 million of the 10 million it provided for the school meals initiative was set aside for education and training activities the final law provided 375 million for net the school meals initiative was funded at 8 million roughly between the 59 million recommended by the house and the 10 million recommended by the senate bill commodity donation programs the administration proposed that funding for the elderly nutrition program and pacific island commodity program be consolidated with that provided for the emergency food assistance and soup kitchenfood bank program efap and for the commodity supplemental food program csfp total recommended spending for these five commodity assistance programs cap would have been 2722 million under the administration request or 351 million less than the 3073 million total appropriated for them in fy1997 the senate and housepassed bills provided between 18 and 19 million more respectively than the administration for these five programs 2898 million and 291 million respectively for fy1998 however neither the house nor senate approved merging the elderly nutrition and pacific island programs with the others the final law provides total of 2822 million for the 5 programs 141 million for the commodity assistance program which contains efap and the csfp and 1412 million for food donations for selected groups which contains the elderly nutrition program pl 10586 provides 140 million for the elderly nutrition commodity program in fy1998 the same amount recommended by the administration and contained in the house and senatereported bills house floor amendment raised this amount to 145 million but this was deleted during conference deliberations the total appropriation requested by the administration for efap soup kitchens and the commodity supplemental food program csfp for fy1998 without elderly commodities and pacific island programs was 131 million this is 35 million less than the amount appropriated for these programs in fy1997 the house and senatepassed bills provided 141 and 1486 million respectively for these three programs the finally enacted bill adopted the house proposal 141 million and contains specific language specifying that cap funds used for efap be used only for the administrative costs of the program and not for any commodity purchases this concurs with the administration proposal to end discretionary federal spending 45 million in fy1997 to buy commodities for efap and soup kitchens in fy1998 the final law makes room for 45 million in cap discretionary funding the same as in fy1997 for grants to states to help with costs of transporting storing and distributing commodities commodity support for efap and soup kitchens will come solely from the 100 million in food stamp appropriations required by food stamp law to be used to buy commodities for efapsoup kitchens 1 assuming 45 million of the amount appropriated for the cap is allocated for efap administrative grants and this is not required the remainder 96 million of the 141 million 1 fy1997 supplemental appropriations pl10518 cut 20 million from the 100 million in mandatory spending appropriated to the food stamp program to buy commodities for efap in fy1997 to help offset some of that legislations additional funding for other programs eg wic and flood relief for farmers the fy1998 appropriation law does not alter the 100 million mandatory spending from food stamp funds to buy commodities for efap and soup kitchens appropriated will go to the csfp to provide monthly food packages consisting of usda commodities to needy mothers children and elderly persons this is 10 million more than the amount requested by the administration for the csfp 20 million more than fy1997 appropriations and about 4 million more than the total actually available to the program last year because of carryovers from previous year funds for more information on

research education and economics the fy1998 agricultural appropriations act provides total of nearly 19 billion to fund usdas research education and economics ree agencies in fy1998 this amount is 60 million above the original housepassed bill and 41 million above the senatepassed bill the administration had requested 1800 billion in budget authority for the ree mission area four agencies carry out usdas ree function the departments inhouse research agency is the agricultural research service ars which provides scientific support to usdas action and regulatory agencies and conducts long term high risk basic and applied research on subjects of national and regional importance the cooperative state research education and extension service csrees is usdas liaison with statelevel research education and extension programs ars csrees the economic research service ers and the national agricultural statistics service nass are under the under secretary for research education and economics ree agricultural research service ars pl 10586 provides total of 8252 million in budget authority for ars for fy1998 compared to 784 million in the house passed appropriations bill and 8071 million in the senatepassed bill the administration had requested 786 million for the agency the same as arss appropriation for the fy1997 of the 8252 million in the bill 7446 million is for arss research activities an increase of 278 million above fy1997 and 806 million is for the repair and modernization of buildings and facilities an increase of 115 million above fy1997 the administration had proposed terminating 72 research projects and redirecting 23 million to other research areas the act concurs with terminating 10 projects and achieving management reductions for total savings of 31 million dollars that ars can direct to other priority research areas the conferees adopted measure in conference that will provide 420000 from within the ars budget for the national academy of sciences to study the scientific and organizational benefits and drawbacks of potential independent food safety agency cooperative state research education and extension service csrees pl10586 provides 8548 million in budget authority for the research education and extension programs carried out by the states in cooperation with usda although this represents reduction from the overall fy1997 level of 9094 million the reduction is the result of zeroing out of funding for new research facility construction on land grant university campuses 616 million in fy1997 not reduction in funds for research the funding directed to state research programs is actually increased by 10 million over the current level of 4215 million however the act does reduce overall csrees funding to the states for extension activities by close to 1 from 4263 million in fy1997 to 4234 million these reductions are in extensions special programs however the act maintains formula funds to the states under the smithlever act for extensions core programs and under the hatch act of 1887 for research at fy1997 levels of 1687 million and 2685 million respectively pl 10586 provides 972 million for the national research initiative competitive grants program nri which is less than either the house or senate bills called for 1057 million and 100 million respectively but 3 million more than the fy1997 level the conferees provided 511 million for special research grants grants earmarked for research projects at specific land grant universities the administration had requested 10 million for special research grants the house and senate bills had provided 32 million and 475 million respectively the fy1997 funding for special grants is 498 million the conference agreement provides level funding 59 million for the expanded food and nutrition education program of the cooperative extension service the conferees made slight reductions in extensions family and youth food safety pest management and pesticide applicator training programs under the 3d section of the smithlever act but continued funding all except for two projects in indiana and nebraska the administration had requested slight increases in these programs but neither the house nor the senate had concurred in their respective bills the administration requested termination of funding for the renewable resources extension act an extension forest management education program for private foresters but the conference agreement continues the program at the fy1997 level of 32 million economic research service ers and national agricultural statistics service nass the final fy1998 agriculture appropriations act provides 716 million for ers in keeping with the house proposal to include in the ers appropriation an additional 185 million that permits the agency to assume responsibility for all usda economic research and analysis of food programs and food policy issues the increase also is intended to enhance erss role in helping usda implement the government performance and results act of 1993 the administrations fy1998 budget request had proposed 1 million increase in budget authority for ers for total of 54 million and the senate bill would have maintained funding at the fy1997 level of 531 million the act provides 118 million for nass in keeping with provision in the senate spending bill this level represents an 18 million increase over the fy1997 level up to 363 million of the total amount is to be used to conduct the census of agriculture which was administratively transferred from the department of commerce to usda in 1996 the act also includes language giving usda the authority to conduct the 1997 census of agriculture provision in the house bill that would have reduced nass funding by 15 million to fund the departments civil rights enforcement efforts was not adopted in the final bill line item vetoes on november 20 president clinton submitted to congress list of items that he vetoed in the fy1998 agriculture appropriations act using the new authority under the line item veto act of 1996 pl 104130 all five of the vetoed items pertain to agricultural research congress has 30 calendar days to disapprove the cancellations if it chooses once it returns in late january the president called for the cancellation of two ars construction projects biocontrol and insect rearing laboratory in stoneville mississippi and poisonous plant laboratory in logan utah these projects would renovate or replace existing ars facilities the cancellations would result in 15 million reduction in arss budget authority for buildings and facilities in fy1998 out of 806 million total the presidents rationale for vetoing funds for these two projects is that 1 the administration did not request them in the fy1998 budget 2 the projects would require additional funding for completion and 3 new construction projects should be held in abeyance until the completion of strategic plan encompassing all federally funded agricultural research facilities congress authorized the preparation of the strategic plan which is due in april 1999 in the 1996 farm act under the csrees budget the president vetoed three special research grants totalling 440000 one centered in alaska and the other two in ohio the rationale for the cancellations is that 1 the administration did not request them in the fy1998 budget 2 there are higher priority research areas in need of funding and 3 the land grant universities at which these projects would be conducted could support them with hatch act formula or other funds for further information see issue brief 97032 agricultural research education and extension issues in the 105th congress meat and poultry inspection usdas food safety and inspection service fsis is responsible for the mandatory inspection of most meat poultry and egg products to ensure their safety wholesomeness and proper labeling in the 105th congress how to pay for inspection is key issue usda and the industry are now implementing sweeping new rules to reduce pathogens in meat and poultry products which supplement rather than replace existing inspection procedures this has placed new funding demands on an already strained fsis budget in its fy1998 budget request the administration had called for industry to pay an additional 390 million in user fees to cover greater proportion of the costs of federal inspection however neither the house nor the senate spending bill adopted the proposal and it was not contained in the final fy1998 appropriations act the new fees would have covered the cost of all fsis inplant inspectors currently only some overtime inspection costs are covered by plants rather than taxpayers if adopted analysts estimated that industry would have been paying about 70 of the total cost of the entire inspection system pl 10586 provides 5893 million for fsis activities in fy1998 in keeping with the housepassed spending bill the senate bill would have provided 5906 million this amount is above the fy1997 level of 574 million and just below the administration request for 5912 million the act also contains provision in the original housepassed bill to withhold 5 million of fsiss fy1998 appropriation until usda issues final rule governing the storage and transportation of shell eggs which congress had first requested back in 1991 the senate bill mandated fsis to promulgate regulations on the storage and transportation of shell eggs by december 31 1997 but would not have withheld funds the appropriations act does not include the administrations request for nearly 2 million for pilot projects aimed at tracing and controlling the source of foodborne illness back to the farm level the house appropriations committee maintained that aphis rather than fsis is the appropriate agency to conduct such projects senate bill language opposed any food safety requirements being imposed at the farm level an amendment to the house bill adopted in full committee would have shifted 446000 from fsis to the office of the under secretary for food safety which oversees one agency fsis and had been vacant for nearly 3 years until the undersecretary position was filled this fall the senate bill concurred with the house in providing 446000 to fund the office but directed it to come from new appropriations rather than from the fsis budget pl 10586 contains the senate provision for more information see crs issue brief 95062 meat and poultry inspection issues marketing and regulatory programs the mission of usda marketing and regulatory programs administered by three agencies the agricultural marketing service ams the animal and plant health inspection service aphis and the grain inspection packers and stockyards administration gipsa are to facilitate the domestic and international marketing of us agricultural products and to ensure the health and care of animals and plants while improving market competitiveness and the economy for the overall benefit of both consumers and american agriculture according to usda animal and plant health inspection service aphis aphis spending accounts for most of the marketing and regulatory program budget the fy1998 agriculture appropriations act provides 4263 million in funding for aphiss programs and another 42 million for the construction and repair of aphis buildings and facilities 4305 in total the agency also is authorized to use 88 million of the revenue derived from user fees to help cover the costs of its agricultural quarantine and inspection programs at us airports and ports of entry the user fee provision is in keeping with the housepassed spending bill the senate bill concurred with the administrations request for authority to use 100 million of the user fee account the actual 88 million user fee authorization is 10 million below the fy1997 level pl 10586 contains language giving broad authority to aphis to collect user fees for providing technical assistance goods or services as long as such fees are reasonably based on the services aphis is providing the act does not specify for which programs the agency may use this authority the presidents budget request had proposed 10 million increase in mandatory cost sharing through user fees for animal welfare biotechnology regulation the animal damage control program and other selected aphis programs the conferees statement directs aphis to continue its efforts to maximize cost sharing in all states to the extent possible but states that differing circumstances among states make rigid cost sharing requirement unfeasible however the final bill does include provision requiring aphis to obtain at least 40 matching funds for administering brucellosis eradication programs in the current fiscal year the act contains 267 million same as the fy1997 level for aphis agricultural quarantine and inspection aqi activities at the mexican and canadian borders hawaii and puerto rico the presidents budget had proposed 13 million increase to 278 million for this purpose the administration also had requested 5 million increase in funding for total of 9 million for the agencys pest detection activities but the act provides 21 million increase in this area for total of 63 million agricultural marketing service ams the fy1998 appropriations act provides total of 585 million in fy1998 budget authority for ams of this 466 million is budget authority for the agencys marketing services the administration had proposed 497 million and the house and senate spending measures would have provided 456 million and 496 million respectively the balance of the 585 total consists of 107 million in budget authority for ams programs to strengthen markets income and supply and 12 million for payments to states for program administration the act contains senate report language directing that 1 million be provided for ams marketing assistance to alaska grain inspection packers and stockyards administration gipsa pl 105 86 provides 24 million in budget authority for gipsa which is the same as contained in the original housepassed version slightly higher than the senate level of 235 million and 18 million lower than the administrations request this along with an anticipated 43 million in user fees would bring the agencys program level to 66 million in fy1998 about the same as fy1997 and about 3 million less than proposed by the administration senate provision to provide additional funds for study of meat packer competition and industry structure was not included in the final act food and drug administration pl 10586 includes total appropriation of 9251 million for fy1998 to fund the programs of the food and drug administration fda salaries and expenses are funded at 8575 million including two special initiatives 34 million to fully fund outreach and enforcement activities to implement the august 1996 rule on the regulation of nicotine containing tobacco products and 24 million for fdas portion of the presidents food safety initiative in addition the law allows fda to collect 912 million in user fees under the prescription drug user fee act pdufa and 14 million under the mammography quality standards act mqsa for certification that mammography facilities and equipment comply with national quality and safety standards it also authorizes 75 million to be collected in fees for the certification of exports after the appropriation act became law president clinton signed the food and drug administration modernization act pl 105115 s 830 on nov 21 1997 this act contained reauthorization of the pdufa program for five years and authorized fda to collect 1068 million in fees for fy 1998 under pdufa fda charges pharmaceutical companies user fees to supplement existing appropriations the act requires that congress annually approve the total collection levels for this program in its appropriations bill the fy1998 appropriations act requires fda to submit detailed operating plan for fy 1998 to the appropriations committees later than 30 days after enactment which will include proposal for expenditure of available funds by each center and for other related activities the act requires this operating plan to compare proposed funding levels to the initial fy1998 budget request and fy1997 current
