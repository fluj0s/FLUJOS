i speak not of them being to all intents and purposes new laws made pro re nata 1 and by means anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98882crs2 confusion of impeachment and conviction with the passage of bill of attainder impeachment and trial was judicial process in which the house of commons voted impeachment which it then presented to the house of lords for trial the process was completed upon action by the lords the passage of bill of attainder on the other hand was legislative process that required passage by both houses and the approval of the king some would contend that the seventeenth centu ry practices of the house of commons linked the two and makes them the possible subjec t to confusion during that period the commons having impeached an individual on evidence they feared the lords might find insufficient for criminal conviction on the imp eachment would switch to bill of attainder to punish pro re nata the individual whom it had impeached the lords for their part would punish an individual by an act of legisl ative discretion for conduct that as judges they could not call crime cf roberts the law of impeachment in stuart england reply to raoul berger 84 yale law journal 1419

treason or othe r misdemeanors in the lords house have been frequently in practice notwithstanding the stat ute of 1 h4 and are neither within the words nor intent of that statute for it is presen

for capital offenseexecution of such as are already in bein g but an impeachment before the lords of the commons of great britain in par liament is prosecution of the already known and established law and has been frequently put in practice being present to the most high and supreme court of criminal jurisdiction by the most solemn grand inquest of the whole kingdom2 commoner cannot however be impeached before the lords for an capital offence but only for high misdemesnors3 peer may be impeached for any crime iv b lackstone commentaries on the laws of england 256 1769 transliteration suppliedoriginal footnotes in brackets although the phrase had apparently become fairly common in impeachment cases by then blackstone makes reference to the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors he does nevertheless provide detailed outline of the classification of crimes in his day we are now arrived at the fourth and last branch of these commentaries which treats of public wrongs or crimes and misdemesnors for we may remember that in the beginning of the preceding volume wrongs were divided into two sorts or species the one private and the other public private wrongs which are frequently termed civil injuri were the subject of that entire book we are now therefore lastly to proceed to the consideration of public wrongs or crimes and misdemesnors i d at 1 crime or misdemesnor is an act committed or omitted in violation of public law either forbidding or commanding it this general definition comprehends both crimes nd misdemesnors which properly speaking are mere synonymous terms though in comm on usage the word crimes is made to denote such offences as are of deep er and more atrocious dye while smallerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98882crs3 4 praemunire refers to the statutory ban on s eeking to invoke papal authority to resolve dispute touching upon the king hi s authority or his realm it draws its name from the first line of the writ used to enforce it praemunire facias ab quod sit coram nobis the writ instructed the sheriff to see to it facias that named i ndividual ab was forewarned praemunire of the individuals obligation to ppear before the court to answer charges that the individual had shown contempt for the kings prerogatives by invoking forbidden papal authority in some matter touching upon the interests of the king 4 b lackstone s commentaries 10218faults and omissions of less consequence are comp rised under the gentler name of misdemesnors only the distinction of public wrong s from private of crimes and misdemesnors from civil injuries seems principally to consist in this that private wrongs or civil injuries are an infringement or privation of the civil rights which belong to individuals c onsidered merely as individuals public wrongs or crimes and misde mesnors are breach and violation of the public rights and duties due to the whole community considered as community in its social aggregate capacity t reason murder and robbery are properly ranked among crimes since besides the in jury done to individuals they strike at the very being of society which cannot possibly subsist where actions of this sort are suffered to escape with impunity in all cases the crimes include an injury every public offence is also private wrong and somewhat more it affects the individual and it likewise affects the community id at 5 the third general division of crime s after offenses against god and offenses against the law of nations consis ts of such as more especially affect the supreme executive power or the king and his government which amount either to total renunciati on of that allegiance or at the least to criminal neglect of that duty which is due from ev ery subject to his sovereign every offence therefore more immediately ffecting the royal person his crown or dignity is in some degree breach of this duty of allegiance whether natural and innate or local and ac quired by residence and th may be distinguished into four kinds 1 treason 2 felonies in jurious to the kings prerogative 3 praemunire 4 4 other misprisions and contempts treason imports betraying treachery or breach of faith it therefore happens only between allies faith the mirror for treason is indeed general appellation made use of by the law to denote not only offences against the king and government but also that accumula tion of guilt which arises whenever superior reposes confidence in s ubject or inferior between whom and himself there subsists natural civil or even spiritual relation and the inferior so abuses that confidence so forgets the obligations of duty subjection and allegiance as to destroy the life of any such his superior or lord id at 74 5 felony in the general acceptation of our english law comprizes every species of crime which occasioned at common law the forfeiture of lands or goods this most frequently happens in those crimes for which capital punishment either is or was liable to be inflicted treason itself was antiently comprised under the name of felony id at 94httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98882crs4 the fourth species of offences more immediately against the king and government are intitled misprisions and contempts misprisions term derived from the old french mespris neglect or contempt are in the acceptation of our law generally unders tood to be all such high offences as are under the degree of capital but nearly bordering thereon and it is said that misprision is contained in every treason and felony whatsoever misprisions are genera lly divided into two sorts negative which consist in the concealment of something which ought to be revealed and positive which consist in the commission of something which ought not to be done of the first or negative kind is what is called misprision of treason consisting in the bare knowledge and concealment of treason without any degree of assent thereto id at 11920 misprisions which are merely positive are generally denominated contempts or high misdemesnors of which the first and principal is the maladministration of such high offices as are in public trust and employment th is is usually punished by the method of parliamentary impeachment wherein ch penalties short of death are inflicted as to the wisdom of the house of peers shall seem proper consisting usually of banishment imprisonment fines or perpetual disability id at 121 lastly to endeavor to dissuade witness from giving evidence to disclose an examination before the pr ivy council or to dvise prisoner to stand mute all of which are impediments to justice are high misprisions and contempts of the kings courts and punish able by fine and imprisonment the order of our distribution will next lead us to take into consideration such crimes and misdemesnors as more especially affect the commonwealth or public polity of the kingdom the crimes and misdemesnors that more especially affect the common wealth may be divided into five species viz offences against public justice against the public peace against public trade against public health and against the public police or oeconomy of each of which we will take cursory view in their order first then of the offences against public justice some of which are felonious whose punishment may extend to death others only misdemesnors i shall begin with those that are most pena l and descend gradually to such as are of less malignity id at 12628 16 the next offence against public ju stice is when the suit is past its commencement and come to trial and that is the crime of wilful and corrupt perjury which is defined by sir edward coke to be crime committed when lawful oath is administered in some judicial proceeding to person who swears wilfully absolutely and falsely in matter material to the issue or point in question subornation of perjury is the offen ce of procuring another to take such false oath as constitutes pe rjury in the principal the punishment of perjury and subornation at common law has been various it was antiently death afterwards banishment or cutting out the tongue and then forfeiture ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98882crs5 5 wooddeson gave series of highly regarded well attended and widely publicized lectures on the law beginning in 1777 the lecture on english impeachment provides the foundation for much of the impeachment discussion in jeffersons manual see hdoc 104272 sec liii 1995jefferson prepared his manual of par liamentary practice for his own use during the years when he presided over the senate as vice president from 1797 to 1801 it has been printed officially virtually ever sincegoods and now it is fine and imprisonmen t and never more to be capable of bearing testimony 17 bribery is the next species of ffence against public justice which is when judge or other person concerned in the administration of justice takes any undue reward to influence his behavior in his office id at 13639 wooddeson5 in the last lecture two distinct modes of criminal prosecution were reserved for future inquiry namely proceedings on impeachments and penal acts of parliament occasionally passed against particular offenders the former is designed to occupy our present consideration it is certain that magistrates and offi cers intrusted with the administration of public affairs may abuse their delegated powers to the extensive detriment of the community and at the same time in manner not properly cognizable before the ordinary tribunals the influence of such delinquents and the nature of such offences may not unsuitably engage the authority of the highest court and the wisdom of the sagest assembly the comm ons therefore as the grand inquest of the nation become suitors for penal justic and they cannot consistently either with their own dignity or with safety to the accused sue elsewhere but to those who share with them in the legislature on this policy is founded the origin of impeachments which began soon after the constitution assumed its present form in the year 1321 all the kings subjects are impeachable in parliament but with this distinction that peer may be so accused before his peers of any crime commoner tho perhaps it was formerly otherwise can now be charged with misdemeanors only not with any capital ffence for when fitzharris in the year 1681 was impeached of high treason the lords remitted the prosecution to the inferior court tho it greatly exasperated the accusers such kind of misdeeds however as peculiarly injure the commonwealth by the abuse of high offices of trust are the most proper and have been the most usual grounds for this kind of prosecution thus if lord chancellor be guilty of bribery or of acting grossly contrary to the duty of his office if the judges mislead their sovereign by unconstitutional opinions if any other magistrate attempt to subvert the fundamental laws or introduce arbitrar power these have been deemed cases adapted to parliamentary inquiry and d ecision so where lord chancellor has been thought to have put the seal to an ignominious treaty lord admiral to neglect the safeguard of the sea an ambassador to betray his trust privy counselor to propound or support pernici ous and dishonorable measures or confidential advisor of his sovereign to obtain exorbitant grants or incompatible employments these imputations have properly occasioned impeachments because it is apparent how little the ordinary tribunals are calculated to take cognizance of such offences or to inve stigate and reform the general polity of the state 2 w ooddeson s

or neglect of duty i d at 88 madison june 2 1787 with months reflection two delegates pinkney and morri s moved that the remova l language be stricken mr pinkney mr govr morris moved to strike out this part of the resolution mr p observed he ought not be impeachable whilst in office mr davie if he be not impeachable whilst in office he will spare efforts or means whatever to get himself reelected he consider ed this as an essential security for the good behavior of the executive mr wilson concurred in the necessity of making the executive impeachable whilst in office mr govr morris he can do criminal act without coadjutors who may be punished in case he should be reelected th at will be sufficient proof of his innocence besides who is to impeach is the imp eachment to suspend his functions if it is not the mischief will go on if it is the impeachment will be nearly equivalent to displacement and will render the executive dependent on those who are to impeach col mason point is of more importance than that the right of impeachment should be continued shall any man be above justice above all shall that man be above it who can commit the most extensive injus tice when great crimes were committed he was for punishing the principal as well as the coadjutors there had been much debate difficulty as to the mode of chusing the executive he approved of that which had been adopted at first namely of referring the appoi ntment of the natl legislature one objection agst electors was the danger of their being co rrupted by the candidates this furnished peculiar reason in favor of impeachments whilst in office shall the man who has practiced corruption by that means procured his appointment in the first instance be suffered to escape punishment by repeating his guilt docr franklin was for retaining the clause as favorable to the executive history furnishes one example only of first magistrate being formally brought to public justice every body cried out agst this as unconstitutiona l what was the practice before this in cases where the chief magistrate rendered himself obnoxious why recourse was had to assassination in wch he was not only depriv ed of his life but of the opportunity of vindicating his character it wd be the best way therefore to provide in the constitution for the regular punishment of the executive when his misconduct should deserve it and for his honorable acquittal when he should be unjustly accused mr govr morris admits corruption some few other offences to be such as ought to be impeachable but thought the case s ought to be enumerated defined mr madison thought it indispensable th at some provision should be made for defending the community agst the incapacity ne gligence or perfidy of the chief magistrate the limitation of the period of his service was not sufficient security he might lose his capacity after his appointment he might pe rvert his administration into scheme of peculation or oppression he might betray his trus t to foreign powers in the case of the executive magistracy which was to be administered by single man loss of capacity or corruption was more within the compass of probable events and either of them might be fatal to the republic mr king expressed his apprehensions that an extreme caution in favor of liberty might enervate the government we were formin g he wished the house to recur to the primitive axiom that the three great departments of govts should be separate independent that the executive judiciary should be so as well as the legislative that the executive should be so equally with the judiciary would this be the case if the executive should be impeachable it had been said that the judiciary would be impeachable but it should have been remembered at the same time that the judiciary hold their places not for limited time but during good behavior it is necessary therefore that forum should behttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98882crs9 established for trying misbehavior was the executive to hold his place during good behavior the executive was to hold his place for limited term like the members of the legislature like them particularly th senate whose members would continue in appointment the same term of 6 years he w ould periodically be tried for his behavior by his electors who would continue or disconti nue him in trust according to the manner in which he had discharged it like them therefore he ought to be subject to intermediate trial by impeachment he ought not to be impeachable unless he hold his office during good behavior tenure which would be most agreeable to him provided an independent and effectual forum could be devised but under circumstances ought he to be impeachable by the legislature this would be destructive of his independence and of the principles of the constitution he relied on the vigor of the executive as great security for the public liberties mr randolph the propriety of impeachmen ts was favorite principle with him guilt wherever found ought to be punished the executive will have great opportunities of abusing his power particularly in time of war when the military force and in some respects the public money will be in his hands should regular punishment be provided it will be irregularly inflicted by tumults insurrections he is aware of the necessity of proceeding with cautious hand and of excluding as much as possible the influence of the legislature from the business he suggested for consideration an idea which had fallen from col hamilton of composing forum out of the judges belonging to the states and even of requiring some preliminary inquest whether just grounds of impeachment existed mrgovr morriss opinion had been changed by the arguments used in the discussion he was now sensible of the necessity of impe achments if the executive was to continue for any time in office our executive was not like magistrate having life interest much less like one having an hereditary interest in his office he may be bribed by greater interest to betray his trust and one would say that we ought to expose ourselves to the danger of seeing the first magistrate in foreign pay wit hout being able to guard agst it by displacing him one would think the king of england well secured agst bribery he has as it were fee simple in the whole kingdom yet charles ii was bribed by louis xiv the executive ought therefore to be impeachable for trea chery corrupting his electors and incapacity were other causes of impeachment for the latter he should be punished not as man but as an officer and punished only by degradation from his office this magistrate is not the king but the primeminister the people are the king when we make him amenable to justice however we should take care to provide some mode that will not make him dependent on the legislature ii f arrand 649 madison july 20 1787 the convention voted to make the executive removable on impeachment but moved on without addressing the particulars the dele gates assigned the committee on detail the task of working these and other matters individually agreed upon into cohesive draft the draft the committee presented on august 6

on the adoption of the federal constitution elliot 478 pennsylvania december 4 1787 elliot ed 1888 mr iredell mr chairman i was going to observe that this clause vesting the power of impeachment in the house of representatives is one of the greatest securities for due execution of all public offices every government requires it every man ought to be amenable for his conduct and there are persons so proper to complain of the public officers as the re presentatives of the people at large the representatives of the people know the fee lings of the people at large and will be ready enough to make complaints if this power were not provided the consequences might be fatal it will be not only th means of punishing misconduct but it will prevent misconduct man in public offi ce who knows that there is tribunal to punish him may be ready to deviate from hi s duty but if he knows there is tribunal for that purpose although he may be man of principle the very terror of punishment will perhaps deter him iv lliot 32 north carolina july 24 1788 mr maclaine i recollect it was mentioned by one ge ntleman that petty officers might be impeached it appears to sir to be the most horrid ignorance to

object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in government wholly elective the subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust they are of nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself the prosecution of them for this reason will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused in many cases it will connect itself with the preexisting factions and will inlist all their animosities partialities influence and interest on one side or on the other and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt t he federalist papers 39697 rossiter ed 1961 james wilson impeachments were known in athens they were prosecuted for great and public offences by which the commonwealth was brought into danger they were not referred to any court of justice but were prosecuted before the popular assembly or before the senate of five hundred it is evident that in england impeachments could not exist before the separation of the two houses of parliament we find the commons appearing as the grand inquest of the nation about the latter end of the reign of edward the third they then began to exhibit accusations for crimes and misdemeanors against offenders who were thought to be out of the reach of the or dinary power of the law in the united states and pennsylvania impeachments are confined to political characters to political crimes and misdemeanors and to political punishments i w orks of james wilson 17901791 42526 1967 edhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98882crs13 10 storys implicit rejection of perhaps more plausible construction of high crimes and misdemeanors may reflect the confluence of conflicting realities represented by the dangers of partisanship and the failure of the phrases more commonly understood meaning to reach universally accepted grounds for removal such as insanity contrary to the weight of authority but consistent with much of the evidence the term high crimes and misdemeanors may have been intended to simply mean all crimes blackstone seems to indicate that the terms high crimes and low cr imes felonies and misdemeanors and high crimes and misdemeanors were thoug ht synonymous by the time storys commentaries first appeared in 1833 however the young republic had experienced the impeachment and conviction of judge pickering necessitated by his apparent insanity and an abortive attempt by some in the case of justice chase to use impeachment to purge the federal bench of the appointees of their political opponents dilliard samuel chase i the justices of the supreme court 1789 1969 19697 1969 how better to avoid these distasteful alternatives than to shroud the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors in an accommodating veil of uncertainty capped by the sage observation that the sage observation that the identification of the circumstances that warrant an officials removal must be made on an ad hoc basisjoseph story 785 as the offences to which the remedy of impeachment has been and will continue to be principally applied are of political nature it is natural to suppose that they will be often exaggerated by party spirit and the prosecutions be sometimes dictated by party resentments as well as by sense of the public good there is danger therefore that in cases of conviction the punishment may be wholly out of proportion to the ffence and pressed as much by popular odium as by aggravated crime from the nature of such offences it is impossible to fix any exact grade or asure either in the offences or the punishments and very large discretion mu st unavoidably be vested in the court of impeachments as to both 796 the next inquiry is what are impeacha ble offences they are treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemesnors for the definition of treason resort may be had to the constitution itself but for the definition of br ibery resort is naturally and necessarily to the common law now neither the constitu tion nor any statute of the united states has in any manner defined any crimes except treason and bribery to be high crimes and misdemesnors and as such impeachable it w ill not be sufficient to say that in the cases where any offence is punished by any statute of the united states it may and ought to be deemed an impeachable offence it is not every offence that by the constitution is so impeachable it must not only be an offence but high crime and misdemeanor 797 again there are many offences purely political which have been held to be within the reach of parliamentary impeachments not one of which is in the slightest manner alluded to in our statute book and indeed political offences are of so various and complex character so utterly incapable of being defi ned or classified that the task of positive legislation would be

that an imp eachable offense is whatever majority of the house of representatives considers to be at given moment in history conviction results from whatever offense or offenses twothirds of the other body considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office again the historical cont ext and political climate are important there are few fixed principles among the handful of precedents i think it is fair to come to one conclusion however from our history of impeachments higher standard is expect ed of federal judges than of any other civil officers of the united states the president and vice president and all persons holding office at the pleasure of the president can be thrown out of office by the voters at least every 4 years to remove them in midtermit has been tried only twice and never donewould indeed require crimes of the magnitude of treason and bribery other elective officials such as member s of the congress are so vulnerable to public displeasure that their removal by the complicated impeachment route has not even been tried since 1798 but nine federal judges including one associate justice of the supreme court have been impeached by this house and tried by the senate four were acquitted four convicted and removed from office and one resigned during trial and the impeachment was dismissed in the most recent impeachment trial conducted by the other body that of us judge halsted l ritter of the southern district of florida who was removed in 1936 the point of judicial behavior was paramount since the criminal charges were admittedly thin in joint statement senators borah lafollette frazier and shipstead said httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98882crs25 we therefore did not in passing upon the facts presented to us in the matter of the impeachment proceedings against judge halsted l ritter seek to satisfy ourselves as to whether technically crime or crimes had been committed or as to whether the acts charged and prov ed disclosed criminal intent or corrupt motive we sought only to ascertain fro m these facts whether he had conducted himself in way that was calculated to undermine public confidence in the courts and to create sense of scandal there are great many things which one must readily admit would be wholly unbecoming wholly in tolerable in the conduct of judge and yet these things might not amount to crime senator elbert thomas of utah citing the jeffersonian and colonial antecedents of the impeachment process bluntly declared tenure during good behavior is in sense guaranty of life job and misbehavior in the ordinary dictionary nse of the term will cause it to be cut short on the vote under special oath of tw othirds of the senate if charges are first brought by the house of

11912914 remarks of rep gerald ford 1970 special inquiry subcommittee both concepts would allow judge to be impeached for acts which occur in the exercise of judicial office that 1 involve criminal conduct in violation of law or 2 that involved serious dere liction from public duty but not necessarily in violation of positive statutory law or forbidden by the common law sloth drunkenness on the bench or unwarranted and unreasonable impartiality sic manifest for prolonged period are ex amples of misconduct not necessarily criminal in nature that would support impeachment when such misbehavior occurs in connection with the federal office actual criminal conduct should not be requisite to impeachment of judge or any other federal official while such conduct need not be criminal it none theless must be sufficiently serious to be offenses against good morals and injurious to the social body both concepts would allow judge to be impeached for conduct not connected with the duties and

1970commprint quoted in 3 d eschlers ch 14 313 nixon inquiry inquiry staff report two points emerge from the 400 years of english parliamentary experience with the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors first the particular allegations of misconduct alleged da mage to the state in such forms as misapplication of funds abuse of official power negl ect of duty encroachment on parliaments prerogatives corruption and betrayal of trust second the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors was confined to parliame ntary impeachments it had roots in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98882crs26 ordinary criminal law and the particular allegations of misc onduct under that heading were not necessarily limited to common law or statutory derelictions of crime in any event the interpretation of the g ood behavior clause adopted by the house has not been made clear in any of the judicial impeachment cases whichever view is taken the judicial impeachments have involved an assessment of the conduct of the officer in terms of the constitutional duties of his office in this respect the impeachments of judges are consistent w ith the three impeachments of nonjudicial officers each of the thirteen american imp eachments involved charges of misconduct incompatible with the official position of the officeholder this conduct falls into three broad categories 1 exceeding the constitutional bounds of the powers of the office in derogation of the powers of anothe r branch of government 2 behaving in manner grossly incompatible with the proper function and purpose of the office and 3 employing the power of the offi ce for an improper purpose or for personal gain impeachment is constitutional remedy ddressed to serious offenses against the system of government the purpos of impeachment under the constitution is indicated by the limited scope of the remedy removal from office and possible disqualification from future office nd by the stated grounds for impeachment treason bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors it is not controlling whether treason and bribery are criminal more important they are constitutional wrongs that subvert the structure of govern ment or undermine the integrity of office and even the constitution itself and thus are high offenses in the sense that word was used in english impeachments the framers of our constitution consci ously adopted particular phrase from the english practice to help define th constitutional grounds for removal the content of the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors for the framers is to be related to what the framers knew on the whole about the english practice the broad sweep of english constitutional history nd the vital role impeachment had played in the limitation of royal prerogative and the control of abuses of ministerial and judicial power while it may be argued that some articles of impeachment have charged conduct that constituted crime nd thus that criminality is an essential ingredient or that some have charged conduc t that was not criminal and thus that criminality is not essential the fact remains that in the english practice and in several of the american impeachments the criminality issue was not rais ed at all the emphasis has been on the significant effects of the conduct undermining the integrity of the office disregard of constitutional duties and oath of office arrogation of power abuse of the governmental process adverse impact on th system of government clearly these effects can be brought about in ways not anticipated by the criminal law criminal standards and criminal courts were tablished to contro l individual conduct impeachment was evolved by parliament to cope with both the inadequacy of criminal standards and the impotence of c ourts to deal with the conduct of great public figures it would be anomalous if the framers having barred criminal sanctions from the impeachment remedy and limited it to rem oval and possible disqualification from office intended to restrict the grounds for impeachment to conduct that was criminal httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98882crs27 it is useful to note three major presidential duties of broad scope that are explicitly recited in the constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully executed to faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states to the best of his ability the first is directly imposed by the constitution the second and third are included in the constitutionally prescribed oath that the president is required to take before he enters upon the execution of his ffice and are therefore also expressly imposed by the constitution not all presidential conduct is sufficient to constitute grounds for impeachment there is further requireme ntsubstantiality in deciding whether this further requirement has been met the facts must be considered as whole in the context of the office not in terms of separate or isolated events because impeachment of president is grave step for the nation it is to be predicated only on conduct seriously incompatib with either the constitu tional form and principles of our government

2d sess 7 178 267 1974 attorneys for president nixon the english impeachment precedents cl early demonstrate the criminal nature and origin of the impeachment process the framers adopted the general criminal meaning and language of those impeachments while rejecting the 17th century aberration where impeachment was used as weapon by parliament to gain political supremacy at the expense of the rule of law in light of legislative and judicial usage american case law and established rules of constitutional and statutory construction the term other high crimes and misdemeanors means great crimes against the state finally review of american impeachment precedents shows that while judges may be impeached for something less than indict able offenses even here the standard is less than conclusive all the evidence points to the fact that the president may not he may be impeached only for indictable crimes clearly set forth in the constitution this is the lesson of history logic and experience this is the meaning of treason bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors any analysis that broadly construes the power to impeach and convict can be reached only by reading constitutional aut horities selectively by lifting specific historical precedents out of their precise historical context by disregarding the plain meaning and accepted definition of technical legal terms in short by placing subjective gloss on the history of impeachment that results in permitting the congress to do whatever it deems most politic the intent of the framers who witnessed episode after episode of outrageous abuse of the impeachment power by the self righteous english parliament was to restrict the political reach of the impeachment power those who seek to broaden the impeachment power invite the use of power as means of crushing political adversaries or ejecting them from office 1 tocqueville democracy in america 11115 p bradley ed 1945 the acceptance of such an invitation would be destructive to our system of government and to the fundamental principle of sepa ration of powers inherent in the very structure of the constitution the framers never intended that the impeachment clause serve tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98882crs28 dominate or destroy the executive branch of government in their wisdom they provided adequate and prope r methods for change the misuse of the impeachment clause was not one of them an analysis of the constitutional standard for presidential impeachment 5961 1974 vi charles black impeachment handbook 3940 1974 omitting qualifications and recognizing that the definition is only an approximation i think we can say that high crimes and misdemeanors in the constitutional sense ought to be held to be those offenses which are rather obviously wrong whether or not criminal and which so seriously threaten the order of political society as to make petulant and dangerous the continuance in power of their perpetrator the fact that such an act is also criminal helps even if it is not essential because general societal view of wrong ness and sometimes of seriousness is in such case publicly and authoritatively recorded the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors carries another connotationthat of distinctness of offense it seems that charge of high crime or high misdemeanor ought to be charge of definite act or acts each of which in itself satisfies the above requirements genera l lowness and shabbiness ought not to be enough the people take some chances when they elect man to the presidency and i think this is one of them b

crimes and misdemeanors the phrase high crimes and demeanors was an english term of art that denoted political crimes against the state and the choice of this phrase was deliberate and considered action by including that english phrase our founding fathers intende d to expand the scope of impeachable offenses beyond the scope of criminally indictable offenses this language incorporates political offenses against the state that injure the structure of government and tarnish the integrity of the political office as alexander hamilton observed these political offenses include breaches of the public tr ust that president assumes once he has taken office hamilton made this point in the federalist describing impeachable crimes as those offences which proceed from the misconduct of public men or in other words from the abuses or violations of some public trust they are of nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political as they relate chiefly to injuries done

precedent in this nations history for framing case for the removal of chief executive may well be the earliest the declaration of independence in expressing reasons for throwing off the government of george iii the continental congress did not claim that there had been single offense justifying revolution instead it pointed to course of conduct it pursued invariably the same object and evinced common design it all had in direct object the establishment of absolute tyranny over these states it was this pattern of wrongdoing taken together not each specification considered alone that showed the unfitness of george iii to be the ruler of the american people the unfitness of president to continue in office is to be judged in much the same way with reference to totality of his conduct and

therefore be concluded that impeachment is not political tool for arbitrary removal of official s that the standard for what constitutes an impeachable offense is not based on an inflexible hist orical precedent or on the judicial tenure clause that impeachment is not limited to cr imes whether indictable or otherwise and that the sanction of impeachment does not extend to noncriminal misconduct unless it involves violation of statutory w the conduct of the respondents official duties or an abuse of his official position within these limitations it is extremely difficult to define the proper standard for an impeachable offense in affirmative terms the only generalization which can safely be made is that an impeachable offense must be serious in nature while there are clear rules as to what constitutes serious offense there are number of factors which are relevant thus an offense is more serious if it is criminal violation or if it involves moral turpitude in the words of one court it may be safely asserted that where th act of official delinquency consists in the violation of some provision of the c onstitution or statute which is denounced as crime or misdemeanor or where it is re neglect of duty willfully done with corrupt intention or where the negligence is so gross and disregard of duty so flagrant as to warrant the inference that it was willful and corrupt it is within the definition of misdemeanor in office but where it consists of mere error of judgment or omission of duty without the element of fraud and where the negligence is attributable to misconception of duty ra ther than willful disregard thereof it is not impeachable although it may be highly prej udicial to the interests of the state fenton the scope of the impeachment power 65

closely analogous to the great offen ces impeachable in common law england in addition to treason and bribery the great offences included misapplication of funds abuse of official power negl ect of

theodore dwight i have dwelt the longer on this point because many seem to think that public officer can be impeached for mere act of indecorum on the contrary he must have committed true crime not against the law of england but against the law of the united states as impeachment is nothing but mode of trial the constitution only adopts it as mode of procedure leaving th crimes to which it is to be applied to be settled by the general rules of criminal law as there are under the laws of the united states common law crimes but only those which are contrary to some positive statutory rule there can be impeachment except for violation of law of congress or for the commission of crime named in the constitution english precedents concerning impeachable crimes are consequently not applicable dwight trial by impeachment 15 american law register 6 ns 257 26869 1867 alexander simpson many attempts have been made to define this power quite commonly by those who were trying to make the defi nition fit the facts to particular case rather than to have it accord with the constitutional provisions only notable exception to this however is what was said by manager afterwards president buchanan in the peck impeachment what is misbehavior in ffice in answer to this question and without pretending to furnish definition i freely admit that we are bound to prove that the respondent has violated the constitution or some known law of the land this i think is the principle fairly to be deduced from all the arguments on the trial of judge chase and from the votes of the senate on the articles of impeachment against him in opposition to the principle for which his counsel in the first instance strenuously contended that in order to render an offence impeachable it must be indictable but this violation of law may consisthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98882crs31 in the abuse as well as in the usurpation of authority the abuse of power which has been given may be criminal as the usurpation of power th at has not been granted perhaps that statement should be br oadened to include offences of so weighty character and so injurious to the office that every official is bound to know that they are of the same general character as crimes and might well be made criminal by statute but the terra incognita beyond one can properly be asked to explore under the existing constitutional provisions if for other reason than because it is fixed and saluta ry principle that penal provisions shall be so construed that the persons to be affected by them may certainly know what things they are forbidden to do simpson federal impeachments 64 university of pennsylvania law review 651 881 1916 michael gerhardt attempts to limit the scope of impeachable offenses have rarely proposed limiting impeachable offenses only to indictable offenses rather the major disagreement among commentators has been over the range of nonindictable offenses for which someone may be impeached the problem is how to identify t hose nonindictable offenses for which certain highlevel government officials may be impeach ed given that certain federal officials may be impeached and removed for committing serious abuses against the state and that these abuses are not confined to indictable offenses the challenge is to find contemporary analogues to the abuses against the state th at authorities such as hamilton and justices wilson and story viewed as suitable grounds for impeachment on the one hand these abuses may be reflected in certain statutory cr imes violations of federal criminal statues such as the bribery statute represent abuses against the state sufficient to subject the perpetrator to impeachment and removal because bribery demonstrates serious lack of judgment and respect for the law and because bribery lowers respect for the office in other words there are certain statutory crimes that if committed by public officials reflect such lapses of judgment such disregard for the welfar of the state and such lack of respect for the law and the office held that the occupant may be impeached and removed for lacking the minimum level of integrity and judgment suffi cient to discharge the responsibilities of the office on the other hand congress needs to be prepared as thencongressman ford pointed out to explain what nonindictable offenses may be impeachable offenses by defining contemporary political crimes th boundaries of congressional power to define such political crimes defy specification be cause they rest both on the circumstances underlying particular offense including the actor the forum and the political crime and on the collective political judgment of congress gerhardt the constitutional limits of impeachment 68 texas law review 1 83 1989 ronald rotunda moreover leaving aside historical precedent to limit impeachment to the commission of crimes is bad policy such limitation is both too broad and too narrow it is too broad because some crimes have functional relation to the problem of malfeasance or abuse of office for example if an official in the executive branch judge or legislator had been arrested once for driving while intoxicated that crime should not merit th drastic remedy of removal from officehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98882crs32 the proposed limitation is also too narro w for the civil officer might engage in many activities which amount to abus of office and yet not commit any crimes for example if the president abus ed his pardon power by unconstitutionally pardoning judge who had been impeached or summoned the senators from only few states to ratify treaty the president may have violated criminal law but he or she has abused the office rotunda an essay on the constitutional
