divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32485belowcost timber sales an overview summary the usda forest service fs sells some timber at prices that are less than the agency expenses to administer the timber program these belowcost timber sales have been debated by congress sporadically for more than two decades but policy to address the issue has been adopted legislatively or administratively part of the debate over be lowcost timber sales has been about their relative frequency at the direction of congress the fs developed system for reporting the financial and economic results of timber sales data were reported annually for each national forest beginning with fy1989 but report has been issued since fy1998 interest group estimates of sses continue to be made public with much fanfare and attendant news stories but the estimates of the financial results of fs timber sales vary widely this disparity is due to differences in basic approach profit andloss cash flow or other approach and in assumptions bout relevant costs the fs sells timber for variety of reasons in some cases the purpose may be to provide timber for local mill and mills and communities have been built on the implicit promise of continuing timber availability timber sales may also be used to modify existing conditions to reduce fuel loadings to alter the mix of tree species to provide habitat for specific animal species to restore forests to more natural conditions to provide access for recreation and other uses etc while alternative means of modifying vegetation exist timber sales may be more efficient have lower net cost to the treasury and to societ than the alternatives even though the sales may not cover costs according to strict financial criteria the issue is what if anything cong ress and the administration should do about belowcost timber sales some argue that action is warranted because the fiscal concern is merely tool being used to reduce timber sale levels others are concerned about the net cost to taxpayer s about the environmental damages that result from some timber sales or about alleged subsidies to timber companies the debate is often characterized as either do nothing or eliminate all belowcost sales however other options exist choices for belowcost policy might include how to measure fiscal resu lts over what geographic and temporal scales with what opportunities to demonstrate improvement and with how much agency discretion over how to factor costs into the decision to sell or not to sell timber this report provides background on the issue it is not anticipated that it will be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32485contents historical background 1 c n g r s s i n l d l i b r t i n s 2 d m i n i s t r t i v f f r t s 4 w h t r b l w c s t t i m

service fs have been persistent concern1 the possibility of losses was first raised in 1980 report that caught the attention of the house appr opriations subcommittee on interior and related agencies the committee requested fs data on timber sale revenues and costs subsequent studies using these nd other data reached similar conclusions that fs timber sales lose money the committee agreed that the existing data were inadequate for accurately measuring the losses and agreed to give the authorizing committees time to review the situation while directing the fs to develop timber cost accounting system despite numerous hearings over the ensuing two decades neither congress nor the administration has acted to limit financial losses from fs timber sales but questions about such sa are raised in congress periodically this report provides an overview of belowcost timber sales sales where the revenues are less than the costs to prepare and administer them it provides brief history of concerns over timber manageme nt profitability discusses difficulties in identifying belowcost timber sales examines concerns over financial losses and justifications offered for continuing such sales and discusse s relevant aspects of belowcost timber sale policy options for congress andor the administration historical background profitability was an early concern in federal timber management the first fs chief gifford pinchot believed that the national forests could and should be managed profitably to demonstrate the profitability of longterm sustained timber management to the private sector2 despite the efforts nd proclamations by pinchot and his successors the fs did not generate net revenues for the us treasury in 1920 the third fs chief william greeley proclaimed that timber management was profitable when one included the nonmoneta ry benefits access for recreation and for fire protection improvement of wildlife habitat etc3 this claim that total timber management benefits ex ceed total costs continues to be the fss principal rationale for its timber management policies in 1960 the fs sought and congress enacted the multipleuse sustainedyield act pl 86517 16 usc 528531 the

the combination of uses that will give the greatest dollar return or the greatest unit output for the next 20 years fs timber sales were widely presumed to be generally profitable nonetheless there were hints of possible problems in 1970 the bolle report decried apparently uneconomical intensive forestry practices on the bitterroot mt national forest5 in 1976 marion clawson an economist with resources for the future criticized national forest management as wasteful and inefficient6 in 6l2 of the national forest manageme nt act of 1976 nfma pl 94588 16 usc 1600 1614 et congress directed the fs to include representative sample of belowcost timber sales in the agencys nnual report however nfma implicitly accepted general timber sale profitability in 14 h by creating special fund for salvage sales poten tially unprofitable because of low values for dead and dying trees the conventional wisdom of fs timber sa profitability was challenged in 1980 report by the natural res ources defense council nrdc7 that report compared specified annual protection ma nagement and investment costs with revenues for each national forest for fi ve years fy1974fy1978 and found that depending on

of representative sidney yates chair of the house appropriations subcommittee on the department of the interior and related agencies discussion of fs timber cost accounting in the 1983 fs

will address the issues of co st allocation and valuation of benefits specifically related to the commercial timber sales program secondly bill language has been included which will allow increases in timber sale levels from the previous year in any forest only if the estimated receipts are in excess of annual expenditure s for timber sold in at least three of the preceding five years the bill language prohibiting timber sale increases on forests with belowcost sales was deleted during the fl oor debate at the request of the chair of the house agriculture committee to allow that committee an opportunity to deal with the issue legislatively11 the senate appropriations committee also objected to direction on timber sales that was related to sale costs and receipt s although it agreed with the need for better timber cost accounting and allocation12 the house agriculture committee held ex tensive hearings on belowcost timber sales with administra tion witnesses on february 26 1985 and with 41 other witnesses on june 5 and 6 198513 despite this extensive review the committee developed legislative propos and direction for the administration or for the appropriations committee

policy in senate agriculture committee hearings by thenassistant secretary of agriculture james lyons arguing that data were inadequate to assess options and promising study of policy options22 the fs study to examine options for reducing belowcost timber sales was conducted under the guidance and review of an interagency advisory team the report published in january 1995 descri bed timber program financial policies various perspectives on belowcost timber sales the shifting management direction to ecosystem management and policy opti ons described in previous studies and new options for addressing belowcost timber sales23 however the clinton administration did not proffer proposal to reduce belowcost timber sales what are belowcost timber sales identifying belowcost timber sales is deceptively simple exercise comparisons of fs timber sale receipts nd expenses appear to both illuminate and disguise information about the financial and economic c onsequences of timber sales the fs sells timber for many reasons to generate receipts to supply wood for manufacturers to provide employment to expand access for motorized vehicles to alter the composition and distribution of ve getation in an area and more often sales are modified to mitigate or enhance other values on or near sale sites mixing timber and nontimber costs and benefits this raises questions about whether each timber sale should be examin ed or whether the timber pr ogram locally regionally or nationally is the proper level for assessing financia l performance furthermore government cost accounting for the disposal of appreciating assets is not as simple and straightforward as many believe thus questions ar ise about the relevant and appropriate measures of cost s different interest groups measure the financial and economic consequences of timber sales differently the two most commonly used measures are cash flow and profitability although other measur are occasionally used none of these approaches or measures is inherently right or wrong each provides useful information by which to assess various aspects of the fs timber program each might provide relevant criterion for individual timber sales depending on why that timber sale is being offered or for the timber program at some aggregate level some are most useful for monitoring financial performance and for supporting planning efforts while others c ould be used to screen individual saleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32485crs6 before committing to major investments probably none on its own is sufficient to assess the timber program completely but in concert they may provide picture that describes many of the nuances of the program profitability one approach to estimating the financial conse quences of timber sales is to calculate the profitability of fs timber sales tspirs generally follows the structure of an income or profitandloss statement used in the private sector for reporting to investors regula tors and tax collectors th is approach has two major strengths first profitandloss calcula tions depend on matching revenues with the expenditures that generate those revenue s current investments to produce future revenues are capitalized and then fully am ortized by the time revenues are produced second income statements are standard accounting reports that provide defined structure for presenting information on financial performance however profitability analyses may be poor predictors of long term performance and investment potential in addition profitability dete rminations may be impossibl for assessing individual sales because of the limitations in allo cating fixed costs including longterm investments among the sales thus profitability analyses may be restricted to national forests or some ot her level of aggregation cash flow another approach is to calculate the resulting cash flow by comparing the cash receipts from timber sales with the relevant costs cash flow analyses have two major strengths firs t cash flow directly measures the fiscal results of the current years timber sales for the us treasury second cash flow the statement of sources and uses of cash is standard accounting activity because it is possible for profitable businesses to go bankrupt if their cash income is insufficient to cover current expenses ho wever as with profitandloss analyses annual cash flow analyses may poorly indi cate longrun financial results because changes in market conditions can rapidly alter an organizations cash flow and may poorly indicate management profitability and investment potential this is particularly true for logged areas that need substantial restoration investments because current receipts result from existin g conditions while current expenditures may be to provide future benefits other other approaches to assessing th financial and ec onomic consequences of timber sales exist financial investment analyses such as calculating the internal rate of return can be appr opriate for assessing investme nts but are difficult and are fraught with uncertainty about future r eceipts regional economic analyses can be used to examine the economic benefits of the timber program but are impractical for assessing individual timber sales and comparable data for assessing effects on other sectors such as the recreation industry do not exist except in rare circumstances social investment analyses and estimating net public benefits are other approaches to assessing the broad ec onomic consequences of th timber sale program but methods for assessing current and future timber and other values are at best imprecise and highly debatable relevant costs even analyses using the same basic approach can yield quite different results depending on the assumptions about the relevant costs and cost allocations determining the relevant timber sale costs might seem to be simple and straightforward but timber sales actually all fs land management activities affect not only timber but all of the resources on and near the sale site researchers havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32485crs7 24see for example ervin g schuster apporti oning joint costs in multipleuse forestry

25ervin g schuster charles keegan iii and robert bens on provisions for protecting and enhancing nontimber resources in northern region timber sales research paper int326 ogden ut usda forest service mar 1984addressed the issue of allo cating joint production costs the costs of activities that produce multiple goods and services and ve always conclude d that allocation scheme for joint production costs is wide ly and unambiguously accepted as yielding the right answer24 thus any estimate of financial performance is disputable wide variety of costs have b een included in various studies direct sale costs the cost to prepare and administer timber sales are usually included but studies have suggested that federal costs are increased or timber bids are decreased by sale adjustments to mitigate and enhance nontimber resources25 indirect sale costs expenses for activities that would not likely occur if timber were not being sold such as boundary surveys some road maintenance and st aff specialist support for environmental analyses on timber sales are often included but the extent to which such costs are relevant is arguable salerelated investments such as road access and postsale reforestation are so typically included but allocating such investments over time and among beneficiaries is also debatable timber program costs that are part of longrun timber management but are not related to current timber sales such as timber inventories timber research reforestation of burned sites and timber stand impr ovement to increase productiv ity are also included in some studies finally some other costs such as general administration receipt sharing payments and wildfire protection have been at least partially attributed to timber sales and timber management and included in some studies however the multiple outputs environmental impacts and differing time scales of timber sales and related activities make identifying relevant costs and comparing them with relevant revenues problematic two decad of debate have not resolved the dilemma and further debate seems unlikely to result in widespread agreement why do belowcost sales occur the fs is authorized to sell timber nd is not required to make money on each sale or overall under current law as not ed above sales are made for an array of reasons to generate receipts to supply wood for manufacturers to provide employment to expand access for motorized vehicles to alter the composition and distribution of vegetation in an area and more at times selling the timber may be ancillary to the primary purpose of the action ie trees may be cut for other reasons than to provide timber for the industry three general reasons are typically presented to explain why belowcost timber sales persist past promises the nature of the national forest lands and the nature of multipleuse management in addition individual sales or timber programs for national forest or nationwide might have been predicted to generate net returns buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32485crs8 26in alaska the fs began trying to establish timber industry in the 1920s two longterm contracts each requiring the c onstruction of pulp

might have led to results that differ from the expectations past promises one justification for continuing to sell timber regardless of possible financial losses is the at least implicit fs promise to provide timber from the national forests many sawmills and communitie s have been located because of the expected continuing timber supply from the national forests in fe w cases the clearest example being the tongass national forest in southeast alaska national forest timber was explic itly used for ec onomic development to create an industry where none had previously existed26 the promise of supplying timber from the national forests is an old one the 1897 act that first authorized the sale of timber identified one of the purposes of the forest reserves now nationa l forests as to furnish continuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of citizens of th united states in 1960 the multipleuse sustainedyield act pl 86517 16 us c 528531 expanded on this promise by requiring national forest management for sustained yi elds as defined in 4b sustained yield of the several products and services means the achievement and maintenance in perpetuity of highlevel annual or regular periodic output of the various renewable resources of th national forests without impairment of the productivity of the land thus national forest mana gement was intended to pr oduce outputs without regard to the financial results of such production in 1976 nfma further implied sustained production in 13a by gene rally limiting national forest timber sale levels to an allowable sale quantity which can be removed from such forest annually in perpetuity on sustainedyield basis together these laws at least imply an expectation of continued timber sales from the national forests and some have argued that the promise is guarantee27 most observers note that while sustained timber sale programs have been promisedthey are not legally enforceable by blishing other conditions on national forest management congress the executive branc h and the public thr ough participation in national forest planning may choose to constrain or even eliminate timber sales in some areas indeed timber sale levels have declined significantly from peak of 113 billion board feet in fy1987 to 16 billion board feet in fy2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32485crs9 national forest lands the nature of the national forests lands may explain the persistence of below cost timber sales many of the early forest reserves were established in the rocky mountains to protect waters heds sustain flows for navi gable waterways and reduce downstream flooding the weeks law 36 stat 961 16 usc 515 et was enacted in 1911 to authorize acquisition of lands particularly in mountainous areas of the east for similar reasons thus many of the lands have low timber growth rates andor species with low timber values some national forests have also been degraded often prior to their acquisition or protection poor timber harvesting pr actices principally on private timberlands before world war ii is one cause aba ndoned eroding agricultural lands were also acquired and typically planted to fastgro wing tree species to stop the erosion but with 2020 hindsight the species now are c onsidered ecologically inappropriate for those sites natural disasters most co mmonly forest fires insect and disease epidemics and windstorms can also degrade forests for example hurricane hugo which struck in september 1989 pr obably caused the loss reported in tspirs for the francis marionsumter sc nati onal forests in fy1991 because of the extensive salvage of degraded timber despite the poor inherent or historical condition of so national forests timber sales may still be warranted some vege tative manipulation ma be desirable to reduce fuel loadings and the risk of damage by fire to invest in future timber production to enhance water flow s or wildlife habitat to alter existing vegetation for more sustainable or naturally functioning ecosystem and for other reasons selling timber may be an efficient tool for manipul ating the vegetation achieving the desired results at lower cost to the government than alternative methods however the relative efficiency and public acceptance of timber sales versus other means of altering vegetation can only be assessed on sitespecific basis multipleuse management in addition to being managed for sustai ned yield the national forests are to be managed for multiple uses defined in the multipleuse sustained yield act as for outdoor recreation range timb er watershed and wildlife and fish purposes the act includes lengthy definition of multiple use including harmonious and coordinated management of the various resources w ith consideration being given to the relative values of the various resources and not necessarily the combination of uses that will give the greatest dollar return or greatest unit output clearly the fs is not to manage the national forests principally to generate revenues or profits this is not to suggest that costs efficiency or profits must be ignored only that they cannot be the so or primary reason for the management decision the fs does use timber sales to alter vegetation nd timber harvesting might be costefficient means to achieve such goals the fs modified tspirs to acknowledge such practices by separating timber sales into co mmercial timber sales primarily for providing wood to users nd stewardship sales p rimarily for other purposes it might be expected that st ewardship sales would be more likely to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32485crs10 28john h beuter overview of belowcost timber sale issue technical bulletin 9002 washington dc american forest resource alliance nov 30

practices and procedures analysis of alternative systems by ross w gortebelowcost but during the several year s for which tspirs distinguished between commercial and stewardship sales there wa s consistent patte rn of stewardship sales having lower re venues or higher costs or being more likely to be belowcost some critics have suggested that be lowcost timber sales occur because governments generally and the fs in particular are inefficient28 one analyst has produced detailed critique of timber sale practices that crosssubsidize highvalue and lowvalue species generating much greater overall expenditures but without significantly increasing receipts29 numerous studies have offered suggestions for changes to improve timber sale efficiency the fs has made numerous changes in its timber sale process to improve efficiency but the overall financial results appear despite the lack of tspirs reports to have not changed substantially what if anything should be done the future of belowcost timber sales some interest groups have argued that nothing should be done about belowcost sales because the apparent fiscal concern is simply be ing used to reduce fs timber sale levels using fs losses to reduce timber sales may well be tactic for some possibly most critics of belowcost timber sales and thus improved financial performance would be unlikely to re duce the conflict over national forest management nonetheless some are c oncerned about taxpayers fi nancing the environmental damages that occur from some timber sales and others are concerned about recent projections of federal budg et deficits in his fy1994 budget president clinton proposed phasing out belowcost timber sale s as part of his package to reduce subsidies for extractive resource uses of federal lands the fy1995 house republican budget initiative also proposed to eliminate belowcost timber sales by directing the forest service to bring down the costs of managing their programs without reducing receipts30 much of the debate over belowcost timber sale policy has focused on two approaches do nothing because belowcost concerns are not the real issue and cease all belowcost timber sales because the justifications ar inadequate between these two extremes however are multitude of possibilities to date only one study has suggested alternatives to this persistent debate of continue cu rrent practices versus stop belowcost logging31 this study discusses mong other things relevant choices for policy on belowcost timber sales choices includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32485crs11 measurement of fiscal performance cash flow and tspirs profitability are commonly used in the belowcost bate but other measures might be appropriate for some sales eg stewar dship sales or fo r some sites eg salvage in devastated areas or nds not suited for timber production geographic scope of assessment tspirs measures timber programs for entire national forests but salebysa decisions and other scales eg watersheds or ranger distri cts may also be feasible temporal scale of assessment cash flow and tspirs analyses focus on annual performance while na tional forest plans make decisions that can apply for decade or more to compensate for annual fluctuations performance could be assessed by combining years or using rolling averages for multiple years or by permitting one or few years of losses within period eg losses in two of the past five years might be acceptable opportunities for improveme nt debates have focu sed on past performance but managers might be able to improve the fiscal results of the timber sale program the implementation period and criteria for reestablishing terminated programs are choices that could be included in belowcost policy and agency discretion the forest service currently has comple discretion over fiscal standards for timber programs the opposite extreme would be rigid policy prohibiting all belowcost sales or programs based on the identified standards other possibilities include national standards for local consideration in forest or project planning regional or washington office review of fiscal performance and exte rnal regional or na tional review boards consistent with or exempted from the federal advisory committee act for recommendations to the regiona l forester or the chief additional choices and possibilities undoubtedly exist and the number of feasible combinations is nearly infinite thus there are many approaches that congress andor the administration could select to improve fs timber sale fiscal performance with myriad ramifications for local economies and for the environment ultimately decisions about the quantity cation and timing of fs timber sales will be determined by agency decisionmakers responding to direction from congress and the administration and to input from the public
