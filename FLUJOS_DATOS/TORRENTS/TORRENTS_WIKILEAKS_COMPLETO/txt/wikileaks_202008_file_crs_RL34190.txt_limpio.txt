specialist in public health and epidemiology domestic social policy division holly stockdale analyst in health care financing domestic social policy division pandemic influenza an analysis of state preparedness and response plans summary states are the seat of most authority for public health emergency response much of the actual work of response falls to local officials however the federal government can impose requirements upon states as condition of federal funding since 2002 congress has provided funding to all us states territories and the district of columbia to enhance federal state and local preparedness for public health threats in general and an influenza flu pandemic in particular states were required to develop pandemic plans as condition of this funding this report which will not be updated describes an approach to the analysis of state pandemic plans and presents the findings of that analysis state plans that were available in july 2006 were analyzed in eight topical areas 1 leadership and coordination 2 surveillance and laboratory activities 3 vaccine management 4 antiviral drug management 5 other disease control activities 6 communications 7 healthcare services and 8 other essential services history of federal funding and requirements for state pandemic planning is provided in an appendix this analysis is not intended to grade or rank individual state pandemic plans or capabilities rather its findings indicate that number of challenges remain in assuring pandemic preparedness and suggest areas that may merit added emphasis in future planning efforts generally the plans analyzed here reflect their authorship by public health officials they emphasize core public health functions such as disease detection and control other planning challenges such as assuring surge capacity in the healthcare sector the continuity of essential services or the integrity of critical supply chains may fall outside the authority of public health officials and may require stronger engagement by emergency management officials and others in planning since different threats such as hurricanes earthquakes or terrorism are expected to affect states differently many believe that states should have flexibility in emergency planning this complicates federal oversight of homeland security grants to states however which requirements should be imposed on all states when is variability among states desirable and when is it not flu pandemic is perhaps unique in that it would be likely to affect all states at nearly the same time in ways that are fairly predictable this may argue for more directive federal role in setting pandemic preparedness requirements but the matter of what the states should do to be prepared for pandemic is not always clear for example uncertainties about the ways in which flu spreads the lack of national consensus in matters of equity in rationing and long tradition of federal deference to states in matters of public health all complicate efforts to set uniform planning requirements for states in addition to assuring the strength of planning efforts readiness also depends on assuring that states can execute their plans this assurance can be provided through analysis of the response during exercises drills and relevant realworld incidents such an analysis is not within the scope of this report contents

analysis of state preparedness and response plans background in 1997 new strain of avian influenza bird flu named h5n1 for its genetic makeup emerged in hong kong and killed six people it has since spread to other countries in asia europe and africa where it has infected more than 300 people killing more than half of them the situation has raised concern about the possibility of global human pandemic1 flu pandemic of modest severity would strain public health and healthcare systems worldwide and although flu viruses do not directly harm physical infrastructure severe pandemic could nonetheless affect infrastructure and commerce through high absenteeism supply chain disruptions and other effects public health functions in the united states are decentralized with states in the lead for most public health authorities such as disease surveillance and quarantine in many states local public health authority is also decentralized not falling under the direct control of state health officials the federal government provides funding guidance and technical assistance to state and local planners and can require that certain activities be carried out as condition of funding but the federal government has limited authority to precisely direct the planning efforts of states and localities2 because the states are the seat of most authority for public health and medical preparedness national preparedness for public health threats depends in part on the preparedness of individual states pandemic planning at the federal state and local levels is woven into broader allhazards emergency planning and the response to pandemic would employ the same basic approaches to leadership authority coordination assistance and financing as with other incidents3 however flu pandemic would pose at least two challenges that may be unique to this threat and that may merit specific attention in planning the likelihood that all jurisdictions would be affected at nearly the same time and the potentially prolonged period many months during which response posture would have to be maintained the nearsimultaneous nature of pandemic would likely diminish the value of stateto

pandemic coupled with potentially high absenteeism could pose exceptional challenges in maintaining continuity of operations coop for essential services including potentially continuity of government5 since 2001 all states have received annual federal funding to plan for emergencies including public health threats certain planning activities were required as condition of the federal funds these planning requirements have evolved from one year to the next see the appendix for information regarding federal preparedness grants to states and associated requirements but efforts to evaluate states compliance with planning requirements or the effectiveness of states preparedness efforts in general have not evolved concurrently6 this crs report describes information that exists to date regarding evaluations of pandemic preparedness it also presents an approach to the analysis of state pandemic plans and the findings of that analysis crs analyzed pandemic plans available as of july 2006 at that point all states had been required to submit to the us department of health and human services pandemic plans one year earlier and all had done so however the states were not given specific direction regarding the content of the plans that were required in july 2005 and they were not required to update their plans during the subsequent grant funding cycle7 since july 2006 states have received dedicated funding for pandemic preparedness through the federal public health and hospital preparedness grants and additional guidance emphasizing training and exercises has been provided pandemic planning benchmarks have also been incorporated in municipal homeland security grant program for additional background on the variety of pandemic planning activities discussed in this report

preparedness and suggest areas that may merit added emphasis in future planning efforts this report will not be updated crs analysis methods and limitations in 2005 crs retained contractor the national opinion research center norc at the university of chicago8 to create database that could be used to analyze state pandemic preparedness and response plans norc delivered the database to crs containing information abstracted from one publicly available pandemic planning document from each of the 50 states and the district of columbia dc in august 20069 the most comprehensive publicly available document was used for analysis available documents varied and included 1 comprehensive pandemic preparedness and response plans 2 annexes to broader public health or emergency management plans or 3 brief summaries of pandemic preparedness plans comprehensive pandemic plans were analyzed when available when not annexes were analyzed when available brief summaries were analyzed only when the other two options were not available broader public health or emergency management plans were not analyzed in any case often they were not publicly available of the 51 plans analyzed 14 were referred to by the authoring state as draft pandemic plans 14 as annexes to the states allhazards plan and 13 as formally adopted influenza plans ten states did not specify the database was populated in july 2006 at that time publication dates for the 51 plans ranged from 2002 through 2006 as follows 2006 29 plans 8 see httpwwwnorcorghomepagehtm 9 reference in this report to state plans includes dc and the total number of plans analyzed is 51 plans analyzed were the most current publicly available plan available for each state as of july 2006 on either the states website or on federal pandemic flu website httpwwwpandemicflugovplanstatesindexhtml the database was created and analyzed using microsoft office access 2003 software crs4 2005 16 plans most predating key federal plan issued in november 200510 2004 2 plans 2003 and 2002 1 plan each year and two plans were not dated total of 66 variables were developed for analysis to assess pandemic planning activities in the following eight topical areas 1 leadership and coordination 2 surveillance and laboratory activities 3 vaccine management 4 antiviral drug management 5 other disease control activities eg isolation and quarantine 6 communications activities 7 healthcare services and 8 other essential services eg public utilities the 66 variables are dichotomous that is for each variable plans were determined to contain substantive mention of particular activity yes or not no11 variables were developed by crs and the contractor to span spectrum of pandemic planning activities they were intended to reflect variety of public health preparedness activities that were presented in federal pandemic planning guidance documents available at the time12 as well as number of planning challenges and potential planning gaps that were the subject of ongoing policy discussions while each individual variable was intended to reflect an essential element of pandemic preparedness crs did not attempt to weigh the relative importance of each variable with respect to the others the findings of this analysis are subject to number of limitations first variables were developed intentionally to reveal planning gaps rather than to document the universe of activities that may be described in the plans or that may have been discussed in grant guidance see the appendix second certain planning elements eg reporting relationships between the health department and the governor or plans for mass fatality management may not be fleshed out in the pandemic plan but may be laid out in states public health preparedness or general 10 states were required to submit pandemic flu plans to the department of health and human services hhs by july 2005 the hhs pandemic plan for public health and medical preparedness which included guidance for state planning was published in november 2005 superceding more cursory draft pandemic plan many states subsequently updated their plans to better coordinate with the hhs plan see hhs hhs pandemic influenza plan november 2005 at httpwwwpandemicflugov 11 additional categorical and freetext variables were also created and were used to inform analysis of the dichotomous variables in addition to the 66 dichotomous variables presented selected crosstabulations are also presented to show the interaction of certain variables 12 the set of variables was finalized in may 2006 see the appendix for discussion of federal guidance for state pandemic planning crs5 emergency management plan these broader plans were not analyzed and in many cases were and are not publicly available third some states have published only brief summaries of extant pandemic plans that are not publicly available by their nature these summaries did not typically make substantive mention of planning activities fourth certain preparedness and response tasks may be delegated to local officials and may not therefore be described in the state pandemic plan13 fifth states may have developed detailed operational plans for certain aspects of pandemic planning such as ventilator triage but may not have included them in the pandemic plan or may not have updated the pandemic plan to reflect these narrowly tailored documents sixth while analyses began with keyword searches yes findings were applied only to substantive discussions of relevant topics in the plan not merely the finding of keyword in list or another entry that lacked meaningful context for planning while efforts were made to standardize analysis these determinations were inherently subjective finally this analysis reflects snapshot in time in what appears to be dynamic national planning effort the database contains state pandemic plans available as of july 2006 since then fy2006 supplemental funds for state pandemic preparedness were released pandemic planning benchmarks were included in homeland security grant guidance and at least 16 states have updated their pandemic plans most of these limitations would have the likely effect of underestimating states planning efforts therefore finding that planning element is absent from states pandemic plan does not necessarily mean that the state has not addressed that element this analysis is not intended to grade or rank individual state pandemic plans or capabilities there are not at this time the processes or standards to support such an evaluation rather this analysis is premised on the idea that national preparedness for pandemic flu is in part dependent upon the preparedness of individual states variables in this analysis that yielded fewer yes responses overall may indicate areas that merit added emphasis in future planning efforts other analyses of state pandemic planning analyses by federal agencies though the federal government has provided considerable funding and guidance for state pandemic preparedness it has not published comprehensive assessment of state pandemic planning efforts since fy2002 all states have received grants from two agencies in the department of health and human services hhs the centers for disease control and prevention cdc to improve state and local public 13 some local jurisdictions have published detailed pandemic plans see for example santa clara county california pandemic influenza preparedness and response plan for santa clara county at httpwwwsccphdorgpanflu crs6 health capacity and the health resources and services administration hrsa for hospital and healthcare system preparedness the department of homeland security dhs also provides preparedness grants to states and cities discussion of these grants and associated federal requirements for pandemic planning is provided in the appendix while each agency evaluates state compliance with those requirements none has published assessments of states performance14 the hhs office of inspector general has reported on the compliance of some individual states with certain requirements of the cdc and hrsa grants but has not addressed pandemic planning specifically15 the white house homeland security council has reported on federal progress to assist states in variety of specific pandemic planning tasks laid out in the national strategy for pandemic influenza implementation plan implementation plan16 but has not evaluated state pandemic planning efforts17 the government accountability office gao has published analyses of some aspects of federal pandemic preparedness18 but has not published systematic analysis of state pandemic plans gao has also published analyses of the cdc public health and hrsa hospital preparedness grant programs but these analyses have not included assessments of state pandemic preparedness19 gao has not published information about the performance of individual states in 2006 dhs published the nationwide plan

pandemic preparedness some of the methods used and the findings may nonetheless be of interest dhs conducted its review in two phases state selfassessments and validation site visits conducted by teams of peer reviewers21 states were evaluated for variety of benchmarks and their planning status was graded as fully partially or not sufficient review teams focused on three health and medical benchmarks 1 processes to maintain patient tracking system 2 procedures to license outofstate medical volunteers and 3 processes for mass fatality management they found fewer than half of the states to be fully sufficient for each benchmark22 results were published in aggregate ie dhs did not publish the results for specific states analyses by nongovernmental authors researchers from research triangle institute international rti published the findings of their analysis of 49 state pandemic plans available as of early 2006 for planning elements including vaccination surveillance and detection and disease containment23 the authors found considerable variation among states and posited two explanations first federalism which places states in the lead in matters of public health and second limited scientific information about how flu is spread and therefore which disease control practices are likely to be effective the authors recommended that hhs publish more detailed planning guidance for states and that there be more research on influenza including the effect of interventions such as use of masks and closure of schools on disease transmission authors presented their findings for specific states for ten specific preparedness benchmarks and published the findings for additional benchmarks in aggregate trust for americas health tfah notforprofit public health advocacy group has published annual report cards in which states were graded according to set of preparedness criteria developed by the group24 as with prior reports the 2006 report included primarily general not pandemicspecific public health criteria but included finding that four states do not test yearround for the flu which is necessary to monitor for pandemic outbreak tfah also created model

december 2006 the associated press ap reported on the findings of interviews it conducted with health officials in every state regarding aspects of pandemic planning26 ap found that many states had not yet made investments of state funds for pandemic planning but were reliant solely on federal funds health officials stressed that during pandemic shortages of healthcare workers would likely be the worst bottleneck in ramping up health system capacity ap also found lack of consensus on some planning elements such as whether to close schools or to stockpile antiviral drugs crs analysis results the following sections tabulate and discuss findings for the 66 dichotomous variables findings of yes mean that state pandemic plan makes substantive mention of the relevant subject matter for each of the variables 51 plans were analyzed tables are presented for each of eight topical areas studied for most of the topical areas plans were searched for planning assumptions these are statements of generally accepted facts or circumstances that are used to achieve consistency and relevance in planning efforts such as the assumption that severe pandemic could result in absenteeism rates as high as 40 overarching planning assumptions for pandemic flu are provided in the hhs pandemic plan and include the universal and nearsimultaneous nature of pandemic and the expectation of shortages of vaccine and antiviral drugs27 in this analysis state plans were searched for the presence of planning assumptions that were specific to the topical area being analyzed leadership and coordination often when emergency managers have reviewed the response to disasters they have found the most serious shortcomings to involve unclear lines of authority confusion about leadership lack of mechanisms to coordinate multiple responding agencies and other problems involving command and control in the 1970s firefighters developed the incident command system ics to address these problems in the management of rapidly moving wildfires since then the nations structures for coordinated incident response have evolved incorporating lessons learned from number of disasters and terrorist attacks in 2002 congress established dhs to serve as the focal point for the federal governments disaster preparedness and response activities and tasked the secretary of dhs to develop the national incident management system nims to assure that responders from different jurisdictions 25 trust for americas health pandemic flu and potential for us economic recession march 2007 at

disciplines can work together effectively in disaster response in addition congress has continued to refine the delegations of authority among key federal response agencies28 state response agencies have evolved similarly and are in some cases required to adopt uniform emergency management practices as condition of federal homeland security grant funding table 1 presents the findings of this analysis for state designations of authority and coordinating mechanisms in the response to flu pandemic generally fewer than half of the plans made substantive mention of each of the leadership and coordination variables such as the designation of specific responsible individuals or liaisons about twothirds of the plans mentioned the states emergency operations center and how it would be activated to coordinate response efforts during pandemic29 table 1 leadership and coordination of plans that address leadership and coordination variable variable n51 provides general planning assumptions regarding pandemic flu 34 designates liaison between health department hd and governor 10 designates liaison between hd and state emergency management office 13 designates an individual

state emergency operations center seoc 33 hd is represented in the seoc 11 healthcare system liaison is represented in the seoc 6 mentions pandemic flu exercises or drills 37 the designated individual is usually either the governor or the state health official only 16 of the plans mentioned the national incident management system nims though states were to address nims compliance as requirement for

httpwwwfemagovemergencynimsindexshtm 29 an emergency operations center is the physical location where agency representatives assemble during an emergency to coordinate response and recovery actions and resources 30 see for example the announcement accompanying fy2005 guidance for the cdc public continued crs10 only 16 plans mentioned possible role for the national guard in pandemic response unless it is federalized the national guard is state response asset under the control of the governor31 there has been considerable discussion of the maintenance of civil order during pandemic while matters of incident management or deployment of the national guard may be described in the states general preparedness plan flu pandemic could have certain effects that are unlike other disasters hence it could be helpful to describe specifically how the national guard might be used or how incident command could be established during pandemic only four state plans mentioned both nims and the national guard about threefourths of the plans mentioned pandemic flu exercises or drills states were required to conduct public health emergency response exercises and to develop pandemic plans as conditions of their fy2005 cdc public health grants but they were not required at that time to conduct exercises specifically for flu pandemic as requirement of fy2006 supplemental appropriations for pandemic flu congress called on the states to conduct pandemic flu exercises that would enable public health and law enforcement officials to establish procedures and locations for quarantine surge capacity diagnostics and communication32 cdc guidance accompanying the grants required states to test three aspects of pandemic response control of community gatherings eg school closings medical surge capacity and mass vaccination mass prophylaxis33 the funds were made available to states in july 2006 the same time that the crs pandemic plan database was constructed while the requirement for multisector exercises by states is important these exercises may be carried out individually by states the only national multi sector pandemic exercise reported to date has been tabletop simulation

health departments and designated healthcare providers voluntarily report relevant information such as laboratory results or hospital admissions to several flu surveillance systems run by cdc information is gathered and analyzed weekly during the winter flu season monitoring for pandemic flu would be integrated into these existing systems key challenges in the rapid detection of novel flu viruses ie those with pandemic potential are the vagueness of flu symptoms which occur with many other diseases and the difficulty in distinguishing specific flu strains of interest from the background of other strains commonly in circulation35 table 2 presents the findings of this analysis for state surveillance and laboratory activities in pandemic planning twentyseven plans mentioned laboratorybased surveillance for flulike illness however many of the plans pre date 2006 when cdc reported that public health labs in all 50 states and the district of columbia have the capability to test for h5n1 influenza36 most state plans incorporated planning assumptions to guide flu surveillance however most state plans did not mention integration of human and animal flu surveillance data or the use of syndromic surveillance to track flu37 table 2 surveillance and laboratory activities of plans that address surveillance and laboratory activities variable variable n51 provides planning assumptions regarding surveillance 40 mentions capacity to perform labbased surveillance for flulike illness 27 mentions linkage of human and animal flu surveillance data 19 mentions existing or planned use of syndromic surveillance to track flu 23 previously published analysis of 49 state pandemic plans found that there was considerable variation among states in planning for surveillance and detection all states planned to utilize some or all of the existing flu surveillance mechanisms 35 cdc overview of influenza surveillance in the united states june 26 2006 at httpwwwcdcgovfluweeklypdfflusurveillanceoverviewpdf 36 an h5n1 influenza diagnostic test developed by cdc was approved by the food and drug administration fda and delivered to laboratories in the national laboratory response network which includes public health labs in all 50 states many federal labs and others in february 2006 see httpwwwbtcdcgovlrnfactsheetasp 37 syndromic surveillance means tracking symptoms of illness which could provide information faster than waiting for the results of laboratory testing cdcs surveillance of sentinel healthcare providers gathers reports of influenzalike illness ili which is form of syndromic surveillance some have recommended that during pandemic states should be able to expand surveillance of ili to emergency departments and other healthcare facilities crs12 during pandemic and few state plans mentioned procedures to screen arriving international travelers for influenza38 vaccine management vaccination is considered the best preventive measure for influenza but because of continuous changes in the genes of flu viruses vaccines must be matched to specific strains to provide good protection flu vaccine is currently produced using timeconsuming process with sixmonth lead time in the early months of pandemic vaccine would be in short supply policymakers have struggled to develop the best approaches for vaccine rationing when there are competing goals maximizing lives saved assuring the continuity of essential services and maintaining perceptions of fairness for example39 table 3 presents the findings of this analysis for variables regarding vaccine management before and during pandemic table 3 vaccine management of plans that address vaccine management variable variable n51 provides planning assumptions regarding vaccine management 28 identifies priority groups 33 identifies and enumerates priority groups 6 describes plan for vaccine distribution 36 describes multiple contingency plans for vaccine distribution

dose for an individual 13 describes plan to track vaccineassociated adverse events vaes 34 describes plan for ind protocol and tracking vaccine parity and vaes 6 delegates aspects of vaccine management and logistics to local hd 8 while about twothirds of the state plans discussed the matter of priority groups only six attempted to enumerate the individuals in each group enumerating those in priority groups ie knowing how many of states residents fall within each of the priority groups is essential in executing states priority plan without that information it would not be possible to match the magnitude of need to the actual number of doses of vaccine available and to properly advise officials and the public 38 holmberg et 39 see crs report rl33381 the americans with disabilities act ada allocation of scarce medical resources during pandemic by nancy lee jones crs13 regarding who should report for request or be given vaccination at specific points in time this analysis did not attempt to describe vaccine priority schemes for those states that proposed them previously published analysis of state pandemic plans found that most states planned to comport with vaccine priority guidelines laid out in the hhs pandemic plan40 if the state plan was published after the hhs plan or with earlier federal recommendations41 in general these federal recommendations call for healthcare workers and sometimes other first responders to be vaccinated first in order that they can remain at work and not make others ill next in order of priority are those most vulnerable to serious complications from flu based on annual experience with seasonal flu some have criticized this approach saying that it fails to address other legitimate planning goals such as the continuity of essential services vaccination of populations that are most likely to spread flu or the apparent poor immune response to the vaccine among some individuals in vulnerable priority groups42 2006 analysis of pandemic plans from 45 countries found marked variability in proposed vaccine priority schemes in particular with respect to the priority ranking assigned to children further demonstrating the lack of scientific and cultural consensus on this matter43 while about threefourths of state plans discussed vaccine procurement and distribution 12 states appear to have kept their options open and have planned to distribute vaccine or coordinate its distribution according to several different possible procurement scenarios fewer than half of the state plans discussed vaccine storage or security states efforts to plan for vaccine procurement and distribution during pandemic may have been complicated by uncertainty about the ways in which vaccine may be made available to states to date efforts to develop and stockpile candidate prepandemic unmatched prototype vaccines have been federally funded and the vaccines are not commercially available but it is not clear that the federal government would purchase matched vaccine during pandemic while having centralized control could simplify planning efforts it could also carry significant cost for the federal government unless it were possible to use collateral financing sources such as medicare and private health insurance when available to pay for the vaccine the hhs pandemic plan states that during pandemic vaccine would be

setting for pandemic influenza an analysis of national preparedness plans plos medicine vol 3 10 october 17 2006 the study also found variability among countries in their plans to prioritize the use of antiviral drugs crs14 made available through existing commercial channels and distribution mechanisms44 this is the same system that has come under fire during recent shortages of seasonal flu vaccine because of the difficulties faced by public health officials in trying to locate and redirect available vaccine to priority groups in 2006 congress passed the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act pl 109417 which authorizes the secretary of hhs with the voluntary cooperation of manufacturers wholesalers and distributors to track the initial distribution of federally purchased flu vaccine during pandemic45 if pandemic were to spread swiftly vaccine may be pressed into service before standard safety and efficacy tests could be completed such unlicensed vaccine could be used under the food and drug administrations fdas investigational new drug ind provisions46 these include requirements for strict inventory control record keeping informed consent and adverse event tracking all of which would pose an additional challenge for public health officials during vaccination campaign in addition two doses of pandemic flu vaccine may be needed to provide optimal

state plans did not address the implementation of ind protocols for unlicensed antiviral drugs but about half of the plans did mention adverse event tracking which could be useful whether the drugs used are licensed or unlicensed other disease control activities in the united states isolation and quarantine authority is generally based in state rather than federal law50 while isolation and quarantine were crucial in the worldwide response to sars these methods are less likely to be successful in controlling influenza influenza has shorter incubation period than sars and is often contagious in the absence of symptoms or before symptoms appear making it difficult to identify persons who should be quarantined table 5 presents the findings of this analysis regarding the use of isolation quarantine and other socalled nonpharmaceutical interventions npi ie interventions not involving drugs or vaccines during pandemic table 5 other disease control activities of plans that

half of the plans discussed isolation and quarantine procedures whether voluntary or compulsory twenty one plans identified the state official who has authority to compel isolation and quarantine though only two discussed the use of judicial review to assure the protection of civil liberties if such orders were made whether this signals gap in state legal preparedness for public health threats skepticism about the utility of constraining individual movement to limit the spread of pandemic flu or other factors cannot be determined from this analysis since the 2001 terrorist attacks states have been active in revising their public health 50 both isolation and quarantine restrict the movement of those affected but they differ depending on whether an individual has been exposed to disease quarantine or is actually infected isolation persons in isolation may be ill and isolation sometimes occurs in healthcare settings those under quarantine are by definition not ill from the disease in question though other health conditions may complicate the quarantine process for more information see crs report rl33201 federal and state quarantine and isolation authority by kathleen s swendiman and jennifer k elsea crs17 authorities though the scope of authorities regarding disease control still varies from state to state51 only nine plans discussed designated locations in which isolation and quarantine could be carried out and for several of them home was the designated location this comports with the planning assumption that the healthcare workforce could be overwhelmed during pandemic of even modest severity those who were sufficiently ill could receive care under feasible isolation protocols within healthcare facilities these may include alternate facilities which are discussed later in the section on healthcare services those who were exposed but not ill or who were mildly ill would remain at home receiving care from family and friends few plans discussed the use of large congregate isolation or quarantine facilities for pandemic flu fewer than onethird of the plans provided substantive descriptions of large scale social distancing measures such measures include socalled snow days in which communities would close schools cease nonessential operations and enact other protocols that would have the effect of keeping people at home in february 2007 after

message public confidence could erode if neighboring jurisdictions recommended different approaches to school and business closures though each jurisdictions decision may be sound successful

community planning guide february 2007 at httpwwwahrqgovresearchmce crs19 officials who lead pandemic preparedness efforts though there are federal and state efforts to stockpile vaccines drugs ventilators and other supplies the healthcare workforce is likely to be the key limiting factor in ramping up healthcare service delivery during pandemic an influenza pandemic of even limited magnitude has the potential to disrupt the normal workings of the healthcare system in variety of ways these may include deferral of elective medical procedures diversion of patients away from overwhelmed hospital emergency departments and tertiary care facilities protective quarantines of susceptible populations such as residents of longterm care facilities and hoarding theft or blackmarketeering of scarce resources such as vaccines or antiviral drugs the systems usual approaches to mass casualty management involve bringing in additional workers from other states and diverting or evacuating patients to unaffected facilities because flu is communicable disease and because pandemic could affect large areas of the united states simultaneously these approaches may be ineffective or even harmful during pandemic options to expand healthcare capacity during pandemic include stockpiling supplies beforehand with considerable upfront cost and altering standards of care that is implementing policies that change the way medicine is practiced approaches to altered standards of care include providing healthcare at alternate sites such as gymnasiums changing required staffing ratios altering scopes of practice eg permitting nurse to perform certain procedures that normally could only be performed by physician withholding of certain services such as diagnostic tests and rationing of services table 7 presents the findings of this analysis for variables regarding the provision of healthcare services during pandemic table 7 healthcare services of plans that

deployment of the strategic national stockpile sns civilian stockpile of drugs and supplies maintained by cdc for distribution to state officials during emergencies56 states were required to plan and exercise for receipt and distribution of sns contents as condition of their public health preparedness grants this mechanism may be used to distribute vaccines andor antiviral drugs during pandemic but the federal stockpile could not contain the amounts and variety of drugs and medical supplies needed to sustain general healthcare services across the nation during pandemic fewer than half of state plans discussed state or local stockpiling of drugs and supplies or their procurement during pandemic in the event that supply chains were disrupted fewer than half of state plans discussed each of several other approaches to expand healthcare capacity during pandemic including plans for medical surge capacity in general health workforce surge capacity the use of alternate healthcare sites altering standards of care and tracking of capacity and utilization57 while slightly more than half of the plans discussed providing for the mental health and psychosocial support needs of citizens only about onethird of plans addressed this planning element specifically for responders also only onethird of the plans mentioned the management of mass fatalities according to the hhs pandemic plan moderate pandemic could result in an estimated 209000 deaths nationwide and severe pandemic like that in 1918 could result in an estimated 19 million deaths58 other essential services severe pandemic could cause high absenteeism with disruption of essential services supply chains and other consequences beyond the public health and healthcare sectors the secretary of hhs michael leavitt has said if pandemic hits our shores it will affect almost every sector of our society not just health care but transportation systems workplaces schools public safety and more it will require coordinated

and in april 2007 launched series of regional workshops to examine state pandemic planning in number of nonhealth areas61 the workshops were designed to help governors staff and state agencies examine issues such as governance maintenance of essential services and the coordination of response strategies among levels of government and across borders during pandemic table 8 presents the findings of this analysis regarding the continuity of services other than public health and healthcare services during and after pandemic findings show that few state plans mentioned other essential services

and true weaknesses in planning could be magnified as responses unfold the state pandemic flu plans analyzed here reflected their authorship by public health officials many of them addressed core public health functions such as surveillance or vaccine management though specific aspects of these functions were addressed in varying degrees of depth this suggests that challenges remain even in areas that are familiar to public health planners such as developing schemes to prioritize or ration limited medical assets coordinating surveillance to optimize early detection and ongoing disease monitoring and legal liability and civil rights issues associated with disease control measures fewer plans addressed leadership and coordination or the continuity of nonhealth services subjects which may be unfamiliar to public health planners or which may exceed their authority these elements may require stronger engagement by emergency management officials and others in planning this analysis studied pandemic planning at the state level as with any emergency response most of the responsibility rests with local authorities this analysis did not attempt to assess the status of local pandemic planning efforts though such efforts are also likely to pose significant challenges just as public health authority is decentralized to state rather than federal authorities it is also decentralized in some states with local health departments having varying degrees of autonomy further complicating planning efforts62 variability among states in pandemic planning has been noted in another analysis63 the decentralized nature of public health is often cited as an explanation the federal government cannot directly dictate to states what they must do to prepare though it can establish certain requirements as condition of federal preparedness funding some flexibility in those requirements is helpful in allowing states to prepare differently for those threats such as hurricanes earthquakes and wildfires that are likely to affect states differently pandemic on the other hand is more likely to affect states in similar ways that are to some extent predictable this threat may be more amenable to standardized planning approaches and to more directive federal requirements tied to funding but the matter of what the states should do to be prepared for pandemic is not always clear for example uncertainties about the ways in which flu spreads the lack of national consensus in matters of equity in rationing and long tradition of federal deference to states in matters of public health all complicate efforts to set uniform planning requirements for states the crs database analyzed here contains state pandemic plans available as of july 2006 at that point all states had been required to submit pandemic plans to hhs one year earlier and all had done so however the states were not given specific direction regarding the content of the plans that were required in july 2005 and they were not required to update their plans during the subsequent fy2005 funding cycle 62 for more information see crs report rl31719 an overview of the us public health system in the context of emergency preparedness by sarah lister 63 holmberg et crs23 the guidance that accompanied targeted pandemic funding for fy2006 in accordance with congressional report language emphasized exercises assessments assistance to local jurisdictions in their planning efforts and other specific tasks but did not explicitly require that states update their plans if needed to keep them current to certain date64 this may reflect broader trend in disaster preparedness in which planning is seen as the first step toward competent response but the assurance of actual response capability is focused instead on the development and evaluation of exercises rather than on evaluation of plans65 exercises and drills test the ability of jurisdictions to execute their plans and they detect planning gaps consequently assessments of response capability rest not only on assessments of planning but also on assessments of exercise programs and integration of findings into subsequent rounds of planning66 dhs has developed the allhazards homeland security exercise and evaluation program hseep to provide standardized policy methodology and language for designing developing conducting and evaluating exercises67 but it has not published information about the specific application of this approach to pandemic flu preparedness the rand corporation under contract from hhs developed the public health preparedness database which incorporates evaluation criteria to be applied to exercises and searchable database of exercises including orientations tabletop exercises and drills used to evaluate public health preparedness68 the database contains two local exercises specifically for pandemic flu but none at the state level also while pandemic influenza scenarios have been used to exercise specific elements of public health response such as distribution of stockpiled medications there has been national exercise to test multisector multijurisdictional response to flu pandemic 64 the crs
