soap deliverable 15 report on the interpretation of palaeodata using climate simulations contributions from cru fub gkss university of bern and udesam compiled by j m jones and zorita and j m jones gkss research centre one of the main aims of the soap project is the comparison of climate model simulations and palaeoclimate proxy data the combined analysis of proxy and gcm data is essential for reducing the uncertainties in estimates of natural climate variability and for improving numerical models it will help to better understand the interactions among the various components of the climate system to estimate the relative contributions of natural and anthropogenic climate forcings to climate variability and to make scenarios of future climatic changes more reliable the work on sop towards the interpretation of palaeodata using climate simulations has used the socalled pseudoproxy approach this approach uses nonproxy data either instrumental or modelsimulated to mimic the proxy data mann and rutherford grl 29 doi1010292001gl014554 20012002 zorita et 2003 gonzalezrouco and legutke j clim161378 1390 2003 within soap number of such gcmbased pseudoproxy studies have been undertaken where the simulation is used as laboratory to test questionshypotheses on climate reconstruction this report contains the publication where the work is published or in press or short report of work in progress below is brief summary of the contributions grouped by institution followed by table of contents and reference list containing the publications from the contributors and publications cited in this introduction publications of the individual contributions are at the end of each contribution gkss von storch et 2004 used the pseudoproxy approach applied to both the erikechog simulation of the gkss hereafter erik simulation and thenatural forcings and all forcings simulations of hadcm3 to investigate the influence of noise on statistical reconstruction methods including that of mann et 1999 where it was found that past variations may have been at least factor of two larger than indicated by empirical reconstructions commentary was provided on this work by osborn and briffa 2004 see cru below von storch and zorita 2005 also used the pseudoproxy method to address an issue of the mann reconstruction method raised by mcintyre and mckitrick 2005 in the erik simulation the gkss has also undertaken work together with fidel gonzálezrouco of the universidad computense madrid the first stage of this work was an analysis within the erik simulation of the relationship between the terrestrial deep soil temperature and surface temperature gonzálezrouco et 2003 key relationship in boreholebased reconstruction of surface air temperature in gonzálezrouco et 2006 forward models of borehole temperatures were applied to the erik simulation and control simulation with the echog model to test the borehole reconstruction methods cru osborn and briffa 2004 provided commentary to von storch et 2004 where they linked the systematic underestimation of lowfrequency variability to the differing shapes of the variance spectra of the nh temperature and the pseudoproxy data and thus suggest that for climate reconstructions to be optimal on all time scales proxy data must have variance spectra similar to those of the climate data that they aim to reconstruct osborn and briffa together with other coauthors rutherford et 2005 examined the sensitivity of temperature reconstructions to the use of different target variable annual or seasonal temperature target domain hemispheric or extratropical and reconstruction method they found that when the differences in target variable and domain are accounted for the differences in several reconstructions are small and that all reconstructions robustly indicate anomalous warm conditions in the 20th century with respect to the past millennium fub the fub investigated the influence of different decisions makde during the reconstruction process bürger et 2006 using the erik simulation they then investigated the influence of these decisions using the the proxy data of mann et year1998 bürger and cubasch 2005 both the model based and proxybased study found wide spread of possible millennial temperature histories which they attribute to the fact that that the training variations are not representative of the full millennium and that the reconstruction methods are notregularized to actually compare the simulated and proxyreconstructed northern hemisphere temperature histories g bürger has correlated and regressed against the northern hemisphere annual mean land surface temperature anomalies as simulated in erik and the hadcm3 simulation onto eight recent proxy based nh temperature reconstructions where he finds that the echog simulation better fits the proxies than does the hadcm3 simulation university of berne the university of berne together with udesam below have utilized the pseudoproxy approach to investigate data quality issues of proxybased reconstructions from their groups in this case the reconstruction of european continental temperature of luterbacher et 2004 in the erik simulation küttel et page n investigated the skill of the reconstruction method together with the dependency on the quality of the predictors and their availability over space and time udesam the work of udesam used the pseudoproxy approach applied to the erik simulation to investigate issues regarding reconstruction of pdsi for the mediterranean region for the period 13502000 ad using tree ring width and density records nicault et in preparation they explored firstly the influence of low number of proxies in their reconstructions as in the early part of their reconstruction here they found that before 1600ad large part of the reconstruction region has not enough information to produce reliable reconstruction they also investigated the influence of
