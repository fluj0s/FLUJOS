the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 created refundable tax credit for firsttime homebuyers firsttime homebuyers generally include individuals who have not had present interest in principal residence within three years before buying the new property the credit is based on 10 of the purchase price of the principal residence but may not exceed 7500 the credit may be reduced or eliminated for married taxpayers with income over 150000 or other taxpayers with income over 75000 to be eligible for the credit taxpayers must purchase property after april 8 2008 and before july 1 2009 the property must be used as the taxpayers principal residence the credit is refundable but also must be repaid therefore it is similar to an interestfree loan the payback period is fifteen years but does not begin until two years after the purchase so long as the taxpayer continues to own and use the property as principal residence the payback would be 500 each year if the credit claimed had been 7500 however if the taxpayer sells the property or ceases to use it as principal residence the entire outstanding credit generally becomes due for that tax year repayment may be waived if the taxpayer dies or if the sale of the property does not generate gain under the special statutory calculation acceleration of the repayment will not be triggered if the property is transferred between spouses or between ex spouses incident to divorce involuntary conversion will also prevent acceleration of repayment if the property is replaced within two years taxpayers must file tax return in each year in which repayment of the credit is required even if they are not otherwise required to file tax return for that year

congress proposed tax credits as means of encouraging taxpayers to purchase principal residence the bills differed in some ways and were similar in others each required taxpayers to use the new property as their principal residence each also li mited the credit to purchases within prescribed time framegenerally one year or less the maximum amount allowed for the credit ranged from 7000 1 to 150002 with the largest amount credited over threeyear period for one bill only property that had been foreclosed would have qualified the buyer for credit3 for four others actual foreclosure was not required instead for selleroccupied property the sellers acquisition mortgage would have to be in default status for the buyer to qualify for the credit4 only one proposal required link between the tax credit and some financial distress connected to the property 5 it however limited the credit to firsttime homebuyersa term that as defined in the bill includes some who have previously owne d their own principal residence this was the approach that was adopted by congress in the housing assistance tax act of 2008 this act was included as division c in the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 which became law on july 30 20086 as enacted the credit is available only for purchases made after april 8 2008 and before july 1 2009 unlike the other proposed housing credits the firsttime homebuyer credit is refundable7 unlike other existing tax credits and the other proposed housing credits in most cases the new firsttime homebuyer tax credit is also repayable

threeyear period does not disqualify an individual for the tax credit exam ples of such property include vacation homes and rental or investment properties this definition of firsttime homebuyer is less lenient than the one used for the credit for first time homebuyers in the district of columbia dc credit which requires present interest for only one year prior to the purchase8 it is also less lenient than the one used to exclude early distributions from qualified retirement plans from the 10 additional tax9 in that case first time homebuyer is defined as one who has not had present interest in principal residence within the twoyear period ending on the date the new property is acquired

principal residence the term is said to have the same meaning as when used in section 121 10 of the internal revenue code irc section 121 provides explicit definition but uses the term and refers to situations in which property that might otherwise not be thought of as principal residence will nonetheless be considered one11 however treasury regulation provides guidance regarding property that may be considered principal residence12 according to regulation 11211 to be principal residence property must first be used as residence facts and circumstances determine whether property is used as residence the regulation notes that houseboat house trailer or the house or apartment that the taxpayer is entitled to occupy as tenantstockholder in cooperative housing corporation13 may be residence but personal property that is not fixture under local law is not included taxpayer may have more than one residence but can have only one principal residence when there is more than one residence determining which of the residences is the principal one depends on facts and circumstances some of the factors that can be relevant are where the taxpayer works where the taxpayers family lives where the taxpayer banks where the taxpayer attends religious services where the taxpayer belongs to recreational clubs the taxpayers usual mailing address for bills and the addresses used on income tax returns drivers licenses car registrations and voter registrations when taxpayer relocates due to employment the residence in the new location may or may not be the taxpayers principal residence if the taxpayers family remains in the old location temporarily until house is sold lease expires or school year is completed the residence in the new location could be considered the taxpayers principal residence however if the taxpayer leaves the family indefinitely in the old location and lives in small dwelling in the new location it becomes more likely that the old residence will remain the taxpayers principal residence thus if the taxpayers spouse and four children remain in large rental property in another location small condominium purchased in the new location might not 8 26 usc

defines purchase as generally being any acquisition15 but excludes certain acquisitions as written the law may be bit ambiguous it states the following 36c3 purchase in generalthe term purchase means any acquisition but only if i the property is not acquired from person related to the person acquiring such property and ii the basis of the property in the hands of the person acquiring such property is not determined i in whole or in part by reference to the adjusted basis of such property in the hands of the person from whom acquired or ii under section 1014a relating to property acquired from decedent this can be read to mean that purchases from related parties do not qualify as purchases eligible for the tax credit if either of the basis provisions in 36c3aii applies but could qualify if purchased from related party at full fair market value however the provision could also be read to mean that any purchase from related party is unqualified and that any purchase even if not from related party is unqualified if either of the basis provisions applies 16 the firsttime homebuyer credit for district of columbia has similar provision 1400ce2 purchase in generalthe term purchase means any acquisition but only if i the property is not acquired from person whose relationship to the person acquiring it would result in the disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707b but in applying section 267b and c for purposes of this section paragraph 4 of section 267c shall be treated as providing that the family of an individual shall include only his spouse ancestors and lineal descendants and ii the basis of the property in the hands of the person acquiring it is not determined 14 26 usc 36d4 15 26 usc 36c3a 16 for discussion of basis including times when the owners basis

property in the hands of the person from whom acquired or ii under section 1014a relating to property acquired from decedent recognized tax commentary has interpreted this provision of the dc credit to mean that purchases from related parties never qualify for that credit17 however it interpreted the similar provision in 36 to mean that purchases from related parties were only disqualified if either of the basis provisions applies18 the instructions for form 8859 which is used to claim the dc credit on the federal tax return advise taxpayers you cannot claim the credit if you acquired your home from certain related persons or by gift or inheritance

purchased28 however taxpayers who purchase principal residence in the first six months of 2009 may choose to treat the property as if it had been purchased in 200829 taxpayer purchasing an eligible property before filing the 2008 tax return would be able to claim the credit on the original return for 2008 if taxpayer had already filed the 2008 tax return an amended return could be filed to claim the credit the advantage to claiming the credit on the 2008 tax return is that the credit could produce refund sooner than if it were claimed on the 2009 return in the case of taxpayer who would otherwise have balance due on the 2008 return claiming the credit for 2008 would reduce or eliminate that balance due the disadvantage of claiming the credit on the 2008 return is that the repayment period would begin one year sooner taxpayers buying qualifying property in 2009 could effectively receive their credit before filing their 2009 return by adjusting the amount they pay in federal taxes for the remainder of the year for taxpayers with wage income this can be done by filing new form w4 with the employer increasing withholding allowances to adjust withhold ings so that the total withheld for the year is reduced by an amount equal to their anticipated credit taxpayers who must pay quarterly estimated taxes can make similar adjustments to their quarterly payments however to avoid possible penalty on underpayment of estimated taxes they should adjust the payments equally rather than reducing the payment in early quarters by the entire amount of the credit

statute33 this is term that is used for other credits however for those credits recapture generally is required only when the taxpayer ceases to qualify for the credit34 in contrast the entire amount of the allowed firsttime homebuyer credit must be repaid even if the taxpayer continues to live in the property as principal residence for 30 years

allowed firsttime homebuyer tax credit on the taxpayers tax returns for each of fifteen consecutive tax years35 for taxpayers who were allowed the maximum credit 500 would be added to their tax return as liability in each of fifteen consecutive tax years this recapture begins two years after the tax year in which the property is purchased or deemed to be purchased36 since recapture is reported on the taxpayers tax return the taxpayer is required to file tax return for each year in which repayment is due even if otherwise not required to file return37 recapture may be accelerated if the property is sold or is longer used by the taxpayer as the taxpayers principal residence38 generally this means that any allowed credit that has not already been recaptured must be recaptured in full on the tax return for the tax year in which the house is sold or otherwise ceases to be used as the taxpayers principal residence there are two situations in which repayment is waived completely there are two other situations in which repayment is not accelerated when the taxpayer ceases to use the property as the principal residence

g350g561determining the taxable gain for properties for which the firsttime homebuyer tax credit was allowed however another calculation is required to determine whether the outstanding credit must be recaptured in this case the outstanding credit is subtracted from the adjusted basis of the property reducing it the taxpayer must use this amount as the adjusted basis for new calculation of gain to determine whether the outstanding credit must be recaptured in the year of sale if the new calculation results in gain the outstanding credit up to the amount of gain must be recaptured for this reason taxpayers who make improvements to their property would be welladvised to keep careful record of the costs incurred since those costs would increase their adjusted basis in the property and possibly eliminate the need to repay the credit when the property is sold example 1outstanding credit must be recaptured taxpayer purchases house for 250000 and reports 7500 as the firsttime homebuyer credit on form 1040 in the year of purchase two years later before repaying any of the credit and without doing anything that would change the basis of the property the taxpayer moves to another state and must sell the property the sales price is 265000 expenses of sale are 15000 the taxpayer has gain from the sale for income tax purposes 265000 sales price 250000 adjusted basis 15000 sales expense 0 gain however to determine the extent to which the credit must be repaid another gain calculation is required for this calculation the propertys basis is reduced by the amount of the credit that has not yet been repaid therefore for this calculation the adjusted basis is 242500 250000 7500 the outstanding credit using this number there is gain of 7500 so the entire 7500 credit must be recaptured on the tax return for the year in which the property is sold 265000 sales price 242500 adjusted basis 15000 sales expense 7500 gain example 2outstanding credit must be partially recaptured assume the same facts as in the first example except that the sales price is 260000 and the property is sold four years after purchase for both the second and third years after purchase 500 of the 7500 credit would have been recaptured on the taxpayers tax returns each year thus 1000 has been recaptured and the outstanding credit is 6500 again for tax purposes there is gain 260000 sales price 250000 adjusted basis 15000 sales expense 5000 loss httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34664g22g145g142g561g8g146g155g156g157g556g22g146g150g142g561g10g152g150g142

g351g561however the basis must be reduced by the outstanding credit to determine the amount of outstanding credit that must be recaptured since 1000 has been recaptured only 6500 of the credit is still outstanding when the basis is reduced by 6500 the result is 243500 250000 6500 using this number in the gain calculation there is 1500 gain therefore 1500 of the outstanding credit must be recaptured on the tax return in the year of sale but the remaining 5000 will never be recaptured 260000 sales price 243500 adjusted basis 15000 sales expense 1500 gain example 3no recapture of outstanding credit use the same facts as in example 2 except that the sales expense is 17000 again there would be gain for tax purposes 260000 sales price 250000 adjusted basis 17000 sales expense 7000 loss again the basis as reduced by the outstanding credit would be 243500 2500006500 in this case however the gain calculation to determine the required recapture of the outstanding credit would result in gain therefore none of the outstanding credit would be recaptured in the year of sale 260000 sales price 243500 adjusted basis 17000 sales expense 500 loss

provision is clearrecapture of any outstanding credit is waived for tax years ending after the death of the taxpayer for property that was purchased by more than one taxpayer it appears that only the individual decedents portion of the outstanding credit is free from recapture even if the credit was claimed by married couple on joint return the statute states that half of the credit allowed on joint return is allocated to each spouse for purposes of the recapture provision therefore it seems likely that for these couples only half of the outstanding credit will be free from recapture after the death of one spouse where unmarried individuals purchased property together and allocated the credit between them each has separate repayment obligation based on the credit claimed the death of one of the coowners would not change the remaining owner s own repayment obligation similarly when httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34664g22g145g142g561g8g146g155g156g157g556g22g146g150g142g561g10g152g150g142

domain it is involuntarily converted an involuntary conversion also occurs when property owner agrees to sell property that is under threat of condemnationwhich means that the property will be taken by eminent domain if the owner does not agree to sell in each of these situations the taxpayer will cease to use the property as the principal residence however recapture will not be accelerated if new principal residence is acquired within two years after the original property was sold or ceased being used as principal residence 43 the new principal residence would be substituted for the one that was involuntarily converted and recapture of the outstanding credit would proceed along the 15year scheduled payback period just as if there had been disruption in usage note that the new principal residence cannot be property that was owned by the taxpayer before the qualifying residence was involuntarily converted

property can be freely transferred between spouses with recognition of gain or loss transfers between former spouses enjoy this benef it only when the transfer is incident to the divorce between the two44 the recapture provisions of the firsttime homebuyer tax credit allow such transfers to occur without accelerating recapture of the outstanding credit even when one of the parties ceases to use the property as principal residence45 additionally the party who transferred the property is relieved of all subsequent repayment obligations the party to whom the property was transferred becomes responsible for both the yearly recapture of the outstanding credit as well as accelerated recapture if the property is later sold or ceases to be used as principal residence there is parallel provision to allow unmarried coowners to transfer the repayment obligations to another owner if the property is transferre d to the other owner additionally for those taxpayers their own outstanding
