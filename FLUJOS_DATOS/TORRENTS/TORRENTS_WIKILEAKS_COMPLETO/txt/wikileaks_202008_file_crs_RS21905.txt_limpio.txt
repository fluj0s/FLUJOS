july 31 work program for completing multilateral trade negotiations in the doha development agenda dda includes an overall decision to complete the negotiations launched in doha qatar in november 2001 with annexes that lay out negotiating frameworks for agriculture and other dda issues1 wto member countries failed to reach such an agreement at their fifth ministerial conference in cancun mexico in september 2003 agreement now means that negotiations will continue into 1 the framework agreement known as the doha work programme decision adopted by the general council on august 1 2004 can be viewed at httpwwwwtoorgenglishtratop_e dda_eddadraft_31jul04_epdf congressional research service the library of congress crs2 the next phase to determine negotiating modalities failure to agree on framework conversely would have created uncertainty about prospects for concluding the dda and about the viability of the wto as global forum for negotiating further trade liberalization according to several economic analyses failure to further liberalize world trade would mean foregone opportunities for economic gains for developing and developed countries alike2 other analysis suggests however that trade liberalization also would impose adjustment burdens on many agricultural sectors including some commodity sectors in developed countries3 the agriculture framework the agriculture framework annex of the july 31 decision addresses the three pillars of agricultural trade liberalization identified in the 2001 doha ministerial declaration substantial reductions in tradedistorting domestic support the phaseout with view to total elimination of all export subsidies and substantial improvements in market access4 the framework now becomes the basis for establishing specific formulas schedules end dates and other parameters modalities for achieving those objectives httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21905 during the next phase of negotiations now underway domestic support the framework agreement provides that reductions in overall tradedistorting support will be accomplished using tiered or banded approach the tiered formula will be applied to achieve harmonization in the levels of support ie the wto member countries having higher levels of tradedistorting domestic support will make greater overall reductions as down payment on the overall cut the framework calls for 20 reduction from bound maximum permitted levels of support in the first year after negotiations are completed not only will member countries make an overall reduction in support but separate reduction commitments will be made for the components of tradedistorting support ie amber box most tradedistorting minimis category of spending now exempted from cuts if it accounts for less than 5 of the value of production and blue box 2 world bank global economic prospects realizing the development promise of the doha agenda 2004 this world bank study estimates that deal to lower global trade barriers

wtoorgenglishtratop_edda_edda_ehtmdohadeclaration crs3 payments based on fixed areas and yields fixed level of production or fixed number of livestock member countries may make greater than negotiated reductions in each component of support in order to achieve the overall required cut in trade distorting support amber box support will be reduced using harmonizing tiered or banded approach and productspecific amber box support will be capped at average levels according to methodology to be negotiated the definition of the blue box will be modified to include direct payments that do not require production eg us counter cyclical support and capped at 5 of member countrys average total value of agricultural production during an historical period additional blue box disciplines will be negotiated minimis spending also will be reduced according to formula to be negotiated nontrade distorting measures green box will be reviewed to ensure that they have or at most minimal trade distorting effects or effects on production developing countries will receive special and differential treatment for all types of trade distorting support in the form of longer implementation periods and lower reduction commitments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21905 the harmonizing approach in the agriculture framework suggests that others notably the european union eu would have to cut tradedistorting support more than would the united states in the eu case its bound level of amber box support is currently depending on exchange rates around 80 billion while the us bound level is 19 billion according to us trade negotiators the united states should have difficulty in meeting the aim of cutting the sum of tradedistorting support levels by 20 in the first year as reductions would be made from bound or permitted rather than applied or actual levels5 the us dept of agriculture usda estimates that the us bound level of domestic support could be as high as 49 billion the current us bound level of support for amber box spending plus estimates of the future bound levels of minimis and blue box spending while actual spending could be considerably less rendering the 20 cut in the first year meaningless for the united states however depending on the outcome of the negotiations future cuts could be higher some in the 108th congress expressed opposition to cuts in safetynet programs put in place by the 2002 farm bill as would be required by the agriculture framework agreement6 export competition the agriculture framework stipulates that by the end date to be negotiated wto member countries will eliminate export subsidies export credits credit guarantees or insurance programs with repayment periods beyond 180 days terms and conditions for export credits not in accordance with disciplines to be agreed including inter alia interest payments minimum interest rates and minimum premium requirements trade distorting practices of exporting state trading

press release dated august 3 2004 sen tom daschle crs4 aid not in conformity with disciplines to be agreed including disciplines to prevent commercial displacement developing country wto members will benefit from longer implementation periods for phasing out export subsidies with differential treatment for export credit programs provided in favor of leastdeveloped and net foodimporting countries stes in developing countries which enjoy special privileges to preserve domestic price stability and ensure food security will receive special consideration for maintaining monopoly status the elimination of eu export subsidies has been longstanding objective of us agricultural trade policy as has requiring greater transparency in stes such as the canadian wheat board in exchange for agreeing to the elimination of its export subsidies however the eu demanded and got agreement that disciplines would be negotiated for all forms of export subsidies including us export credit guarantees and food aid usdas export credit guarantee programs which have provided guarantees for about 4 billion of agricultural exports annually in recent years would be substantially altered by the agreement as presently constituted these programs can provide credit guarantees from 180 days to 10 years7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21905 us food aid for humanitarian relief and development projects eg pl 480 title ii donations which meet the criterion of not displacing commercial sales appear to be unaffected by the framework agreement earlier versions of the framework implied that commodity food aid would be eliminated in favor of cash grants however the framework does indicate that the question of providing food aid exclusively in fully grant form will be addressed in the negotiations the role of international organizations visavis wto member countries food aid programs will also be addressed in the negotiations market access the agriculture framework calls for all wto member countries except the least developed countries ldcs to reduce import tariffs using tiered formula harmonization of tariff levels will be achieved through deeper cuts in higher tariffs tariff reductions will be made from bound not applied rates higher tariffs will be subject to deeper cuts with some flexibility for importsensitive products the number of tiers bands and the tariff reduction for each band remain to be negotiated prerequisite of modalities for reducing tariffs is agreement on formula for converting specific tariffs eg cents per kilogram into ad valorem equivalents tariffs expressed in percentages wto countries may designate number to be negotiated of sensitive products for which substantial improvement in market access must be achieved through combination of tariff quota increases and tariff reductions applied to each product developing countries will be able to designate number of products as special products based on criteria of food security livelihood security and rural development needs these special products will be eligible for more flexible treatment as regards market access special safeguard mechanism ssm will be established for developing countries while special agricultural safeguard ssg for developed countries as currently provided for in the uruguay round agreement remains under negotiation safeguards permit reversion to previous tariff levels if imports surge 7 details on usdas export credit guarantee programs are at httpwwwfasusdagovexcredits crs5 other market access issues to be negotiated include tariff escalation where value added products from developing countries receive higher tariffs than unprocessed products and the erosion of trade preferences for developing countries the framework declares that developed countries and developing countries in position to do so should provide dutyfree and quota free market access for products of the ldcs although the agreement is less specific on market access than on the two other pillars the united states succeeded in getting number of important principles into the agriculture framework these include harmonization of tariffs deeper cuts in higher tariffs single approach to improving market access for both developed and developing countries alike and applying the principle of substantial improvement to all including sensitive products however the united states yielded greater flexibility to the eu and group of developedindustrialized countries eg japan switzerland norway south korea in their selection of importsensitive products market access conditions for special products from developing countries also remain under negotiation some maintain that the market access provisions are not as ambitious as proposed by the united states in its comprehensive negotiating proposal8 but others maintain that the frameworks approach to tariff cuts and market opening is stronger than the proposal that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21905 was under consideration during the cancun ministerial conference9 cotton although cotton was not mentioned in the doha ministerial declaration number of african cotton producing and exporting countries succeeded in getting into the framework their proposal for eliminating all tradedistorting cotton subsidies and providing compensation for economic losses of african cotton producers while subsidies were phased out10 the united states while not agreeing with the african proposal worked with the african countries on formulation in the framework to address the cotton initiative11 the framework stresses the importance of the cotton initiative provides that work on cotton will be carried out under all three pillars and provides that the dda will work to achieve ambitious results expeditiously cotton is the only commodity specifically mentioned in the framework singling out cotton is an indication of the crucial role developing countries played in the framework negotiations as the wto operates on the basis of consensus each of its 147 member countries had to agree to the framework before it could be adopted disagreement over cotton could have jeopardized agreement on the entire framework ultimately the africans agreed to keep negotiations on cotton within the agriculture negotiations while 8 the 2000 us comprehensive negotiating proposal for wto agriculture negotiations can

rs21712 the african cotton initiative and wto agriculture negotiations crs6 the united states committed to achieve ambitious results expeditiously and both endorsed the framework with these provisions frustrated by the pace of negotiations on cotton the african producing countries have proposed accelerating the elimination of cotton subsides and the provision of compensation for adverse market effects the united states maintains its position that changes in cotton subsidies should be part of an overall dda agriculture agreement12 us cotton subsidies are also threatened by brazils successful challenge to them in wto dispute settlement13 next steps the work program does not establish new deadline for completing the dda originally january 1 2005 but does fix december 2005 as the date for the sixth wto ministerial conference to be held in hong kong agriculture negotiations in the modalities phase are proving less difficult than the ones just completed on the framework if modalities are agreed to by july 2005 they would be on the agenda of the hong kong ministerial with agreement on agriculture modalities dda negotiations could be completed during 2006 assuming agreements in other negotiating areas httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21905 if dda negotiations do result in trade agreement then congress could presumably take up legislation to implement it under trade promotion authority tpa or fasttrack procedures title xxi of pl 107210 under fasttrack if the president meets the trade negotiating objectives and satisfies consultation and notification requirements in pl 107 210 then congress would consider legislation to implement trade agreement with limited debate amendments and with an up or down vote tpa however covers trade agreements signed by june 1 2005 twoyear extension is possible if the president requests it which he has done and congress does not disapprove14 if the extension is granted then the effective deadline for us participation in the dda round and for congressional consideration of implementing legislation becomes june 2007 that time frame also coincides with the expiration of the 2002 farm bill in 2007 pl 107171 farm bill changes may be needed to meet us commitments in final dda agreement on agriculture 12 the us and cotton in washington trade daily vol 14 86 may 2 2005 13 see crs report rl32571 usbrazil wto cotton subsidy dispute 14 2005
