monopolization were not successful eg s 1167 93d congress sponsored by senator philip hart 10 ie predatory pricing or tying the purchase of an unwanted product to the purchase of one over which the seller has monopoly in this respect note cases filed against microsoft and intel by doj and the ftc discussed infra beginning at p 4 11 the power that for example automobile or softdrink manufacturers who admittedly produce nonstandardized differentiated products have over their trademarked products is not the power that makes an illegal monopoly 351 us at 393section 2 of the sherman act prohibits both the monopolization and attempted monopolization of interstate or foreign trade or commerce3 section 7 of the clayton act prohibits mergers or acquisitions where in any line of commerce or any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country th effect of such transaction may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create monopoly4 section 5 of the federal trade commission ftc act pr ohibits unfair acts in commerce5 shorthand definition of monopoly is t he power to control prices or exclude competition6 the significance of the ability to exclude competition is however as is the ability to control prices in the supposed leterious effect of the lack of competition on consumers who are presumed to benefit from the existence of largely competitive markets and not on the excluded competitors the antitrust injury requirement obligates complainants to demonstrate as threshold matter that the challenged conduct has had an actual adverse effect on competition as whole in the relevant market to prove it has been harmed as an individual competitor will not suffice7 it is axiomatic that the antitrust laws were passed for the protection of competition not competitors 8 there is concept of fault monopo lization in united states antitrust law9 absent finding by court of guilty behavior10 therefore there can be finding of monopolization finding of monopoly power does not by itself necessarily equate to finding of the monopolization prohibited by either section 7 of the clayton act or section 2 of the sherman act11 or the unfair practices prohibited by section 5 of the ftc act practically then there must be determination of the markets within whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20241crs3 12 united states v ei dupont nemours c 351 us 377 1956 is considered landmark monopolization case there in order to determine whether duponts dominance in the cellophane wrapping market amounted to unlawful monopolization it was necessary for the court to define product market that included but was larger than cellophane wrapping before it could ultimately determine whether dupont controlled the price and compe tition in the market for such part of trade or commerc as it is charged with monopolizing id at 392 ie whether there was significant enough compe tition from noncellophane flexible wrapping materials to dilute duponts admitted monopoly in the cellophane wrapping market the monopoly enjoyed by dupont in the cellophane wr apping market was found not to amount to unlawful monopolization of the mark et for flexible packaging materials despite cellophanes advantages it has to meet competition from other materials in every one of its uses we conclude that cellophanes inte rchangeability with the other mate rials mentioned suffices to make it part of this flexible packaging material market 351 us at 398 400 13 merger standards under us antitrust law aba monograph 7 1981 14 pitofsky robert proposals for revised united states merger enforcement in global economy 81 georgetown law journal 195 205 note 3 december 1992 15 see fn 2 supra the guidelines were issued in 1962 by the antitrust division and revised in 1982 and 1984 they were substantially modified and issued jointly by doj and the ftc 1992 and revised by the agencies in 1997 the 1984 ve rsion indicated that the department would consider foreign as well as domestic competition in determining the geographic market for the products or services of potential merger 234 the 1992 version states that the unifying theme of the guidelines is that mergers should not be permitted to create or enhance market power or to facilitate its exercise 01 the 1997 revision dealt only with the agencies treatment of the socalled efficiency defense merger that is on balance anticompetitive will not generally be saved by claimed or actual efficiencies nor likely be approved by the reviewing agencies 4 although the guidelines are not binding on either the antitrust division or the ftc or for that matter the cour ts they are indicative of the agencies thinking with respect to the competitive concerns inherent in all market transactionsthe alleged monopolist operates ie the relevant product ma rket andor the relevant geographic market in order to determine the extent to which he is actually capable of exercising any meaningful pricecontrolling or competitionexcluding power or the extent to which he has already done so12 at least four views of economic markets provide some context to the relevant market and subsequent monopo lization deter minations free market which holds that market forces produce the best alloca tion of resources and b the nonanecdotal evidence indicates correlation between concentration and profits centrist which is somewhat similar to the free market view that size and distribution dont necessarily signify the intensity of competition but does believe that collusion is more likely in concentrated markets moderate structuralist which emphasizes that the greater the number of competitors in market the more likely there will be downward pressure on prices and strict structuralist which holds that competition is directly and inversely related to concentration levels13 the bottomline goal of us antitrust policy should be to encourage producers to make and sell better products at lower prices and pass those savings on to consumers14 the jointly issued horizontal merger guidelines15 were promulgated in order to inform the business community of the agen cies doj ftc governing philosophy and analytical framework when th ey are reviewing the permissibility of proposed mergershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20241crs4 16 merger guidelines 01 17 joel i klein assistant attorney general antitrust

underlying policy assump tions section of the introduction states unequivocally that mergers should not be permitted to create or enhance market power or to facilitate its exercise but goes on to note that while competitively harmful mergers will be challenged there is larger universe of mergers that is either competitively beneficial or neutral16 emphasizing that distinction the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division in 1998 testified sometimes people complain about merger solely based on its size i want to make clear however that antitrust analysis focuses on the specific competitive harms that may be associated with particular merger not on its size in the abstract thus for example big merger may not be challenged because the merging parties are not competitors or potential competitors of one another and the merger does not raise any vertical antitrust issues at the same time we may challenge smaller merger that involves the only two firms that make particular product the key for our review is whether the merger will harm consumers not the sheer size of the corporate entities involved 17 two relatively recent cases clearly illust rate the antitrust enforcement agencies currently existing differentiation between the existence of monopoly power and active monopolization the department of justice suit against microsoft18 and the ftcs complaint against intel19 in microsoft the antitrust division stated that microsoft possesses and for several ears has possessed monopoly power in the market for personal computer operating systems20 but filed its action not to challenge microsofts monopoly status but rather the companys actions to protect its valuable windows monopoly against potential competitive threats and to extend its operating system monopoly into other software markets microsoft has engaged in series of anticompetitive activities microsofts conduct includes agreements tying other microsoft soft ware products to

app eals court supported the district court finding that microsoft is in fact monopolist it neve rtheless refused to find that the bundling of ie with the operating syst em could therefore be characterized as per violation the court was willing to suspe nd judgment on the issue in light of the dearth of case law addressing it and the relative lack of actual experience with the arrangements the poor fit between the sepa rateproducts test nd the facts of this case24 and so felt compelled to remand the per finding to the distri ct court for further consideration in light of its opinion that the tying activity at issue could at most be considered violation of the antitrust laws because unreasonable under the rule of reason25 the district court determined that microsoft had maintained

of microsofts lawful monopol power in furtherance of unlawful monopolization27 in the charges against intel corporation by the ftc the commission acted to restrain the pattern of conduct that violates section 5 of the federal trade commission act 15 usc 4528 and not because of intel s acknowledged monopoly status29 as monopolist intel can compete by producing better cheaper and more attractive products it cannot act to cement its monopoly power by preventing other firms from challenging its dominance intel has acted illegally it has used its monopoly power to impede innovation and stifle compe tition by denying necessary technical information to certai n customers in retaliation for their suits against intel to enforce their the customer s patents allegedly infringed by intel30 some observers view the present enforcement posture as evidence of the flexibility and workability of the federal antitrust laws although it is cer tainly possible to disagree with the ways in which the antitrust enforcement agencies have acted with respect to particular instances of proposed mergers or visavis sp ecific alleged monopolists given the existing rationale of the antitrust laws however it is difficult to disagree with their policy of prohibiting only those transactionsac tivities which they believe dowill in fact harm competition on the other hand cong ress is free to reexamine the
