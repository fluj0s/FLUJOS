6211c13 shspec211 entrance to cases lrh starts by referring to recent bulletin hcob 11nov62 3gaxx straightening up 3gaxx cases the subject of entrance to cases is becoming broad and encyclopedic there is new routine r321 see also p 356 below the original 3ga was highly workable but insufficiently delineated routine 321 is 3ga plus all the improvements like tiger drilling it would probably work on any case that was wellprepared but we cant count on case being wellprepared preparation would be done with cchs and prepchecks there have been frailties in the preparation of cases that have made it necessary to develop things that werent really vital we rediscover havingness every six months it seems it has been six months since the last time matter how tricky your auditing question is if the pc isnt there it wont reach him or alter his case unusual solution will get to him either so when faced with the unusual do the usual the very ordinary the tricky developmental work has had uses and has brought us forward on wellprepared case tiger drilling the 850goal list is easy the pc doesnt protest all the time the pc who is not wellprepared isnt doing the commands and has dirty needle he never completes the auditing cycle the reads you get while tiger drilling arent coming from the po confronting anything they are coming from some automaticity even if the case is wellprepared you could still have difficulty doing r321 the goal could be absent from the list or on the list but so unreal to the pc that it would never answer up if confronted so you need process that overcomes the pcs enturbulated pt environment etc this process is 3gaxx 3gaxx is designed to totally grab the pcs attention and interest and to keep it where the rock slam is it will always be true that rock slam will produce interest it is sort of forced insessionness interest follows rock slam you are overwhelming the socalled natural defenses of the mind you use the rock slam channel find the goal find the pairs of items all along the channel by their rock slams you can pretty well overwhump almost anything in the pc if you can get on the trail of rock slam you will be asked to do miracles to audit in noisy environments on poorlyprepared cases for that you need very powerful processes 3gaxx is what you need it is designed to capture the pcs interest so much that he can only tell you what is in front of his face there are three bank elements that are handled in 3gaxx 1 the rock slam channel 2 the goals channel 3 set of pairs that lead from the dimmest beginnings of the gpm up to the tiniest pair in pt the route between these pairs is travelled from pt back to the beginning the procedure is to 1 find the goal and then 2 find items that have built up by the existence of this goal this is path marked by rock slams 3gaxx has rules such as the rule that the pcs interest follows the rock slam since this is true the pc has choice but to be in session suppose the pc is protesting midruds whenever you get off the rock slam channel this would be because he is only in session as long as you are on the rock slam channel where he cant help being interested it could also be because he has been beaten with midruds to point where he cant stand them when you are getting his prehav level items by listing ww would prehav level the answers come ripping off his circuits when havingness is low circuits key in someone who is in indifferent contact with pt has his circuits keyed in circuits are gpm items or their cousins aunts or uncles 3gaxx deals out the circuits that the pc would normally be using anyhow so he has choice but to give them to you and thus you do get an auditing cycle you start out with dynamic assessment see pp 305308 for the general procedure use these questions 1 what isnt part of existence 2 who or what have you detested 3 who or what would you prefer not to associate with in listing and nulling these follow the rock slam note these commands might be the precursors of later pts rundown tech lrh recognizes the enturbulative effect of environmental factors on auditing though as yet there appears to be official form of ethics handling there seems to be an attempt to handle all of it through tech so you are doing 3gaxx and now you call his attention to pt to get midruds in and you have godawful time nothing quite cleans up if you have goofed and invalidated one of his items you will really be in the soup since he is allergic to pt which is where he would have to be to clean it up so process as beefy as 3gaxx must be done with expertise particularly when used on pc who is not well set up for it you have leeway for error when you have overwhelmed the natural defenses of the mind that is why untrained auditors shouldnt try to run these highpowered processes with r321 you can find the pcs goal whether he is ready to find it or not by entering the case with dynamic assessment by rock slam an additional method of entering the case is roll your own prehav see hcob 7nov62 roll your own prehav the prehav scale to be exact must be given by the pc in his own words so find the prehav level and ask the represent question get list and find the item which will be his perfect individual prehav level this procedure gets rid of the necessity for huge long assessments and you will probably wind up with rock slam this way you will list who or what would do that and get terminal or oppterm it doesnt matter which the assessment can be done simply by calling each level assessing by elimination down to few items tiger drilling those items to one and saying consider committing overts against _______ this should turn on the slam so you get the item which is the protagonist or antagonist in the game which pursues from the fellow having had goal in the first place they are like pair of dumbbells there is also another pair of dumbbells the notpair pinned to the positive items electronically eg ww would smoke ww would not smoke ww would oppose smoking ww would oppose not smoking positive negative you can however safely ignore the negative items you could find the item get the oppose represent oppose that represent that etc etc you are not trying to clear somebody this way although you could theoretically by going back item by item down the rock slam channel it would be hard though lacking the goal it is easier to go down aways pick up the goal and then list it unburden the goal then find it and work with it if you kept discharging the case and at the same time disorienting the case you would get further and further from finding the goal you would really just be enturbulating the case say if you kept giving the pc items that didnt slam he would keep getting fuzzier and more confused this could occur when you went by detested person etc see p 333 see also p 243 above there is pair there which you have ignored if you go on to the dynamic assessment and the represent etc so your rule is to make pair when you get an item that rockslams you oppose it if it is still hot you represent it this isnt all that smooth when the pc is not clear the items can be out of order you have to pick your way through it the test by which you go is what is still slamming it will slam if you run get the idea of committing overts against itwithholding from it if it still slams it hasnt been opposed even if you think you got the oppterm the gpm straightens out only because you have gotten the pc to recognize the matter energy space and time that the item consists of it has been recognized and placed where it should be placed the pc has seen what it is opposed by and has gotten sensible about it this goes back to the earliest laws of the mind that lrh formulated namely that things are composed of 1 identities 2 similarities and 3 differences this is from dianetics the original thesis and dmsmh see note on p 198 above gpm is in state of total identification when you first greet it every item is every other item when you list you are bringing about similarity from an identity by causing the pc to find the item they the other items were all pinned to in the first place differentiation takes place and the thing starts blowing apart just calmly finding that the pc is rockslammer and telling him will make him significantly saner right there he was mad at the whole environment now he knows what hes mad at specifically eg scientology ron etc now if we find who or what was mad at whatever he was slamming on scientology or whatever we would have pair that would tend to blow because slam is the meter manifestation of games condition its the unsuccessful effort to withdraw from the thing he must attack it takes two items minimally to make package one stick wont burn it takes two to make fight every package has at least two items and really four including the not pair ie you also have to find out what wasnt against scientology and what scientology isnt rockslammer is only bad off before he has been detected when he finds out what his target really is scientology and then finds out what would attack that target he will feel better he will start to shed that valence and he can be someone else but the more rock slam you leave behind you by leaving items the more the rock slam will diminish the pcs attention is on those bypassed items and he cant confront the items ahead of him since he only slams on things that can become real to him the slam fades out so you had better get all the things that he can confront if you have available parts of his line plot with unopposed items you can free up more of his attention by filling in those blanks so heres why you are doing 3gaxx you are releasing sufficient attention from fancied opposition in the environment so the pc is not distracted and going backtrack from the ruffled point of the environment as you go on he will get less and less confused and more and more able to find his goal eventually you find the goal after you have hatful of items by variety of methods you could take goal like to dance on eggs that fired only three times but which rocket reads once in awhile you can do represent list on that goal to get similar goal and pull apart goals you can list for the goal that given item would have cf expanded dianetics wants handled rundown but unless all this improves the pcs presence alertness and available attention you would do better to just give him problems intensive and cchs
