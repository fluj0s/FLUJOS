6810c07 class viii tape 11 assessment and listing basics and this is the seventh of october 1968 and i think the eleventh lecture i want to point out with that caption that the last lecture was the tenth lecture of three october so nobody will think that there are three or four lectures pulled off the line up here this the amount of material which i can give you on the subject of auditing of course is quite voluminous and it is my job to find out how to codify and communicate to you the material concerning the mind and spirit and the beingness and the universe in such form that it will be comprehensible and usable the certain communication media absence thereof makes this difficult these tapes probably have deterioration of only few years span one has to be alert to this kind of thing and additionally we get the wild enthusiasm of somebody of placing material on the line which is completely additive and has nothing to do with it and sometimes do this and sign my name to it and we have the wild enthusiasm for pulling key material off the line which makes other things then not make any sense and these various things have occurred in the past and you right now have several instances of this the major one of these has to do with assessment and nulling and we will go into this immediately and directly assessment is an action done from prepared list please for god sakes get that through your skull please please please for god sakes understand what it is because it has messed up thousands of preclears this miscomprehension of what this is all about has messed up preclears all over the world an assessment is an action done from prepared list prepared list prepared by the auditor prepared by prepared by somebody else it is not given by the pc it is prepared prepared made up listed by somebody else not the preclear prepared list and that is the action of assessment assessment assessment that is the word that goes with that there is other word goes with that assessment does not go with anything else but that that is all that assessment means it is associated with prepared list only prepared list period there are number of laws and actions which go along with assessment theres an entirely different subject just as different as pulling up the anchor and splicing lines different different subject different different completely completely completely utterly utterly utterly theyre even years apart in development called listing and nulling listing and nulling this is something listed by the pc listed listed by the pc pc says it it is from questions the auditor asks the question the pc then gives him items which the auditor then writes down from the pc thats called listing and nulling listing listing and nulling nulling nullingl listingl not assessment not assessment let give you the background of this now the reason im being emphatic is because its practically killed thousands of pcs the confusion between these two things and theyre two entirely different operations now the laws of listing and nutting do not apply to the laws of assessment and the laws of assessment have nothing to do with the laws of listing and nulling and i never would have dreamed anybody would have mixed up the two theyve got nothing to do with each other in the emeter book em 24 has to do with assessment assessment assessment nothing but assessments and that is assessment now let not hear in the future that somebody hasnt done it and done it correctly because it is assessment and it is done and guys come into the line up and they say that is old fashioned and we dont do it anymore and yik yik yik yap yap yap yaps thats the additive we do do it it is key vital piece of auditing assessment from prepared list emeter book number 24 and theres an exact way to do it and it has nothing to do with listing and nulling nothing nothing nothing to do with listing and nulling there isnt any connection with listing and nulling none there is listing and nulling drill in the emeter book listing and nutting has its own laws theyre on tapes theyve been on tape for years at saint hill but people come along and theyve taken the laws of assessment and they said well in view of the fact we dont list and null them anymore you dont assess i dunno yea yea well actually the law of assess of list and so on is so actually to get something to one item on an s and d you grind out every reading item on the list except one and by doing that thousands of pcs have been arc broken and chopped up so i dont care to think it was unintentional because there is list on the saint hill special briefing course that tells you how to list and null and the laws which you had recently issued in an hcob 1968 are all there on the saint hill special briefing course and they apply to the subject of listing and nulling listing and nulling the laws of listing and nulling you ask the question of the pc the pc gives you item item item item the auditor writes them down and then he nulls the list and there must only be one item which has any read in it of any kind whatsoever on that list so the pc says dog biscuits roast beef catfish long fall bd the auditor then goes over the list catfish or he goes over it dog biscuit catfish doesnt read doesnt read and then nothing read on the list anything been suppressed on the list so balderdash he extends the list balderdash lemons oranges and he goes back up to the top good biscuits dog biscuits catfish oranges lemons oranges reads lemons reads hes had it there are two items now reading on the list so he puts bar over to the side and he extends the list and the answer is manhole covers and he gets long fall bd now he goes back over the whole list again clear from the top biscuit dog biscuits right on down the list nothing reading nothing reading nothing reading nothing reading manhole covers thats the pcs item it reads he gives it to the pc and that is the action of listing and nulling and that is the whole action of listing and nulling and that is the way it is done and it is not done any other way and these two actions are entirely entirely completely utterly different but i know somebodys come along and says we dont do that anymore we dont do that old drill and we dont ever assess from prepared lists anymore and so therefore nobody knows how to do it because i know at this moment 1968 that is has not been taught for at least two or three years but they knew how to do s and ds wrong they knew how to do those with three reading items on the list and then wondered why their pcs were arc broken the cases werent getting any better and so forth do you get the enormity of mixing up two entirely different things now look youve got to know youve got to know how to assess prepared list youve go to know this now maybe earlier maybe earlier i could have told you i could have told you this separately and so forth and made it all very plain but how the hell could i predict anybody was going to be complete kook because theres an infinity of errors an infinity of errors can grow up the one line is very narrow one i could give you billions of words of lecture and bulletins trying to predict every error somebodys going to make and we would still get one missed so you have to know what you know and one of the things you have to know is thing called assessment and it is em 24 in the emeter book and it has nothing to do with s and ds nothing to do with remedy bs nothing to do with remedy as those are all listing and nulling actions those havent have theyre completely separate its as different as ship and bus completely different im using this as an example at this time to show you what can happen that wrecks workable technology one set of laws that has nothing to do with the subject is applied to the subject the action to which the laws are connected is said to be old hat and not done anymore recently it was being brooded about very broadly and widely oh well we never run engrams by chain anymore thats looked on as squirrel action how the hell are you ever going to get an fn on an engram chain how would you ever run engrams on somebody that was way up the bank very very chopped up and charged up you couldnt get him to run single engram because the engrams up in the top you can only go through em couple of times and they go solid so you have to do it by chains and then it goes down the line you finally find the basic and the whole cockeyed thing blows and somebody to come along and say thats old hat we dont do that anymore well my answer to that would be we dont audit you anymore you can go on and fall on your head because its dirty trick it does in every pc whose case is only resolvable by engram running by chains at the level of running engrams the reason you have trouble with cases is the usual hasnt been done the standard hasnt been done hasnt been done hasnt been done we had case here the other day wildest thing you ever heard in your life auditors were doin their nuts going around in circles trying to resolve this case this case was an unusual case fantastic ones oh very difficult cycle bla bla bla bla finally the case went into treason or something of this sort i made it my business to try to find out something about this case and what do you know he was on upper ot sections and he had never run grade in his life never run arc straightwire never run secondaries never run engrams never run zero to four never been on power never run r6ew he was an unsolvable case nobodyd audited him so you get the case who was audited with off beat tech and you get the case who has never been audited on tech and they alike can be failed cases and the solution at once to the two types of case the one whos been audited on off beat tech and the one who has not been audited at all same solution find out what hasnt been done on the road to standard tech and do it and the case resolves right now and thats how difficult it is so all you have to know is what is standard tech and then find out what hasnt been done in standard tech and get it done now where tech is violated and where standard tech is violated you have to have repair actions which put them back together again now supposing we have case which has eight hundred and sixty nine lists that have been done in balderdash north slobokum and then they lost his folder anyhow and the auditor who did listed list couldnt write and bunch of things like this you thought didnt have his folder and so on and this case is wrapped around telegraph pole hes in terrible shape how you going to resolve that case we havent got the list to correct maybe you havent even got the auditor who knows how to correct list and an auditor who doesnt know how to list and null and thinks that listing and nulling is assessment and whos all screwed up anyhow he couldnt correct it by list anyway but there is way to correct this case and thats very vital its serious thing to lose somebodys lists but there is way there is way and it contains assessment its an action called assessment and the auditor dreams up list of things and he says auditing auditors review sessions scientology dianetics do you see lists and then that is put down in column by the auditor and is assessed over and over until one item is left reading and that is assessment and you all of sudden got staring you in the face lists alright turns out to be lists good it could just as well turn out to be auditing or just as well turn out to be review but it turned out to be lists that is the hot button in this field now that will come close enough to whats wrong with him to solve it and then youve got thing called l1 so you say now on lists and you itsa earlier itsa with false and suppress on any of the reads on the l1 you take up each item in order from the top down on lists boom on lists boom on lists boom and you clean each one and all of sudden the pc goes fn and those old lists wont bother him anymore its absolute magic that you can undo bunch of lists and things like that but it depends on the auditor being able to assess now is this technique of assessment so old hat i dont think so now im going to give you some sort of an idea of an assessment as she is done i will write it down here on the blackboard and sheet can go along with this lecture and this is this business of assessment this now is prepared list its prepared list and its something like auditing listing review orgs scientology dianetics grades now the auditor makes that up or the case supervisor makes that up and the auditor he puts it into line up like this and he gives it he gives it of course its date which is eleven ten sixty eight in this case and he puts the pcs name on it which is tj pete and heres the other one all of sudden at saint hill i heard with horror that this was going on theyre doing s and ds over arc breaks and out ruds i couldnt understand it last november ive been trying to unravel this since last november why because people would say well an s and d isnt auditing an s and d isnt auditing you know assessment isnt auditing assessment isnt auditing it is simply trying to locate something to audit and you can assess anybody at any time anywhere and theres session involved assessment has nothing but an s and d that is auditing but assessment is never auditing you say the word right to the pcs bank bombs bombs bombs you can pick him up i dont care if hes in an arc break i dont care what the hell is wrong with him if your own trs are ok you can just go bang bang bang and you can get the item right out of the pc he doesnt even have to be if hes even doped off you can get the item just take piece of paper its got these items on it take your meter and you say these things to the pc you say the first one like auditing auditors lists reviews out scientology out now weve got one column and weve got two items reading and this is assessment this is assessment it has nothing to do with listing and nulling nothing nothing nothing the pcs ruds we dont care this can be done on street corner if youve got some place to park your emeter now weve got two reading items havent we so we go down here the next time and we find out where this thing is lists scientology we have one reading item left on the list and that is all there is to it and that is assessment aint that difficult but let tell you if you cant do this there are large number of cases you cant crack because there are many types of prepared lists now let us get an entirely different action were asking the pc who done it and this is listing and nulling and its in session and were saying who done it thats not legitimate question im just giving it to you so you wont interiorize into your case while i show it to you sarcasm lot of people listen to with banks so we ask the pc who done it and the pc says joe bill pete the auditor marks it fall toger lige now we go over the thing and we say to the pc joe bill pete second one here with long fall toger bob lige oh brother we have two reading items on the list the list is not complete because theres two reading items on the list pete and toger and this is not assessment this is nulling nulling this is not assessment this is nulling and it didnt null and we now know theres two reading items on the list so we know the list isnt complete so we put bar over here and we write extended on this little bar here ext we put and under this we get we say on this question who done it and the pc says bigelow long fall bd as the pc says it so now we go up to the top of this thing and we say joe second x bill second x pete toger out out lige out bigelow long fall bd 21 bigelow is your item thats listing and nulling its an entirely different operation isnt it now you ought to spot whoever told you that the laws of assessment applied to listing and nulling now you see how it can get mucked up look it isnt what i says it is its what works and this operation of listing and nulling if done wrongly if those two items pete and toger are left on the list and you simply scrub it out and grind it down so that pete doesnt read and youve got toger left you give the pc that item hell go through his skull boom arc break apathy upset become angry out of session and very often just finishes with auditing right at that point thats the most arc breaky action is listing and listing is dangerous action for that reason you try not to let green auditors list you try not to let them list when guy has really got it down great they can assess anybody can assess theres nothing to assessment do you see the two different actions well theres only one way to do both of them there are additional ways now when you get into 5a running power plus youll find out that its odd but its just shortcut 5a follows the laws of listing but on the subject and the person and the place person place subject on those things on those things its just peculiar but the first bd is always it the first blow down is it so to save time and because the subject is hot and because this is reliable action all you have to do is grab that bongo and give it to the pc and you know it will be true but its short cut and its just peculiar to 5a and you try to do it on an s and d and youll very often get your throat cut list is incomplete on it so 5a can be done in this shorthanded fashion but nothing else i know of can and its unfortunate because it looks like different set of laws but there are different laws it just happens that is always comes out right if the pc in session now 5a can also blow on just the subject of persons persons long fall bd bong fn you try to go past that and youre gonna rise the tone arm right up through the roof now these are such key subjects with an individual that an individual can become seriously seriously seriously ill or upset within two or three days after wrong power plus so if the pc comes back couple of days later and hes sick or something like that you know his 5a is out its elementary but now when you put it in again do all the laws of listing and nulling with regard to it do everything he says you get such peculiarity of yeah i thought of an item and he didnt put it down or the auditor he said it and the auditor didnt write it down or something weird went on dont you see its very off beat it was lousy session its not dangerous to do 5a it is just incredible the amount of goof by which it can be done the pcs who get very upset and so forth and theyve had bad listing in their past the best thing to do is to actually get the lists and correct them get the earliest list ever made on the pc and find the right item off of it sometimes youre lucky and you can do this sometimes you can get the list and then you can be an idiot too you can get the first list you can get the item off of it it was suppressed its usually the first item or something like that first or the second item and its very suppressed and here we are first s and d he ever had and out of that s and d he gets the collector of taxes or something see that was the item it was never given to him hes had twenty thirty s and ds since then so collector of taxes long fall bd and you got the suppress in on it and so on it was an eighteen page list and this was the second item on the list oooh odd kind of comm boy was that lousy so anyhow long fall bd you give him his item he says yeah reads reads tears yeah thats it now go to the next s and d and try to correct that its got the same item except by this time it was suppressed and you stopped putting it on the list every s and d he had from the first s and d he ever had is always the same item now he can get little local locks on this suppressed item and that comes out to be the organization executives or something usually cause by that time hes turned kind of vicious do you see what the hell why would you correct more than the first one now if you were lucky enough to get the first remedy b the fellow ever had and get that on its exact items well remedy b for that command will be that remedy b and that blew and thats it youre handling real horse power youre handling tremendous horse power see those arent light techniques 1950 you could overrun 1955 you could go on and on you could do various things you cant do those things today the technique is too powerful its too fast zing boom bung boom when we got into r212 r212 runs so something minor something minute two minutes three minutes couple of items goes fn and that packs up the whole subject but somebody who had to have all of his intensive would some times get run twenty five hours on something that cleared up in two minutes well it was just at that point at that exact point that we crossed the boundary line from technology which could be roughly handled and still come out into technology which if its exactly handled sent your pc flying it was at that point now somewhere during that period the confusion here on assessment is because of this assessment was something done on what was called the prehave scale by assessing these things and running them you could fix pc up now so he could have something so these old prehave scales something around 1959 60 they became so numerous and so heavy that i developed further technology and collided with the whole subject of listing and nulling let the pc put it down up to that time all the auditor ever did was put it down so now when the pc put it down that was brand new set of rules and you had to know these new rules because they didnt follow these old rules its quite obvious they didnt follow the old rules so on the research line as it came forward you find somewhere around 59 60 61 you find the discussion is of assessment and then time marches on and later tapes when they talk about listing and nulling are talking about the subject of listing and nulling as i have just differentiated for you in this lecture and they have nothing to do with assessment but assessment was the prerun it was the forerunner and all the laws of listing and nulling had to be learned cause they were entirely different than those of assessment now oddly enough you cant much upset pc by getting the wrong item on his list but wait if the case supervisor or the auditor is hottern pistol and hes looked back through this case heres folder foot and half thick of review sessions given at the bideahee review center and he looks back through this ohh oh my god and then he sees some clue that the fellow was audited before that in bull isle but he doesnt have any of the laws any of the s and ds that came from that area whats he gonna do you can upset the case and do an over review of review of review of correction of correction to correct the correction and youll get into hell of fire fight with some auditor particularly if the auditor is not very expert trying to get him to correct pile of lists he just keeps plowing it in further he himself hasnt differentiated between assessment or listing and nulling he doesnt know what these actions are if he just clubfootedly goes in and leaves three items reading on the list which you told him to repair but now weve got repair of repair we have actually exceeded the ability of the auditor to correct because he couldnt list and null in the first place now very smart case supervisor he says ok this fellows had lot of auditing of various kinds whatsoever in various places and has pretended to be very tough case and so on the basic thing is that standard tech hasnt been applied here someplace so lets find it out and lets try and correct the case up so hes at least auditable alright so he does list and the list is auditing auditors anything he can think of that might be in connection with this centers franchises you know anything he could think of that might add up to this and he turns it over to an auditor who looks bright looks like he has head he hasnt got two heads god knows and then whats this whats this quote auditor unquote do he even messes up the little simple job of assessment and he gets the item that isnt the biggest reading item on the list he suppresses that he suppresses that one the first item on the list still in assessment is likely to be the one most missed because you dont have the pcs attention or anything and you havent told him what youre doing maybe or something so he misses that first one he doesnt nothing hears it he just sort of goes blup but anyway theres rfactor you know you got to tell somebody youre going to assess i usually tell them im going to assess list on you keep quiet my rfactor and i dont want anybody talking on assessment it isnt auditing youre just trying to find something and the more the pc talks the more hes going to screw it up so you want him to shut up so you ask him politely with complete arc to shut up you say im going to do list on you and there is reason for you to say anything i would prefer that you did not if he is prone to be yap yap now you go bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark go up to the top of it again bark bark bark bark go up to the last reading bark bark bark bark bark bark thats the item now i dont care whether you give him the item or not but somebody who is very inexpert and who lets the pc itsa itsamamnfwhfmf and has the pc squirming about and doing other things and doesnt know how to get pc to hold the cans and few things like this you know little outnesses like pcs itsaing about his motherinlaw trying to run ptp while the auditors trying to assess list thats something stupid see you get wrong item all of sudden the pc arc breaks because theres hotter item on the list there is usually on these lists the hottest item and it isnt enough to get the longest fall thats not correct to write down the longest fall its the one thats still in because actually what happens is is you sort of scan him up and down the track and he eventually sticks in the falling area it isnt that things scrub out he will just his mind automatically will park where he has the most interest its method of paralleling the mind so as you go over the reading items why his attention goes zuuu uu now if his attention was on one of these items and you give him another item hell therefore arc break because youve excited bypassed charge on the right item and youve given him the wrong item you try to prep check that or do something with that and he arc breaks further so you can you can goof it up even with an assessment so you have to know how to run an emeter thats elementary you have to know how to run an emeter get the guy to sit still so on ive seen auditors losing their nut because the pc was boiling off or doped off or doped off in an assessment and therefore the assessment isnt valid you know the assessment is valid the assessment is valid on an unconscious person you can actually take an unconscious person if your tone 40s good enough you can assess list and find exactly what it is its the auditor its the auditor the auditor thats the law now the net result of all of this is simply that assessment is assessment but assessment requires that you do get the right item on the list youre assessing its almost inconceivable that anybody could get the wrong item on this list but it actually could be done you could get the pc so hes fighting it so hes suppresses it so he does some things so he you know so you can actually correct one of these assessment lists but that becomes very idiotic its such simple fast operation that the whole essence of it is getting in there and doing it before the pc finds out and then hell all of sudden start saying wait minute yes of course youve parked him right where the most charge is of course he then has tendency to say i have just remembered that woof woof bluff and itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa wait minute woah woah woah youre not processing him you dont know what the hell hes going to itsa youre going to prep check this thing youre going to do something with this thing you are gonna adapt it to recall question youre gonna run it on list 1 well hes pulling the wrong action on it already so therefore its even stupid to indicate it to the pc i see on some assessments very recently as why theyre done wrong i see it indicated to the pc and he agreed that that was true and he told that trotdedot waffle waffle waffle i imagine the pc walked out of session probably good and arc broke because theres an excellent chance that this item has excited bpc by passed charge and so on he dont itsa because youre not running it it isnt an itsa subject he could probably get into severe trouble itsaing because hot subject you wouldnt have chosen it you wouldnt have chosen that list subject if it wasnt hotter than pistol on his case oh theres various things you could do about it hes probably curious about what read on the list and that sort of thing aw yeah give him his item in very unexcited sort of way but its not an auditing action youre trying to find something to run and there very often will be many hours or even day or two intervene between the time you did the assessment and the time hes gonna be run on it well youre gonna run something real strong on it and there is good reason to run something real strong on it dont you see now you can say well yes itll fn if it just fnd on itsa whv not just itsa on fn aw bull its key to the case so if its handled with the right process it will unblock the case but yickety yickety yackety yackety bill code doo yackety do do da do dee do do fn yeah its just the same old stupid pc as the other one and we did an assessment and we found out that it was auditing and and so forth and he told us about the fact awwawaw he said all auditors are dogs yeah dogs the the all auditors are dogs fn arc break needle yeah we itsad it didnt do anything for the case you see what stupidity can enter in here so you say auditors good thats thanks now were going in to and were going to do this and so forth youre handling it when your pc is in session you might do this before the session began sort of thing or do it after the session ended and it usually is very puzzling to some green pc to have one of these assessments done after he has been flown on something youve done undertaken major action major action on the pc fly the needle wham wham wham and then all of sudden you pull out this list you see and you give him list and you just say well yes now you dont have to say anything about this im just going to go over this just to see whats here bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark thank you very much good now to put the end rudiments in why in this session has any charge been missed anything anything you care to say anything fellow says well what was that all about were just trying to trying to see where you were now and youre doing fine thank you very much evaluate evaluate good thank you you dont tell him i am trying to find an item so that we can put it together and audit you on it in the future because youve now continued session and boy that is grave blunder see so its usually best to give it to him at the beginning of the session really say good how are the cans how are you today joe bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark thats good thank you very much he says what the hell was that all about do you have an arc break well yeah i was very startled very good thank you good fine thats clean alright do you have ptp yeah what was that all about thats problem well i was just doing an assessment of list trying to get some dope here alright he says great great fn now you go into the auditing action that you were going to go into or just knock the session off youve got the dope now that dope if it adds up right can become process now it can be done on l4a it can be done on l1 it can be prep checked you can pull number of different gags out of it but those are the major things you can do with it on bla bla has anything been do you see list 1 or prepcheck see theres various standard actions that are undertaken with this item but the item is hot and you want to get it as good as you can you want to run it right down and get what you can off of it and then get an fn that will stay that way for while now that is the use and value of assessment the use and value of listing and nulling now you may find on saint hill tapes you may find on older tapes that this differentiation has not been made you may find it is missing in tape line up it may be this and that but certainly i am making it clear to you now therefore you should be aware of somebody pulling something out of line up that he himself doesnt understand what the hell it is do you see there can be serious action its actually wrecked i dont know how many cases now i dont say that this is now going to be wrong in the future cause you guys are all going to make that right and you guysll probably for long time been trying to straighten up little points like this and so forth and im giving it to you as horrible example of what can happen the technology that applies to arc breaks is suddenly applied to missed withholds to give you an idea see on missed withhold is it arcu or cdei on an arc break do you have an arc break well yes i do weil what was it all about well i was they were very cross with this morning very good who nearly found out you could get that really screwed up couldnt you now i dont mean to be profane about it but i have talked to many peopie very sweetly and i have taught them how to audit with great kindness and they havent learned in many instances they havent learned so you will forgive my emphaticness funny part of it is in this particular unit at this particular time your auditing picks up about hundred percent every twenty four hours thats very remarkable line of gain now the next action here is there are certain methods of teaching which go on on this course and which should go on on this course and which are exterior actually to the bulletins and so on which must be called definitely to attention and that is that case folders of cases supervised by myself are part of the course actions now power folders were done in another day and another time when we were trying to develop and handle power but they nevertheless greatly assisted people in the case supervision of power and they were totally removed from the course so that nobodyd ever seen or heard of these things for over year and nobody knew how to run power all of sudden so i call to your attention that case folders supervised by myself and case supervision by myself are part of the curriculum of this course and those must be studied and it is the best part of those the sessions that are well done rather than specializing only in session that are badly done since there can be an absolute infinity of error there is only one single track of well done also auditing at this level is not what you get away with its what you do perfectly we are auditing at different strata different altitude it is what you do perfectly youre total perfectionist we dont care how the pc and you dont care either how the pc came out of the session and said oh i had wonderful session you look through the thing and its something like this do you have an arc break who else has been arc broke with you do you do things to make people arc break with you you look over at the examiners form what wonderful session had won there is thing called propitiation you are perfectionist you are not looking for the result you are looking for the perfect rendition of the technology we dont care how the pc felt afterwards because if it was perfectly administered on standard tech you can with perfect confidence say that you will have achieved perfect result on the pc which is lasting but the rough trs the introduction of squirrelynesses the failures to follow the exact things which are being taught the failure to do you have present time problem thats clean do you have missed withhold plunk we dont care if he did or didnt have present time problem why the hell did the auditor have to go and ask about missed withholds without getting an fn on ptps well you say well of course the pc was stuck in missed withhold thats why it didnt fn naahhh youre an auditor youre auditing from level of class viii what the hell do you mean the guy comes into session with missed withhold my pcs dont theyre not supposed to have missed withholds arc breaks or ptps and if i ask them about it and they tell something it fns not because i say it fns because it does trs are in now if this guy is all goofed up and hes got out ruds and hes out of session like screaming crazy and hes running the session running the session i dont have an arc break but i have ptp let tell you my ptp so and so and so and so and so and so of course theres missed withhold mixed up in the thing now what were going to run in the body of the session theres only one reason therere two reasons actually that pc does that but we dont expect one of them to be valid which is the auditors trs are out we expect the auditors trs to be in and perfect but when the auditors trs are indifferently in and pc is out of session and behaves to control the session the answer is out rudiments out rudiments thats all trs fair see now an auditor with perfect trs could probably audit over the top of out rudiments but thats asking hell of lot so if his trs are fair his control of the session would normally be good and the pcs madly out of session we know that the ruds are out its one of these equals out of session ruds out now the answer to that from the case supervisor is rattatattat fly each rud to floating needle using suppress and false meaning simply that you dont leave one of the buttons unless you get in its itsa earlier itsa to fn on arc breaks and when i say its flunk flunk flunk because he said do you have ptp thats clean thank you very much now you do have missed withhold why didnt ptp fly well its either suppressed or false read if it didnt fly it is either suppressed or false read lets get this level of think thats very extreme level of think isnt it when you ask the pc question and the needle doesnt float then it is either suppressed or false read youve asked the pc question now let put this again very strongly and very exactly youve asked the pc question and it was clean didnt read and it didnt fn then its either suppressed because of false reads or there is suppressed something on it why didnt it fn well thats hell of an extreme way of here we labor and sweat and go through twenty five hour intensives and so forth to finally get an fn and all of sudden ron looks at us here and says we ask the pc question we didnt get an fn theres something wrong with that hey now get this as different viewpoint you ask the pc do you have an arc break and the pc fned cause he didnt have one now if it didnt fn either hes been told he has had arc breaks when he didnt have or hes told he read on them when he didnt so hes eventually suppressed the whole subject or hes got an arc break that is suppressed or hes got one that reads and hes got one that reads you itsa it find out what it was get your arcu cdei get the charge off of that and then check it and if it hasnt fned yet you ask him is it suppressed see ana get the read alright is that false you got it somebody told you you didnt have one i dont care what it is you havent got an fn yet so its an earlier similar earlier similar reads there is such thing as an arc break that reads clean theres arc break to fn needle that does not fn on question look at the extremity of this needle that does not fn on question has either been falsely called sometime or another and has so been suppressed or it is suppressed because it isnt an fn fn is native state i get out of bed in the morning and grab hold of couple of cans and so forth and have dial wide fn why theres neither suppress theres suppress on it im not asking myself anything if i ask myself something on the meter and it stopped fning i would know there was something there or that it was false or that it had been suppressed or there was an answer i answer it and it fns again you should be auditing pc from an fn wondering why the fn is not continuous rather than trying to sweat it through for the next seventy five hours to possibly get an fn what the hell are you doing with fns now i know exactly how good your auditing is and how bad it is i dont have to need anything more than the pc did not come to the next session with an fn thats all i need to know start of session he had to have his ruds put in hes losing some portion of the gain he should get so i look over somebody who is an auditor exclamation point and i know that his pcs are going to start coming to session with fns very soon and to run major action you have to wreck the fn now if you ask pc who had an fn if he had an arc break perfectly reasonable to do and the fn stopped then youve either got false or suppress see the fn stopped but it didnt read then theres false or suppress so youd have to get in those buttons so now lets go back to this the guy says the guy says do you have ptp clean do you have missed withhold plunk plunk plunk plunk plunk plunk plunk he just passed read thats either false or suppressed hes been called falsely so the guy suppressed the read or something but it doesnt fn he doesnt fn on the subject of missed withholds he doesnt fn on the subject of ptps so its false or suppressed do you get the idea now thats hell of an extreme point from which to audit but thats the kind of case supervision youre getting at this particular stage of the game if you wonder why youre developing such aeronautic proficiency and such aquatic expertness is because you and are auditing from two different standards and ill tell you how to win in this game you start auditinq from my standard not because i say so but because you will find out that it works pcs that dont fn when they come into session have been roughly audited not roughly taught not roughly handled theyve just been roughly audited pcs whose fns dont even last to the examiner two minutes later you mean an arc breaks handled and ptps handled and his missed withholds off and good session under his belt and hes just cleaned up some big section of his life and his fn doesnt last from the auditing desk to the examiner balderdash my god mine even lasts doing case supervision on your folders horrible thing to say now so therefore the methods of teaching include the inspection of these case supervision and anything that is improved or done in any way why case folders and so forth which demonstrate this will be added to the course so that this is definitely part of it now something which is supposed to be taken up something supposed to be taken up by the supervisor and so on to find out where the student is actually weak and its supposed to get him to do it in clay the hes supposed to get him to do it so that he understands it its up to the supervisor to get the fellow clarified on these things not asking bunch of goofy question but get it so that he can actually take look at it because the basic cognition on this stuff is its as simple as shot arrow i mean its just simple its like this assessment it arc breaks because i taught it for years and its been done for years and its very simple action and assessment can be forgotten or somebody cant do assessment i wonder why an auditor would leave four items reading on prepared list what good it that to anybody and then show that one was three inches long and one was two inches long i dont care how long they are what stayed in what stayed in thats the whole clue to the whole thing thats all you ever want to know as case supervisor now i assure you that every one of you without going out of valence in the least are going to be exactly in my boots as i am trying to teach you how to come up the line on standard tech each one of you will be occupying these two boots youre gonna have the same problems youre gonna get twice as outraged and youll have to be able to do it in such case state that your needle floats through the lot so those are methods of course teaching which i must remark upon students quite normally take up case supervision folders take up case supervision folders in group so that each one of the cases the auditing sessions which got well done definitely taken up why that is well done session now you will see in some of these case folders that instead of being raging beast i actually am not much of raging beast i am more than kind because youll occasionally see little slips i dont say anything about see theyre so tiny and knowing that the auditor was so over strained at that particular point that it would seem too damn petty because it didnt mean anything to the session little points of outadmin you know like he doesnt put the time down for four columns so you cant find out when the hell he did the action in the in the session report because he never put down the time so you know that the action and so forth and then theres time put down on the list when he does the list so you cant find where the list fit into the session see these little things i know youll find not saying much about them but you should move up into that level of perfection now as far as tapes are concerned and listening to tapes usually the quality is so very very bad on tapes over home recorder machines which you listen to through earphones that this course at least is designed to play the tapes in common hall to the students all at one time but this poses the problem this poses the problem of what about somebody who comes in late on course and therefore you could only give the course every so many weeks or something like this youll find these tapes more or less you can somebody can start listening to these tapes anyplace and you carry it on through but all the tapes should be listened to ive tried to tell you often enough on the tapes so that you dont have to take notes its very embarrassing thing in an auditing session to have to take out your notes i remember one time back in 1950 when an auditor who was going to audit had to find dianetics the modern science of mental health to find out what the canceler was and opened up my book and read the canceler as part of session youre supposed to know your data very quickly now the student youll find the cases make out on the course best when students start to audit late on the course the students who are auditing later on the course rather than those who audited once on the course turn in far better session theyve got the data the theory under their belt and theyve normally integrated it so that they can put it together into session without lot of questions popping up so student should audit relatively late on course not early on now when i say late well if he was going to be three weeks on course why about the earliest he ought to do any auditing is after about week and half of very furious study and it would have to be very furious study one is expected to go through the checksheet on this course at least three times i consider that minimum id consider nine optimum if you knew it by the time that youd hit nine boy youd know it and you wouldnt be worrying about it trying to remember it the only reason you make mistakes is yourre trying to remember something thats about as obvious as can be now the other thing is is we teach auditors not cases and on this course why auditors dont have cases there are cases on the course and that is an old rule but there are cases on course and thats the most remarkable thing ive tried to teach you without teaching you through my case and you should be able to be taught without being taught through your case now the net result of that is is auditors dont have cases every now and then solo auditor gets going about his case or something of this sort well all right but he is also the auditor and he cant have the excuse that he keeps bad admin and doesnt audit because his case is bad he is different thing as solo auditor now the whole subject of this course that you sort out eventually are the relative importances and you should have gotten this long long long long time ago it should have been way way way back when the the final assortment of data is actually in the axioms and you should have learned these long time ago axiom 58 intelligence and judgement are measured by the ability to evaluate relative importances to lot of people datum in scientology is just about the same as data in buddhism is about the same as drop of water in the ocean and so on the position of the emeter is an equal importance to the trs of the auditor in other words monotone importances you should know this axiom 58 intelligence and judgement are measured by the ability to evaluate relative importances when you eventually sort out the material youre going through you wont find that there are fifty data that are important but you have to know the rest of them to back it up but there are fifty more less than what is important what is important and that is the thing you have to break through somebody came in here on this course asking questions about heredity well i dont care anything about heredity the russians have heredity bysinko i think had something to say about it somebody dreamed it up sometime or another but brother it has the relative importance of an ink blot on rock in the south pacific so your data has to be evaluated against other data ive had somebody tell that you could find everything there was in scientology in krishnamurti well it was hell of an exaggeration so i said now show something and they finally dreamed it up and they said well he said something about time and i said good we also said something about time now show where he said something about time and they showed one sentence which was in whole book and this one little sentence by misinterpretation could be said to be the fact that time exists in this universe but nowhere in there did he give it any relative importance and it was just of monotone to every other thing in there so somebody comes up to you and tells you well thats just like the vedic something or other theyve got lot to learn because they dont even know the relative importance amongst the vedic actions there is an important vedic hymn ive forgotten which one it is about the fourth one which gives the cycle of action and it gives actually very very wise little piece of information it defines the cycle of action way back in vedic times and in the entire panorama of vedic materials there isnt anything else but sand thats hell of thing isnt it but there is one was one datum there now the people studying vedic hymns i am sure think theyre all of equal importance there was only one useful datum in the whole line up very valuable datum now where where student has to shake himself loose where he has to get himself squared around is to find out what is important and what is unimportant and when he is able to sort these things out he is then able to do what he has to do he is also able to teach and this is primary job which is done by the student under the heading of methods of teaching this is something that is up to the student to sort out relative importances until he does so he is just in one horrible maze every drop of water in the ocean is just like every other drop of water in the ocean and all those drops of water in the ocean they really dont relate to anything well hes gotta get that stacked up and hes gotta find out what are the important data what are the important data and get those things arranged and arrange those important data without recourse to whether or not they solve his case or not for as student he couldnt care buttons about whether they solve his case or not in the normal course of events they of course will resolve his case but they actually wont solve his case unless they solve all the cases some people like to be individualists and have different types of cases im sorry for those people but we may even invent cs which satisfies their statushappy seeking we have to run on you now technique st and that is technique of spotting the number of spots on spots its very special process its for very genius people if you did such thing as that it would probably be dishonest but i never let my sense of humor get the better with my case supervision but sometimes when you hear what some people think is missed withhold that even i have heard half around the world this girls busy getting off this missed withhold see well ive known that for years i know one girl that went clear to australia and buried herself in the bush and has never come out towards scientology again because she had withhold that only she knew in company with she never got it off in session but i dont think there was anybody in london didnt know it shes down there busy hiding this withhold that everybody else knows it suddenly strikes you with some pity looking at some extreme action like this that humanism and status and few things like that are put above power decency and freedom but those are the relative importances of the being and he will sort those out as time goes along now i could go on and give you lot of data about this and that and the other thing but i do have some very very important data ive already told you that session control is out ruds and relative importances but i want to tell you something very astonishing something absolutely astonishing and that is the one hand electrode as used in solo auditing can obscure floats to such degree that person overruns himself consistently and you will find t in auditing of such people you will be amazed and he will be amazed when you say there are four five six eight ten times they went clear on the clearing course or something of this sort they went release on it or something and he didnt see any floats well he was handling one hand electrode and it doesnt float furthermore it gives ta lie it can be high or it can be low now if you want to straighten this out for yourself get couple of cans with the alligator clip couple of old tin cans the way those meters are designed against i think its size eight or size ten tin can and they have alligator jaw leadins that clip to those tin cans you take those two cans and you hold them and that meter is calibrated to work in calibrated to react to two tin cans one held in each hand now when person gets up in the ot sections he is insufficiently in contact with all parts of the body to register worth god damn on one hand electrode in many cases you very often will find the one hand electrode is registering 25 that the needle appears to be relatively loose that this appears to be ok if you were to take at that moment two one hand electrodes you know two two different electrodes which are separated each one held in one hand making two handed connection to the machine the needle might be doing float and the ta might be in completely different place now its very amazing how completely erroneous this can be the ta can be at 3 floating on the proper two cans and on one hand electrode can be at 4 stuck but because it actually is calibrated to be floating on the two hands and is floating and is actually floating any effort to get it down from the stuck 4 is of course an overrun life can be marvelous cant it so those electrodes are best and those electrodes are only reliable which are held one in each hand or which are connected to the two opposite sides of the body now word of warning if you try to hook up an electrode against the skin it very often i mean like under the armpit or some tender portion of the anatomy watch it because it only has seven and half volts going through it but it actually gives sensation of burn and can actually burn somebody we do have somebody who tries to handle electrodes by lashing one to his leg and hes always been thinking he is such marvelous special case because it burns his leg well my god it always burns anybodys leg itd burn your leg too dont think i havent made tests of that character all the way across the line but this latest data here about one hand electrode is result of series of tests which i have taken in order to resolve some materials and some reactions on the higher ot sections of research and im telling you this for the first tlme it isnt that ive withheld it from anybody but that it doesnt float as you go up into higher sections you dont get float anymore and you get the weird action then of an overrun and you put now you as an auditor put the guy into review session and its sort of packed up and its spooky and the needles doing this that or the other thing theres not only false needle but false ta so theres worry about the ta is one of the buttons which you must remember comes about in solo auditing and you have to put into your line up his ta worried about his ta his ta is low or his ta is high hes worried about his ta and it comes up as problem and can act as sufficient problem to operate as any other present time problem operates at case gain every time he goes into session he has this problem with the ta and in one hand electrode he can read up to 6 stuck when he actually will be floating dial wide on two cans now you will see then this mystery of this guy was all worried about his ta and hell be sitting on the meter all of sudden hell have dial wide float while youre auditing him and he tells you hes worried about his ta well that is the mystery of it all is hes got some flooky electrode set up which messes him up now theres some material in progress on this and this will be resolvable but im just warning you that this condition does exist and that you will run into this condition now the actual actions of auditing on solo level are very often very very very very very badly done incredibly badly done guys go into session they dont put in their ruds the rudiments are out and they try to use the ot section in order to handle their ptp you got it and they then audit over out ruds out ruds audit over out ruds out ruds now you get somebody that cant run an engram cant run anything else and he gets onto ot 3 isnt trained wraps himself around telegraph pole messes himself up most horribly one are the difficulties is that he will run an incident 1 on one thetan and turn around and run an incident 2 out of another thetan i sometimes find somebody who says when youre trying to run an incident 1 on him well he has reality on it and so on and yet he claims to have done something with 3 he cant have done anything with 3 unless he ran some incident 1s he can very often run his own incident 1 blow quite few body thetans he doesnt necessarily have to be on it forever but he certainly had to run incident 1 and he certainly had to run it several times now therefore why didnt he well he doesnt know engram running he cant run engrams and not able to run engrams my god he couldnt run em on pc he couldnt run em much less on himself he hasnt any control of his own bank he therefore is somebody who by reason of training and by reason of charged case did not in actual fact have any business being on the ot sections because his case is too charged up now his case is too charged up because his grades are out it isnt very difficult thing engrams secondaries arc straightwire back it down into that zone hes had drugs they have never been rehabbed something like this and god almighty he hes trying to get through the ot sections well its something like this standard tech rehabs all former releases on any subject and if those things arent rehabbed i dont care whether its done early or late on the case if the persons not actually had arc straightwire run if hes not actually had secondaries run if hes not actually had engrams run all correctly zero the real processes of zero one two three four actual power r6ew fudge to it actually run em his case is too charged his case is too charged up now one of the ways you can tell case is too charged up is he starts to run secondaries or engrams or something like this and he doesnt seem to be able to get much reality on it and he sort of brushes it off but somebody arc breaks him and he goes fn well youre clear thats it weve got you released now on engrams oh now you try to take him up through the grades kooky things like this have happened but those are violations of standard tech standard tech includes that an fn is not valid fn unless its with gis but you say the thing did fn and he didnt have gis and when i started to run it further it packed up and the ta started up my dear fellow you now have found out that is was real fn so fn with bad indicators so you decide its just an fn with bad indicators and im going to do something else with this fn with bad indicators and im going to run it bit further im going to do something else with this all of sudden the fn packs up the ta starts up my god it wasnt an fn with bad indicators meaning an arc broke needle it was valid fn youve had it now of course youre going to have to come off of it and rehab it right away bongo rehab indicate the overrun it goes back to its proper fn hes just sort of sour puss pc in general but he never has nobodys ever seen any gis on him never seen any good indicators and so on well the trouble with the case is the trouble with the case is it is simply supercharged its just charged up case the guys just charged up like crazy well theres something wrong and person who has arc broke needles is an overcharged case who is liable to go low ta hes potential low ta case so the resolution of the low ta it was very necessary to say that standard tech covered all cases there are several ways to resolve low ta it is resolvable by valence shifting it is resolvable by proper run on ot3 it is even resolvable by prpr6 so i have just pulled the rabbit out of the hat recently and ive got low ta cases resolvable at the level of arc straightwire and secondaries and engram running we might as well cure them up there as any other place so i do pull some rabbits out of the hat every now and then whats resolvable on the upper levels ive made it now resolvable on the lower levels all of which is part of the standard tech which youre being taught alright now the high ta is inevitably and invariably overrunsinevitably and invariably but theres hooker on this overrun it might be the profession of somebody that is overrun and you have to find the person hes just one damn too many dentists and you find the dentist who constituted the overrun and the ta blows down the subject of dentistry doesnt go but the subject of dentists does do you follow he doesnt blow down on operation but it blows down on the subject of dentists how would you find such thing well you would normally find such thing very easily by the interesting mechanism that he was pts pts you do an s and d you get big blow down on the thing well he was actually overrun on this subject and that made him pts to it and its all very involved in his head but we dont care how it is so overrun is high ta but it could also be the overrun of the person you can get the phenomena of overrun showing up on an s and d and youll think maybe pts makes high tas it doesnt ok so you got the high ta you got the low ta and other things with regard to that and your technique is pretty straight now you think in my teaching of you that i at this stage of the game that i have become savage that i have become brutal that i have become utterably mean i call to your attention that i have taught you kindly and sweetly before now i wont try to make you wrong by saying you have done it all wrong because the actual fact before i arrange this course to teach you this i did get simplification of communication to try to find out where you might possibly be snarled up and have done everything i could to unsnarl it so im not trying to make you horribly wrong in everything you have learned im just trying to make you horribly right by getting you to get all the gain there is as an auditor and as case out of standard tech thank you very much
