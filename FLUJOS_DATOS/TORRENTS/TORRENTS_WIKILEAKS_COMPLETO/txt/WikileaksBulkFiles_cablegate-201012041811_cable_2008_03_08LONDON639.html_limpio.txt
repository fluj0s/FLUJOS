good vibrations ref london 453 classified by ambassador robert tuttle reasons 14 b d 1 cnf summary the labour party spring conference held february 27 march 2 in birmingham was characterized by low energy poor attendance and lack of charismatic leadership despite serving as kickoff to the partys campaign for the may 1 local elections in england and wales in his march 2 key note speech prime minister brown emphasized the need to prepare for the economy of the future and counted the opportunity costs for britain of poverty substandard education and poor health care vowing that his purposeful and progressive government would continue to battle those scourges browns vision excited opposition but it excited enthusiasm either at precampaign conference that suffered from low attendance and seemingly straightened finances aimed primarily at labours local level activists the conference focused on recruiting female candidates improving communications with minority communities and enhancing labours performance in local government media reporting focused on the irony that secretary for communities and local government hazel blears sipdis lauded mayor ken livingstone for revitalizing london ahead of the hotlycontested may 1 mayoral race without recalling that only eight years ago labour expelled livingstone from the party for insisting on running as an independent foreign secretary david miliband provided rare moments of star power for party that seems increasingly to miss tony blairs charisma end summary brown use the opportunity of power 2 cnf labours spring conference february 27march 2 in birmingham billed as the launching event for the may 1 local elections featured keynote speech by prime minister gordon brown intended to fire up the labour faithful in the event browns speech eloquent as it was in articulating his vision of the partys purpose failed to move the audience beyond more than polite applause opening with an admission that the last few months had been difficult brown talked about the series of challenges his government had faced as soon as it came into office floods foot and mouth disease avian flu and the global credit crunch he made mention of the decision not to go to early elections that precipitated labours plummeting poll numbers see ref instead brown talked about the global economy of the future in which skilled workers and entrepreneurs would reap highvalue returns and declared that higher standards of education would equip britons to succeed in globalized future economy he emphasized his view that poverty particularly among children was scar on britain and he graphically listed the ways in which the denial of potential through inadequate health and education costs britain talent and achievement labour government that was purposeful and progressive brown slipped and said powerful and progressive but corrected himself had to use the opportunity of power to bring the power of opportunity to those elements of british society in need 3 sbu while browns speech focused largely on domestic issues he did extend his analysis to the costs of poverty to the rest of the world noting that 72 million children have access to schools and vowing to eliminate diseases such as diphtheria tuberculosis and malaria brown called for an extension of sanctions on sudan and for the release of burmese dissident aung san suu kyi 4 sbu in qa session that followed browns remarks many of the questions from the audience had to do with the labour governments management of school standards and health care the bread and butter issues for labour members at the local level embassy comment discussion of educational issues became rather detailed one birmingham mp told poloff that the labour party is made up of teachers explaining that their parochial concerns tend to dominate party events end comment curiously given media reports of an imminent possible rebellion against the government on pending security legislation to extend the legal detention period from 28 to 42 days the subjects of terrorism police powers and civil liberties were not raised and while brown pounded the conservative party on its plans for tax cuts and opposition to the lisbon treatys plan for eu reform he made little reference to the upcoming battles for local councils in which the liberal democrat party poses as large threat to labour as do the tories number of labour students from cardiff rose to say she had been eight years old when labour came to power and asked what should she tell people now about what makes labour radical force brown reiterated his calls for ending poverty and eliminating disease globally palestinian asking what brown would do to end the conflict in palestine provoked rare outburst of applause brown responded by noting planned upcoming investment conference labours financial woes 5 cnf the lack of energy that hung like pall over the keynote speech was evident elsewhere either because of low attendance or the partys financial woes labour members groused that conference organizers had chosen bad weekend welsh members stayed away to attend the march 1 st davids day festivities back home st david is the patron saint of wales and his feast day is welsh nationalist obligation and the march 2 observance of mothers day in britain put many prospective attendees in the position of choosing between the labour party and their mums judging by the turnout mum won in many cases labour party workers who have been living on shoestring for the past several years were scarce on the ground those who were present were not particularly motivated asked for copy of the prime ministers speech one party worker referred poloff to the website version which several hours later had not yet been updated to reflect extensive changes in delivery some labour members noting the partys financial straits asked why so much money had been spent on the labour deputy leader race in 2007 noting that the money raised by the candidates would have been better spent to support the partys local campaigns this year female recruitment 6 c organized around three key themes the conference focused on recruiting female candidates improving communications with minority communities and enhancing labours performance on local government the three areas were selected with view to preparing for local elections but there seemed to be disconnect between the state of those efforts and the imminence of the may elections regarding womens empowerment mp barbara follett provided advice on presenting oneself effectively as woman candidate to an audience of about 25 women that included only one prospective not active candidate embassy comment while labour rightly congratulates itself on having more female mps that the tories the recruitmentempowerment process at the conference appeared to be still in its early stages end comment local labour organizations and the trades unions according to other speakers on womens issues are where women have to rise through the ranks without much help from the central party apparatus reaching out to muslim voters 7 c ten people including poloff showed up at an event aimed at improving labour outreach to muslim communities embassy comment given labours loss of muslim support following the iraq war the low turnout by party activists at this event was inexplicable end comment manchester councilor and former lord mayor afzal khan provided recommendations to labour candidates looking for votes in muslim communities including use as salam aleikum as greeting dont get hung up on shaking hands with females call into muslim radio programs send cards for muslim religious holidays and wait outside mosques on friday to hand out leaflets labour mep gary titley from bolton also provided the earnest advice to avoid assuming that all muslims hold identical views and to maintain links with communitybased organizations one british muslim from nottingham rose to describe what he felt was suppression of large muslim contingent in his local labour party khan told him there was democratic process and the muslims in nottingham should use it 8 sbu secretary for communities and local government hazel blears led the way on labours achievements in local government birminghams revitalized town center including the conference center that was the venue for the event were held up as labour achievements as was london mayor ken livingstones record in revitalizing london in break out groups however there was one ominous session on effective opposition labour members complained that for labour councilors who are on the front lines so to speak against tory and libdemdominated councils there is little or support from the party in either substantive policy terms or personal assistance milibands star power 9 cnf in an otherwise low key conference the frisson of excitement whenever foreign secretary david miliband appeared was palpable the european parliament labour party lunchtime event on the lisbon treaty that featured miliband as speaker drew packed hall he followed that appearance by session with over hundred labour students who clearly idolized him stumbling into what was belatedly revealed as private session poloff heard miliband outline his criteria for successful country of the future openness empowerment of the whole population and global linkages there is increasingly less of distinction between foreign and domestic policies he told the students and the challenge is to mobilize people to change the lessons of the 80s and 90s are that rainbow coalitions dont work in order to mobilize dynamic forces political leaders must develop unifying narrative or ideology in this respect labour must decide if it is the party of the working class or the party of the middle class answering questions on foreign policy miliband supported reform and noted the real issue at the is the uns failure to deliver on its responsibility to protect because most threats to civilians come from their own governments and not foreign invasions he defended uk participation in chinas olympic games as an opportunity to shine light on the real china warts and all he emphasized that iran represented dangers not just in nuclear weapons development and support for terrorism but also through its own domestic human rights practices for example he noted that iran has the highest per capita rate of capital punishment in the world comment 10 cnf labour members have been increasingly asking themselves the same question raised by the student from cardiff what makes labour radical after nearly 11 years in government for party that still contains large element who feel more comfortable in opposition such selfquestioning contributes to feeling of postblair rudderlessness even though blair ended up unpopular he was the sun around which the party orbited and his speeches matter the content sparked an emotional response browns earnest and praiseworthy vision excites opposition and yet it seems to excite great enthusiasm either with two months to go before local elections financiallyconstrained labour hardly seemed on the verge of mobilizing for campaign that will not only determine labours fortunes on the local level but may also affect gordon browns own tenure as leader the poorly attended conference lacked the buzz that strong parliamentary party representation would have provided and milibands star power notwithstanding there was catwalk of prospective challengers to brown but the irony of labours holding up ken livingstone as model of labour achievement only eight years after his expulsion from the party for running for london mayor as an independent was not lost on the uk
