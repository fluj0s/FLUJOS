argued that the regulations ar contrary to congressional intent and will mean irreparable injury for bankin g competitors of federal credit unions the case will now go to trial on the issue f granting permanent injunction with the date of decision unpredictable whil congressional att ention was focused on this issue on february 3 1999 with house banking committees subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer credit hearings legislation has been introduced the main issues concern whether the statutory directives to favor charterin g single credit unions ra ther than adding groups to existing credit unions and generally requiring groups over 3000 to be separately charte red have been properly interpreted by ncua in the hearings and presumably in the lawsuit aba charges that th regulations undermine congressional intent with the result that the credit unio n industry will be able to consolidate and expand an other point of contention revolves around whether local community as interpreted by ncua to include rural an d metropolitan jurisdictions of 300000 or less is reasonable interpretation of th statutory language considering the statutory purpose of requiring actual

credit unio n membership access act this legislation preserves existing multiple group occupational bond federal credit unions it contains instructions to ncua wit h respect to future applications by groups to be come or be joined with multiple group credit union ie ncua is to charter single groups where possible or to require the group to join credit union within reasonable proximity to the group

unions may extend their membership to persons an d organizations located within areas underserved by other depository institutions ncuas regulations interpreting these statutory provisions are at issue in the 1999 aba case which may well be decided on chevron grounds the credit union membership access act the credit union membership access act sets forth three categories or fields of membe rship under which federal credit union may be organized 1 singl associational or occupationa l common bond credit union 2 multiple common bond credit union and 3 community credit union the single common bond credit union has one gro up that has common bond of occupation or association 12 usc 1759b1 the multiple common bond credit union has more than one group each of which has common bond of occupation or association as general rule each of thes groups must have had more than 3000 members at the time it was first included 12 usc 1759b3 and d1 inclusion of groups having more than 300 0 members is permissible under any of series of exceptions 1 one exception permits adding persons from an underserved area r neighborhood 4 2 another exception applies to any group that the ncua

applies to any group transferred in connection with supervisory merger6 essentially the statute provides that other than for pervisory mergers and additions from unders erved areas only groups of 3000 or more that are not economicall viable may be added to another group or groups in multiple group credit union the statute requires ncua t issue guidelines and regulations establishing the criteria to accomplish this7 the statute further provides that the ncua where practicable and consistent with safety and sound ness encourage the formation of separate credit unions if that is not possibl in given situation then it must require the group to be included in credit union that is reasonably proximate unless questions of impracticality or safety and soundness are implicated under the legislation moreover the ncua i s8 prohibited from approving any application to add group unless it makes variou s determinations that are directed at assuring the credit unions safety and soundness and thus the integrity of th share insurance fund the required determinations are 1 that the credit ion has not engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice within the preceding year 2 the credit u nion is adequately capitalized 3 the credit union has the financial and administrative capability to serve the proposed group 4 an potential harm to other credit unions by the expansion is outweighed by the publi c good realized in meeting the needs of the group being added 5 and the credit union has met any additional requirements that the ncua has required by regulation9 the statute also provides that any regulation defining immediate family r household for credit union membership purposes and any regulation defining well defined local communi ty neighborhood or rural district for purposes of defining community credit union is to be treated as major ru thus delaying implementation for 60 days 10 the regulations generally on december 17 and december 22 1998 the ncua ap proved final rules

last year this subcommittee set up strai ghtforward approach to multiple bond and community credit unions which was incorporated in the final law this approach was predicated on three interrelated concepts each designed to giv preference to smaller locally controlled credit unions first ncua shoul d encourage single common bond credit unions whenever poss ible to strengthen this directive congress permitted only groups with fewer than 3000 to join another credit union except under prescrib ed extenuating circumstances second if new common bond were in fact added to an existing credit union the combinatio n should be with credit union located within reasonable proximity third th word local was added to the standard for community credit unions despit these clear d irectives from congress ncuas rule disregards this preference for smaller locallycontro lled credit unions and is biased toward large credit unions whether local or not testimony of harley d bergmeyer httpwwwhousegovbanking2399abahtm emphasis in original hereinafter aba testimony irps 941 59 fed reg 29066 june 3 199412those regulations conform with the intent of congress issues raised include d question s as to whether the regulations furthered statutory policies with respect t chartering separate credit unions and adding groups to reasonably proximate credit unions and whethe r ncuas definitions of community immediate family and household furthered the goals of the statute numerical limit of 3000 on groups that may be added one of the points discussed was whether the procedures established by the ncua for adding selec t groups to existing credit unions or combining groups in initially chartering multiple group credit unions comply with the statutory requirement that ncua encourage the formation of separately chartered credit unions wherever practicable an d consistent with reasonable standards for safe and sound operation of the credi t union 12 usc 1759 f criticism has been directed at ncuas approaches to determin ing economic viability of groups seeking credit union charter th geographic proximity requirements fo r adding new groups and the application of the statutory numerical l imitation of 3000 for groups seeking to be added to an existing credit union ncua has taken the position that the size of the group seeking a11 charter often indicates economic viability which it terms economic advisability in the regulations it set 3000 members as the mark of presumptive viability an d declared that an applicant with less than 3000 members may have to provide more evidence of viability such as pledge of continued financial support by the employer or sponsor than group of 3000 or more this figure of 3000 members was n increase from previous figure of 500 to critics setting floor of 3000 as a12 benchmark of group viability seems at variance with the statutorys ceiling of 3000 for adding to existing groups in announcing the promulgation of the regulations ncua advanced the 3000 thresh old as consistent with congressional intent as well as ncua experi ence and as not intended to undermine the statutory requirementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30090crs5 63 fed reg 71998 7200113 dennis dollar testimony before the house committee on banking and financial services14 subcommittee on financial institutions nd

board will encourage the formation of separatel chartered credit unions if it is prudent and economically advisable importan t factors in making t his determination however are the desire of the group

the formati on of new credit unions one reason advanced by ncua13 for the increase was that todays technology requires both startup costs an d sophisticated skills for credit uni on employees that are less likely to be found in small groups 14 while numer ical limit of 3000 is set as the general rule permitting group to join another credit union not having the same common bond the statute authorizes exceptions and requires that ncua issue guidelines for approvi ng additions of groups of 3000 or more ncua seems to have espoused balancing test that considers15 the 3000 numerical limit in the context of safety and soundness concerns the16 ncua guidelines require more detailed analysis for groups of 3000 or mor members the credit ion must demonstrate that the formation of separate credit union is not practical and that the group lacks volunteer and other resources t operate an economically viable credit union under ncua standards also required is identification of the new groups eligibility for membership in any other credi t union whether it has other credit union service available and information on th proximity of the group to the petitioning credit unions service facilities the proxi mity test for adding groups the statute requires that ncu include the group in credit union within reasonable proximity to the location of the group wherever practicable and co nsistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of the credit union the senate report accompanying thi s legislation states that this section provides for the ncua to encourage the formation of separatel chartered credit unions wherever possible consistent with safety and soundness instead of including an additional group within an existing credit unions field of membership if the formation of separate credit union by such group is t practicable or consistent with safety and soundness standards then the inclusion of that group is required to be in credit union within

case suggests that the function of matching groups seeking credit union services with credit unions interested in offering services to larger membership base can best be accomplished in the marketplace itselfthe match between select employee group and credit union involves number of factors some of which are tangibl and others that are intangible the underlying need is recognition on the part of both par ties that indeed the match is good fit for both srept 105193 105 cong 2d sess 7 199820 ththe regulations however do not set forth procedures directly implementing th reasonable proximity requirement for example there is nothing that indicates that ncua will consider whether an addition of group to credit union fulfills th reasonably proximate standard or whether the new group should be referred to closer credit union what is included is one general statement that ncua will attempt to assist any group in chartering credit union or joining an existing credit union if the group is not eligible for federal credit union service ncua will refer the group to the appropriate state supervisory authority wher different requirements may apply 18 ncua does not ask for any information about other nearby credit unions r reasons for not choosing to join them in testimony the credit union trad organization the national association of federal credit unions indicated that the idea that ncua would be matchmaker for groups seeking to join credit unions does not coincide with the reality of the credit union application process that th e19 statute requires matchmaking in some instances seems to be the position that aba has taken in its lawsuit p iece of legislative history that may be relevant appears in the senate report acco mpanying the final version of the legislation which declares the committee does not intend for these exceptions to provide the board wit h broad discretion to permit lar ger groups to be included in other credit unions these
