was developing new finance practice in the middle east and was in the market for top talent there was superb job for him in saudi arabia dass wasnt sure he had lived in singapore all his life and had secure job as an asset finance specialist with norton rose he was 38 and married with two young childrenbut he listened and as the recruiter spelled out the opportunities he became intrigued dla said the recuiter would soon have the largest law practice in the middle east already it had vast number of islamic finance transactions and could offer him lots of projects the move would broaden his skill set and double his salary he decided to discuss it with his wife i had to convince my wife to agree to put up with the hardships of living in place like that she needed lot of convincing eventually they decided to godla smideast debaclexxxxxxxxxxxxxx downtown dubai dla pipers vast new dubai office is mostly empty after its aggressive growth strategy gave way to bruising retreat david robinson reports chambers client report 5a striking example of unrealistic expectations poor execution and bad management former dla partner on the dubai officedla piper few months later in september last year dass and his family arrived in dubai with high hopes the plan was that he would spend month there getting to know his new colleagues before moving on to saudi arabia his hopes unfortunately did not long survive his arrival they didnt even know who to intro duce to nobody knew what was going on the dla partner who had first contacted dass former regional finance chief oliver agha had left the firm there was finance team partner in charge and legal work uncertainty hung over the office in fact it affected dla s middle east operation including the saudi office where dass was due to start within weeks his move to saudi arabia was called off and he stayed in dubai but the office was desperately short of work it was suggested at one time that he work in qatar then in saudi again but these suggestions came to nothing then in february 2009 came the final sugges tion he was told he was redundant he had little choice but to uproot his wife and children for the second time in six months and return to singapore and seek work in depleted job market dass was victim of dla s wildly ambitious middle east strategy the firm embarked on an aggressive hiring spree relied too heavily on one client and pumped vast resources into building finance team that failed to deliver its striking example of unrealistic expectations poor execution and bad management says former dla partner faced with huge losses the firm has slashed its dubai workforce its office in emaar square which boasted about 120 lawyers last december now houses about 60 according to lawyers at the firm the lawyers that remain have scarcely enough work to do and live in fear of losing their jobs growth for growths sake dla launched its whollyowned dubai office in may 2006 with five lawyersour strategy is about adding value wherever our clients do business rather than about size proclaimed dla piper jointceo nigel knowles as he sat next to then chairman george mitchell the former us senator at press conference our global footprint would not be complete without an office in dubai and we see this as the first step in our expansion strategy in the middle east senator mitchell added dla has subsequently opened wholly owned offices in abu dhabi qatar oman and bahrain in addition to joint ventures in saudi arabia and kuwait the threeway merger that created dla piper in 2005 gave the dla brand offices across the globe the missing link was the middle east and dubai was the natural focus point it boasted annual gdp growth of more than 15 dla needed to catch up with rivals that had thriving operations there regional chief david church was given mandate to aggressively develop the business he was pretty much given carte blanche says londonbased former dla partner over time church hired handful of middle east department heads he encouraged them to build competitive practices the emphasis was on growth in february 2007 dla hired oliver agha from clifford chances saudi arabian alliance firm aljadaan partners and made him an equity partner global head of islamic finance as well as head of finance for the middle east he promised to build the best islamic finance practice in the world recalls dla lawyer agha quickly set about putting his ambitious plan into action he flew around the world attending conferences on shariacompliant banking roped in lawyers from across dla s network and went on massive overseas hiring spree but despite enormous investment his practice failed to develop 6autumn 2009everyone understood that nakheel was the big goose that laid the golden eggs that sustained dla pipers whole middle east operation former dla piper associate dla piper many new recruits quit within weeks com plaining that the finance group lacked senior expertise and didnt receive enough work it was complete sham says former associate who quit after few months this lack of expertise began to alienate clients in winter 2007 dla advised noor islamic bank on transaction we only used them once our feeling is that there is more specialist counsel out there says omar rahan general counsel at noor islamic bank saudi hollandi banks head of islamic banking kamal mian uses less diplomatic language it was terrible he says recalling dla pipers involvement in 67 million islamic bond despite losing clients and struggling to gain work agha continued to hire by the time he contacted probin dass in spring 2008 and vinced him to join aghas group had grown to 20 lawyers dla also invested heavily in projects and construction in spring 2007 it hired damian mcnair from australian firm mallesons stephen jacques as its regional projects chief his arrival gave the dubai office welcome shot in the arm mcnair had an ace up his sleeve nakheel dubais biggest developer controlled 80 billion worth of real estate projects and was behind number of dubais largerthanlife projects including its famous palmshaped islands the developer provided dla with stream of construction work on multibilliondollar developments such as dubai waterfront with nakheel providing 80 of his teams work mcnair went on new hiring spree his team grew to about 15 partners and 40 lawyers in little over year everyone understood that nakheel was the big goose that laid the golden eggs that sustained dla pipers whole operation recalls former associate dla did not receive nakheels core finance work which stayed with clifford chance finance and projects drove the hiring spree but other practices were expanding too australian lawyers would in time dominate most groups every month you would get an email reporting that 1012 lawyers had joined along with similar number of support staff recalls former associate dla s dubai head count soon dwarfed its rivals by the end of 2008 its dubai office housed about 120 lawyers its middle east operation had about 140 lawyers in total the dubai offices of lovells and norton rose both hold about 30 lawyers it was growth for growths sake says peter hodgins dubaibased partner specialising in islamic insurance who left dla piper earlier this year for clyde co the firm didnt have the client base to sustain it the crisis hits in autumn 2008 lehman brothers collapsed and governments around the world resorted to drastic measures to remedy the ensuing crisis the global economy teetered on the brink but this did not deter dla piper in dubai the sharp rise in head count had seen the firm outgrow its 11000 sq ft office near dubai media city new recruits had to work out of hotels because there was so little space that autumn in apparent disregard for the gathering economic storm dla relocated to plush new 29000 sq ft office near dubais central business district which had room for more than 200 lawyers the merits of the move provoked fierce debate within the firm by this time dla s london management had started to worry the firm had pumped millions into its middle east venture but the dubai office had yet to turn profit that autumn finance chief oliver agha departed in acrimonious circumstances adding to the uncertainty at the end of the year former europe and asia senior partner peter wayte waschambers client report 7the socalled sabbaticals are just another way of terminating people its been handled in secretive manner one knows who has been fired until one day theyre not in the office anymore dla piper associatedla piper posted to the emirate to understand what had been going wrong unfortunately everything was about to get worse by early 2009 it became apparent that the foun dations of the dubai economy were as shallow and shifting as the sands of the arabian desert the staterun companies that had driven dubais property boom such as nakheel had borrowed heavily to finance an array of glittering developments but the downturn had left gaping holes in their balance sheets dubai was saddled with debts in excess of 80 billion in february the uae central bank stepped in with 10 billion bailout loan to dubai to avert crisis this rapid turn of events has sent shockwaves through the dubai economy real estate values in the emirate have plunged by as much as 50 and widespread job cuts have left thousands of homes and offices empty some bailout cash went to nakheel but the developers debts remain enormous the compa ny has been forced to drastically restructure its business merge number of units and lay off hundreds of staff the stream of nakheel work that sustained most of dla s dubai practice groups has all but dried up everything collapsed like pack of cards says former dla lawyer rage and redundancies new recruits were still coming through the door in february 2009 when dla s management hit the panic button probin dass was one of the first to be made redundant many more would follow officially the firm has made two rounds of cuts in the region in april it announced that eight dubaibased associates had been asked to leave this was followed by deeper cuts in june which saw one partner among the nine lawyers reportedly given their marching orderseighty lawyers remain in its dubai office dla management claims but dla lawyers say that various methods have been used to cut jobs reducing the number closer to 60 across the office many lawyers have been sub ject to costcutting measures including unpaid sabbaticals with job guarantees the so called sabbaticals are just another way of termi nating people says an associate at the firm its been handled in secretive manner one knows who has been fired until one day theyre not in the office anymore the firm denies that sabbaticals have been used as an alternative to redundancies but admits it will review the position of some staff placed on leave before they return adds dubaibased dla lawyer rumour has gone around the office that half dozen partners have been told that their notice period has been deemed to have begun in case they should need to be made redundant unless the firm makes lazaruslike recovery in the com ing months theyll probably lose their jobs dubaibased associates and salaried partners have been forced to take 5 pay cut only the tmt team has been relatively unaf fected and has maintained steady flow of work other practice areas have struggled the corpo rate group which hit 20 lawyers last year but has since shrunk has failed to make significant inroads in the market most of its lawyers have been placed on fourday week the office is half empty says dubaibased dla lawyer the dubai offices woes are mirrored elsewhere in the region in saudi arabia for instance the firm has struggled to build presence as probin dass found out to his cost foreign firms are required to have local sponsor to operate there so in 2006 dla signed an agreement with saudi lawyer abdulaziz alfahad the union failed to gel last summer it agreed new deal with islamic finance specialist abdulaziz bosaily that mt87mt111mt114mt108mt100mt32 mt83mt101mt114mt118mt105mt99mt101mt115mt32

lawyers and currently holds six the rent on its huge new premises in dubai and glamor ous penthouse offices in abu dhabi are together estimated to be in excess of 4 million t make matters worse

that more cost cutting was on the cards we are not going to deny that there are things that have happened that we would have pre ferred not to have happened darwin admits but nakheel is by means our only client the office has range of clients but i am unable to name them because of confidentiality some people in litigation and regulation in the it practice are busy we would prefer if people in

lawyer s website descended into lengthy slanging match as dubaibased lawyers vented their anger about the situation sadly the dla debacle in the middle east was all too predictable the firm underresearchedthe market and pursued fingerinthewind strategy wrote one anonymous poster the saddest part is the toll of misery of those who uprooted themselves from good jobs to follow the dla pied piper and who are now forced onto the job market at the worst possible time
