resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31723textile and apparel trade issues summary textile and appare l production and inte rnational trade have been important elements of economic activity and growth since the industrial revolution major reasons are 1 textiles and pparel are basic items of c onsumption in all countries and 2 textile and apparel manufacture particularly apparel is laborintensive requiring relatively little fixed capital fo r entrepreneurs to establish production facilities thus these industr ies are major generators of jobs in many countries because of its importance to the us ec onomy and to many us trade partners textile and apparel trade has been major issue in trade relations with number of countries and regions other industrialized countries have faced similar issues and in attempts to resolve conflicts between the interests of expor ters and importers number of agreements multilateral and bilateral were signed over the years generally restricting the qua ntities of textiles and apparel traded major recent event was the completion on january 1 2005 of the phaseout of such quotas as mandated by the uruguay round of trade negotiations in the 1990s in the last several decades textile nd apparel manufacture has been shifting to developing countries as whole with textiles and appare l accounting for large portions of their exports to industrially developed countries lower wages in developing countries together with the laborintensiveness of apparel production tend to give those countries cost advantage in apparel manufacture and locational advantage for their textile production als there have been large shifts in many individual countries shares of world tex tile and apparel trade since the mid1990s the basic worldwide shifts have affected and continue to negatively affect the us textile and apparel i ndustries while there have been few intermittent increases overall us output of textiles and apparel and associated employment in the mid 2000s are below peaks set in the last thr ee or four decades and are projected to decline further most trade participants analysts and observers expected that the quota phaseout would result in increased exports of textile s and apparel by deve loping countries as whole however it became widely believed and feared now seemingly justified that china will be major beneficiary at the expense of most other developing countries although india and pakistan are expected to benefit appreciably as well the united states and the european union have imposed limitations on the initial surge in imports from china as permitte d by the rules governing chinas accession to the world trade organization notwithstanding the potential difficulty for some us textile and apparel industry segments congress has eased trade terms on apparel from andean caribbean and subsaharan nations in moves to boost economic growth in poorer regions however the preferences are tingent in many cases on requirements that beneficiary country industries use usm ade materials in producing apparel in addition the united states has concluded free trade agreements with number of countries mainly

important elements of economic ac tivity and growth since the industrial revolution major reasons for this are 1 textiles and appare l are basic items of consumption in all countries and 2 apparel manufacture is laborintensive requiring relatively little fixed capital t hus these industries are major generators of employment modest capital requirements contributed to textiles and apparel being among the major industries at the start of the industrial revolution and contribute to these industries being importa nt to developing countries now the percentage of total manufacturing value added accounted for by textile production among developing countries in 2004 was th ree and half times the percentage among industrialized countries and the corresponding percentage for apparel production was two and half times that fo r industrialized countries1 lower wage rates in developing countries together with the laborintensiveness of apparel manufacture tend to give developing count ries comparative advantage in apparel manufacture and locational advantage for xtile manufacture thus textile and apparel ma nufacture is tending to shift to developing countries with textiles and apparel constituting large portions of their exports industrialized countries textile and apparel manufacture m easured by constant dollar value added increased between 1980 and 2004 whereas textile and appa

in textile and apparel production and trade described above have affected and c ontinue to affect the us highly developed and industrialized economy although there ve been few intermittent increases overall us production of tex tiles and apparel in the mid 2000s is below peaks set in the last three or four decades the dec line has been especially notable over the last several years for example us output of textile product materials4 nonapparel textile endproducts nd apparel in august 2006 was 33 11 and 37 respectively below the 1999 levels in c ontrast output by us manufacturing as whole nearly doubled between 1980 and 1999 and increased 16 between 1999 and august 20065 more significant to many in th us textile and apparel industries employment in those industries combined fell by more than 60 between 1980 and august 2006 the industries together employed about 610000 people that month compared with 21 million in 19806 some of the decline in us textile and apparel employment is linked to gains in productivity and some to increases in importation of textiles and apparel output per hour in us textile manufacturing more than tripled between 1960 and 1987 then rose more than 50 between 1987 and 2000 apparel manuf acturing output per hour doubled in the earlier period and near ly doubled agai n in the shorter later period thus increases in textile manuf acturing productivity we re faster between 1960 and 1987 and those in apparel manufacturing more rapid more recently us manufacturers of textiles and apparel have been facing intensifying foreign competition for much of the postworld war ii period by 1973 the united states had trade deficit of nearly 2½ billion in textiles and apparel c ombined and it has continued to rise steeply7 both textiles and apparel experienced increasing trade deficits into the mid1990s and it has tinued for apparel nd other textile endhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31723crs3 8 us international trade commission dataweb 9 us

us imports of apparel nd other textile ndproducts will exceed exports by an estimated 86 billion in the full year 20068 to great extent the increase in imports of apparel over the years reflects number of sharp increases in imports for example there were two ch increases in the 1960s one in the 1970s one in the 1980s and one in the 1990s however imports of yarn thread and fa brics essentially have leveled off since the mid1990s and exports of those materials have increased if the rates of yarn thread and fabric imports nd exports in the ten months of 2006 continued to the end of the year us yarn threa d and fabric producers will have experienced modest trade surplus of 13 billion especially recently usmade yarn and fabrics have fared better with respect to trade than usmade apparel and ot her textile endproduc ts yarn and fabric production is less laborintensive more eas ily automated and as major input to apparel can be exported to serve as input s to foreignmade pparel that then is exported back into the united states als us yarn and fabr ic manufacturers have been helped by requirements in trade agreements and trade preference programs that broadly require usmade yarn and fabr ics be used to produce the apparel made abroad us trade preference programs ar described later in this report growth in us fiber and fabric imports has leveled off fi ber and fabric exports have increased faster than imports and expor ts of have exceeded imports since 2001 us textile and apparel trade with deve loping countries is considerable in 2005 four of the top ten fibe r and fabric import sources seven of the top ten non apparel textile pr oduct sources and nine of the top ten apparel sources were developing countries for us exports six of the top ten fiber and fabric destinations two of the t op ten nonapparel xtile product destin ations and six of the top ten apparel stinations were deve loping countries mexico was one of the topfive in all the above import and expor t product groups and china was first as nonapparel textile endproduct exporter and first as an apparel exporter to the united states9 key aspect of trends in us textile and apparel manufacturing and in us textile and apparel trade po licy is the opposing interests of us importers and retailers and us manufacturers the fo rmer groups seek to obtain goods at the lowest cost which are imports in many cases to maximize their sales which of course tends to lower demand for the products of us xtile and apparel manufacturershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31723 crs4 table 1 us trade in textiles and

textiles and clothing in the world economy geneva july 1984 p 4041 11 in the early post world war ii period japan could fairly be called developing country 12 the multifiber arrangement sometimes is called the multifiber ag reement incorrectlytrade agreements the united states and other develope d industrialized c ountries began to experience steep increases in imports of textiles and apparel from developing countries in the 1950s and 1960s that di splaced domestic production in the former countries for example imports of appare l and fabricated tex tile products in current dollar value into the united states rose at an average annual rate of 18 between 1963 and 1968 and 20 between 1968 and 1973 developing countries increased their percentage of world exports of textiles from 18 to 22 between 1963 and 1973 and their percentage of world ex ports of clothing from 15 to 3510 attempts to ease the resulting conflicts between the interests of textile and apparel exporters and importers resulted in number of bilateral agreements mainly between developed and devel oping countries bearing on and generally restricting textile and apparel trade japan agreed to voluntarily control exports of cotton textiles to the united states as early as 195711 exporting and importing nations agreed under the auspices of the general ag reement on tariffs and trade to short term arrangement in 1961 and to long term arrangement in 1962 that controlled trade in cotton textiles among many subsequent agreements were those between the united states and five countries hong k ong japan korea ma laysia and taiwan in 1971 and between the us and macao and singapore in 1973 to establish maximum import levels of wool and manmade fiber textiles and apparel other agreements some multilateral such as the north american free trade agreement discussed below however have sought to increase trade with particular attention to textiles and apparel in many cases multifibre arrangement in the early 1970s the united states led in moves toward an international agreement on textile and apparel trade the arrangement regarding international trade in textiles was reached in 1973 k nown as the multifibre arrangement or mfa it provided for set of restrictions including schedule of individual country quotas on international textile and apparel trade12 the united states negotiated 18 bilateral agreements under the terms of the overall arrangement the mfa consolidated virtually all of pr evious bilateral agreements and applied common set of rules the bilaterally negotiated agreements departed from the basic rules of the general agreement on tariffs and trade particularly with respect to the principle of nondiscrimination these ag reements applied qua ntitative restrictions such as quotas when surges of imports of particular products caused or threatened to cause damage to the industry of th importing country the mfa effective january 1 1974 was intended to last four years with th aim of eventually phasinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31723crs6 13 article 7 of the atc says as part of the integration process and with reference to the specific commitments undertaken by the memb ers as result of the uruguay round all members shall take such actions as may be necessary to abide by gatt 1994 rules and disciplines so as to achieve improved ac cess to markets for textile and clothing products through such measures as tariff reductions and bindings reduction or elimination of nontariff barriers and facilitation of customs administrative and licensing formalitiesout the restrictions but it was extended several times it was replaced by the agreement on textiles and clothing which did phase out the quotas agreement on textiles and clothing among the outcomes of the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade which include the cr eation of the world trade organization wto was the agreement on textiles and clothing atc the atc which replaced the multifibre arrangement on january 1 1995 was transitional instrument that unlike the mfa phased out existing quotas improved access to the textile markets of developing countries and eventually placed trade in textiles and apparel under the rule s governing other products as part of the process the agreement calls for cuts in tariffs to achieve improved access to markets for textile and clothing products but systematic tariff reductions occurred under the atc13 the atc provided for 10year transiti on period for producers in the developed countries that had quotas to plan for and adjust to pros pective intensified competition from producers in developing countries quotas on textile and apparel imports were eliminated in four stages by set percentages of 1990 import volumes limits on remaining quotas rose at each stage with the final stage occurring on january 1 2005 notable feature of the atc was provision allowing importing countries to impose transitional safeguard mechanisms to protect against damaging surges of imports of products not under quota and not yet integrated under wto rules also while the atc specified the percentages of goods subject to quotas that must be phased out at each of four stages im porting countries could and did defer liberalization of the most sens itive products until the last stage many developing countries whose expor ts of textiles nd apparel had been limited by past agreements saw this strategy as unfairly deferring substantial liberalization of imports and constraint on their economic growth they wanted faster phaseout of quotas and were eager for acceleration of the benefits of existing agreements much of the negotiations related to textiles and apparel before during and between the seattle and doha ministerials pertained to this issue developing countries received some support from the european union and japan for accelerated implementation of agreements reached in seattle and they continued to press for accelerated implementation of the atc between those meetings doha declaration stated that the special needs and interests of developi ng and least developed countries were to be

groups ffected by that agreement the main nafta provisions related to textiles and apparel are the elimination of tariffs and quotas on goods coming from mexico and th elimination of mexican tariffs on us textile and apparel pr oducts to benefit from such free trade goods must meet the rules of origin which require in most cas that textile and apparel products trade among the nafta partners are made of rn and fabric manufactured in the free trade area the strict rules are meant to ensure that us fiber and fabric producers could continue to supply us textile and apparel compan ies that move

implementation and effects of the quota phaseout completion of the phaseout of quotas on textile and apparel trade removes hindrance to industries with competitivel yadvantageous characteristics in some countries to win markets fro m their counterparts in othe r developing countries and in industrialized countries exporting c ountry industries that had some assured market access along with restricted quan tities by virtue of an agreement with an importing country now face more open comp etition especially in laborintensive apparel manufactureassembly the actual ex tent of implementa tion of the phaseout however has been uneven so far implementation caveats if implementation is defined as the ability of countries political leaders to permit the provisions of the agreement on textiles and clothing to take full effect it can be argued that complete implementation may be difficult for at least three reasons 1 the fourth stage of import quota phaseout was large in terms of the proportion of the volume of xtile and apparel ite ms that are scheduled to be freed from quotas 2 the fourth stage covered ite ms that were left to the end because of their domestic sensitivities and 3 the phaseout is major symbolic as well as actual step toward further globalization considered by some as economically and environmentally oppressive ndor as an intrusion into their economic or personal lives the actuality of the economic conseque nces of the full effect of the atc may aggravate those negative feelings with respect to procedure some considered it likely that parties that are harmed by or perceive threat from goods pr oduced abroad would use the safeguard mechanisms available41 and at least with respect to the united states and the eu some safeguards already have been put in place see discussion under pre and posthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31723crs19 implementation developments as described earlier chinas wto accession agreement allows the united states and ot her member

textiles and apparel still is constrained to some extent by tariffs which are not required to be reduced by the atc competitiveness factors the expiration of the quotas on textile and apparel trade removes hindrance to winning markets for industries in c ountries with competitivelyadvantageous characteristics while low labor costs ar important numerous other factors in one country can combine to offset lower labor costs in another country or provide an advantage over another country with comparab labor costs other factors include labor skills workforce availability managerial quality proximity to markets infrastructure suitability degree of market access quality and cost of material inputs availability and cost of capital level of service and business climate labor skills and work force availability are among the factors that determine effective labor costs better trained work ers tend to be more productive and wages tend to be higher if tex tile and apparel producers face substantial competition for workers from other parts of the economy geographical locati on and transportation availability and proficiency affect delivered prices and shipment times the market access afforded by trade preference unilaterally provided or by agreement might offset disadvantageous characteristics but this can depend heavily upon the strictness or looseness of any rules of origin provisos quality and cost of inputs depends upon factors such as the presen ce or absence of supplier industries andor upon other access to raw materials and inte rmediate inputs including the sizes of any tariffs on imports of material inputs level of service includes pr oduct quality scope of service reliability and flexibility political stability citizen safety security of operations reliability of telecommunications and the consistency efficiency and honesty of the legal and co mmercial systems are among characteristics determining countrys business climate pre and postphaseout procedural developments given the widespread pre2005 prediction of substantial market capturing by chinese and other asian exports some veloping country g overnments and textile and apparel industrie

of products still under quota the group claime d that cita was causing irreparable harm by proceeding to consider the petitions using the threat of market disruption instead of actual market disruption as criterion for considering safeguard quotas ultimately an appeals court stayed an injunction imposed by the international trade court and cita proceeded on several of the cases between december 2003 and late oct ober 2005 cita formally requested consultations with china and simulta neously implemented quotas on several categories of apparel on november 8 2005 it was announced that the united states and china had signed threeyear pact limiting chinas exports of 34 textile and apparel products until 2008 whic h was very similar to the agreement the european union had reached with china china obj ected to us imposition of the safeguard quotas especially those based upon an alleged threat of market disruption49 effect on us producers and the us economy as already discussed and

for domesticallyproduced textiles and apparel will tend to further the long term shift in the us economy from lower to higher valu added industries and tend to increase average wages in manufacturing if labor is sufficiently mobile effects on developing countries the phaseout of textile nd apparel quotas tends to remove an obstacle to industries in lowerlaborcost nations generally developing countries to win markets from their counterparts in industrialized c ountries thus it is reasonable to expect that the shift in textile nd apparel production fro m developed to veloping countries will continue moreover there is considerable scope for the shift to at least continue inasmuch as industrialized countries still accounted for bout 59 of world textile production and 66 of world apparel production in 200450 also in general elimination of quotas provides more scope to countries whose industries are more efficient to gain at the expense of countri with less efficient industries in this context efficiency par ticularly connotes the ab ility to pr oduce at lower cost measured in common currency in some cases whatever gains in physical sales volume that textile and apparel exporters derive as result of the quota pha seout may be offset to some extent by lower prices per unit that result from free access to markets in quota regimen prices tend to be higher than they othe rwise would be as quotas act as rationing device in some cases textile and pparel producers subject to quotas benefit by receiving the higher prices on smaller volumes themselves sometimes the higher prices are in the form of formal quota charges added to the market price by private sector exporters manufacturer s or others that hold entitlements to quotas or by the government that administers the quotas key goal of and expectation from th atc quota phaseout was that world economic welfare will improve summary of quantitative studies on the impact of the phaseout that was prepared in connection with conference on that subject51 reported that all the reviewed studies produced estimates that global welfare willincrease but with considerable varia tion of magnitude among the studies and considerable variation in the distribution of welfare gains by region andor country the estimates of most of the studies indicat ed that developing countries will be the main beneficiaries of th quota phaseout but some studies resulted in estimates showing that developing countries woul d experience diminished welfare in the aggregate however the modeling results of the studies consistently indicated that there will be considerable shift in textile nd apparel production nd trade to asian and other developing countries with ch production falling and imports increasing in industrialized countries

most trade participants analysts and observers expected that the quota phaseout would result in increased exports of tex tiles and apparel by developing countries as w hole during the uruguay round of trade negotiations it was the developing countries that espoused the phaseout most strongly however it became widely believed and feared now seemingly justified that china will be major beneficiary at the ex pense of most other developing countries although india and pakistan are expect ed to benefit appreciably as well55 data and other information china is an especially vigorous and strong competitor in world textile and apparel trading regimen by virtue of its rapid i ndustrialization large economy substantial natural resources fast economic growth and large population also it has fewer trade rule restraints now that as member of the wto its quotas have expired major factor is chinas quasiprivatizati on of its agricultural sector and consequent gain in productivity which is releasing portions of its large rural population from agricultural work for employment in urban industrial centers such large availability of workers tends to restrain wage rates the itc study and some others see china as having low labor costs high productivity locallyproduced materials and able to make almost any type of textile and appare l product at any qu ality level at competitive price56 in addition many assert chin uses unfair trade practices such as currency manipulation57 other asian countries while china is expected to become and may well have become the supplier of choice

out along with mfa quotas on january 1 2005 countries eligible for dutyfree us textile trade preferences may have potential advantage over some other potential suppliers depending greatly upon beneficiary countries geographical proximity to the united states thus it is not surprising that the caribbean countries as group constitute the largest market by fa r for us fiber yarn and fabric among the three us trade preference regions table 2 as noted earlier us domestic exports of fiber yarn and fa bric to cbtpa countries whic h had been rising at least since the mid1990s increased sharply in 2001 the calendar year following the going into effect of the cbtpa and have rise n further since then however it should not be inferred that geographical proximity is the only factor in determining competitive advantage regional trade agreements there is separate issue of the effect s of the quota phaseout on the textile and apparel industries in countries that are parties to the num erous regional and bilateral trade agreements and now in place and vice versa generally it would appear that the phaseout would tend to diminish the benefits of regional agreements to the participating pa rties on the other hand the structur relationships formed as result of such trade agreements may limit the hoped for gains of the tex tile and apparel quota phaseouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31723crs27 appendix estimating imports share of the us textile and apparel markets to reflect as closely as possible the structure of textile and apparel manufacturing textiles and apparel were disaggregated into three categories yarns fibers and fabrics the basic materials for manufacturing textile endproducts b finished textile products other than apparel and c finished apparel and apparel accessories the framework now used to collect and compile industry and product data in canada mexico and the unite d states the north american industry classification system uses these classifications for textiles and apparel the percentages provided in table 5 are rough estimates in which the total value of imports in each of the above textile and apparel categories is related to the approximate sizes of the us market of each of the categories in each case the latter was estimated by frequently used method of approximating the size of national market for particular category of goods which adds total shipments by domestic manufacturers of the category of goods to to tal imports of the category of goods and subtracts exports of that category of goods thus the market is implicitly defined as total purchases at manufacturers prices of the particular category of goods in the country the import data esse ntially are at manufacturers prices and are on customs value basis this approach to estimating market share while relatively s imple and convenient to use disregards the fact that the total value of shipments by an industry contains some double counting of the value of its out put this is because some industry firms produce material inputs that are sold to ot her companies in the industry that further transform the materials and as is the us ual practice the sales totals value of shipments of the former group are both in cluded as component of total industry sales and in effect in the sa totals of the latter group in asmuch as the value of the former groups output is included in the va lue of the latter groups output the value of imported goods produced by industries in foreign countries does not include such double counting however thus the numerator of the ratio imports of textiles and apparel from china is not comparable to the denominator as the measure of the us market for textiles and appa rel includes double counting the effect is to understate imports share of the us textiles and apparel markets
