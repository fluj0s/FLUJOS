bilateral cooperation on wide range of foreign polic defense and intelligence issues that has developed over the cour of many decades and more recently from the uks strong support in countering terrorism and confronting iraq the united states and britain also share mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship and are each others biggest foreign direct investors nevertheless some policym akers and analysts on both sides of the atlantic question how special the special re lationship is between washington and london former uk prime minister tony blair who stepped down on june 27 2007 sought to build good rapport with the bush administration to both maximize british influence on the global stage and to strengthen the uk as the indispensable bridge between the united states and europe but many british critics charged that blair received little in return for his strong support of controversial us policies some suggest that new british prime minister gordon brown may be less likely to allow the united states to influence uk foreign policy to the same degree as did blair given the ongoing uk public unease with the war in iraq and the bushblair alliance others contend that brown is strong supporter of the anglosaxon political alliance and ec onomic model and thus is unlikely to initiate any substantive changes in uk policy toward the united states meanwhile despite britains traditional ambivalence toward the european union eu the uk in its desire to play key role in bigger and more integrated eu may inevitably be drawn closer to europe in the longer term analysts note that some uk foreign policy impulses are closer to those of its eu partners than to the united states for example like other eu member states britain places great emphasis on multilateral institutions as means for managing international crises and legitimizing the use of force others argu that the conduct of british foreign policy has never been nor will it ever be as simplistic as blackandwhite choice between the united states and europe preserving the uks position as strong us ally and leading eu partner provides uk foreign policy with maximum flexibility to promote its diverse interests in eu rope and beyond consequen tly the uk will continue to seek close ties with both the united states and the eu for the foreseeable future this report assesses the

bilateral cooperation on wide range of foreign polic defense and intelligence issues that has developed over the cour of many decades and more recently from the uks strong support in countering terrorism and confronting iraq following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks former uk prime minister tony blair stated that he considered the attacks on the united states as attacks on britain following the deadly terrorist bombings in london on july 7 2005 that killed 52 innocent victims the united states reciprocated expressing solidarity with the british people and government and offering any intelligence law enforcement or other assistance necessary the us senate and h ouse of representatives in the 109th congress each passed unanimous resoluti ons condemning the 2005 london

gordon brown assu med the uk prime ministership from blair the modern usuk relationship was rgely forged during the second world war and cemented during the cold war by the need to deter the soviet threat it is often described as the special relati onship by policymakers and scholars in particular because of the unusually clos usuk intelligence arrangement and the unique usuk cooperation in nuclear and defense matters the united states and the uk have collaborated in collecting and sharing intelligence since world war ii and london continues to share intelligen ce with washington and other english speaking countries australia canada and new zealand that it does not share with its european allies or eu partners uk us cooperation on nuclear technology also dates back to the 1940s and the united stat has supplied britain with the missile delivery systems for its nuclear warheads since 1963 during the cold war the uk served as vital base for us forces nd cruise missiles and continues to host us military personnel albeit at re duced levels and us defense planners view the uk as one of only two european allies the other being france able to project significant military

cooperation has gendered degree of mutual trust between the united states and the uk that also extends to the diplomatic and political fields the united states and britain are two of five permanent members of the security council and are founding members of nato us and uk officials from the cabinet level to the working level consult frequently and extensively on the full spectrum of global issues many us and uk diplomats report often turning to each other first and almost reflexively when seeking to build support for their respective positions in multilateral institutions or during times of crisis as in the immediate aftermath of the september 11 attacks on the united states some say that the common language and cultural similarities as well as the habits of cooperation that ve developed over the years contributes to the ease with which us and uk policymakers interact with each other the mutually beneficial usuk trad and economic relati onship is another important aspect of the usuk partners hip the uk has the fifth largest economy in the world and is the fifth largest us export market worldwide even more significantly the uk and the united states are each others biggest foreign investors us military and economic suprem acy however has caused many to characterize the uk as the junior partner in the usuk relationship and to note that the relationship is more special to britain than it is to the united states in the aftermath of world war ii as the british empire crumbled and the uks relative poverty and military weakness became evident the united kingdom made strategic decision to stick close to the united states as way to preserve as much of its fading power as possible leverage its influe nce internationally and better protect its interests in europe and the world this has been guiding principle of british foreign policy especially since the 1956 ez canal crisis during which the uk was forced to abandon its joint military operati on with france and israel in the middle east in the face of us disapproval and ec onomic pressure that led to run on the pound nevertheless there have been num erous ups and downs in the usuk relationship over the years2 former prime minister blair who st epped down as uk leader on june 27 2007 after 10 years in office sought to build good rapport with both the clinton and bush administrations in order to further the special relationship maximize british influence on the global stage and strengthen the uk as the indispensable bridge between the united states and europe as result some claimed that london had more political capital in and influence on washington than any other foreign government especially during the bush administration british critics however charged that blair got little in return for his unwavering support of controversial us policies in the fight against terrorism and in iraq some have called for reevaluation of the usuk partnership others note that blair paid high political price both with the british public and his ow n labour party for his close alliance withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33105crs3 bush and some suggest that future british prime ministers may chart more independent course fro m the united states upon assuming office in 1997 prime minist er blair and his labour party also pursued larger role for the uk in the european union eu the uk stood aside in the early 1950s when the six founding continental countries began the european project british leaders feared that uk participation in european integration would infringe too much on uk sovereignty and detract from rather than add to british influence in the world they also worri ed that the usuk special relationship would be endangere d despite washington s assertions to the contrary the uk finally joined the european community ec the eus predecessor in 1973 although many britons have re mained skeptical of the eu and ambivalent in their support for further european integration the uk has been consistent supporter of eu enlargement and turkish membership in the eu and blair was key driver of eu efforts to forge an eu defense arm and common foreign policy the uk however does not participate in the eus si ngle currency the euro nor in the eus open borders system some analysts sugge st that the uk may inevitably be drawn even closer to europe in the longer term especially if tensions in the broader us european relationship drive the tw sides of the atlantic apart gordon brown who served as uk chance llor of the exchequer equivalent to the us treasury secretary throughout blairs tenure took over as labour party leader on june 24 2007 in an uncontested election and became prime minister upon blairs resignation on june 27 2007 brown and blair have been both close political partners and rivals for over two decades and brown has long aspired to succeed blair although many regard brown as something of an unknown quantity as far as foreign policy is concerned most experts do not believe that he will make any major substantive changes in relations with the united states at the same time brown will likely be cautious of developing too close of personal relationship with bush given the british publics unease with the bu shblair alliance and the war in iraq this report assesses the current state of usuk relations it examines how special the special

conservative tory party rule blair became labour party leader in 1994 and is r ecognized as one of the key architects of new labour prompting the party to abandon its statist trade union past and to embrace free markets and competition in 2001 blair decisively secured second term and in 2005 the labour party won an hi storic consecutive third term in office albeit with reduced parliamentary

over period of uk economic expansi on that began in 1993 between 1997 and 2001 real gdp grew by an annual average of 31 unemployment is low at just under 5 and growth continues in the 23 range although it has slowed since the 2001 global economic downturn key domestic goals for blair included improving the delivery of public services promoting government reforms and tackling crime immigration and asylum issues many analysts view blair as achieving some progress in these areas but perhaps falling s hort of the high expectations set in 1997 for sweeping reforms blair is widely credited however with being driving force behind political settlement in northern ir eland problem that many say he devoted more time and attention to than any other british prime minister he was instrumental in forging the 1998 good friday agreement and pushing the parties in succeeding years toward fully implementing the peace plan and sharing power process that culminated in may 2007 with the return of selfrule to northern ireland internationally blair did not shy away from the use of military force especially to further humanitarian aims such as stopping ethnic cleansing in kosovo in 1999 the september 2001 attacks on the united stat put countering terrorism on the top of blairs agenda and he is viewed as one of the few european leaders who largely shared president bushs vision of the fi ght against terrorism as one between good and evil british forces participated in the usled military action in afghanistan from its start in october 2001 and blair shar ed bushs belief that iraq under saddam hussein posed an immediate threat to international security3 public opposition to the uk role in the wa r in iraq and domestic questions about blairs trustworthiness contributed significantly to labours diminished parliamentary majority fr om 161 to 66 seats in the 2005 elections although labour won roughly 35 of the national vote this represented decrease of over 5 percentage points from labours share of the vote in 2001 and the lowest share for any majority british government in mode rn history since 2003 blair had come under repeated fire including from some pr ominent members of his own party for allegedly exaggerating intelligence about iraqs nuclear and biological weapons capabilities and misleading the uk into war labours opponents used ongoing british casualties in iraq and government documents leaked during the campaign that some suggested proved that blair was committed to the use of force in iraq as early as the summer of 2002 to keep

british involvement in the war in ir aq remains deeply unpopular especially amid iraqs difficult security situation and the ongoing political and ethnic strife many commentators view iraq as blairs greatest failure over the last few years some say that iraq has also overshadowed much of blairs domestic agenda and other international priorities such as resolving th israelipalestinian conflict some credit blair however in succeeding in putti ng global climate change and african development high on the international agenda some analysts also contend that blairs ambitions to position the uk as leader in europe were weakened by blairs close alliance with the bush administration they note that the usled war in iraq in 2003 bitterly divided the eu and pitted blair against the former l eaders of france and germany who strongly opposed the use of force in iraq moreover they suggest that blairs limited political capital in the aftermath of the war in iraq further circumscribed his governments ability to bring the uk into the eus single currency or to significantly reduce british skepticism of the eu integration project although blair initially championed proposed eu constitutional treat implementing major internal reforms much of the british public feared that some changes coul d pave the way for an eu superstate at blairs final eu summit in june 2007 eu leader s

noted above brown and blair have been both close political partners and rivals for ove r two decades they first met in 1983 when they entered the house of commons and shared an office as new members of parliament brown and blair discovered mutual frustration with labours direction and the leftwing infi ghting they were both convinced that labour had to change if it was ever going to win power again the two quickly became inseparable and were both prom oted into labour leadership positions by 1994 however brown and blair found themselves pitted against each other as rivals for party leader

chancellor over domestic policy and that blair would hand over power to brown at future date rumored to be after blair serv ed two terms in office analysts say that as the years went on brown came to believe that blair had reneged on key part of the granita deal and intended to remain as prime minister far longer than originally planned the tensions between the two and their respective supporters grew over time even as brown remained publicly loyal to blair in 2004 blair came under increasing pressu re over iraq including from many prominent members of his own party and faced questions about his health after suffering heart problems blair attempted to kill the rampant speculation that he might quit by announcing that he inte nded to fight the upcoming 2005 general election serve full third term but then stand down allowing his successor to fight fourth term political commentators not however that this announcement only served to increase speculation about bl airs departure date and led opponents both within and outside of labour to brand him as lame duck although brown staunchly backed blai r in the 2005 election observers suggest that brown pporters bega n to call more insistently for blair to announce resignation date especially given the election results and labours d iminished parliamentary major ity tensions came to head in the summer of 2006 following an interview in which blair seemed to indicate that he would not step down for several more years and in the midst of his failure to swiftly condemn israels bombing of lebanon blairs decision on lebanon which was in line with bush administration policy was viewed by ma ny in labour as yet another example of blairs subservience to washington and some say was the final straw for many normally loyal

office brown and the labour party enjoyed an in itial honeymoon period opinion polls for most of the summer of 2007 showed brown and labour ahead of the rival conservative party for the first time in almost year the conservatives had benefitte d from declining public support for blair and from their new younger leader david cameron who sought to modernize the party and make it more inclusive brown however received high marks over the summer for his governments effective response to the june 2007 failed car bomb attacks in london and glasgow serious flooding in the uk and an outbreak of

some suggest to contrast with his predecessors focu s on foreign policy and announced that he would put priority on improving hous ing health care and education7 in light of the favorable opinion polls in the summer of 2007 there was intense media speculation that brown might call an early election in the fall in order to gain public mandate as prime minister press reports suggested that brown and his political advisors had begun the process of planning for an autumn snap election in october 2007 however brown announced that he would not call an early election in order to give himself more

labour by an average of four percentage points in an effort to regain the political initiative press reports indicate that the brown government will embark in 2008 on new round of new labour reforms ranging from immigration to welfare analysts note that brown is unlikely to call for new election until 2009 at the earliest8 brown foreign policy and implications for the united states although many regard prime minister brown as something of an unknown quantity as far as foreign policy is concerned most experts do not believe that he will make any major substantive changes in relations with the united states he is largely expected to seek to retain the uks position as key and influential us ally they note that brown has long been str ong supporter of the anglosaxon political alliance and economic model in one of his first major foreign policy speeches in november 2007 brown asserted that i be lieve our ties with america founded on values we share constitute our most important bilateral relationship9 at the same time some analysts suggest that brown may be less likely to allow the united states to influence uk foreign policy to the same degree as has blair in part because brown is viewed as more in tune with the labour party faithful one pundit put it this way other things bein g equal brown would want to be good ally of the americans but he would care more about what

blairs pursuit of an international agreement on climate change as for uk relations with the eu brown is viewed as desiring an outward looking economically vibrant eu and has s ought to put more emphasis on this goal than on deeper integration brown is often perceived as more euroskeptic than blair reputation he earned in part because of his opposition to britain joining the single european currency the euro some obser vers assess that brown has been largely absent on the eu scene since assuming the prime ministership both because of his own ambivalence toward the eu and hi s focus on winning the next uk election also they suggest that brown has been an xious to keep the eu off the public radar screen given his governments decision to ratify the new eu reform treaty the lisbon treaty through parlia ment rather than risk hol ding public referendum that might fail and throw the eu into new cr isis brown reportedly views the lisbon treaty as necessary to enable an enlarged eu to function more effectively but has also asserted that it should mark the end of eu institutional reform for the foreseeable future thereby allowing the eu to focus on other global concerns browns

trends as noted above strong relations with th united states have been cornerstone of uk foreign policy to varying degrees since the 1940s most uk policymakers have looked upon being loyal ally to the united states as way to magnify the uks influence internationally and protect its global interests in 1944 the uk foreign office described its american policy as being to steer this great unwieldy barge the united states into the right harbor13 uk officials long viewed themselves as americas foreign policy guide and mentor often attempting to quietly exert restraint some experts suggest that the united states has been more inclined to listen to the uk than to other european allies because of the uks more significant military capabilities and willingness to use them against common threats the uk has also viewed maintaining good re lations with the eu as an essential part of british foreign policy despite ongoing british ambivalence toward the eu the british governments decision in the 1960s to apply for membership in the european project was largely driven by concerns that the uk economy was suffering from being outside the club as well as fear s that frances political dominance of the experiment was growing too strong ever since the uk acceded to the eceu in 1973 successive british govern ments have sought to balance british interests between washington and brussels at the same time some uk foreign policy impulses are closer to those of its eu partners than to those of the united states this has become more evident as the eu has evolved into political as well as ec onomic actor and in the years since the 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states like its other eu partners britain places great emphasis on multilateral institutions as means for managing international crises and legitimizing the use of force meanwhile the united states views this approach as only one option furthermore the uks col onial history in the middle east and its relatively large muslim community bet ween 15 to 2 million muslims out of population of roughly 60 million influences so of its policy choices in ways that are distinct from those of the united stat for example london views resolving the israelipalestinian conflict as top pr iority maintaining that it is the key to reshaping the middle east and decreasing the terrorist threat both at home and abroad while washington

gave the uk more influence in the eu while the united kingdom would have more influence in washington if it played central role in europe they suggested that britain might cease to matter to

tion in 1997 that britain will be more valuable and more valued ally of america if we do actually emerge as leading partner within europe because britain which does not have influence in europe will be of less inte rest to washington14 other experts suggest however that the blair government was also eager to promote the uk as leader in europe to give britain more options in its foreign policy and decrease british dependency on the united states many uk policymakers were alarmed by us hesitancy in the early 1990s to intervene in the balkan conflicts prompting serious questioning of us reliability and natos role in the postcold war era at the same time blair and many of his advisors believed that europe had failed to pull its weight diplomatically or militarily in the balkans they recognized that the violence in the balkans laid bare europes inability to manage or intervene in such crises on the european continent let alone further afield as result they concluded that the european allies needed to be better prepared to undertake peacekeeping or crisis management missions on their own in the event that the united states chose not to participate in 1998 blair reversed britains long standing opposition to the development of an eu defense arm and threw greater support behind eu efforts to forge common foreign policy the 1999 nato ai r campaign in kosovo further exposed europes military weakness and gave adde d momentum to these initiatives the british moves were widely interpreted as an attempt to demonstrate britains leadership in europe at time when the uks influence had lessened due to its absence from the launch of the eus single currency blair maintained that any eu defense role should not undermine nato and argued that improving european military capabilities would enable the allies to better share the security burden however us critics were suspicious that britains policy reversal on an eu defense arm indicated that the uk was inclined to support french ambitions to develop the eu as counterweight to the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33105crs12 15 ash op cit p 49 and glenn frankel from memos insights into allys doubts on iraq war washington post june 28 2005 16 discussions with uk official s and experts springsummer 2005relations postseptember 11 following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states some analysts contend that prime minister blair hewed more closely to washington than to his other eu partners many argue that this was because blair unlike other european leaders immediately grasped how september 11 changed everything both for the united states but also with regard to the international threat posed by terrorists especially if they were able to acquire weapons of mass destruction uk diplomats stress that blair was deeply cerned about such threats including the one posed by saddam hussein in ir aq long before september 11 2001 regardless after september 11 the blai r government made strategic choice to stand by the united states and stuck with this choice as the bush administration began to pursue regime change in iraq according to an account of march 2002 cabinet meeting by robin cook who was th leader of the house of commons blair stated that britains national interest laid in steering close to the united states because otherwise the uk would lose its influence to shape us policy he argued that by seeking to be the closest us lly britain stood better chance of preventing washington from overreacting pursuing its objectives in iraq in multilateral way and broadening the us agenda to in clude what the uk and other eu partners viewed as the root causes of islamist terrorism such as the ongoing israeli palestinian conflict15 the degree to which the uk has successfully influenced us policy choices in the war on terrorism iraq and other issues has been topic of much debate on both sides of the atlantic uk officials contend that blair played crucial role in convincing the bush administration to wo rk through the united nations to disarm iraq even though this initiative ultimately fa iled they argue that the priority blair placed on resolving the israelipalestinian conflict helped encourage us efforts in the immediate aftermath of the iraq war in the late spring of 2003 to become more engaged in the search for peace britis h officials also point to the 2001 war in afghanistan the 2002 indianpakistani nuclear crisis and the rehabilitation of libya as issues where the uk has worked closely with the united states and affected us policy choices for example the uk was instrumental in pressing for meaningful international peacekeeping presence in afghanistan which resulted in the creation of the international security assistance force isaf16 in addition british diplomats cite the close relationship and trust built between prime minister blair and president bush as key reason why the uk gained us acquiescence to the december 2003 natoeu d eal to enhance eu defense planning capabilities many us officials had worried that allowing the eu to develop its own operational planning ce ll would duplicate and compete with nato structures and be first step in driving the alliance apart however blair reportedly called bush at least twice to discuss the issue and reassure him that the new eu planning cell would not weaken nato

june 2007 on one of blairs final days in office the treaty among other measures seeks to ease the export of sensitive us defense technology to the uk something long pressed for by british officials critics contend however that blair got little in return for his staunch support of controversial us policies over the last few years many british commentators have described blair as the american presidents poodle blai r opponents point out that he did not succeed in keeping th united states on multilateral path with regard to the use of force in iraq and although blair supported giving the united nations significant role in reconstructing iraq the bush administration initially opted for more limited i nvolvement although pres ident bush made some efforts toward being more engaged in the search for peace in the middle east in the immediate aftermath of the iraq war british critics claim that bush has not made resolving the israelipalestinian conflict priority uk critics have also suggested that us responses to blairs initiatives on african development and climate change have often fallen shor t and further demonstrate that blairs close relationship with bush has yielded few benefits for britain18 some british officials complain privately that many us policymakers expect the uk to function automatically as the us water carrier in the eu that is to fight for us policy positions on political and security issues such as eu defense structures or eu relations with china although uk views on such issues often align with those of the united states british diplomats assert that us reliance on the uk to support us interests in the eu or be the peacemaker often puts them in an uncomfortable position causing some eu members to view the uk as little more than americas trojan horse they argue that washington must be more sophisticated in managing its relationshi p with the eu and should engage robustly with other eu capitals not just london to argue for its point of view especially when potentially divisive issues are concerned19 future prospects uk officials argue that the conduct of british foreign policy has never been as simplistic as blackandwhite

interests in europe and beyond consequently the uk will continue to seek close ties with both the united states and eu for the foreseeable future regardless of which party or persona lities holds power in either london or washington many experts also note that british instincts toward protecting uk national sovereignty from eu encroachment remain strong and uk officials are not about to cede their freedom of action in foreig n policy and defense matters to the eu anytime soon nevertheless some analysts suggest that the balance in the triangular usuk eu relationship could change in the years ahead with the uk ultimately drawn closer to europe they point out that geographically the uk is much closer to continental europe than to the united states and over 50 of uk trade is with its other eu partners as member of the eu the uk has already given up some sovereignty to the union in certain areas and is therefore bound to the eu in much more fundamental way than it is to wash ington many believe it is only matter of time before the uk joins the euro which would reduce the degree of uk exceptionalism within the eu in ddition commentators suggest that younger britons feel more european and future generations of british policymakers farther removed from world war ii and the cold wa r may not share the same conviction as previous generations about the im portance of the special relationship several analysts argue that the effect of the iraq war on the 2005 british election may also make future briti sh governments more hesitant about being as bold of us ally as blair was to the bush admin istration blairs successors may be more inclined to ensure that uk policies are in line with those of other major eu partners bbc correspondent john simpson commented that for the first time since 1941 it may longer be the automatic choice to stick close to washington none of mr blairs successors for the next halfcentury will entirely forget what happened to tony blair in the 2005 election when he chose to support an american president in preference to most of the rest of europe20 some suggest that the internal eu crisis over iraq also convinced blair of th need to forge more common eu foreign policy in part to help bolster the uk s clout in washington in march 2003 during blairs statement opening the debate on ir aq in the house of commons he asserted that europe with one voice should ve firmly committed itself to backing the united states in addressing the threat s posed by saddam hu ssein but demanded in return that the us should choose th path andrecognize the fundamental overriding importance of restarting the middle east peace process21 at minimum some experts suggest that us policymakers should not take future british support for us

united states in the future as the price for its support of us policies other ukwatchers maintain that the united states will retain an edge in the triangular usukeu rela tionship arguing that there is place in british politics for uk foreign policy that does not put st rong relations with the united states at its center given the uk publics euroskepticism and usuk cultural and historic ties many also point out that the uk s more liberal freestyle market economy is more in line with the us economic and social model than with the highly protectionist statist social systems that exist in much of continental europe furthermore they suggest that the balan ce of power within the eu has shifted in favor of the uk vision for the eu which is outwardlooking and atlanticist they assert that following eu enlargement france and germany are longer able to drive the eu forward alone this will make it easier for the uk to ensure that the eu evolves in usfriendly way minimize useu tensions and decrease

overdue they charge that traditionally liberal asylum and immigration laws in the uk as well as the countrys strong free speech and privacy pr otections have attr acted numerous radical muslim clerics claiming persecution at home as result some say the uk has become breeding ground for islamist terrori sts such as airplane shoe bomber richard reid and the 20th september 11 hijacker zacarias moussaoui both of whom were apparently indoc trinated at radical mosques in london until recently uk authorities have emphasized extended rveillance of extre mists as way to gather intelligence but some us officials have expressed frustration with what they view as dangerous delays in arresting terrorist suspects or instigators in the uk24 the uk has been trying to balance its counterterrorism policies against well established civil liberty protections and democratic ideals at times this has also created tensions with the united states for example british courts have rejected some us extradition requests for terrorist suspects on the grounds of insufficient or inadmissable evidence like its eu pa rtners london has also expressed serious concerns about some us practices in combating terrorism such as the terrorist detentions at guantÃ¡namo bay us rend ition policy and the cia program to detain and question terrorist suspects outside the united states british officials

reductions are being carried out in consultation with us military planners nevertheless some us critics question the british contention that security in southern iraq is impr oving and thus makes the

however some british defense official s and industry leaders complain that while the uk defense market is relatively open foreign access to the us defense marketplace remains restricted and heavily protected they point out that the us military uses very little equipment bought fro m or developed outsi of the united states and this largely accounts for the u suk defense trade imbalance many uk policymakers are also frustrated that us security restrictions hamper technology transfers which they say impedes uk efforts to costeffectively enhance british defense capabilities and improve interoperability with us forces some military analysts believe that us technologysharing restrictions may make the united states less attractive defense supplier or industrial partner for the uk in the longer term they note that the uk is already under some pressure from its eu partners to buy eur opean in order to help create european jobs to ensure european defense base strong enough to

of secti on 38j of the us arms export control act to make it easier for british companies to buy us defense items this has generally been referred to as seeking waiver from the us international traffic in arms regulations itar however london has been unable to overc ome congressional concerns especially in the house of representatives that uk export controls are not strong enough to ensure that us technologies sold to or sh ared with britain woul d not be reexported to third countries such as china although congress granted the uk preferred itar status in october 2004 intended to expedite the export licensing process for british defense firms some in the british defense industry maintain that the process remains too timeconsuming uk officials also bristle at the us refusal to grant full itar waiver given the uks role as key us ally in an effort to address longstanding british concerns about us technology sharing restrictions and export controls the united states and the uk signed new treaty on defense cooperation in june 2007 the treaty seeks to ease the exchange of defense goods services and informati on in part by ending the need for separate us export license for certain designated defense quipment purchased by the uk government and select british companies the treaty is reciprocal and is intended to cover defense quipment for which the us and uk governments are the endusers the treaty also calls for the creation of appr oved communities of companies and individuals in each country with security clearances to deal with technological transfers the new defense cooperation treaty must be approved by the uk parliament and the us senate analysts note that the treaty represents change in approach by the bush administrat ion and that the ad ministration has effectively abandoned its pursuit of an itar waiver for the uk u s supporters point out that the new treaty will also make the export of uk defense items such as roadside bomb detection equipment for us troops in iraq faster however some suggest that the treaty could still face hurdles in the senate and may not be ratif ied for some time42 economic relations the bilateral usuk trade and

in 2005 the uk held the yearlong rotating presidency of the g8 group of leading industrialized nations and made climate change one of its top priorities like its eu partners the blair government was dismayed with the bush administrations rejection of the kyoto protocol on climate change that set limits on heat trapping gas emissions in an attempt to reduce global warming the bush administration maintained that such mandatory caps would be too costly and that the kyoto protocol lacked suffi cient developing country par ticipation instead it has sought to promote research and technologi cal advances to incr ease energy efficiency and decrease emissions at the 2005 g8 summit uk officials claimed that they succeeded in narrowing the gap between the united states and europe on climate change they pointed out that washington agreed to language in the g8 communique acknowledging for the first time the role of human activity in global warming and the need for urgent action critics maintained that the final g8 statement on climate change was significantly weaker than earlier british versions which had called for ambitious gr eenhouse gas reductions and committed g8 countries to spend certain amount on new environment friendly projects some british critics also argued that th lack of more positive us response to blairs climate change proposals in 2005 further demonstrated that blairs close relationship with bush had yielded few be nefits others contend that blair has played crucial role in shaping the bush administrations evolving stance on climate change and point to the most recent g8 mmit in june 2007 as an example at the june 2007 g8 summit blairs last as uk leader the united states joined germany the current g8 pres idency country the uk nd other european states in agreeing to seriously consider halvin g emissions by 2050 moreover despite its previous reluctance the bush administration committed to working toward new climate change treaty within the framework by 2009 european critics claimed that the 2007 g8 agreement fell short of germanys goal of firm commitment to 50 cut in emissions by 2050 they also suggested that the administration could still try to circumvent the process noting president bushs announcement in may 2007 th at it would seek to forge separate agreement by the end of 2008 on reducti on strategy with the worlds top 15

northern irelands protestant majority 53 defines itself as british and largely s upports continued incorporation in the uk unionists the catholic minority 44 considers itself irish and many catholics desire united ireland nationalists for years the british and irish governments with us support sought to fac ilitate po litical settlement the resulting g ood friday agreement was reached in april 1998 it calls for devolved government the transfer of power from london to belfast and sets up government structures in northern ireland in which unionists and nati onalists share power it recognizes that change in northern irelands status as part of the united kingdom can only come about with the consent of th majority of its people despite much improved security situation in the years since full implementation of the good friday agreem ent has been difficult in october 2002 the devolved government wa s suspended for the fourth time amid breakdown of trust and confidence on both sides deco mmissioning disarmament especially by the irish republican army ira and poli ce reforms were two key sticking points as noted earlier blair was key driver of the 1998 good friday agreement which the bush administration and many mbers of congress continue to view as the best framework for lasting peace in rthern ireland over the years the bush administration and many mbers repeatedly sought to support the efforts of london and dublin to fully implement the agreement and to broker deal to reinstate northern irelands devolved government and powersharing institutions us and british officials frequently asserted that the ira and other paramilitaries must go out of business in order to m ove the peace process forward and that sinn fein the iras associated political party must join the policing board democratic oversight body at the same time us and british policymaker s pressed unionists to recognize sinn feins evolution and impor tant steps taken by the ira such as its july 2005 decision to end its armed struggle and dump its weapons efforts to fully implement the good friday agreement culminated on may 8 2007 when northern irelands devolved politi cal institutions were

kingdom on specific issues the socalled special re lationship offers the united states certain tangible benefits and often serves to buttress us in ternational policies uk support has been important to the global fight against terrorism us military action in afghanistan and the usled war to oust saddam hussein and efforts to stabilize and rebuild iraq uk military capabilities and resources have helped share the us combat and peacekeeping burden in these conflic ts as well as in the balkans britain has been consistent proponent of developing greater eu political and security role in way that complements nato and promot stronger eu as better and more effective partner for the united states the two allies also share mutually beneficial and increasingly interdepende nt economic relations hip and uk policies within the eu and with the united states have helped to maintain and promote more open and efficient world trading system whether the uk position within the u seu relationship and traditional uk foreign policy tendencies are changing are questions that have vexed policy analysts for many years but beyond the issue of whether changes are afoot lay perhaps two more profound questions does it really matter for the united states if the uk draws closer to europe in the longer term nd in light of the eus ongoing evolution how might uk either more inside or out side of the eu affect us interests part of the answer to these questions depends on whether the eu evolves into more tightly integrated body especially in the foreign policy and defense fields some us analysts say that if the eu becomes more coherent foreign policy actor this could make the uk less reliable ally for the united states if the uk increasingly turns toward its eu partners in formulating foreign policy decisions this could make it harder for washington to gain londons support for its initiatives in nato or the united nations the uk may also be more resistant to being the us water carrier in europe some fear that the uk may become less willing to deploy its military force in support of us objectiv or be tempted to support traditional french aspirations to develop the eu as rival to the united states others argue that more integrated cohesive eu in which the uk plays leading role could make the eu better partner for the united states in tackling global challenges conversely if core europe were to develop in which vanguard of eu member states drove furt her integration but which did not include economically liberal and proatlanticist br itain washington could lose one of its key advocates within the eu and useu nsions could increase many assess that further eu integration in the foreig n policy and defense fields however is impossible without continued british par ticipation given uk global interests andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33105crs29 military capabilities thus eu initiatives in these areas are unlikely to go forward in any significant way without british co mmitment and leadership while the former blair government was instrumental in eu efforts to develop common foreign policy and defense arm future more euroskeptic conservativeled government might seek to slow these eu projects others are skeptical about the eus ab ility to play bigger role on the world stage those of this view maintain that the eu is far from speaking with one voice on contentious foreign policy issues if the eu does not move toward further political integration and remains looser association of member states whose foreign policies continue to be determined primarily at the national level little may change in the current state of the usukeu relationship even if the uk moved closer to the eu by joining the euro this may be th most realistic scenario in light of the uks own ambivalence toward deeper eu political integration many experts contend that british government would ever relinquish uk sovereignty in the foreign policy or defense fields to the eu the future shape and identity of the eu however does not rest solely in british hands it will also depend upon the view s and ambitions of other eu members particularly france and germany and the political parties in power as noted earlier many point out that the new leaders of france and germany are viewed as more economicallyliberal reformminded and atlanticist than their predecessors consequently brown or future uk lead ers may find themselves sharing more common ground with their french and germ an counterparts thereby enabling the uk to promote its vision of politically strong economically vibrant eu working in partnership with the united states an eu shaped more fully to the uk liking and to that of the united states may ease useu tensions and the pressure on the uk to serve as bridge or peacemaker between the two however improved relations among london paris and berlin might also in the longer term lead the uk to turn more frequently to its other eu partne rs first rather than washington on foreign policy concerns as result washington might not hold quite the same influence over london as it has in the past at the same time regardless of whether the eu evolves into more coherent actor on the world stage or whether the uk draws closer to europe in the years ahead the usuk relationship will likely re main an important factor in the conduct of british foreign policy in general the special relationship helps to boost britains international standi ng and often gives the uk greater clout in the eu and other multilatera l organizations british officials will persist in efforts to shape decisionmaking in washington however the extent of us influence on british foreign policymaking in the future may depend in part on british perceptions of the value that washington places on the uk as an ally although british support for us policies should not be automatica lly assumed many uk policymakers and experts believe that it is not in british in terests to choose between the united states and europe and thus the uk will continue to try to avoid such choice for the foreseeable future
