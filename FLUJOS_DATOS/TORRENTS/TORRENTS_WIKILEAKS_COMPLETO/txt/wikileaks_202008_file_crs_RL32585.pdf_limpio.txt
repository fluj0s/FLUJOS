ammunition feeding devices lcafds expired on september 13 2004 in statute saws were defined in two ways first certain firearms were defi ned as saws by make and model second other firearms were defined as saws if they included specified features for example rifle was defined as saw if it was able to accept detachable magazine and included at least two of the following features 1 foldingtelescoping stock 2 protruding pistol grip 3 bay onet mount 4 muzzle flash suppressor or threaded barrel capable of accepting such vice or 5 grenade launcher there were similar definitions for pistols and shot guns bills were introduced to extend the ban s 2190 s 2498 make it permanent s 1034 or expand it to include other military style firearms hr 2038s 1431 key consideration for congress is wh ether violent gun cr imes particularly crimes involving multiple gunshot vic tims and gunshot wounds per victim were reduced by the ban proponents of the ban maintain that firear m trace data strongly suggest that the use of saws in crime had declined since the ban took effect opponents of the ban contend that firear m trace data are unreliable indicators of criminal gun use based on statements by federal agencies and leading researchers proponents also c ite data on law enforcement officers killed with firearms which suggest that saws and other similar firearms have been used to kill significant number of law enforcement officers opponent s of the ban note that it is not possible to determine precisely whether these fir earms were saws nor is it known to what extent these firearms contributed to the ability of the criminals to outgun the police proponents of the ban argue that assau lt weapons should be prohibited because they were designed for military purposes are firearms of choice for criminals and are not suitable for hunting competitive shootin g or selfdefense they assert that these weapons include all the military f eatures that increase capacity and ease of firing they underscore that the impet us for the ban was several mass murders committed with saws and that these firear ms are disproportionately given their small numbers used in crimes involving multiple shots fired multiple victims multiple gunshot wounds per victim and poli ce officers as victims they note that despite several lega l challenges the ban was upheld as constitutional by federal courts opponents of the ban argue that saws were not designed for or used by military forces and that large numbers of law abiding gun owners use saws for self defense marksmanship and hunting they contend that saws are functionally different from other semiautoma tic firearms in that they fire only one round per pull of the trigger and that the statutorily defined features of saw were largely cosmetic they also cite federal state and local data sources that suggest that saws have been used in small fraction of vi olent crimes before and after the ban they view the ban as part of progressive intrusion on the right of citizens to own firearms as noted above the ban expi red on september 13 2004 this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32585contents introduction 1

of the sawlcafd ban has been and will likely remain controversial bills were introduced that would have extended the ban s 2190 s 2498 made it permanent s 10 34 or expanded it to include other military style firearms hr 2038s 1431 on march 2 2004 the senate passed an amendment to s 1805 that would have extended the ban for 10 years but the bill was not passed key consideration for congress is wh ether violent gun cr imes particularly crimes involving multiple gunshot victims and gunshot wounds per victim were reduced by the ban as in 1994 an underlying question for congress is whether

remained legally transferrable under applicable federal and state laws3 data on saws and lcafds notwithstanding statutory definitions there remains lack of definitive data on saws for example the precise number of saws in civilian circulation is unknown as is the number of saws used in crime nonetheless there are three sources of limited data on saws and their possible use by criminals those sources include 1 atf firearm trace data 2 crime gun recoveries in cer tain cities and 3 data on law enforcement officers killed feloniously in the line of duty atf firearm trace data there are limite d data about saws from firearm traces conducted by the atf but the proper use and interpretation of the related data remain matter of debate4 today as before the 1994 sawlcafd ban there are significant questions about the consistent and unbiased collection of atf firearm trace data consequently at national level firearm trace data may not be representative of the types of firearms recovered by police and hence may not be representative of guns used in crime some researchers however find firearm trace data to be useful measurement of crime gun trends particularly when such data are limited to localities in which the issue of consistent and unbiased data collection have been at least partially addressed through comprehe nsive crime gun tracing5 other researchers have long stressed that firearm trace data are not representative samples of crime guns6 neither the federal bureau of investigation fbi the principal federal agency charged with the collection of nationa l

there were indications that any effects that the ban might have had on re ducing firearmsrelated violent crime might have been offset by an increase in us of firearms equipped with lcafds as with firearm trace data however th ere are significant limitations regarding firearm recovery data for these cities first while all of these cities made efforts to include all firearm recoveries associated with murders or other serious crimes in their databases relatively small percentage of crime guns were recovered by law enforcement second firear m recoveries may be affect ed by local and regional enforcement strategies that result in significant variation in recoveries from one locality to another third these cities provided the studys researchers with convenience samples fourth the citie s were not selected randomly these limitations precluded the studys researchers from testing for statistical significance between the saws other semiautomatic fi rearms equipped with lcafds and all

definition of an assault weapon that is accepta ble to all parties has proved difficult while some would fine an assault weapon to include any militarystyle firearm others maintain that all semiaut

categorize certain types of firearms acco rding to traditional notions as to what constitutes machine pistol carbine battle rifl or an assault weapon16 as result some still debate the co rrect use of the term assault weapon17 military assault rifles according to many firearms experts assault rifles were developed during world war ii to provide lighter infantry weapon that could fire more rounds more rapidly and more easily18 in other words the design of these firearms included features that allowed for increased capacity and rate of fire less weight and less recoil to increase capacity of fire detachable selffeeding magazines introduced in the late 1880s were incorporated into th rifles to increas the rate of fire assault rifles were designed to be fired in fully automatic mode firing repeatedly or with select fire feature that allowed them to be fired in fully automatic mode in short bursts such as three rounds per pull of the trigger or in semiautomatic mode one round per pull of the trigger midsize rounds were developed so infantrymen could carry more ammunition and their rifles would be lighter when fully loaded also midsize rounds reduced the recoil or kick making the rifles easier to handle and keep on target the prototype assault rifle was devel oped by the germans during world war ii based on swiss design this rifle the maschinerkarabiner 42 mkb 42 was chambered to fire the 792x33 millimete r mm cartridge midsize rifle cartridge the germans improved upon the mkb 42s design and produced the first assault rifle literally dubbing it the sturmgewehr stg 43 towards the end of the war after the war the stg 43 was the m odel for later generati ons of assault rifle designs including the spanish cetme belgique fnfal and west german g3 the soviet union meanwhile develope d the avtomat kalashnikov of 1947 ak 47 which was chambered to fire 762x39 mm cartridges the united states was relatively late in developing similar assault rifle between 1956 and

to be fully automatic meaning they fire and reload continuously with single pull of the trigger until all the rounds in the magazine are expended or the trigger is re leased later generations of these weapons were outfitted with select fi re features that allow them to be fired in multiround bursts or in semiautom atic mode in addition to fully automatic mode many assault rifle designs included features that were previously incorporated into submachine gun designs and handguns such as pistol grip s and barrel shrouds some ban supporters maintain that these features allow shooters to more easily stabilize and effectively fire these rifles in low slung position in cl ose quarters combat ban opponents maintain that the grips are shaped to conform with the relative position of the rifles barrel and stock these rifles also include detachable magazines with greater capacity than used in early generations of world war ii battle rifles like the american m1 garand or the german model 98 mauser civilian semiautomatic assault weapons semiautomatic firearms are self or reloading meaning that when one round is fired the firearm automatically ejects the old cartridge casing and loads fresh cartridge by partially utilizing the energy expended by the fired cartridge semiautomatic firearms incl uding saws fire one round per pull of the trigger like all other firearms other than fully automatics the rate of fire of semiautomatics is equivalent to that of revolvers in that both depend on how quickly person can pull the trigger other comm onplace firearms such as boltaction leveraction and pumpaction firearms require manual operation of the firearms bolt to reload between shots many models of firearms that were originally designed for military purposes most of which were originally designed to be fired in fully automatic mode or select fire were later produced for civilian markets by modifying their design so that they could only be fired in semiaut omatic mode to convert one of these firearms to fully automatic is illegal19 these weapons are also capable of accepting magazines of greater capacity than ten rounds promptin g some to argue that the largecapacity magazine or lcafd is perhaps the most functionally important distinguishing feature of assault weapons20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32585crs7 21 the public safety and recreational firearms use protection

bush had halted the importation of some semiautomatic firearms that could be considered assault weapons under existing legal aut hority provided by the 1968 gun control act under the determination that they were not particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes34 in 1998 the clinton administration halted the importation of firearms modified to comply with the 1989 importation ban35 while in part the clinton importation ban was pr ompted by trade dispute with china others have noted that comp anies closely tied with the chinese army were providing large numbers of surplus military firearms to us importers at very low costs36 domestic firearm manufacturers continued to produce firearms at times with mostly imported parts which ban supporters argued were ither in violation of the ban since they were copies or duplicates of banned firear ms or firearms that should have been banned under an expanded saw definition in addition to some observers the importation ban on these firearms but similar ban on their domestic manufacture appeared to be an incongruity in the law 1997 saw ban impact study the 1994 act also required the attorney general to study and measure if possible the impact of the saw ban with focus on drug trafficking and violent crime37 it stipulated that the study woul d be conducted for 18 months beginning 12 months after the date of

leading to reduction in sawrelated crime the researchers noted that the statutory schedule for the study constrained their findings to the shortterm effects of the saw ban they concluded that because the banned weapons and magazines were never used in more than modest fraction of all gun murders that the maximum theoretically achievable preventive effect of the ban on gun murders is almost certainly too small to detect statistically with only one year of postban crime data40 the researchers found that the price of saws nearly doubled in the year preceding the ban but then dropped to n early the 1992 prices immediately following the ban nevertheless researchers estimated that the ban possibly contributed to 67 decrease in total gun murders or 27 decrease in assault weaponlarge capacity feeding devicerela ted crime between 1994 and 199541 in addition while they detected decrease in multiple victimmultiple gunshot wo und crimes they did see slight reduction in killings of police officers with saws in addition the researchers analyzed fi rearm trace data collected by the atf they found that atf firearms trace data we re an imperfect m easure because they reflect only small percentage of guns used in crimes while imperfect the urban institute researchers noted that the trace da ta reflected similar tr ends in data on all guns recovered in two cities42 they noted that decr ease in saw traces in 1995 as compared to 1994 warranted further study the urban institute researchers included several recommendations in their study they included the need to develop new

there is general lack of definitive data on assault wea pons and the wider population of firearms that constitute the civ ilian gun stock43 consequently the number of saws available to civilians for possession or transfer is only estimated as is the frequency with which saws are used in crimes44 it is generally accepted however that the population of assault wea pons particularly those subject to the 1994 ban increased significantly during the 1980s and early 1990s45 the intent of the ban was to gradually reduce th number of legally available saws at the time of the ban it was estimated that there were upwards of 15 million privately owned assault wea pons in the united states46 according to crs extrapolations 231 million firearms ma up the civilian gun stock in 1994 including 81 million handguns 82 million rifles and 68 million shotguns consequently saws constituted less than 1 of the civilian gun stock at the same time according to one recent study there were 25 million firearms capable of accepting large capacity ammunition feeders or roughly 11 of the civilian gun stock47 opponents of the ban argue that saws ar rarely used in crime more than 248 compared to the relatively small saw percentage of the total gun stock however proponents of the ban have count ered that saws are disproportionatelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32585crs13 49 on its website the brady campaign to

early tripled from cys 19952002 questions remain about the consistent and unbiased collection of more recent firearm trace data despite atf efforts to promote comprehensive crime gun tracing in several localities consequently firearm trace data in the ggregate may still not be representative of the types of firearms nationally rec overed by police and hence may not be representative of guns

press release nov 5 2003 available at httpfeinsteinsenategov03releasesr assaultwepsrate1htm1992 however most firearms that are traced have not been used to commit violent crimes and most firearms used to commit violent crimes are not traced53 due to several factors moreover including policy changes at the state and local level there may be significant variation over time and from jurisdictionto jurisdiction as to the when why and how firearm is recovered and selected to be traced54 in addition law enforcement officers may be reluctant to request traces for firearms that would be difficult to trace because of missing identifying information such as the firearms manufacturer and serial number55 therefore newer guns for which such information may be more readily available are more likely to be traced than older guns in addition law enforcem ent agencies often conduct studies focused on specific categories of offenders andor types of firearms in certain geographical areas consequently the data may be bi ased as 1 older firearms may be under represented in the trace data because of missing information and 2 firearms of special interest to law enfo rcement may be overrepresented56 for these reasons it is not possible to test for statistical significance of possible relationships between firearm traces in general and saw traces in particular and the wider population of firearms available to civilians as result firearm trace data do not provide grounds for clear statisti cal conclusion about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the sa w ban and making inferen ces about

and saw traces the data first published by the brady center are presented in table 2 which shows that for fy19901994 assault weapons made up 488 of total traced fir earms while the brady center reported this percentage to be 482 this diffe rence may be the result of rounding table 2 also shows that for fy19952001 banned assault weapons comprised 161 of traced firearms the brady center calculated the percent change in the saw firearm trace share by subtracting 161 from 482 and dividing by 482 which yields 667 or twothirds decrease in the saw share of the total traced firearms for fy19901994 as compared to fy1995200165 depending upon how the data are presen ted different inte rpretations may be made as to the extent to which the number of saw traces is decreasing for example based on the firearm trace data presented in table 2 above the brady center concluded that the sa w ban has contributed to substantial reduction in the use of assault weapons in crime66 for fy19901994 the annual average number of saw traces was 2842 or 142095 and for fy19952001 the annual average was 2811 or 196797 only 31 fewer traces on average annually for the five years before the ban compared to the seven years after the ban while saw traces as share of total firearms decreased fro m fy1995 through fy2001 the annual average number of saw traces declined by less than 10 after the ban this may indicate that the decline in the saw share of total traces is due to significant increase in total traces rather than decrease in saw traceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32585crs17 67 as part of the

the study attributed the relative rarity of saw use in crime to several factors 1 many saws are rifles and ri fles are used less often than handguns in crime 2 saws whether handguns or l ong guns tend to be more difficult to conceal than other firearms 3 foreign saws were banned from importation in 1989 and 4 saws are more expensive than other firearms75 firearm trace data the studys researchers found that due to instrumentation problems inherent in traci ng data statistical tests are were not presented76 in other words data limitations precluded testing for statistical significance of possible relationships between firearm traces in general and saw traces in particular and the wider population of firearms that are available to civilians see table 5 for atf firearm trace data presented in the study nevertheless the study found that the fi rearm trace data suggested that the use of saws in crime had declined since the bans enactment the study found that saws accounted for 54 of atf firear m traces in 19921993 as compared to 16 in 20012002 decline of 70 if the brad centers methodology is adopted and the percent change in the saw share of total firearm traces for 19911994 495 and 19952002 198 is calculated the result is 60 decrease in the saw share of total firearms traced which is close to the brady centers finding of 66 firearm recovery data the studys researchers examined several databases of guns recovered by police in six localities77 the studys researchers found that such firearm recoveries desp ite limitations that also precluded testing for statistical significance provided the best availabl indicator of changes over time in the types and especially the specific makes and models of guns used in violent crime and possessed and or carried by criminal and otherwise deviant or high risk persons78 they found reductions in tw cities of 17 to 72 in saw recoveries as percentage of total firearm recoveries but other reductions ranged more generally in the other four cities between 32 and 4079 based on these findings the study concluded that atf firearms trace data and local databases on guns recovered by police showed that in various places and time s from the late 1990s through 2002 saws typically fell by onethird or more as share of firearms used in crime80 such conclusions however were drawn without the use of statistical tests

limitations inherent in firearm trace and recovery da ta the updated impact study also found that in several locations lcafds were used in between 14 and 26 of crimes and there were indications that any effects that the 1994 ba n might have had on reducing firearmsrelated violent crime were partially offset by an increase in criminal use of semiautomatic firearms equipped with lcafds82 the study noted that while the acts lcafd provisions limited the number of these devices that were legally available there were 25 million of these devices within the united states before th 1994 act and between 1994 and 2000 another 48 million lcafds were imported for commerc ial sale and permits were issued to import an additional 472 million83 it was also noted that while semiautomatic firearms equipped with lcafds accounted for about quarter of gun crimes based on crime gun recoveries it was not clear how frequently shootings that resulted in death or injury were consequence of th shooters ability to fire more than ten rounds without reloading84 conclusions the study concluded that it would be premature to make definitive assessments of the bans impact on gun crime as any effect was likely to be small at best perhaps too small for reliable measurement85 moreover any reduction in crime was likely offset by an increase in the use of nonbanned semiautomatic firearms quipped with lcafds as consequence the studys researchers could not clearly credit the ban with any of the nations recent drop in gun violence86 the studys researchers recommended additional studies to develop better data on saws and lcafds using vari ety of research methods that would include among other things more in cidentbased studies that contrast the dynamics and outcomes of ttacks with different type s of guns and magazines87httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32585crs24 88 violent crime includes murder and nonnegligent homicide kidnaping rape robbery and aggravated assault050000100000150000200000250000

general see figure 2 below saw violent crime traces as presented in table 5 had an annual average number for the preban period of 413 the same as fo r the postban period if total firearm traces were good indicator of violent crime trends it could be expected that both would rise or fall at similar rates source crs presentation of data taken from the july 2002 updated assessment of the federal

cator of firearmsrelated violent crime trends because the slightly increasing rate of violent crime traces does not correspond to the decreases in violent crime that have occurred in the past decade

officer killings were saws of the 591 firear mrelated killings 65 11 involved rifles chambered to use one of the two most common sa w rifle calibers of ammunition 762x39 mm and 223 remington89 though it should be noted that both calibers are used in rifles that are not semiautomatic as well as in saws and ot her semiautomatics the vpc has reviewed unpublished fbi da ta and conducted dditional

grip nor is it routinely outfitted with either flash suppressor barrel shroud or bayonet lug 92 the mini14 series of rifles are ch ambered to accept 223 remington and 762x39mm cartridges while it accepts detachable magazine its configuration does not include protruding pistol gri p nor is it routinely outfitted with either flash suppressor barrel shroud or bayonet lug 93 the samozaryadnyi karabin simonova sks semiautomatic rifle was produced by the soviet union in 1945 since then they have been produced in large numbers by eastern bloc countries and china it was not originally designed to accept detachable magazine but there are after market parts on the civilian market that can be easily acquired to allow these firearms to accept detachable magazine the sks is chambered for 763x39 mm cartridges they are generally quite inexpens ive as compared with semiautomatic assault weapon variants of the ak47 m16 g3 or fnfal 94 the mak90 is semiautomatic version of the chinese made ak47

20 2004 p 5that at least 41 of the 211 law enforcement officers slain in the line of duty between january 1 1998 and december 31 2001 were killed with assault weapons using these figures one in fi ve law enforcement officers slain in the line of duty was killed with an assault weapon90 there are two things about the vpcs inte rpretation of these data that should be noted first excluding the 72 officers killed in the 911 terrorist attacks there were 224 officers feloniously killed in the 19982001 period of which 211 officers were killed with firearms second 20 of the 41 fi rearms that the vpc counted as assault weapons may not meet the statutory saw definition for example the vpc counted the m1 carbine91 the mini1492 the sks93 and the mak9094 as assault weapons but none of these rifles was ba nned by the 1994 act when such weapons are discounted it lowers the number to 20 out of 211 or 224 officers killed with weapons that may be saws or one in 11 in addition fbi incident summaries on the officer killings suggest that only in handful of the killings did the criminals fire more than 10 rounds of ammunition the number of rounds to which the ban limits magazines made since the ban took effect furthermore several othe r firearms the vpc counted as saws may or may not have been saws as it is unclear whet her these weapons were actually preban saws or versions of these weapons that were manufactured nd transferred legally after the ban copycatslegal substitutes nevertheless some would likely argue that even if these firearms were not strictly saws by definition they ought to be banned opponents of the ban ve questioned the relia bility of such data95 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32585crs28 legislation in the 108th congress bills have been introduced in the 108th congress to extend or make permanent the ban on saws and large capacity ammunition feeders other bills would modify the definition of semiaut omatic assault w eapon to cover greater number of firearms by reducing the number of features that would constitute such firearms and expand the list of certain makes and models of firearms that are statutorily enumerated as banned s 1034 as introduced by senator dia nne feinstein would make the ban permanent as would hr 2038 and s 1431 as introduced by representative carolyn mccarthy and senator frank lautenberg respectively the latter two bills would modify the definition and ex pand the list of banned weapons senator feinstein has also introduced s 2190 and s 2498 that would extend the ban for 10 years on march 2 2004 the nate passed an amendment to s 1805 the gun industry liability bill that would have extended the ban for 10 years but did not pass the bill conclusion the expiration of the sawlcafd ban has been and is likely to remain controversial key cons ideration for congress is whether violent gun crimes particularly crimes involvi ng multiple gunshot victims and gunshot wounds per victim were reduced by the ban as in 1994 an underlying question for congress is whether saws are more dangerous than other semiautomatic fi rearms and if so should the ban be extended or made permanent and possibly expanded to include other military style firearms as noted in the report however there is lack of definitive data on saws and lcafds there are steps that could be taken to improve such data for example report forms issued to state and local law enforcement by the fbi for purposes of compiling the annual report on law enforcement officers killed and assaulted could be modified to capture add itional information about incidents in which firearms are used in addition as part of the national incident based reporting system nibrs which is the basis for uniform national crime reporting the fbi could modify its data collecti on and submission requirements for firearm related homicides pa rticularly in regard to those incidents that involve multiple shots multiple victims and multip gunshot wounds per victim in regard to firearm traces it may be possible to revamp the atfs firearm tracing system to improve the quality of data for example besides modifying data submission procedures controlled fir earm trace surveys could be conducted in certain geographic areas to determine whether saws or other firearms are the guns ofchoice for youth gangs and drug traffick ers similar surveys are already underway as part of the youth crime gun interdiction initiative and have yielded useful data on crime guns to assist local law enforcement agencies in formulating citywide or regional firearmsrelated vi olence reduction strategieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32585crs29 in conclusion improved incidentbased reporting and firearm trace data could provide useful insights into the lethality and criminal use of saws and other militarystyle firearms as well as other crime guns in the interim until more definitive data are available congress faces exercise of its collective value judgement on the lethality and relative dangers posed to society by these firearms versus the diminution of the freedom to bear arms as set out in the constitution
