the united nations system staff college unssc the united nations interregional crime and justice research institute unicri and the united nations research institute for socia l development unrisd as external benchmarks iv audit findings and recommendations governance issues unidir statute 9 the general assembly at its first special sessi on devoted to disarmament in 1978 proposed to create institute for sustained fo rwardlooking research and study activity in the field of disarmament and to promote informed p articipation by all states in arms control and reduction in october 1980 unidir commenced it s operations as an intergovernmental organization within the unidirs statute came i nto effect on 1 january 1985 10 according to article iii of the statute boar d of trustees governs unidir and also serves as the secretarygenerals advisory board on disarmament matters the board members knowledgeable in the field of security ar ms control and disarmament were selected by the secretarygeneral for an initial 2 year term the role and the responsibilities of the board are clearly stipulated in the statute there are currently 23 members on the board who meet twice year in new york usually j anuary and in geneva usually july 11 until 2003 the board discussed unidir activiti only as part of its considerations during global issues on disarmament thus the boar d only devoted limited time to unidir issues and could not adequately discuss unidir issu to enhance the effectiveness of its responsibilities the board at unidirs initiative established subcommittee to examine more closely issues related to unidirs work progra mme the subcommittee consisting of eight members held its first meeting in july 2003 the subcommittee which reports to the board meets before the annual board meeting that i s held in geneva to discuss unidirs work programme and other activities in oios opini on the existing governance structure and arrangements in comparison with the other autonomo us institutes is adequate and effective 3 linkages with and other agencies 12 unidir conducts research on disarmament and sec urity to assist the international community in their disarmament way of thinking the ir associated decisions and efforts in order to make its research activities relevant to t he international community unidir had to establish linkages with the secretariat and othe r specialized agencies other organizations programmes and institutions of the system as wel l as with other organizations and institutes active in the field of disarmament resea rch article vi of the statute emphasizes the need for unidir to develop arrangements for active cooperation with these specific organizations and institutes 13 oios review of the minutes of the board meetin gs the directors reports and other project documents indicated that unidir had establi shed an effective linkage with the department of disarmament affairs there was cooper ation in joint research projects publications expert meetings and conferences and ther disarmament related activities unidir had also established linkages with the unite d nations development program undp and regional centers for peace and disarm ament despite this unidirs linkages with agencies eg iaea ctbto opcw an d research institutions within the system remained ad hoc similarly unidir was yet t establish an effective cooperation with other organizations and institutes active in the fi eld of disarmament research oios noted that lack of funding was one factor limiting active coop eration 14 oios recommended that unidir should formulate strategy to establish clear and welldefined linkages with other agencies and re search institutions unidir should also strengthen its cooperation with nonun organization s and institutes active in the field of disarmament research unidir responded that it had strategy for linki ng with and research organizations currently unidir have for example research contracts with over 50 research institutes unidir had carried out nu mber of research projects and have two mous with undp as well as longstanding collaborati on with dda recently unidir had executed cooperative project with unhcr unidir f urther clarified that their strategy is based on their research interests and others inter ests disarmament is constantly changing field knowledge evolves rapidly and specialists c an emerge or become outdated quickly relative to other fields in order to provide the m ost relevant and ahead of the curve research to member states unidir needs to retain f lexibility and not be tied into collaboration with one institute b funding arrangements funding needs to be secured 15 according to article vii of the statute volunt ary contributions from member states and public and private organisations should form th principal source of the financing for unidir the article also provides for subvention from the regular budget of the towards meeting the cost of the director and staff of the institute the article further states that in given year the subvention should not exc eed an amount equivalent to one half of the assured income of the institute coming from volunta ry sources the table below indicates the total amount received as voluntary contributions an d the subvention provided by the regular budget 4 year total income 000 rb subvention 000 percentage 2002 1704 219 13 2003 1040 228 22 2004 2080 275 13 total 4824 722 15 it was evident that unidir received modest subven tion of 15 per cent of its total income from the regular budget this modest subvention cou ld only meet the cost of employing the director and part of the salary of one support staf f 16 unidir has relied mainly on voluntary donations from governments and private donors unidir receives two types of funding earma rked for specific projects undertaken by unidir and nonearmarked funds for other activities including administrative expenditures throughout the review period about 52 per cent of the contributions is earmarked for unidir specific projects or activities therefore unidir has very little flexibility in terms of nonearmarked funding and has to rely on ad hoc arrangements for hiring staff and undertaking other activities during the 20022003 biennium voluntary contributions totaled 22 million the contributions from few member sta tes represented 84 per cent of total voluntary contributions with france and japan maki ng the most significant contribution of 600000 each the french contribution is used to fund the post of the deputy director and the japanese contribution is used mainly to fund 24month project from 20022004 the estimated voluntary contributions for the 20042005 biennium amounted to 31 million including 18 million contribution from the euro pean commission for 20month project 17 in oios opinion unidir needs to expand and st abilize its funding sources to ensure its effective functioning unidir with the support of the board should seek enhanced support from the regular budget to meet the costs of employ ing staff members holding core functions within the institute also unidir with the involve ment of the board needs to formulate funding strategy to increase the level of funding f rom member states and private donors there was an earlier plan to organize donor meeti ng however this was not pursued in oios opinion periodic donor meetings to present r esearch activities and publications would increase awareness of the work of the institute and could help to attract more funds recommendation head2right the director of unidir with the support of the boar d should formulate and implement strategy for enhanced fund raising including organising donor meetings unidir also should seek adequate funding from the regular budget to better meet the costs of its core staff rec 01 18 unidir agreed and had begun to implement the recomm endation two donor meetings were held in april with selected states as part of larger fundraising strategy and 5 so far sweden new zealand austria and turkey have responded by donating funds unidir would look to find ways to seek adequate funding fr om the regular budget to meet the cost of its core staff better oios will consider this recommendation implemente d when it receives copy of the fund raising strategy and information n its effort to seek adequate funding for its core

undertaken any comprehensive indepth evaluation of its overall achievements in response to unidirs request oios as part of the audit under took an impact assessment of unidirs work 20 oios assessment was intended to make an indepe ndent and objective evaluation of the impact of unidirs research work and its public ations and other activities unidir has been sending its research papers and publications t various interest groups throughout the world oios developed questionnaire which was ad dressed to the recipients of unidirs publications the questions varied and focused esse ntially on the following aspects quality and relevance of research publications usefulness of work publications research activities meetings and expert networks to the activities of the addressees impact of

create m ore awareness oios noted from the responses that unidirs printed publications and it s web page were efficient in creating the awareness however it was noted that the media cov erage of unidir activities was not adequate unidir needs to formulate an outreach st rategy to create more awareness including media coverage vii oios found perceptible gap in terms of the geographical area where unidirs impact was noticed while the majority of the respo ndents were from europe north america and australia only minimal number of responses c ame from asia south america and africa unidir needs to increase its impact and cr eate more awareness by covering wider geographical area unidir pointed out that there are fewer individuals and research institutes located in developing countries than in developed countries unidir sends all its publications to about 300 researchers and institute s based in african countries 360 in asiapacific and 300 in latin americacaribbean in percentage terms of total mailing this amounts to 115 for africa 16 for asiapacific and 13 for latin americacaribbean unidir always attempts to increase the numbers of p artners and recipients in those regions viii most of the respondents have been regularly receiving unidirs publications majority of them between 3 to 5 times in year nd in certain cases more than five times unidir has been regularly and consistently sending its publications and other information as significant percentage stated that they had been receiving them for more than year oios noted that good percentage of respondents have be receiving them for more than ten years ix unidirs mailing list needs to be reviewed and updated number of emails were not functional anymore out of the 700 messages sen t 130 19 per cent were sent back to oios as undelivered mail return to sender as thei r email address was invalid unidir explained that it mainly used postal addresses for disseminating its publications and that it constantly updates its mailing list by responding t returned postal mailings and written notification to ensure email addresses are updated and operational unidir plans to send regularly test email to all entries on the list from which undelivered returns will be deleted and to send onepage form to all recipients of idir publications for their updating of postal and email addresses as required based on the survey results oios makes the followi ng recommendation to increase the impact of unidirs research publications and outrea ch activities 7 recommendations head2right unidir should develop and implement an effective utreach strategy with more focussed emphasis on media co verage of its activities and publications rec 02 22 unidir agreed and stated that the forthcoming annu strategy meeting would in fact focus on unidirs outreach with specific reference to media coverage of its activities and publications with view to enhancing the institut profile in the relevant media and interested general public improved exposure will b sought to foster broader awareness in international public opinion of unidirs work in pu rsuit of disarmament as well as to assist in eliciting the interest of potential funders oios will consider this recommendation implemented upon receipt of the report of unidirs annual strategy meeting 23 oios also suggested that unidir consider widening t he geographical coverage of its activities in order to achieve global impact unidir will continue to seek to broaden and enhance the geographical scope of its activities t his will remain matter of particular priority in the developing world where there exist far fewer research institutes or academic departments active in unidirs field than in other regions beyond seeking out existing partners and interlocutors in the developing world unidir will continue to do its best to contribute to actual capacity building in areas whe re disarmament research is least developed d administrative issues personnel management 24 according to article iv of the statute the st aff of the institute shall be appointed by the director under letters of appointment limite d to service with the institute the personnel management is governed by the staff regul ations and rules of the subject to such arrangements for special rules or terms of app ointment as may be proposed by the director and approved by the sg however such special rules have been so far approved unidir stated that the limitation of service to uni dir limited career development unidir would like to see this changed for general service staff oios concurs that it would be preferable to engage general service staff through the unog staff selection system 25 currently unidir has four staff members appoin ted under the 100 series fixedterm contracts for varying periods the director is appo inted for two years while the deputy director and the specialized secretary are appointe d for one year the administrative assistant currently holds permanent contract in addition undir has been regularly employing six staff members for core functions c omputer systems manager research programme managerconference organizer an editor i n chief an editor an assistant editor and fellowship and internship coordinator in additio n unidir recruits number of project managers and researchers depending on the projects implemented at the time these staff members were issued letters of appointment loa by the director and administered solely by unidir not by unog hrms 26 oios has concerns on the manner in which unidir manages its staff members i the terms and conditions of their contracts do not fall under any of the three series of the staff rules ii although they are considered as s taff members they do not fully enjoy the status as staff members iii these staff members are under separate remuneration modality 8 oriented to some extent to the 200 series salary sc ale offering month net salary which does not fully correspond to the salary scales or specia l rates published by the iv they are excluded from participation from the joint staff pension fund and are unable to participate in the medical insurance scheme ove rall they are neither governed by staff rules or by any approved special rules oios noted that these inconsistencies were time and again reviewed by unidir unog liaison legal of ficer and hrms and with ohrm however their status and compliance to the staf f rules remain to be resolved unidir explained that given its already difficult funding situation the application of full entitlements would exceed its financial capabilities 27 in oios opinion unidir in consultation with its board and cooperation with unog hrms and ohrm should ensure that the staff regulations and rules are systematically applied to all unidir staff members unidir should establish and classify posts unidir should also ensure that the condition s of service in the loas should correspond to the provisions of the staff regulatio ns and rules since the letters of appointment shall be signed by the director of unid ir in the name of the secretary general the appointments should be governed by one of the set of rules admissible for employment in the while oios appreciates unidir s difficult financial situation and the additional costs resulting from full applicatio n of the staff rules it is difficult to accept that staff members entitlements and remuneration re driven by the financial situation of an entity this would undermine the common system 28 furthermore the staff selection and contract xtension procedures for these staff members and other consultants were not clear in the personnel files unidir clarified that its staff members were competitively selected and that there had been some occasions for short term and urgent projects when unidir had just appo inted qualified personnel as was normal practice in the recommendations head2right unidir in consultation with its board and with g hrms and ohrm should explore options to gradually apply the st aff regulations and rules to its staff members rec 03 head2right unidir in consultation with its board should estab lish specific posts for the core functions and project posts classify them and ensu re that competitive selection is made for these posts rec 04 29 unidir confirmed that they would explore all possib options with the board and hrms and ohrm to see how unidir could apply the staff regulations and rules to all staff members in that direction unidir intends to establish specific posts for the core functions and project posts and classify them and g through competitive selection procedures oios retains the recommendations for follow up n the progress made after year need to formalize the support with unog 30 according to the statute article ix the sg s hould provide unidir with the appropriate administrative and other support and idir should reimburse the costs for such support unog has been providing support to unidir based on memorandum dated 5 9 march 1984 decided to reduce the rate of reimbu rsement of programme support costs from 13 to 5 per cent and to absorb under the regul ar budget the cost of miscellaneous services unidir had paid 107200 for the 200220 03 biennium and estimated 182000 of programme support costs for the biennium 20042005 however unidir had not established any formal memorandum of understanding mou with u nog listing the services and support to be provided in addition to the reimbur sement to unog unidir has been incurring expenditures on administrative requiremen ts ie publishing it support etc which in oios view could be better serviced by unog unidi r needs to clearly establish the services and support provided by unog 31 oios recommended that unidir should enter into formal agreement with unog listing the services and the support to be provided unidir will explore the possibilities with unog of making the existing agreement formal followup of the boa recommendation 32 oios followed up on the implementation of recom mendations contained in the management letter issued by the board of auditors n 12 february 2004 under recommendation 7 the boa recommended that unidir stablish formal roster of candidates to provide complete and uptodate infor mation as envisaged in stai19997 oios noticed that unidir only maintained list of candidates in database along with the mailing list of the recipients of its publications unidir should establish roster containing the list of all the potential candidates with their respective qualification and experience verified and the potential areas of expertise where they can be utilized unidir is upgrading the database so as to take account of the credentia ls qualifications and experience of the experts however unidir stressed the importance of retaining flexibility when it comes to appointing expert consultants and unidir did not wi sh to be tied to fixed roster v further actions required on recommendations 33 oios monitors the implementation of its audit r ecommendations for reporting to the secretarygeneral and to the general assembly the responses received on the audit recommendations contained in the draft report have been recorded in our recommendations database in order to record full implementation the actions described in the following table are required 2 copy of unidirs
