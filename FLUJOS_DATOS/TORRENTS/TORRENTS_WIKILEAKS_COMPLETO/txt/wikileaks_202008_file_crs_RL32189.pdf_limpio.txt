assessments and develop site security plans s 2781 similar legislation was introduced in the 110th congress s 1968 but there was further action on this legislation also in the 110th congress bills to extend dhss chemical facilities antiterrorism standards were considered but not enacted one bill hr 5533 would preserve an existing exemption for water utilities from chemical facility standards while another hr 5577 would include them in the scope of dhs security rules continuing attention to these issues is possible along with interest in how the federal government coordinates its own activities

acks in the united states across the country water infrastructur systems extend over vast areas and ownership and operation responsibility ar both public and private but are overwhelmingly nonfederal since the ttacks federal dam operators and local water and wastewater utilities have been under height ened security conditions and are evaluating security plans and measures there are federal standards or agreed upon industry practices within the water infra structure sector to govern readiness response to security incidents and recovery efforts to develop protocols and tools are ongoing

journal of the american water works association vol 33 11 1941 1861terrorism and security issues facing the water infrastructure sector introduction the september 11 2001 attacks on the wo rld trade center and the pentagon have drawn attention to the security of many institutions facilities and systems in the united states including the na tions water supply and water quality infrastructure these systems have long been recognized as being potentially vulnerable to terrorist attacks of vari ous types including physical disruption bioterrorismchemical conta mination and cyber attack damage or destruction by terrorist attack could disrupt the delivery of vital human services in this country threatening public health and the envir onment or possibly causing loss of life further since most water infrastructur is governmentowned it may serve as symbolic and political target for some this report presents an overview of this large and diverse sector describes securityrelated actions by the government and private sector since september 11 and discusses additional po licy issues and responses including congressional interest the potential for terrorism is not new in 1941 federal bureau of investigation director j edgar hoover wrote it has long been recognized that among public utilities water supply f acilities offer particul arly vulnerable point of attack to the foreign agent due to the strategic position they occupy in keeping the wheels of industry turning and in preserving the h ealth and morale of the american populace1 water infrastructure systems also are highly linked with other infrastructure systems especially electric power and transportati on as well as the chemical industry which supplies treatment chemicals making security of all of them an issue of concern these types of vulnerable in terconnections were evident for example during the august 2003 electricity blackout in th northeast united states wastewater treatment plants in clevel and detroit new york and other locations that lacked backup generation systems lost power and di scharged millions of gallons of untreated sewage during the emergency and power failu res at drinking water plants led to boil water advisories in many communities li kewise natural disasters such as the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes and 2007 mississippi river floods caused extensive and costly damage to multiple infrastructure system s transportation water electric power and telecommunicationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32189crs2 background broadly speaking water infrastructure systems include surface and ground water sources of untreated water for municipal industrial agricultural and household needs dams reservoirs queducts and pipes that cont ain and transport raw water treatment facilities that remove contaminants from raw water finished water reservoirs systems that distribute water to users and wastewater collection and treatment facilities across the country these systems comprise approximately 77000 dams and reservoirs thousands of miles of pipes aqueducts water distribution and sewer lines 168000 public dr inking water facilities many serving as few as 25 customers and about 160 00 publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities all of these systems and fac ilities must be operable 24 hours day seven days week ownership and management are both public and private the federal government has ownershi p responsibility for hundreds of dams and diversion structures but the vast majority of the nations water infrastructure is either privately owned or owned by nonfedera l units of government the federal government has built hundreds of water projects primarily dams and reservoirs for irrigati on development and flood cont rol with municipal and industrial water use as an incidental sel ffinanced project purpose many of these facilities are critically entwined with the nations overall water supply transportation and electricity infrastructure the largest federal facilities were built and are managed by the bureau of reclamation r eclamation of the department of the interior and the us army corps of engineers corps of the department of defense reclamation reservoirs pa rticularly those along the colorado river supply water to millions of people in southern california arizona and nevada via reclamation and nonr eclamation aqueducts reclam ations invent ory of assets includes 471 dams and dikes that create 348 reservoirs with total storage capacity of 245 llion acrefeet of water reclama tion projects also supply water to 9 million acres of farmland and other municipa l and industrial water users in the 17 western states the corps opera tes 276 navigation locks 11000 miles of commercial navigation channe l and approximately 1200 pr ojects of varying types including 609 dams it supplies water to t housands of cities to wns and industries from the 95 million acrefeet of water stored in its 116 lakes and reservoirs throughout the country including service to approximately one million residents of the district of columbia and portions of northern virginia the largest corps and reclamation f acilities also produce enormous amounts of power for example hoover and gl canyon dams on the colorado river represent 23 of the installed electrical capacity of the bureau of reclamations 58 power plants in the west and 7 of the to tal installed capacity in the western united states similarly corps facilities and reclamations grand coulee dam on the columbia river provide 43 of the total in stalled hydroelectric capacity in the west 25 nationwide still desp ite its critical involvement in such projects especially in the west the federal government is responsible for only about 5 of the dams whose failure could result in loss of life or significant property damage the remaining dams belong to state or local governments utilities and corporate or private owners httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32189crs3 fairly small number of large drinking water and wastewater utilities located primarily in urban areas about 15 of the systems provide water services to more than 75 of the us population arguab ly these systems represent the greatest targets of opportunity for terrorist attacks while the large number of small systems that each serve fewer than 10000 persons ar less likely to be perceived as key targets by terrorists who might seek to disrupt water infrastructure systems however the more numerous smaller syst ems also tend to be less protected and thus are potentially more vulnerable to att ack whether by vandals or terrorists successful attack on even small system could cause widespread panic economic impacts and loss of public conf idence in water supply systems attacks resulting in physical destruction to any of these systems could include disruption of operating or distribution system components power or telecommunications systems electronic control systems and actual damage to reservoirs and pumping stations loss of flow and pressure would cause problems for customers and would hinder firefighting efforts furt her destruction of large dam could result in catastrophic flooding and loss of life bioterrorism or chemical attacks could deliver widespread contamination with small amounts of microbiological agents or toxic chemicals and could endanger the public health of thousands while some expert s believe that risks to wate r systems actually are small because it would be difficult to introduce sufficient quantities of agents to cause widespread harm concern and heighten ed awareness of potential problems are apparent factors that are relevant to biological agents potential as weapon include its stability in drinking water system virulence culturability in the quantity required and resistance to detection nd treatment cyber attacks on computer operations can affect an entire infrastructure network and hacking in water utility systems could result in theft or corruption of information or denial and disruption of service responses to security concerns water infrastructure system designers managers and operato rs have long made preparing for extreme events standard practice historically their focus has been on natural events major storms blizza rds and earthquakes some of which could be predicted hour s or longer before they occurred when considering the risk of manmade threats operators genera lly focused on purposeful acts such as vandalism or theft by disgruntled employees or customers rather than broader malevolent threats by terrorists domestic or foreign the events of september 11 2001 changed this focus federal dam operators went on highalert immediately following the september 11 terrorist attacks reclamation closed its visitor facilities at grand coulee hoover and glen canyon dams because of potential loss of life and property downstream if breached security threats are under constant review and coordination efforts with both the national guard and local law enforcement officials are ongoing the corps also operates unde r continued high defense alert and temporarily closed all its f acilities to visitors after ptember 11 although locks and dams remained operational most closed facilities later reopened but security continues to be rea ssessed following heightened alert issued by the federal government in february 2003 reclama tion implemented

closure of some visitor centers and random vehicle inspections although officials believe that risks to water and wastewat er utilities are small operators have been under heightened secu rity conditions since september 11 local utilities have primary respons ibility to assess their vulne rabilities and prioritize them for necessary security improvements most especially in urban areas have emergency preparedness plans that address issues such as redundancy of operations public notification and coor dination with law enforcem ent and emergency response officials however many plans were veloped to respond to natural disasters domestic threats such as vandalism and in some cases cyber attacks drinking water and wastewater utilities coordinated efforts to prepare for possible y2k impacts on their computer systems on janua ry 1 2000 but these efforts focused more on cyber security than physical terrorism concerns thus it was unclear whether previously existing plans incorporate suffici ent procedures to ddress other types of terrorist threats utility officials are reluctant to disclose details of their systems or these confidential plans since doing so might alert terrorists to vulnerabilities water supply was one of eight critical infrastructure systems identified in president clintons 1998 presiden tial decision directive 63 pdd632 as part of coordinated national effort to achieve the capability to protect the nations critical infrastructure from intentional acts that would diminish them these efforts focused primarily on the 340 large community wate r supply systems which each serve more than 100000 persons the environmental pr otection agency epa was identified as the lead federal agency for liaison with the water supply sect or in re sponse in 2000 epa established partnership w ith the american metropolitan water association amwa and american wate r works association awwa to jointly undertake measures to safeguard water supplies from terrorist acts awwas research foundation contracted with the department of ener gys sandia national laboratory to develop vulnerability assessment tool for water systems as an extension of methodology for assessing fede ral dams epa supported project with the sandia lab to pilot test the physical vulnerability assessment tool and develop cyber vulnerability assessment tool an information sharing and analysis center isac supported by an epa grant b ecame operational under amwas leadership in december 2002 it will allow for dissemina tion of alerts to drinking water and wastewater utilities about poten tial threats or vulne rabilities to the integrity of their operations that have been detected and viable resolutions to problems3 research on water sector infrastructur protection has been underway for some time the department of th army conducts research in the area of detection and treatment to remove various chemical ag ents the federal emergency management agency fema has led an effort to produ ce databases of water distribution systems and to develop assessment tools for eval uating threats posed by the introduction of biological or chemical agent into water system the centers for disease controlhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32189crs5 4 critical infrastructure assurance office report of the president of the united states on the status of federal critical infrastructure protection activities

ential biological agents and the effects of standard water treatment practices on their persistence however in the january 2001 report of the presidents commission on critical infrastructure protection ongoing water sector research was then char acterized as small effort that leaves number of gaps and shortfalls relative to us water supplies4 this report stated that gaps exist in four major areas concerns that remain relevant and are guiding policymakers now threatvulnerability risk assessments identification and characterization of biological and chemical agents need to establish center of excellence to support communities in conducting vulnerability and risk assessment and application of information assu rance techniques to computerized systems used by water utilities as well as the oil gas and electric sectors for operational da ta and control operations less attention has been focused on protecting wastewater treatment facilities than drinking water systems perhaps becau destruction of them likely represents more of an environmental threat ie by release of untreated sewage than direct threat to life or public welfare vulnerabilities do exist however large underground collector sewers could be acce ssed by terrorist groups for purposes of placing destructive devices beneath buildings or city streets pipelines can be made into weapons via the introduction of high ly flammable substance such as gasoline through manhole or inlet explosions in the sewers can cause collapse of roads sidewalks and adjacent structures and inju re and kill people nearby damage to wastewater facility prevents water from being treated and can impact downriver water intakes destructi on of containers that hold large amounts of chemicals at treatment plants could result in release of toxic chemical agents such as chlorine gas which can be deadly to humans if inhaled and at lower doses can burn eyes and skin and inflame the lungs since the 2001 terrorist attacks many water and wastewater utilities have switched from using chlorine gas as disinf ection to alternatives which are believed to be safer such as sodium hypochlor ite or ultraviolet light however some consumer groups remain concerned that many wastewater utilities including facilities that serve heavily populated areas tinue to use chlorine gas to prepare for potential accidental releases of haza rdous chemicals from their facilities more than 2800 wastewater and drinking wate r utilities water supply systems and irrigation systems already are subject to risk management pl anning requirements under the clean air act still some obser vers advocate requiring federal standards to ensure that facilities using dangerous chemicals such as wastewater treatment plants use the best possible industry prac tices practices that are referred to as inherently safer technologies or ists to reduce hazards5 in june 2007 the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32189crs6 5 continued chemical risks at wastewater

march 2006 the government acc ountability office gao reported on survey of security measures at 200 of the nations larges t wastewater utilities7 gao found that many have made security improvements since the 2001 terrorist attacks most utilities said they have completed or intend to co mplete plan to conduct some type of security assessment more than half of res ponding facilities indicated they did not use potentially dangerous gaseous chlorine as wastewater disinfectant however the report noted that these utilitie s have made little effort to address collection system vulnerabilities due to the technical complexity and expense of securing collection systems that cover large areas and have many access points some told gao investigators that taking other measures such as converting from gaseous chlorine took priority over collec tion system protections in 2007 follow on study gao reported that actual and pr ojected capital costs to convert from chlorine gas to alternative disinfec tion methods range from about 650000 to just over 13 million factors affectin g conversion costs included the type of alternative method the size of the f acility and labor building nd supply costs which varied considerably8 there are federal standards or ag reedupon practices within the water infrastructure sector to govern readiness re sponse to security incidents and recovery epa is not authorized to require water in frastructure systems to implement specific security improvements or meet particular security standards efforts to develop voluntary protocols and tools are ongoi ng since the 2001 terrorist attacks wastewater and drinking water utility organizations are implementing computer software and training materials to evaluate vulnerabilities at large medium and small utility systems and epa has provided some grant assistance to drinking water utilities for vulnerability assessments ou t of funds appropria ted in 2002 pl 107 117 epa awarded grants to nearly 900 rge and medium drinking water utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments epa also has targeted grants to train the trainers delivering technical assistance to organizations such as the ruralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32189crs7 9 see httpwwwasceorgstatic1wisecfmcommunity assistance program and the water environment federation that in turn can assist and train personnel at thousa nds of medium and small utilities throughout the country rural and small systems also have received support from the us department of agriculture with financial support from epa drinki ng water and wastewater utility and engineering groups developed three s ecurity guidance documents issued in december 2004 that cover the physical desi gn of online contaminant monitoring systems and physical security enhancements of drinking water wastewater and stormwater infrastructure systems the documents provide voluntary guidelines for assisting utilities that have completed vulnerability assessments to mitigate vulnerabilities of their systems through the design construc tion operation and maintenance of both new and existing systems based on the three guidance documents these groups also have drafted training materials nd set of voluntary standardized best engineering practices that recommend measures to protect water and wastewater infrastructure against range of threats including terrorist attacks and other sources of potential harm such as accidents chemical contamination and natural disasters9 epa epa has taken number of orga nizational and planning steps to strengthen water security the agency created national homeland security research center within the office of re search and development to develop the scientific foundations and tools that can be used to respond to attacks on water systems the center conducts applied re search on ways to protect and prevent mitigate respond to and recover from secu rity events in september 2003 epa created water security division in the office of water taking over activities initiated by water protection task force after the september 11 terrorist attacks this office provides guidance and tools to utilities as they assess and reduce vulnerabilities of their systems it trains water utility personnel on security issues supports the waterisac and implements the agencys comprehens ive research plan epa has issued both water security research and technical support action plan identifying critical research needs and providing an implementation plan for addressing those needs and strategic pl an for

by reflecting projected funding and resources for the ne xt two years on epas strategic objectives and recognizing the evolving role of the department of homeland security11 reviewing these efforts the national re search council concl uded in 2007that epa has developed useful contaminant info rmation and exposure assessment tools in several key areas but that other areas such as physical and cyber security contingency planning and wastewater s ecurity have shown weaker or somewhat disjointed progress an overarching issu is making water security information accessible to those who might need it12 gao has issued two reports discussing how future federal funding can best be spent to improve security at drinking water and wastewater utilities13 both reports are based on the views of subject matter ex perts identified by gao in the drinking water report specific activities judged by the experts to be most deserving of federal support incl uded physical and technological upgrades education and training for staff and responders and strengthening key re lationships between water utilities and others such as law enforcement and public h ealth agencies in the wastewater report the experts cited the replacement of gaseous chemicals used in the disinfection process with less hazardous lternatives as key activity deserving of federal funds along with improving local state and regional collaboration and support facilities vulnerability assessments asked how federal funds s hould be allocated both groups of experts favored giving priority to utilitie s that serve critical assets such as public health institutions government and military bases and to utilities serving areas with large populations key focus of epas activities since 2005 has been the water sector initiative initially known as watersentinel it is pilot project that could serve as model for water utilities thr oughout the c ountry its purpose is to test and demonstrate contamination warning systems at drinking water utilities and municipalities so far epa has awarded grants to install and evaluate early warning systems to cincinnati new york and san francisco and the agency expects to award similar grants to two other cities in the near futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32189crs9 14 for additional information see crs report rl34466 the bureau of reclamations aging infrastructure by

provide added value for the sector18 in the nipp dhs described plan to velop risk analysis method that would include uniform means of measuring ri sk and assessing consequences across infrastructure sectors some drinking water and wastewater treatment industry officials commented that this plan known as the risk analysis and management for critical asset protection ramcap raised concern that it could force some facilities to conduct ne w or revise existing vulne rability assessments drinking water industry officials are said to be concerned that new method may not recognize vulnerability assessments that many drinking water utilities have already completed under requirements of the 2002 bioterrorism preparedness act see page 15 this is particular concern for small and rural utilities many of which have used simpler security models to complete their vulnerability assessment plans and would prefer to build on that model to conduct ramcap and similar activities coordination and in formation sharing the homeland security departments involveme nt in water security concerns has been growing although under hspd7 epa continues as the lead federal agency to ensure protection of drinking water and wastewater treatment systems from possible terrorist acts and other sabotage since early 2004 dhs s been preparing guidance documents on how each infrastructure sector including water systems can protect itself from security threats for some time the two agencies have been working to clarify their roles in providing security to water utilities one of the functions of the water sect or coordinating council is to be point of contact for dhs to vet potential water security policies allowing onestop shopping for federal officials in 2003 dhs created an informationsharing network called the homeland security information network hsin both it and the existing waterisac share the goal of providing security information to water utilities but they differ in some respects the waterisac is private subscription service although it receives some fe deral funding that provide s information to about 530 water utilities and others on security matters it is the primary communication tool in the water sector the hsin softwa re program is free federally funded platform for information sharing it is not limited to the water sector and it provides information by itself it acts as bulletin board where dhs epa and utilities can post securityrelated information distinct from the hsin and the waterisac is the water security channel watersc unched in 2004 as free service

security key question is whethe r protective measures should be focused on the largest water systems and facilities where risks to the public are greatest or on all since small facilities may be more vulnerable related question is responsibility for additional step s because the federal government has direct control over only limited portion of the water infrastructure sector the distributed and diverse nature of owners hip federal nonfede ral government and private complicates assessing and managing risks as does the reality of limited resources the adequacy of physical and ope rational security safeguards is an issue for all in this sector one possible option for federal facilities dams and reservoirs maintained by reclamation and the corps is to restrict visitor access including at adjacent recreational facilities although such actions could raise objections from the public some operators of nonfederal facilities and utilities are likewise concerned as precaution after the september 11 attacks new york city which provides water to 9 million consumers closed its reservoirs indefinitely to all fishing hiking and boating and blocked access to some roads policymakers have examined measures that could improve coordination and exchange of information on vulnerabilities ri sks threats and responses this is key objective of the waterisac and also of the department of homeland security which includes for example functions of the national infrastructure protection center nipc of the fbi that brings together the private sector and government agencies at all levels to protect critical in frastructure especially on cyber issues one issue of interest is how the department is coordinating its activities with ongoing security efforts by other federal agencies and nonfederal entities that operate water infrastructure systems including its imple mentation of the co mprehensive national plan required by presid ential directivehspd7 for some time the two agencies have been working to clarify their roles in providing security to water utilities and in other areas and have negotiated agreements concerning joint research projects and coordination for specific field operations nevertheless in the conference report accompanying the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act cong ress directed epa to enter into memorandum of understanding mou with dhs to define the relationship of the two entities with regard to the protec tion and security of the nation the memorandum was expected to specifically identify areas of responsibilities and the potential costs including which entity pays in whole or part for meeting such responsibilities19 in response epa did not enter into new mou but instead in november 2005 issued report that identifie d general authorities that govern epashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32189crs13 20 us congress house committee on appropriations draft report to accompany department of homeland security appropriations bill 2009 110th congress 2d session p 97 available from http wwwcqcomand dhss respective actions ongoing project s that reflect coordination and existing projectspecific mous this report on roles and responsibilities still may not resolve the potential for duplication and overlap among agencies cu rrently for example policies are being developed both by dhs and epa althoug h both agencies are represented on dhss water sector committee through the cipac process information sharing and dissemination even in this one sector are occurring through several different mechanisms dhs supports the homeland s ecurity information network hsin while drinking water and wastewater u tilities also may receive securityrelated advisories from two other sources the wa terisac and the water security channel some have questioned the mu ltiple advisory groups on top of existing entities and in particular the potential that the several mechanisms for sharing homeland security information could transmit inconsistent information and make the exchange of information more complicated not less others are optimistic that the systems and groups will sort themselves out into co mpatible and comple mentary networks of information sharing but that process could take considerable time in its march 2006 report gao commented on these multiple information services designed to communicate information to the water sector but also acknowledged epas and dhss ongoing fforts to coordinate their activities to advance water sector security gao r ecommended that dhs and the water sector coordinating council identify areas where informationsharing networks supported by epa and dhs especially the waterisa c and hsin could be better coordinated to avoid operational duplicati ons and overlap and to ensure that security threat information is provided to water systems on timely basis water utility industry groups responded to gaos recommendation by sa ying that such coordination efforts are in fact underway and dhs is repor tedly reviewing hsin and considering its future role in information sharing dhsepa coordination again received congressional attention in the 110th congress in its draft report on fy2009 funding for dhs the house appropriations committee included report language urging dhs to work with epa on water security issues the report encouraged the nationa l protection and programs directorate of dhs to work with epa to improve federal outreach to water system managers increase support and guidance on implementati on of risk assessment techniques and publicize effective protective measures that can be taken to increase water system security20 beyond the water sector itself there is interest in larger coordination issues involving crosssector inte rdependencies of critical infrastructures as noted previously water utilities are dependent on electric power to treat and distribute power and electric power is essential to collecting and treating wastewater

ects power also affects water supply also affects sanitary services also affects communications capability the national infrastructure advisory council which pr ovides the president through dhs with advice on infrastructure security reportedly is considering using the water sector as the focus for study of sector interdependencies another information issue concerns the extent of epas ability to collect and analyze security data from water utilities especially information in vulnerability assessments submitted under the bioterrori sm preparedness act discussed below epa officials believe that the act permits reviewing utility submissions for overall compliance and allows aggregation of data but precludes the agency from asking for or analyzing data showing changes in security levels as safeguard against unintended release of such information others including epas inspector general believe that epa has the authority and responsibility to review and analyze the information in order to identify and prior itize threats and to develop plans to protect drinking water supplies among the research needs being addressed are tools for vulnerability and risk analysis identification and response to biologicalchemical agents realtime monitoring of water supplies and development of information technology the cost of additional protections and how to pay fo r them are issues of great interest and policymakers continue to c onsider resource needs and how to direct them at public and private sector priorities critical issue for drinking water and wastewater utilities is how to pay for physical security improvements since currently there are federal funds dedicated to these purpos and utilities generally must pay for improvements using the same re venue or funding sources also needed for other types of capital projects congressional activity since the september 11 2001 attacks congress has conducted oversight on number of thes issues and considered legislation to address various policy issues including government reorgani zation and additional appropriations appropriations since the september 11 terro rist attacks congress has provided appropriations to the corps th bureau and epa for securityrelated programs and activities to protect water infrastructure as shown in figure 1 through fy2008 appropriations have totaled 7944 million for both the bureau of reclamation and the army corps of engineers appropriations immediately after september 11 were intended to support risk assessment of needed security improvements followed by implementation of measures to ensure the safety and security of the public reclamation and corps employees and the facilities for ex ample since fy2004 both agencies have implemented physical hardening and other protective measures as well as personnel and information security both agencies continue to assess and reassess security needs at their facilities as part of ongoing efforts to ensure their longterm

epa grants for vulnerability assessments carried out by large and mediumsize drinking water systems to assist them in complying with requirements of the public health security and bioterrorism prepare dness and response act pl 107288 discussed below epa appropriations support training and velopment of voluntary industry practices for security and grants to states and territories to coordinate activities for critical water infrastructure security efforts 5 million per year epa also provides support for water security information sharing for drinking water and wastewater utilities through the waterisac and the water secu rity channel epa has supported two special initiatives since fy2006 pilot program to desig n deploy and test biological or other conta mination warning systems at

with local law enforcement to protect its facilities also was enacted during the 107th congress pl 10769 in 2001 the house and senate consider ed but did not enact legislation authorizing sixyear grant program for research and development on security of water supply and wastewater treatment systems hr 3178 s 1593 some of the drinking water research provisions in these bills were included in the bioterrorism preparedness act in 2002 the house approved bill authorizing 220 million in grants and other assistance for vulnerability assessments by wastewater treatment utilities hr 5169 but the senate did not act on related bill s 3037 in the 108th congress legislation authorizing vulnerability assessment grants to wastewater utilities was appr oved by the house by 4137 vote hr 866 identical to hr 5169 in the 107th congress the senate nvironment and public works committee approved related legislation s 1039 srept 108149 further action occurred due in part to concerns expr essed by some that the legislation did not require that vulnerability assessments be submitted to epa as is the case with drinking water assessments required by the 2002 bioterro rism preparedness act wastewater security issues again received some attention in the 109th congress in may 2006 the senate environment nd public works committee approved s 2781 srept 109345 it wa s similar to s 1039 in the 108th congress in that it would have encouraged wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and authorized 220 million to assist utilities with assessments and preparation of site security plans it also included pr ovisions responding to gaos march 2006 report that found that utilities have made little effort to addre ss vulnerabilities of collection systems which may be used by terrorist s to introduce hazardous substances or as access points for underground travel to potential target22 s 2781 would have authorized epa to conduct research on this topic during consideration of the bill the senate committee rejected an amendment that would have required rather than encouraged treatment work s to conduct vulnerability ssessments and also would have required highrisk fac ilities to switch from using ch lorine and similar hazardous substances to other chemicals that are often referred to as inherently safer technologies there was further acti on on this bill similar legislation was introduced in the 110th congress s 1968 but further action occurred another issue of recent interest has been the concerns of number of water supply and power users of bureau of recl amation facilities about paying for security costs at these facilities since september 11 reclamation has increased security and antiterrorist measures at federal mu ltipurpose dams from 2002 through 2004 all of the incremental security costs were paid by the federal government howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32189crs17 23 for additional information see crs report rl33847 chemical facility security regulation and issues for congress by dana sheasince 2005 the administration has request ed that users should fully reimburse government for the guards and patrols tion of site security costs in the administrations view project beneficiaries have had several years to adjust their expectations budgets and planning for curre nt guard and patrol levels and that post september 11 cost increases should now be considered project om expenses subject to allocation among project purpos and reimbursement from beneficiaries many users have argued that security costs for which the general public is the beneficiary including obligations for nati onal defense should pr operly be the federal governments responsibility the issue is especially concern for beneficiaries of reclamations five highpriority dams such as hoover and grand coulee which have the largest security needs because these users are being asked to pay proportionally higher share of total security costs than users of other reclamation facilities hearings on the issue were held by the house natural resources committee in june 2006 and the senate energy and natural resources committee in july 2007 compromise of sorts is re flected in legislation enacted in may 2008 section 513 of the consolidated natu ral resources act of 2008 pl 110229 requires water and power users to pay for the cost of security guards but sets an 189 million cap on the amount to be paid by users the issue of security of wastewater and drinking water utilities also was debated in connection with legislation dealing w ith chemical manufacturing plant security as part of bill providing fy2007 appropr iations for the depa rtment of homeland security congress included provisions that give dhs authority to establish risk based and performancebased s ecurity standards at the nations chemical plants the chemical security act section 550 of pl 109295 under the legislation chemical plants are required to conduc t vulnerability assessment and create and implement site security plans based on identified vulnerabilities23 d u r i n g consideration of comprehensive chemical plant security bills during the 109th congress some had proposed that water sy stems drinking water and wastewater be included in the legislation because many store or use extremely hazar dous substances such as chlorine gas that can injure or kill citizens if the chemicals are suddenly released see page 5 however water system officials argued that the water sector should be excluded becau facilities have already undertaken vulnerability assessments s required for many drinking water systems under the 2002 bioterrorism act and as many wa stewater utilities ve done voluntarily further they argued that requirements in the legislation were potentially duplicative of risk management plan provisions in th clean air act which apply to more than 2800 of the largest water systems the chemical plant security provi sions in pl 109295 endorsed these arguments and excluded water systems fro m the new requirements implementing regulations promulgated by dhs in 2007 exempted water systems from security standards however under the statute the dhs rules will sunset on september 30 2009 the 110th congress considered legislation to reauthorize dhss chemical security program but legislation wa s enacted at issue were two pendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32189crs18 24 ibidlegislative proposals hr 5533 would revise and extend the chemical facility security program and would continue to exempt water facilities hr 5577 would revise the us chemical plant security program and would include drinking water and wastewater facilities in its coverage24 at house homeland security committee oversight hearing in july 2007 dhs assistant secretary for infrastructure protection bob stephan said that the water sectors exclusion from the chemical s ecurity act created regulatory gap because chemicals that are covered by the act including chlorine are found at unregulated wastewater and drinking water facilities as well as regulated conventional chemical plants he also sa id that dhs is reviewing ways to boost safeguards at water utilities that use large amounts of ga seous chlorine similarly in testimony before house subcommittee in june 2008 epa and dhs officials testified in support of eliminating the current exempti on for wastewater and drinking water facilities from chemical security re gulations water utilities oppose inclusion in the dhs program arguing that it could lead to costly new mandates the debate also raises the issue of federal agency ro and leadership some were concerned that legislation such as hr 5577 woul d create uncertainty about coordination between epa and dhs and whether epas lead role for the water utility sector would be altered continuing interest in these issues is possible in the 111th congress and beyond along with interest in how the federal government coordinates its own activities and communicates policies and information to the water infrastructure sector
