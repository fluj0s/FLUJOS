alert network to warn the public of imminent or current emergencies caused by terrorist incidents and disasters the warning would have provided information on appropriate protective measures15 s 1753 proposed to establish national alert system administered by national alert office the national alert office would have been established within the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the national alert system would have provided public alert on national regional and local emergencies requiring public response 16 hr 5001 would have required the dhs undersecretary for information and analysis to implement changes to hsas the proposed changes included the requirement for every hsas alert to be accompanied by information on the threat and appropriate protective measures the hsas warning would have been limited in scope for every warning to specific region locality or economic sector believed to be at risk finally hr 5001 would have required dhs to use some means of warning the nation without the use of color designations 17 g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 since the creation of the hsas number of issues have arisen among which are the vagueness of warnings disseminated by

2002 and once to red on august 10 2006 with each change the attorney general or dhs secretary cited intelligence information but offered little specificity except on august 1 2004 when former dhs secretary ridge identified financial institutions in new york washington dc and new jersey as being targeted by qaeda the only other time any specifics were given on possible terrorist attack targets was on february 7 2003 when former dhs secretary ridge cited intelligence reports suggesting qaeda attacks on apartment buildings hotels and other soft skin targets 19 but in this case region state or city was identified as possible locations of attacks moreover dhs has never explained the sources and quality of intelligence upon which the threat levels were based20

threats are too vague21 the vagueness that characterized the eight increases in the threat condition in the past two years has raised concerns that the public may begin to question the authenticity of the hsas threat level former secretary ridge told reporters on june 6 2003 that dhs is worried about the credibility of the system he said that the system needs to be further refined 22 questions about the credibility of the threat say other observers might cause the public to wonder how to act or whether to take any specia l action at all some observers maintain that without specific terrorist threat information there is basis for formulating clear easily understood public announcement of what appropriate protective measures to take23 others assert that the continued lack of specific information arguably can lead to complacency24 dhs officials cite the lack of specificity in intelligence as the reason for lack of detailed information when the threat level is changed

decisions relating to it are best left to the department the lack of specificity may be due to the need to protect intelligence sources or desire by dhs to issue warnings when threat information is generic but nonetheless credible maintaining the status quo places the burden of responding to complaints about the vagueness of hsas warnings and the critiques of dhss perceived inability to give adequate terrorist attack warnings on the department option 2 provide general warnings due to the reported misunderstanding of hsas threat levels and the systems lack of recommended pr otective measures for state and local agencies the public and privatesector entities congress could consider directing dhs to issue general warnings concerning the threat of terrorist attacks without using the hsas to notify state and local governments the public and the private sector general warnings via public statements in coordination with hsas warnings to the federal government would ensure that notices of terrorist threats are issued to state and local governments the public and the private sector dhs chose to provide general warnings on september 4 2003 and november 21 2003 on september 4 2003 dhs cited recent federal interagency reviews of information that raised concerns about possible qaeda plans to attack the us and us interests overseas this general warning listed aviation critical infrastructure wmd and soft target threats however specifics were given on possible location or type of attacks 26 another general warning was issued on november 21 2003 when dhs cited high volume of reports concerning the possible threats against us interests during the muslim holiday of ramadan these reports suggested qaeda remained interested in using commercial aircraft as weapons against critical infrastructure however location of possible attacks was specified27 this approach would address the concerns of some who have asserted that the hsas causes misunderstanding at the state and local level but it would not address the issue raised by those who say dhs does not give enough specificity in its terrorist attack warnings option 3 increase specificity of warnings were congress to decide that the terrorist warnings issued by dhs are too vague and cause complacency in state and local agencies the public and the private sector it might instruct dhs to use the hsas to provide specific warnings to targeted federal facilities regions states localities and private sector industries to the extent that is possible dhs has said that its goal is to have the capability to issue high alerts to designated cities geographical regions industry or critical infrastructure 28 this approach arguably would address the concerns about the perceived vagueness of hsas warnings one could argue that dhs is getting better at providing specificity with the latest alert issued on august 1 2004

drawn the attention of some interested observers early on william b berger president of the international association of chiefs of police testified before the senate governmental affairs committee that the lack of defined response protocols for state and local governments was an area of concern among local law enforcement agencies 29 citing what some contend is lack of dhs guidance on protective measures nonfederal entities are beginning to fill the perceived void for example the american red cross recommends protective measures for individuals families neighborhoods schools and businesses at each of the hsas threat levels 30 further the state of maryland has adopted the american red cross protective measures31 without federal guidance some cities have adopted the following types of protective measures when the hsas threat condition is raised to orange surveillance cameras are activated law enforcement officers are not granted time off port security patrols are increased law enforcement officers are required to carry biologicalchemical protective masks first responders are placed on alert mass transit authorities broadcast warnings and instructions mass transit law enforcement officers increase patrols law enforcement agencies make security checks in sensitive areas such as bridges shopping centers religious establishments and courthouses32 option 1 status quo the hsas was designed for federal government use and congress may deem the system adequate for the federal government this approach can encourage states and localities to conduct threat and vulnerability assessments that would then assist in the development of specific protective measures geared to each state and localitys homeland security 29 us congress senate governmental affairs

conference calls dhs uses ceo com link to notify private sector entities that participate in the system and then makes calls to other critical infrastructure and business associations this arguably results in facto prioritization of alerted private sector entities which could result in targeted private sector entity being attacked without timely and effective alert option 1 status quo congress may decide to allow dhs to deal with issues relating to hsas advisories at this stage of hsas development this approach would encourage the continued utilization of the dhs terrorist threat communica tion systems since the hsas is designed for federal government use there may be need for dhs to establish any other communication systems that disseminate changes in the hsas terrorist threat levels this would however not address the issues some have raised about the dissemination of hsas advisories some would argue that before dhs establishes specific system that communicates change in hsas terrorist threat levels dhs needs to establish protective measures for states localities the public and the private sector this argument is based on the belief that there is little value in knowing of change in the hsas terrorist threat level in the absence of recommended protective measures option 2 revise the hsas notification process congress could encourage or enact legislation instructing dhs to revise the hsas notification process to ensure that state and local law enforcement and emergency management agencies are informed of changes of the terrorist threat level in more effective and timely manner this approach could address the problem of states and localities receiving the notification via the news media without first receiving official notification from dhs this approach however would not address the issue of the public and private sectors receiving timely notification of changes in the hsas threat level possible communications system dhs could use fo r disseminating

operated by private industry the federal government could establish relationship with the corporate suppliers of these technologies relationship to encourage development and effectively consolidate or provide the means to make the current warning systems interoperable consolidating and coordinating federal warning systems however may cause loss of concentration on the systems traditional hazards mature warning systems have established alerting protocols and routines that if consolid ated could become too broad which may result in less effective warnings option 1 status quo without congressional intervention federal agencies responsible for issuing warnings will likely continue to narrowly focus on traditional hazards this approach allows mature warning systems to continue communicating alerts and protective measures to an identified audience also this approach would not incur an increased need for federal funding that would be required to update test and ensure compatibility of the systems on the other hand this approach would not address issues such as overlap of hazards terrorist threat warnings of hsas and any presidential declared emergency wa rning issued by eas and the potential need to reach wide audience through the use of multiple warning systems option 2 coordination and update of warning systems if congress decided to address the issue of coordinating warning systems it could requir all federal agencies with hazard warning responsibilities to establish and develop means for coordinating and updating existing warning systems this approach could allow any warning of manmade or natural hazards to be issued on the full range of federal warning systems this could ensure that larger number of the state and local governments the public and private sector entities would receive the specific warning in an effective and timely manner it would require communication protocol to be developed that allowed one federal warning system to talk to different system updating of warning systems would not only incl ude the ability of one system to talk to another but could also include the ability of such systems as eas to be transmitted on offthe shelf telecommunication devices such as cellular phones given the widespread use of wireless communications some observers have argued for warnings to be issued on wireless devices 47 in the

access to communications facilities in times of emergency48 option 3 consolidation of warning systems if congress decided that there needs to be an all hazard warning system it could enact legislation

state and local governments the private sector and the public these costs include the increased security measures undertaken by states and localities loss to tourism and the indirect cost on the economy during period of heightened threat level in fy2003 the office for domestic preparedness renamed the office of grant programs in fy2007 critical infrastructure protection grant program authorized state and local governments to use allocated grants to fund overtime costs associated with heightened threat levels 50 according to the office of grant programss state homeland security grant and urban area security initiative grant programs guidance overtime is an authorized expenditure only associated with training or exercises office of grant programss law enforcement terrorism prevention program however does allow overtime costs specifically related to homeland security efforts 51 g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561g138g151g141g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 local governments incur direct costs when they put in place additional security measures to deal with higher threat condition 52 an example of this is the cost of random car searches at atlantas hartsfield airport which reportedly requires 180000 month for labor and signage this cost is borne by atlantas police department and airport administration53 because of the budget crisis that many states are experiencing additional homeland security costs during heightened threat periods are seen as an additional fiscal burden the costs associated with threat level changes have prompted many state and local officials to complain to dhs54 the united states conference of mayors released 145city survey that reported that during periods of heightened alert homeland security costs increased to additional 70 million week55 this increase in homeland security costs during heightened threat periods also has localities arguing for direct funding from the federal government femas assistance to firefighters is the only assistance that provide 100 of the funding to localities the office of grant programss urban area security initiative grants however first pass through the state which causes some localities to complain about delay in receiving funding 49 s 118 sec 3 108th cong hr 2537 sec 3 108th cong 50 odps critical infrastructure grant program received appropriations in fy2004 51 us

contention that states and localities have with homeland security funding and costs all homeland security grant programs list authorized equipment and activities that grant allocations can be used to fund states and localities may argue that these authorized expenditures do not address their specific homeland security needs these direct homeland security costs occur not only at the state and local level when the threat level changes federal departments and agencies have to adopt prescribed protective measures outlined in the different threat condition levels of the hsas an indirect cost of heightened threat level is the negative effect on tourism in cities perceived as potential targets of terrorism it has been observed that increased threat levels and the need for heightened security have hurt the tourism industry of such metropolitan areas as washington dc new york and chicago washingtons mayor anthony williams urged residents to be alert for suspicious activities he also wanted the city to remain friendly open and safe to minimize the affects of the terrorist threat level on tourism 56 dc delegate eleanor holmes norton agreed with the need to keep washington open to tourism she said that the citys tourism industry had been hurt by changes in threat condition and that she feared some officials would overreact and shut down public buildings57 an example of the impact on tourism is the decision by some schools to cancel trips to washington because of the threat of terrorist attack58 some municipal officials have had to make costly decision between homeland security and tourism philadelphias mayor john f street for instance chose not to close down street around independence hall after he received call from dhs secretary ridge who advised its closing mayor street cited traffic and tourism concerns as the reason he chose not to respond to the recommendation59 another indirect cost may be how change in the hsas threat condition affects the stock markets60 option 1 status quo congress may decide that the office of grant programs homeland security assistance adequately meets the needs of states and localities homeland security costs due to heightened hsas threat it may be an appropriate approach for ensuring the splitting of homeland security costs among the several tiers of government this policy approach would not however address such issues as the needs of some state and local first responder agencies of hiring additional personnel the loss of revenue generated by tourism due to an increased terrorist threat level or the cost the economy incurs when the terrorist threat level is raised option 2 funding through established the office of grant programs should congress decide that more funding needs to be provided to cover costs incurred by states and localities due to an increased terrorist threat level it could consider establishing grant programs that specifically fund such terrorist prevention preparedness and mitigation activities
