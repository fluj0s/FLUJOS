document of international monetary fund and for official use nly buffed04177 october 14 2004 statement by mr schwartz on mexico executive board meeting october 18 2004 during the last few years the mexican economy has been characterized by mac roeconomic stability efficient debt management financial sector soundness and compliance wit h international standards and codes in number of areas th recovery of the economy is well underway gdp is expected to post growth of 40 percent in 2004 and 38 percent in 2005 the upturn of the economy is linked to the stre ngth of the global economy particularly to that of the us recent manufacturing and maquila exports reflect the strengthe ning of world recovery and imports of inte rmediate goods anticipate grow th of industrial activity consumption and investment ve also shown increased dynamism the recovery has been widespread among the different sectors and s resulted in improved employment indicators the current account deficit which accounted for more than 7 percent of gdp in the runup to the 199495 crisis is down to sustainable 15 20 percent of gdp international reserves have increased tenfold over the past ten ye ars to close to us60 billion and decade of successful floatingexchangerate regime has almost been comple ted the current floating scheme and prudent macroec onomic policies have placed the country in much better position to deal with capital market disturbanc and prevented the build up of external disequilibria inflation and monetary policy during the last eight years inflation has declined significantly reaching levels that had not been experienced for over three decades single digit inflation has become the norm and inflation reached figure under 4 percent at the end of 2003 notwithstanding recent inflation has been boosted by supply shocks in cluding temporary suspension of some meat imports from the us climate effects on agricultural prices and the impact of higher international prices for oil nd other commodities in particular it should be noted that the increases in administered prices have resulted fr om the nondiscretionary use of formulas that link domestic prices to international references moreover one should bear in mind that the cyclical recovery currently experienced by the economy feeds up the passthrough of supply shocks to consumer prices and thus has an effect on inflationary expectations within the framework of an inflationtargeting scheme the bank of mexico ca rries out cautious analysis of the origins of inflati onary pressures and their impact on inflation expectations monetary authorities have focused policy implementation on lim iting the effects on inflation expectations that result from higher commodities pri ces remaining vigilant to address cyclical pressures on inflation that coul d emerge from the strength of 2 aggregate demand and promoting an orderly transi tion to an environment of higher interest rates reiterating its commitment to achieve the inflation target the centr bank has tightened monetary policy on six occasions this year staff suggests that monetary policy implementation should cons ider the publication of an official inflation forecast in order to solve problems in communicating policies when inflation is above target however the fact th at headline inflation has surpassed the target does not entail communications problems inflati on has recently peaked up as result of imported inflation specifically increases in comm odity prices related to an upturn in world economic activity as well as result of geopolitical uncertainty inflat ion expectations produced by market participants for the medium and long term place inflation within the variability interval announced by the centra l bank and communication problems are not present the bank of mexico has repeatedly tigh tened policy in order to bring inflation back to its variability range moreover the fact that the central bank has not incorporated inflation forecasts in its inflationtargeting scheme doe s not mean that its design has not been improved during recent years the mexican inflationtargeting fr amework has incorporated additional elements that facilitate communication for example monetary policy announcements now take plac according to predetermined calendar policy statements place more emphasis on underlying inflation and on explaining the nature of pri ce shocks and monetary policy implementation is fully understandable by market participants fu rthermore thorough analysis of wide range of indicators data nd models has given the central bank good grasp of the transmission process of monetary policy the pub lication of an official inflation forecast as well as other refinements to mexi cos inflationtargeting scheme are constantly evaluated by the central bank board however it is believed that at stage when th inflation forecast might be different from the target an official forecast w ould not add much to the analys is could even create confusion and needlessly affect the credibility of the centr bank let us assume for example that an official inflation forecast is above the inflation target or variability interval announced by the central bank once the forecast is released and assuming that the central bank enjoys some credibility market participants would expect the monetary authority t implement policy in such way as to achieve its original target if the central bank is able to attain the original inflation target the forecast looses relevan ce and next time forecast is announced market participants will not find it useful however if the original target is not met t he central bank would be regarded as good predictor but as incompetent in reaching its target in this case the official forecast would simply serve to validate higher inflat ion expectation and thus affect inflation dynamics in this case the inflation forecast would unnecessarily delay the disinflationary process and make the fight against inflation more difficult staff should note that for those successful inflationtarget c ountries that do provide an inflation forecast their forecast is almost always within their confidence or variability interval around the point target in this case th inflation forecast helps guiding expectations within the interval and as such it does not c ontradict the target but in situation where current inflation is running above the target we do not see how an of ficial forecast could 3 help on the contrary as it has been the case if the central bank clearly specifies that its original target is maintained even though current inflation exceeds such ta rget and monetary policy is clearly identified as committed to bring inflation down fr om the current level to its medium term objective then the ce ntral bank is in stronger position to affect inflation expectations and thus speeds up the disi nflationary process this is the alternative that the bank of mexico has opted for and it has given good results furthermore inflation forecasts produced by market participants are constantly updated and contrasted with t he central banks target so communication probl ems or lack of transparency have been present fiscal policy and debt management on the fiscal front deficit of 03 percent of gdp is expected for 2004 with the aim to reduce it to 01 percent in 2005 public sector borrowing requirements are expected to amount to 26 percent of gdp at the end of this year and 21 percent in 2005 public finances have benefited from the oil windfall and the recovery hence the authorities ex pect to accomplish the fiscal targets without problems fiscal spending has become more efficient and more transparent and the debt structure has also been strengthened we agree with staff that the process of fiscal consolidation that has take n place in mexico should have relied less on oil related revenues neverthele ss the following must be emphasized during the current administration fiscal targets have been met both the traditional definition of deficit and public sector borrowing requirements every year even during the low growth episode that the mexican and the world economy went through in this context several countries used fiscal policy to foster the recovery temptation that was avoided in mexico in addition the political economy process has prioritized fiscal consolidation over undertaking countercyclical policies my authoritie s believe that given the current conditions facing the mexican economy this is the correct approach furthermore in the last two years and for 2005 the income law incorporated conservative assumptions for the oil price therefore pe rmanent expenditure pressures are not being generated by the high prices observed in the oil market this strategy has led to excess revenues that have been allocated to savings and investment ce rtainly it would be desirable to increase savings as staff recommends but it would be imprecise to consider that the extraordinary revenue has been used to boost publicsector consumption in sum the consistent achievement of the fiscal goals in recent years should not be belittle as minor achievement notwithstanding that in recent years the achievement of fiscal goals h as been favored by high oil revenues it must be highlighted that th composition of public spending has improved favoring productive investment therefore once th fiscal accounts are adjusted to consider productive investment in order to assess the sustainability of th fiscal position we find that public finances are better and that fiscal consolid ation efforts have been greater than what an ordinary analysis reveals throughout the report one finds several instances where staff suggests that the spending of windfall oil revenues has made the fiscal position more vulnerable to decline in oil prices 4 and on the need to save significant portion of future windfalls to avoid increasing dependence of the budget on oil revenues we find these comments misleading since they do not clearly depict what has taken place in xico and consider that this kind of comments seem to confuse the economic concept of sa vings with that of financial savings we all agree that longrun fiscal sustainability would generally imply saving portion of the current nonrenewable resource revenue such an approach would both stabilize usable revenue and provide for the accumulation of fi nancial resources that compensate for the depletion of the natural resource thus allowi ng to implement fiscal policies that are set within longerterm framework that is financial savings are designed to smooth expenditure as opposed to the above definition of financia l savings the economic concept of saving refers to the excess of current revenue over current expenditure with the objective of preserving net government wealth savings in this case can be allocated both to public investment or held as financia l assets moreover economic theo ry does not favor any of the two possible destinies however it is common sens that if government allocates all of its economic savings to public investment during good times and fails to build up financial assets it might find it difficult to fina nce expenditures during rainy days as result of the above considerations mexican authorities have tried to strike the right balance between the allocation of excess revenue s and it must be stressed that its largest share has been devoted to investment and savings rather than current expenditures fact that staff fails to recognize according to the current budget decree after ded ucting the expected increase on nonprogrammable expe nditures and the decrease in other revenue sources excess revenues are allocated according to formula that dist ributes 742 percent to savings vehicles pemex trust fund oil stab ilization fund and improve ment of the public balance and 258 percent to infrastructure inve stment in the states the fact that it is expected that pemex will eventually allocate its share to investment i n the development of the mexican oil sector exploration producti on etc should not be seen as current expenditures but as measure that preserves wealth and allows the oil company to become more efficient we have to keep in mind that the rate of return from investing i n the development of the mexican oil sector is subs tantially larger than the yield that can be obtained from financial assets as tbills thus mexico finds it more profitab to invest in the oil sector than in financial assets therefore the assumption that in 2004 savings have been small is incorrect moreover it should also be recognized that permanent ex penditure pressures are being generated as result of the spending expansion associated with excess revenues these revenues are allocated mostly to investment and savings nd are nonrecurrent in nature and consequently can not become pressure for public finances as result of the external public debt management strategy the government face s comfortable debtservice payments schedule as debt has been rolled over on more favorable terms an example is the recen t placement of us15 billion at fixed rate with 30 year maturity this issuance allows the mexican government to prefinance most of its 2005 5 obligations and is in accordance with the external net debtredu ction target of us500 million approved by congress for this year risks associated with reduction of flows to emerging markets have considerably been reduced by changing the composition of public debt and relying more heavily on domestic financing moreover the reduction in the cost of financing in the domestic market has contributed to an improvement of the privat sectors balancesheet position and in the development of domestic markets the maturity of the yield curve has been extended up to 20 years institutional investors are now interested in domestic issuanc with longterm fixed rates due to further progre ss in the development of the financial system and reforms to the pension system in order to further reduce interest rate risk the gove rnment will continue to substitute debt with floating rates for new instruments with fixed rates currently almost 50 percent of domestic debt instruments with maturity of one year or more are linked to fixed rates compared to nearly 15 percent at the end of 2000 it is expected that domestic debt will represent 65 percent of public bt in 2005 compared to 53 percent in 2000 in the staffs treatment of the evolution of th debt to gdp ratio one should realize that in recent years the path of this ratio has been more influenced by the behavior of th exchange rate of the mexican peso with respect to the dollar as well as by the exchan ge rate of the dollar with respect to other currencies in wh ich public debt is subscribed this is an important clarification since usually an increase of the debt to gdp ratio can erroneously be interpreted as lack of fiscal discipline exchange rate movements re temporary in nature and therefore the authorities expect debt as share of gdp to return to decreas ing path the international comparison sections of the selected issues paper on the structure and cost of public debt in mexico show that the current broad pub lic debt level in mexico is lower than the median value of emerging ma rket economies as percentage of gdp support the conception that mexicos public debt level is not high and claim that the size of the mexican public debt does not itself prevent futu re rating upgrades as such the referred analysis refutes the staff reports characteriz ation of mexican debt in paragraph 25 as uncomfortably high output gap productivity and structural reform staffs growth assumptions for 20052009 deserve further analysis the rate of growth of potential output at the baseline scenario 29 pe rcent seems low as it is based on total factorproductivity tfp growth rate assumption heavily influenced by the large nega tive swings observed in the periods of crisis of the 80s and 90s therefore it is not consistent with estimates of potential growth for the periods 199620012002 carried out by previous studies and by the background paper itself alon g with the tfp growth estimation problems the output gap below 2 percent to infer th behavior of gdp growth is small since it overlooks the macroeconomic conditions and is affected by endofs ample problems these factors may be leading to substantial underestim ation of growth for the next years taking into account that trend tfp growth should be higher b the output gap is larger than estimated in the paper c the process of getting back to the potential output should take 34 years at most and d the fact that the mexi can economy is still to benefit from the recent 6 financial sector reforms and from sounder ba nking system the average growth rate for 20052009 should be revised upwards by at least 05 percent this is important since growth forecasts have an effect on all the medium term fiscal projections produced by staff we agree with staff that mediumterm growth prospects are contingent on making progress in the reform agenda analytical work has em phasized that lack of further economic reforms accounts for the failure to deliver growth and velopment significant challenges remain in mexicos structural reform process the ab sence of progress in implementing structural reforms has affected competitiveness authorities have been engaged in constructive dialogue with all sectors in order to reach consensus on whole set of reforms that would boost productivity approval by the legislative branch is in the best interest of the country as it would contribute to raise potential growth statistical coverage of fiscal accounts mexico is strong believer in the usefulness of funds surveillance in t he last ten years the availability and transparency of mexican econom ic and financial indicators have increased considerably and as noted on the staff repor t and on the rosc on da ta dissemination the overall quality of statis tics is good and timely mexico obs erves the sdss nd its metadata are posted on the dsbb we understand the importa nce of fiscal indicat ors including those of the nonfinancial public sector and publis h our fiscal targets since 2001 mexico publishes comprehensive measure of the fisc balancethe public sector borrowing requirementwhich includes the financing needs of public entities and of priva and social entities that act on the governments behalf however we are concerned by the fact that the coverage of fiscal statistics in fund documents and programs varies across re gions the evenhandness of surveillance is questioned when we note that according to fad internal report more than 80 percent of latin american countries provide information on the nonfinancial public enterprise sector in contrast the operations of public enterprise s in middleeastern countries are not covered in the fiscal accounts and only 12 percent of the oecd countries provide this information similarly the coverage of fiscal targets in f und programs in latin america includes in over 70 percent of the cases nonfina ncial public sector figures this contrasts markedly with an average of nearly 20 percent in the universe of country programs and with the absence of nonfinancial public sector coverage in middle eastern countries if we are all to be measured by the same yardstick it would be required to develop indi cators for all members including all type of fiscal c ontingencies we call on management and staff to design plan that would guarantee that all membership is subject to the same scrutiny
