shsbc 46 control of attention lecture given on 18 august 1961 now youve given guilty conscience given guilty conscience now this is the what 18th of august and you are getting an extra lecture today but thats basically because of this burning fact youre not doing good thats the burning fact when worse auditing is done there will probably be people shot over it i hate to say something like that but when worse auditing is done around the world itll be done with brickbats or something of this sort now i dont wish to be unkind i dont wish to be unkind but i wish to be very very factual youre not auditing youre in games condition thats why youre not getting goals you couldnt possibly miss these things the way theyve been missed and this tells us about 90 percent of the auditors get into games condition over goals processing and that is the secret behind routine 3 and that is the data which has emerged they themselves have been so thoroughly suppressed in their goals and have been so smashed back into environments that they themselves did not want to be in that in the final analysis when they start to audit they do fine right up to the point where they start to run goals and terminals on somebody or something like that and then they go blooey and youve just got to do better job of auditing and youve just got to lay that games condition aside on the subject of goals now i was even thinking you could possibly get run back and forth little while what goal would you rather another didnt have or something like this and run the games condition on goals for little while till you got over this but this is the primary thing it isnt that youre flubbing technically particularly but it is just absolute nonsense man it is nonsense to have the second goal the pc ever gave you the proper goal now thats thats silly and then go on for five weeks looking for goal now thats already turned up here pc gives you terminal gives you terminal and the terminal is the right terminal and it falls so the next day the wording is changed on the terminal and it doesnt fall and thats washed out its called something else the next day by the auditor so of course it doesnt fall the other wording that it was changed to never fell anyhow ill give you an idea of it black cat fell so in the next auditing session the auditor takes up the thing and he says cat and it doesnt fall so he says well of course i havent found the terminal but checkover reveals that black cat was falling on on one day and cat wasnt falling on the next but black cat is still falling and black cat is the terminal now how else do you explain that than just say well the guy cant have terminal thats all now look i know basically theres certain terror in making clears i know its kind of spooky man kind of spooky i i myself get jolter once in while you know the records on clears are coming in here fairly rapidly and heres another clear you know and once in blue moon i find myself you know saying ahda ohoh ump you get the idea i mean just some little reactive flick and i laugh about it you know i say this is silly as hell see you can get reactive flip on this this type of thing you know and youre fairly sure now that youre on the right line and the only way you could stop making clears right now is just dont run the rudiments dont find the fellows goal and dont let him have his terminal and if you do that and audit it badly of course you wont have clear i think theres little bit of jolt connected with this now thats just my private opinion but dont think for moment i havent got confidence in you because i think if i just point out what youre doing what i think youre doing and if that fits the next time youre looking down the barrel of assessing somebody and so forth i think you will be able to just checkrein yourself little bit the way ive done you know you say well uh and all of sudden you realize wait minute i left that whole block of goals out hohohoho well now and get yourself by the scruff of the neck and put yourself back in the lineup and take up that block of goals and lets go over them lets go over them real carefully this is hard lines isnt it but lookahere if we have operated up to point where we can learn this then the time is not wasted let assure you the time is not wasted because ive been looking for what it is and the the long goals assessment and do you know that ive studied this just literally for months i looked over auditing records and reports and they all seem logical and there just doesnt seem to be single thing out but when i gave you raking over the coals on the subject and you got busy confirmed it thats it i mean right away you start finding some goals and terminals theyve been there all the time well now how do you account for that how do you account for it otherwise than the fact that there must be not not carelessness but there must be this little bit of unwillingness to find the goal and terminal you see theres just little bit of games condition going on here you get the idea because youre too bright otherwise to make these mistakes and you dont make these mistakes in runofthemill auditing see that goes along fine but on goals and terminals bang now of course suppressing somebody elses goal is the most natural thing in the world if youve got bug on being murdered if youve been murdered recently whats the goal of the murderer to kill you of course and what is your whole evasive action its actually fundamentally devoted to knocking out the goal of the murderer to kill you isnt that right so if you knock out the goal of the murderer to knock you off naturally he wont see so its almost livingness to suppress goals see theres whole classes of goals that one would just instinctively suppress you know wed instinctively suppress goal such as the secretary of state or the president of the united states is all of sudden going to sell out to russia wouldnt we well wed be horrified all right now lets look how far this could go are there whole classes of goals that could horrify us yeah well we must have lot of builtin modus operandi of suppression of unworthy or unwanted goals well now that easily slips over into suppression of goals suppression of goals suppression of terminals i dont think youre trying to suppress clears youd be proud as punch if you made clear but i think this instinctive this instinctive suppress the goal you know is standing right in your path with concrete blocks on this assessment because now i can tell you that from some data to hand here now that the terminals and goals did exist in the first part of the list they existed in the first part of the list how did you miss them how could they be missed now you can go ahead with an assessment if you were handling every incident that came up and you were crossquestioning and crisscrossing every incident that came up and you were checking the guy backwards and forwards and so forth all the way through and you were actually clearing this actually auditing him as you assessed him you know running notknow on every incident that came up and running notknow on what he doesnt know about the goal and what area he escaped the type of clearing i was describing about three days ago remember you could just plow the whole thing up and bring him out the other end clear too see you could do that but you arent doing that youre just running repeater technique and trying to find goal well if youre trying to find goal you can find one and its usually in the first dozen two dozen fifty hundred and fifty goals that the person gave you and as far as terminals are concerned its usually out of list of thirty thirty forty terminals its not hundreds of terminals thirty forty fifty something like that can be done and you can find it so therefore we must be letting our reactive minds get little bit in our road of clearing wouldnt you say must be just something on that order otherwise we wouldnt find goal on tuesday and on wednesday change the wording of it so that it didnt register and then say it doesnt exist got the idea we wouldnt let goal hang fire for four weeks or something like that before we suddenly said well i guess well have to let him have it after all but itd been there for that many weeks you see still registering well the idea of get more goals get more goals this is all fine this is all praiseworthy and so forth yes add to the goals list and perhaps your directions here are to some degree at fault i take full responsibility for that not having obviated them but you just dont need all of these goals you see in order to do goals assessment you you it yeah get your hidden goals and get your withheld goals and unknown goals and suppressed goals and and that sort of thing ask for these in your classification but when youve got about 150 goals written down there if you cant find goal amongst those that would stick you better turn in your emeter its just nonsense not to be able to now if you cleared up every reason he had each goal and went into it this way not with repeater technique but with notknow and found out what you know got the terminal for the goal and found out what he doesnt know about that type of valence you see and what area that valence would want to escape from and what goal you know just take up the whole thing with lots of notknows and just cover the whole thing oh yeah youd make clear that way too but youre not doing that youre doing it by repeater technique and repeater technique is simply to eliminate and leave us standing with goal that will register you should be able to do it in an afternoon on any pc that walks up the street so lets just rack back our sights here on what were supposed to be doing on the thing and we are not alone in this kind of mistake because the mistake has been made in australia and it has now been made in washington its not going to be made anymore see weve been making this mistake long time ive finally isolated the factors which are causing us to make this mistake and the factors which cause us to make the mistake is an expectancy of having to get all of the pcs goals before we find goal which of course isnt necessary at all or have to find all possible terminals before we find terminal to match the goal you see youre being just little bit too thorough little bit too rigorous here little bit too stretchy on the whole thing pc gets down to point where hes comm lagging on you for minute before he can give you another goal well hell youve got the list youve got everything on the list you want got the idea he cant think of any more he goes home and he does he he you say im going to do goals assessment on you tomorrow and you say make up list of goals write down all the goals you ever thought of and also the goals that you dont want anybody to know about write them all down and bring them in to take the list say are there any goals you didnt write down on this well not really and needle falls well what goal did you not write down on this well i purposely didnt write down the goal to burning every city i live in you know something like this write it down you know strip it down little bit you dont get any more action on the needle particularly for that moment thats it now you have his goals list now one of those goals is going to consistently fall that i guarantee if it is read out and phrased and so forth it will continue to fall otherwise your rudiments are out youve stopped the goal from falling by getting the rudiment out in some fashion or you erased it or youve invalidated it or youve just done lousy technical job in some fashion auditing perhaps to you might seem to be something that had enormous numbers of rules connected with it and as long as you think of auditing as having enormous numbers of rules you arent auditing these rules just serve as guideposts of one kind or another but back of those rules your good heart can carry the day you trying to help this fellow out all right there are certain things his mind will and wont do and if that is the basket of rules by which youre operating youre perfectly safe rather than basket of ritual and i call to your attention that every religious organization on the face of earth must have fall failed in its original representation to the multitude must have failed must have because they developed rituals never let the ritual get to be the thing now we can give you ritual which repetitively spoken gives you great ease of proceeding and you shouldnt depart from it particularly but it has value beyond making constancy of session thats all thats all the value that model session has it just gives you constant representation and it gives the pc little confidence because he isnt being asked these things in different ways and it also has the technical advantage of running out former sessions because youre using the same words repetitively by repeater technique the sessions never stick then if you always use the same bridges and that sort of thing you run out your own sessions so youre just doing two jobs in one its good piece of auditing but its value is greater than that it wont do anything it wont do anything its just standardization now lets look at what is happening here is what pc will not do and this is what you must learn in auditing pc will not go into session with his mind fixated his attention fixated on something else than what youre trying to do his attention is fixated on something now you are not going to be able to get him insession nor will you get his interest in the process you are running and dont be amazed if your pc is restless and you havent solved this point of concentrated attention now pc sits down and practically can scream at you sometimes and tell you my attention is definitely concentrated on the fire hydrant which is outside the front door hell warn you if you ask him all the rudiments are simply covered on something like this is your attention fixated on something is there any reason you wouldnt talk to and youve got all the rudiments your rudiments cover nothing else you could look in vain to find something else is your attention fixated on something is there any reason you wont talk to and if that was your rudiments that would be all right now as matter of fact however the questions are little broad they arent sufficiently particular and so you have the rudiments how many ways can his attention be fixed so as to stop session from occurring well it can actually only be fixed very few ways hes got present time problem of short duration or hes got present time problem of long duration now that would be fixation on the exterior environment and usually the short the long duration problem is fixation oon something subjective present time problems of short duration are fixed attention on the immediate environment and present time problems of long duration the present the attention is fixed on something in present time all right but its also been fixed on this thing for long time and its usually subjective so his attention is so fixed he can articulate this if you ask him hard his attention is so fixed that of course to do anything else than keep his attention fixed there would be painful to him so you get into trouble now theres the the primary sources of fixed attention present time problem of short duration present time problem of long duration under the heading of present time problem of short duration you get such matters is well i havent given the the housekeeper message i had for her and i have to sit here remembering that at the end of the session you see im supposed to give the housekeeper this particular message go you wont get any auditing done you got somebody whos sitting there saying well yes yes yes when did i eliminate king okay okay now i must remember to give the housekeeper the message you see all right well i eliminated king remember the housekeeper the message the king uh when did i eliminate housekeeper you get whats going on well youre not paralleling what the mind is doing and of course when you dont parallel what the mind is doing with auditing you of course fail with auditing naturally now the reason you fail might be interesting to you well take that up in moment lets take up the problem of long duration the fellows attention has been so consistently and so continually fixed upon this particular thing that at time can he get his attention really on anything else and he more or less knows about it its very close to the surface and it is very real to him and you could say it is the reality station for his attention everything else is sort of unreal and this is pretty real and it can be anything it can be sore eye you see it can be bad side it can be whether or not hes getting old you see what i mean its whether or not her beauty will be totally destroyed at long last you get the idea but its its be something here its something and its been going on for long time by long duration we mean this lifetime absolute maximum limit got the idea we as soon as we exceed this lifetime we have case that is the most flagrant of these now you very often find present time problem this gets confusing to pc because present time problem of long duration becomes case he finds out this has been going on for actually ages and he thought it had just been going on for the last few years and factually its been going on since ancient troy you get the idea something on the order of this is his going to disgrace him see this is his you know hes thinking about this all the time and he comes into session its quite its quite up on the surface usually if you were to ask him if he was worried about anything and crisscross it and really press it down does he go around worrying about something does he go around thinking about something all the time is there something that bothers him most of the time and he finally says well is my going to disgrace well yes as matter of fact and we assess this thing out handling it and we run it as button see and so help god it goes back to egypt and becomes ra the sun god and goes back into ancient and space opera and goes back to glare fights see sun all these things are all messed up one way or the other and it becomes case so present time problem of long duration can become case dont you see but ordinarily we say present time problem of long duration we have case or two of that going on right now i mean where the present time problem of long duration became the case but ordinarily its just the problem maximum duration is this lifettime something on the order of years certainly months absolute minimum is months now ill give you the reason for this the reason why you cant audit him with one of those things and it will become very plain to you you you wont make this mistake all the time supposing you were standing there looking at tree and you were engrossed in the beauties of this tree and somebody stuck pin in your back do you know that the pain of the pin thrust would be many times magnified by the violence of attention shift the rate of change of attention is way of defining pain relative relative pain is defined by rate of change of attention now if fellow walked up and he says its nice tree i think ill stick this pin in you youd turn around and youd have some defense against it and youd say dont do that or something like that but youre looking at the tree dont even know the fellow was behind you and he sticks the pin in you sudden sudden shift of attention from the tree to something painful and it makes that pin thrust feel like twoedged sword going in hiroshima going about its daily wartime activities and all of sudden theres loud bang and there is hiroshima you see attention shift and that was sufficiently violent that the people who were in the catastrophe had time for twenty minutes time did not exist for twenty minutes they just hung right there well it wasnt the violence of it it was the sudden shift the shift was so remarkably fast dont you see and the amount of attention shift and of course this shifted everybodys attention off all of his pt problems and all of his realities and of course shifted them onto something which was total unreality and sort of net result was we got time so we find that on the track sudden attention shifts is the common denominator of every hung point on the track its when somebodys attention changed not when his attention was on something it was when it changed you could put man in paradise and then consistently shift his attention rapidly and hell become very unhappy with paradise do you see sudden attention shifts thats thats the common denominator this is not something new in dianetics and scientology the first lecture on this is july american legion hall elizabeth new jersey 1950 not something new furthermore its not even really new with dianetics and scientology because locke and hume and some of the others have discussed attention but they never really discussed attention shift this is brandnew factor all right attention has always been known to be part of psychology up till 1879 and then actually was more or less dropped out of the lineup the psychologist does not pay much attention to attention thats mostly because hes in total dispersal of some kind or another its all unfixed attention he thinks now shifts of attention you are using processes which are sufficiently strong that regardless of what his attention is fixed on his attention can be yanked off of it and put on the subject of the process youre using highcaliber mental weapons see theyre very very high caliber so you can make up your mind to run process and sure enough that process will yank his attention but it lays the seed of the first arc break of the session because its painful hes worried about parking meters and you all of sudden get him worried about waterfalls hm duhduh duhdum theres point of confusion right there in the session now his attention doesnt totally come off of parking meters so his attention isnt totally on waterfalls so hes got parking meters and waterfalls all mixed up now and youve accomplished an identification for him which is interesting isnt it youve got new identification youre not auditing him downhill but you certainly arent giving him good session now that is true and mark this well of present time problem of short duration and present time problem of long duration and in neither one of these do you find any exceptions to the rule that your auditing must parallel what the mind is doing now you can go so far with this paralleling what the mind is doing that you start qandaing and not really handling whats there thats the other error you go too far with the parallel so that he says well ive had trouble with but you say youre having trouble with your family who in particular in your family are you having trouble with well im having trouble with my sister what trouble have you been having with your sister oh hes he says well its because of my brother and sister are always fighting and you say well have you been had objections to people fighting and then he says well not really except the police well do you have trouble with watching police fight except when theyre fighting with firemen well do you have trouble watching firemen fight well say that you at least got watching and trouble in there but youre just letting his mind go all round and round in dispersal you see hes still got the problem oddly enough that hes having trouble with his family only youre riding over the hills and far away you see youre actually pulling an attention shift on him youre not coping with what attention fixation he had youre now trying to pick up the attention dispersals see so youre not worrying about the present time problem youre going over the hills and far away thats what we call q and and i will lay down this rule and it is not rule so much as an observation i have never seen case progress unless the attention factor on the immediate environment whether of long duration or short duration was not handled first i have never seen it fail and i have never seen case fail to get some version of an arc break when this was done so the arc break always occurs when you dont pay attention to the attention factor all right there it is if you dont handle the present time problem of short duration the present time problem of long duration when doing auditing you are inevitably going to get an arc break and theres where arc breaks move in whats the arc break its sudden attention shift that is all i dont care whether it was done because of your error or because of what you were running or anything else its just sudden attention shift that is an arc break when you dont handle attention fixation you inevitably arrive with attention shift when you have attention sudden attention shift you get an arc break this is getting awfully elementary isnt it that is an arc break its an attention shift unpredicted unexpected attention shift therefore you flubbing an auditing command lays in little tiny arc break even though the pc says it isnt we dont care what the pc says must have been ah but theres much greater arc break then laid in when his attention is totally fixed upon trouble in the family and you are auditing egyptian waterfalls now the arc break is going to mount up and his confusion is going to get more and more and hes going to have to protest sooner or later and he protests in version of an arc break but this arc break turns up by you making little bit of flub you notice that the pc is restive and it makes you restive and so you give some kind of crossed up auditing command and he takes exception to it and then you knucklehead start to cure up this particular flub oh but that wasnt it it isnt anything you have done in the session except audit him with what youre auditing him with and therefore its almost impossible to cure it as an arc break what have i done to you what have you done to well it doesnt have anything to do with it because he hasnt really isnt really thinking in terms of technical difficulties and the technical difficulty is what he is objecting to but he doesnt know it so of course what has he done to you what has he withheld from you this isnt going to do very much dont yyou see youd have to run you on the prehav scale or something like that to get rid of this arc break because we have to get practically get rid of you because we havent remedied what the difficulty is and the difficulty is is weve given his attention one hell of yank and its still halfway on on the trouble in the family and weve got it halfway on trouble with waterwheels and he doesnt know which way is cooking sound familiar to you his attention is there and its there and its not there and its not there at the same time dont you see now youre going to run this as an arc break because you flubbed auditing commands well it isnt because you flubbed auditing commands its because you gave him an attention shift sudden attention shift and he doesnt know whats wrong and you dont find out and there we go so therefore people with chronic which is long duration present time problems or people with short duration present time problems get arc breaks in auditing sessions and they arc break in auditing sessions to the degree and with the frequency that they have attention fixations on problems which are not handled by the auditor seem real to you can you see this can you see this is this very plain all right now willing to talk to the auditor is the other one now of course pc with heavy arc break is not willing to talk to the auditor but also pc who does not want the auditor to know something is unwilling to talk to the auditor but when pc has withhold something new is occurring the pc is sitting in the middle of the session with known where he is and an unknown where the auditor is and so the auditing session is ridge hes got not hes got know the auditors got notknow on the same subject now in view of the fact that the pcs attention is fixated on this withhold even at lower level than than analytical inspection when we dont get it were guilty of auditing pc with an attention fix and it comes back to attention fixation so if we dont get off the withholds weve got pc with his attention fixed on something same thing isnt it make more sense they had marvelous luck and everybody on the course over in washington really learned to pull withholds and they made terrific case gains and everything was going along fine on on as far as this is concerned they really learned to do security checking and so on to that degree im very happy with them but of course theyd make case gains you can always make case gain with withhold fellows attention is totally fixed on fireplaces where he burned the baby you know fireplace fireplace fireplace now ive got to have my attention fixed on this but its little bit of complicated attention fix its an outfix with an inpull which of course is guaranteed to anchor it see hes got his attention fixed on it but it mustnt get out and it must be notknow everywhere else than where he is you see and you get what is known as guilt and it forms such tremendous part of catholic and freudian mental therapy guilt guilt complexes oh these are terribly important well what it is is an attention fix with the additional complication that its got to stay fixed to pull it in so it mustnt get out see its just little more complicated version of attention fix so you cant audit anybody with big withhold thats simple so it breaks down to the fact that you try auditing somebody with present time problem of short duration or present time problem of long duration or withhold and hes going to get arc breaks and youre going to have trouble in the session and that is all there is to it and the session is not going to run right and its going to go over the hills and far away and thats it and i dont care whether the pc says it is all right i dont care if the pc says he likes it i dont care whether the pc says this is perfectly all right he knows youre trying hard the basic mechanic of the whole thing still holds and down underneath all of this youre trying and its all right and so forth are the same forces of arc break building up those same forces are still building up it doesnt matter what the pc says this happens to be mental mechanic which takes priority over all postulating and everything else on the part of the pc so it doesnt matter what the pc thinks about your arc breaks or your auditing if this condition is there the pc could think you were wonderful auditor and make progress how fascinating now if youre very alert and youre very good at observation and youre very slippy one way or the other you notice the pcs wandering eye i do this accounts to marked degree for my auditing gains and their consistency is i see the pc sitting there and i see the pc looking into limbo as i ask this question or other and i want to know what the pcs looking at beneath the level of the eye socket pc isnt there i know it so i find out where the pc is it sometimes doesnt take more than few comments and few directions and something or other and his attention just slides very smoothly off of where its anchored and it comes over just exactly where i want it to and from that moment on why were in man were running you see and halfway through the session the pcs starting to go you know this way and that way and so forth lets find out where the devil hes gone to now got the idea hes gone somewhere its the goneness of the pc that you ought to be worrying about because you want the pc here you dont want him somewhere else that you dont know about its perfectly all right to have him elsewhere if youre putting his attention elsewhere thats perfectly all right put his attention all over the place as long as hes paralleling the auditing with his attention everything is going along fine and man will he come out the other end slick as newwashed baby but if his attention starts wandering over this way on the present time problem he had with aunt bertha oh you in trouble now youre in trouble because your auditing had nothing to do with anything that could ever reach aunt bertha now in running terminals you will find sometimes find this condition obtains and this is an interesting condition youre covering long long long line of track with this particular terminal and the pc was present and the terminal was present and the pc is seeing more than the terminal is seeing and there is more than that being embraced in the auditing command so theres lot of track stacking up that the pc isnt given any liberty to inspect of any kind whatsoever and that is why you run versions of alternate confront lets let him look at the rest of the track and get his attention off of it and the reason we use alternate confront of proper command please at the proper time youre trying to do it by emeters do it by the pc pc doesnt seem to be so interested just now in this particular terminal well his attentions gone someplace else thats all and what will put his attention right auditing will what auditing well alternate confronts the best cureall you know when it when his attention has done this on the long bank track you see on the long track when his attention has gone skittering and scattering and so forth youre running kings and hes gone galloping along the track and everything is fine and hes happy with you and hes cheerful and hes making gains and all of sudden then his eagle eye spots queen and you go on and ask some more questions about kings and queen queen queen you say whats going on well its nothing yeah but what is what is whats what have you been looking at there oh well man aha boy you know theres one advantage to being king its the very fine variety of queens that you can corral except sometimes and you say well what about this well there it is of course im not above saying something on the order of well all right whats this got to do with kings not challengingly but what is what does this have to do with kings oh its pretty bad overt against king if you steal his queen yeah haha yeah haha yeah yeah hes now back on the subject of kings because queens are now an overt against kings so hell go on and run the auditing command but youve spotted it and youve flicked his attention got the idea so youve kept him paralleling what you want him to do now cruder way to do it oh your attentions on queens huh all right well thats fine going to give you two more commands on kings and well end this process if thats all right with you okay what king have you eliminated thank you what king have you eliminated thank you very good anything you care to say before i end this process okay end of process if its all right with you were now going to run some alternate confront whatever version you have of confront just as long as its track version and you say all right look at the bank thank you look at the bank thank you look at the bank whatever it is look at the bank thank you look at the bank thank you and he says huhuhuhuhu and you say what was that oh he says these queens he says yeah haha boy thats really some way to get rid of king you know why you cave him in and break his heart and do this and that and so forth yeah yeah yeah we used to take them in the roman arena roman parades victory marches and that sort of thing why wed get the queen dragging along back of chariot or something like that when we hadnt captured the king and so on i guess it was sort of dirty trick and you say good fine all right look at the bank thank you look at the bank now if its all right with you ill give you two more commands of this and end this process okay look at the bank thank you look at the bank thank you anything you care to say before i end this process all right fine end of process okay were now going to run kings all right what king have you eliminated thank you what king have you eliminated thank you you got the idea all right distracting noises in an auditing room of course follow exactly this same pattern and you are total knucklehead if somebody drops wastebasket down the hail and you dont immediately assume that something has happened with the pc dont go into big brace of protectthepc go into an immediate inquiry to find out what happened assuming something did all right there are two ways to handle it this is relatively ineffectual but is the usual way to handle it did that noise out in the hail bother you all right number one that is wasted question we dont care whether it bothered him or didnt bother him it sure shifted his attention didnt it must have to some slight degree so we say something on the order of what were you thinking about when the noise happened this is much more effective process what were you thinking about when the noise happened oh he says soandso bzzt and you say what were you thinking about when the noise happened he says soandso all right you say thats good all right what were you thinking about when the noise happened what part of the auditing command were you answering when the noise happened oh soandso and soandso you know okay all right how does that noise seem to you now action on the meter you say all right and without any kind of kind of bridge you return to the process you assume that it did something you dont ask him if it did your pc is not your oracle knowing the mechanic of the thing those are rudiments and thats how she is cut thats the way the cookie crumbles thats the way the cake carves and the way the balloon goes up you are doing the oddity as an auditor of finding where the pcs attention is anchored and thereafter guiding the pcs attention and if the pcs attention isnt going where you want the pcs attention to go you arent auditing so that anything gets in your road of guiding the pcs attention you had better get rid of it now ill lay down another statement dont call it rule its just statement its an accusative its in the accusative tense anything that happens in an auditing session is the auditors fault even if the building burned down but that isnt totally what i mean if anything goes wrong in the auditing session it is never the pcs fault it is never the pcs fault lack of gain on the part of the pc is not the pcs fault the pc will only do in session what the auditor tells him to do or what the auditor doesnt tell him to do and if the auditor doesnt tell him to take his cottonpicking attention off of those gains in georgia in some gradient that is an acceptable gradient of course the session will go wrong if the auditor wants the pcs attention on boats in alaska you have to take the pcs attention off of things in order to put the pcs attention on things because you havent yourself put the pcs attention on the things it is stuck on as he comes into the session you are not quick to take responsibility for taking his attention off of those things you see thats what happens but if the pc has arc breaks if the pc doesnt make win if the pc doesnt get goal its the auditor man its nobody else and thats for d of p or for anybody else its just the auditor and thats for you you want to know what went wrong in the session well not from any part of the pc nothing went wrong from the pcs quarter you did something wrong thats all just as the pc must be at cause in his lifetime because you can put him in an auditing chair and erase his whole life he must have been at cause that whole life or you couldnt have just him there you can erase the traumas he has had with his mama and his papa and his cousins and sisters and aunts and employer without having his mama and his papa and his cousins and sisters and aunts and employer present in the auditing room and if it was their fault and if they had any bearing on ordering his life about and ruining him you actually realize that you would have to have them in the auditing room in order to clear pc do you realize that hed have to scrape them up from all the way back the last couple hundred trillion years and bring them all together in one lot someplace in order to accomplish any kind of case gain well this is not true you have one person there the pc and isnt it miraculous that by shifting his mind this way and that that he actually can get over this and that well therefore he must be cause on the whole track right but in an auditing session in an auditing session there is another cause and that is the auditor and the great oddity is that auditing works because it violates this other principle for the first time you are having an effect on pc in violation of the fact that the pc is cause over all effects wrap your mind around that one you really have learned lot so this has to be terribly clever on your part youve got to be very slippy because youre being cause in section of track on the pcs track and that you can do it and get away with it is miraculous that auditing can happen is utterly fantastic now the only way it can happen of course at all is if he has some willingness to do what you want him to do because he has to do it all you can do is basically you cant force it into existence you can suggest it into existence and he can take cause over it so his cause must still be there but your direction of his cause must therefore be acceptable to him otherwise he is longer cause over this section of track called an auditing session and if he isnt cause over that section of track called an auditing session of course he wont make any gain well how do we keep him cause on that section of track we simply audit him exclusively with his attention on the auditing session without his attention splintered up into this that and everything else around in the environment on present time problems of short or long duration and the arc breaks that resulted from your leaving his attention on it and also the withholds which he is keeping away from you and not communicating to you though all those things get in the road of this other thing he must actually willingly follow your auditing directions and he must have very clear view of what he is following otherwise he isnt cause over that section of track well if he isnt cause over that section of track nothing is going to happen on that section of track and hes going to make gain this should be very plain to you you assume probably wrongly that the pc is delicate or that you can do something to bitch him up and so forth yeah well the only thing you can do to pc is not give him win and the only way you can do that is not by controlling his attention or having his attention there to be controlled and the only way you can deprive him of win is violate his attention factors and the only only attention factor you can violate is having his attention on something else rather than the auditing command and if you violate that you dont get any wins you dont get any goals you dont get any terminals you dont get anything he sits there for twoandahalf hours and thats it why well because his attention wasnt on the auditing session now you can say auditing works but auditing in the absence of the pcs attention isnt auditing so noauditing doesnt work the pcs got to be there to be audited how do you get the pc there to be audited corral his attention how do you corral his attention keep your rudiments in how do you keep the rudiments in well you check them very carefully its not very hard you make far too much out of this business of auditing its too easy you know youre always overreaching with the difficulties of the thing its not that hard all you had to do was have the persons cooperation how do you get his cooperation well dont have his attention on something else while youre auditing him thats all all right if his attention is going to be on present time problem of long or short duration nah you havent got his attention now hell tell you all sorts of things theres all sorts of reasons and rationales he feels betrayed he sat down there to get some auditing whats auditing to him how is he defining auditing as he sits down in the chair well its to get over his headache thats auditing and he gives you goal he said well id like to get over my headache in this auditing session and you dont even give him any hope man you just write down that and you write down couple more goals and then you say do you have present time problem and then dont read the meter and and so forth and then you say well were going to go on auditing kings well the pc just went thataway you see his attention is over thataway and your commands are over thisaway and so an auditing situation doesnt exist so auditing is going to get done in that two and half hours and thats all there is to it and youre just plain lucky if you dont also have an arc break and this and that and the other thing during that session well now what does it take actually to get his attention on this thing well theres several things you can do you can just sit down and overtly handle the headache just just start saying well who had headache thank you who had headache thank you who had headache or what type of personnel has headaches thank you what type of personnel has headaches thank you how could what what type of person do you think would have that particular headache in what kind of an environment oh well what dont you know about that picture thank you what dont you know about that picture thank you what dont you know about that picture thank you what dont you know about that picture thank you what have you forgotten about the picture thank you what have you forgotten about the picture good and what dont you notknow about well what shouldnt be known about that picture thank you very much what shouldnt be known about that picture and he says what picture and you say that picture and he says oh well i can get it back and you say well how is it and he says fine and you say do you have headache i dont have headache that was pretty good and you say all right and you go on with the rest of the rudiments well boy does he know hes being audited why you found his attention where it was and you moved it over to where you wanted it thud bang you see now i can tell you that as far as im concerned there are missing weapons if you can run an engram with notknow if you can run an engram with notknow and forget and so forth and slippetybam without chewing all over on the thing you find the terminal of some kind or another and you find this and that and then you find this engram and the engram shows up and you kick the engram in the head not by taking up the personnel in the engram but just taking up the picture of the engram just taking up just exactly what it is blowing the thing moving it around on the track well if you can do this well for heavens sakes you could handle any auditing fixation of attention that was coming up dont you see hell say i have trouble with my family all the time well how long have you had trouble with your family ive had trouble with my family for years and years and years whens the first time you had trouble with your family okay lets date it oh all right thats fine thats fine oh they held you down poured boiling water over you well thats very interesting age of six good got picture oh god he says i sure got picture and you say well all right good all right what did you do well i kicked and screamed what did you do well i kicked and screamed this would be one way of doing it see all right what else happened around there oh i dont know exactly well good what dont you know about that picture thank you what dont you know about that picture what dont you know about the incident what dont you know about that that thing what you dont what dont you know about it what happened that you could never figure out well what dont you know about it what have you forgotten about it what have the other people forgotten about it what should they forget about it whod be guilty if you forgot about it you know boomboom play it on all sides from the middle all of sudden boom its gone you say all right thats dandy now now lets move into high gear here and lets take look at this trouble with your family now what what do you think about trouble with your family well i have trouble with my family what trouble do you have with your family well i have all sorts of trouble with my family or i did have i did have lot of trouble with my family yeah i can see how that hooks up matter of fact i would keep telling them all the time you know i keep telling them youre always getting in hot water yeah well what do you know about that well now how do you feel about trouble with your family right now well im not worried about trouble with the family all right well thats all right how do you feel about trouble with the family cranked up emeter see oh youre still having little more trouble what family is that oh well thats my own family you know ive always had my own family you know uh my my my wife and children all mixed up with my own hey you know theyre different you say well well what trouble are you having with the family well im not having any trouble with the family you say all right now do you think we can get down to session here bang here we go on the session you got the idea youre in the business of handling peoples attention and that consists of finding out where its fixed and putting it where you want it got it and gradually they came out of the woods and they find out they can put their attention anyplace they want to put it and there we go and were on our way thats about all there is to it and you get out of this rudiments and you get assessments and you get terminal assessments and you get all sorts of odds and ends and running on the prehav scale oh these are just methods of fixing and unfixing attention and thats about all there is to it in auditing but every time you violate auditing pc thinking his attention should be over here on spot x when his attention is actually on spot and you have assumed that his attention is on spot x without examining to find out whether or not its on spot you of course get all the evils of session first of them is progress next of them is arc breaks next of them is trust in the in the auditor you get all of these things one right after the other as you come right on up the line they all arise from this one cause and from other causes follow now knowing this knowing this you then can say vividly that anything that happens in an auditing session is the auditors fault anything bad that happens in the session must be the auditors fault why he didnt find out where the pcs attention was fixed and didnt get it over onto something else now ill tell you something else the earliest method of clearing 1947 48 49 was permissive highly highly highly permissive it was very delicate you it amounts to this repetitive auditing command what picture would it be safe for you to look at you know why it failed you know why it wasnt being done and why clearing was occurring by 1950 although my clears were not all that good they were not bad but do you know why in 1950 it suddenly blew up because i hadnt isolated this attention principle i hadnt isolated this attention principle so that i could articulate it to an auditor and it has taken roughly eleven years to be able to articulate this very thing and ive seen it occurring now and ive just had little example of the old style of clearing accidentally goot entered into in session and then the auditor violated the thing and i suddenly realized that all the old violations only ever summed up in just that one thing they kept giving him something to look at and the rule was that you couldnt give him anything to look at that was outside of his environment you could give him something to look at that was in his environment but you couldnt go any further than that you know you could get the picture of the last five seconds or something thats real safe and so forth the auditing command which accomplished that clearing is what picture would it be safe for you to look at good look at it see that kind of an approach and the violation was the violation was and why that type of clearing worked is everybody insisted on dictating what picture it was now the engram necessary to resolve the case was perfectly valid of course thats where his attentions fixed so you run it as picture but in tremendous numbers of cases we were running people who were not finding pictures safe to look at and so couldnt look at the engram necessary to resolve the case and that was it and there blew up clearing in 1950 but you could today take somebody have them sit down and say what picture would be safe for you to look at all right now look at it hed get it and youd say good now what picture would it be safe for you to look at good look at it just practically nothing else but that hed wind up at the other end long route now i had lot of little speedups that i used to use what sound would it be safe for you to hear what sound could i make see this is the violation of we mustnt give them something out of the immediate environment you see what sound could i make that it would be safe for you to hear or what sound could you make that it would be safe for you to hear and the fellow says swwwttt yeah thatd be safe swwwtt swwwtt thatd be safe and you say good make the sound swwwtt and youd say now close your eyes now do you get picture of the room good now can you hear the sound again oh thats what you want to do all right i cant well lets try it lets try some sound or another of some character and lets fish around until you can finally hear the sound again and you just went down the line of all the perceptics dont you see and you just educated him in with terribly tiny gradients youll find most people that dont get pictures are just stuck right up here in present time they must mustnt mustnt go into that area you know mustnt mustnt mustnt mustnt mustnt mustnt mustnt mustnt go into the area mustnt mustnt slide back mustnt slide back i dont have any pictures hahahaha i havent any pictures dont get any pictures as matter of fact i dont see anything hahahaha so on thats because one tiptoe down the track you see lies the battlefield but you can actually get them to look at these little pictures and look at facsimiles and whats it safe to look at and whats it safe to feel whats it safe to hear just go on down the line turn on all the perceptions one after the other what picture would it be safe to look at now good look at it so on it goes down the line down the line all of sudden hes looking at an engram you know not sure he likes that all right thats fine what part of that would be safe to look at the headsman hed be safe to look at youve got to look at him as matter of fact you cant do anything else hahahahaha and youd say good good good what would be safe to look at just creep through the thing you know the slow freight through arkansas you lick one engram hes got the next one licked already halflicked next thing you know youve accustomed him to his bank and familiarized himself with his bank and the reason clearing occurs is because this other attention problem therefore unbeknownst you see didnt materialize why the permissive approach always found where his attention was stuck the guys worried about the parking meter you said what picture would be safe for you to look at well the parking meter would be the picture he would get you see that is not very good nor very fast method of clearing but it mustnt be lost sight of as method of clearing very gradient very gentle very patient with pc never giving him lose trying to give him wins all the way along the line and it takes gentle kind of auditing which is and very smooth type of auditing which is almost impossible to teach but it works it works just as such now you work auditing today you say well much faster you say wheres your attention fixed bud youre running rudiments really but youre really saying wheres your attention fixed and what dont you want to talk to you about which is where your attention is fixed all right we know we got your attention all squared up and its taken us three sessions to get the attention all corralled we got present time problems of long duration we found terminal we found long terminals list that had to do with the sore shoulders dont you see and we got that worked out and we ran that and all of sudden his sore shoulder went away on the terminals assessment dont you see and we handled his longduration present time problem and we found there were three more longduration present time problems we found terminals that were likely to have those longduration present time problems we found one of those terminals stuck bit more than the others so we ran that on the prehay scale you know we did prehav assessment we ran that bit and we found out this was all straightening out and the fellow knows hes making progress his confidence is rising why youre corralling his attention and they gradually get all of his present time problems of long duration making sure that we handle the present time problems of short duration in the session we make sure that he doesnt get arc breaks and his attention gets stuck here and there keep the rudiments in in other words all the way along the line next thing you know why weve got guy that when we get him rolling on assessments and that sort of thing it is just bang you know its just nothing to it weve coaxed the pc into total sessioning if you take that kind of approach you cant lose the only the only that might be is that you get into bit of games condition with the pc over the subject of goals and terminals hes not going to have body and hes not going to have goal and you get into this kind of games condition with him well already you must have lost control of the pc to get into that kind of games condition i told you early in this lecture that i thought of tailoring up some processes to handle this games condition that isnt necessary the moment that you find out you actually can find where the persons attention is fixed and handle that attention and get it over to where you want it your idea of games with this pc goes because youve got the game now man and you feel pretty hot about being able to do something like that and if something goes wrong dont chalk it up dont chalk it up that you didnt hold your little pinky just right on the edge of the emeter that isnt the reason the session went awry session went awry because you missed somewhere on attention you just missed somewhere on the attention factors the attention factors went awry either you really were auditing this fellow with present time problem otherwise he wouldnt have gotten an arc break or something went astray here that you missed and now that youve got certainty onto what you missed youre not in in fog as to what will cause this sort of thing so auditing becomes much more certain activity to you try this sometime if you dont believe what i say here i mean if you have if you want to get good you believe iit all right but if you get subjective reality on it is what i meant to say pc says yow yow yow arc break you say at once what was your present time problem see this is not smooth you know the smoothest way is to say well yes i heard that yeah im sorry and then slide over and then look and get the rudiments in you see but just just for the hell of it sometime or another in the very near future pc gets an arc break ask him dont even mention the arc break say what was the present time problem hell give you an answer just like that just automatically right on the tip of his tongue well i came into this session i came into this session because i had pain in my chest thats well i i needed auditing today i had pain in my chest thats the first youve heard of it so you see you must have missed must have missed either you werent looking at the emeter or you didnt have the sensitivity up or something was there or your questions werent searching enough or you werent suspicious enough about this thing and basically it starts with your eagle eye didnt notice there was something different about this pc today that he seemed to have sort of wandering eye you know sat down and you say all right is it all right with you if i begin this session now and pc says yes and you say all right start of session and session started for you and the pc says not really oh well hell thats enough man whats it just told you its told you an encyclopediaful promptly and immediately youve been told the pc has present time problem because his attention is stuck elsewhere all right so you say what goals would you like to set for this session and he says well id like to get this pain in my chest fixed up and id like to get this and id like to get that and like something or other and something or other and something or other and then if you were to say after these two indicators do you have present time problem of course you say that formally and dont notice any fall oh wow is your emeter busted what is the question you should ask at that moment because youve already been told twice he has present time problem didnt get into session easily so his attention must be someplace gave you type of present time problem of long duration pain in his chest told you these two things now youre going to run something else you havent prayer of running anything else not prayer youve got to do attentionwrangling so mount ol paint and go out and round up the attention units for long time we said well we didnt handle chronic somatics basically we didnt handle chronic somatics because there was process by which you could rapidly handle chronic somatic well that was then this is now youve got processes that sure handle chronic somatics man you just just get terminals list on the chronic somatic and you normally would have handled it just as idiotically as that just get terminals list takes you maybe two hours to get terminals list utterly complete on the thing because boy is this the fellows got something that the medicos you know the medicos oil up their secretaries to write bills for hours you know its that serious disease and so on you know thered be between times of making out the bills why they actually do batteries of clinical tests you know and move him from hospital to hospital and specialist to specialist you know hes got cancer of the lumbosis compounded with felony and you say well thats just too much for that isnt too much for you because he couldnt have it hes thetan in the first place it takes valence to get that complicated mishmash of sensation well if it takes valence to get that much mishmash of sensation hes obviously in valence so obviously just terminals assessment on chronic lumbosis of the cancer with felony would be absolutely adequate youll find people with that exact sickness back on the track and youll find him knocking their heads in too and you take these people in leper colonies so theyve got leprosy if you were to say all right give an who had leprosy what sort of person would have leprosy oh this sort of person all right and how would you describe that person you write it down what other person would have leprosy and leprosy and leprosy and youd find probably gomez sitting amongst them you see ol gomez was very thorough he was whats known as they have antibiotics but he was an antileprotic and gomez as dictator of venezuela decided he was tired of leprosy in venezuela so he hired two riverboats and he told all the lepers in the country that they were going to be moved down the river to wonderful paradise and going to be given huge grants of land and he had everything up around and they all walked aboard singing hymns and hallelujah and he got every cockeyed leper anybody who had even had white spot on him you know he got them all out in the middle of the river in these two riverboats and then the boys on the bank pushed the plunger on the dynamite that was the end of leprosy in venezuela but i hesitate to say that it was the end of it for gomez hes real cute now theres man with nice package of psychosomatics he used to take anybody he suspected that was being against his regime and hang them up by their genitals from hooks which i consider one of the worst activities he not only did that but he would hang them up in dungeons below water at below tide level so that the water would seep in trickle by trickle by trickle by trickle you see man that guys going to have chronic somatics he was boy he was boy anyway you was just start getting things like that youre running guy like that you see and all of sudden why he doesnt know what it has to do with lepers but boats im just spectator here hed say im on the bank and seems to be couple of boats blowing up out there nothing to do with well anyway lets get back to the session and you say well he said it had nothing to do with him so we wont pay too much attention to it and well go on here little bit further and so on you dont even bother to ask him if hes got another picture now and all of sudden you notice this wander in his eye you know if you then woke up to point of asking him what he was doing well its these boats well what about those boats well i just they just seem to be stuck and thats funny because you see i was just just spectator here on the river i can see im im an indian you know i mean lowcaste person that wouldnt have anything whatsoever to do with blowing up boats and there are these boats blowing up out there isnt that peculiar and it just seems to worry somehow i dont know why but it just seems to well of course you about that time you should cut loose with something like forget and notknow and so on and irresponsibility flies off and he says oh god yeah thats what i did well i think it was good thing to do and he goes through all of the ramifications of the thing and all of sudden the thing blows and couple of days later the doctors come by to slop oil on him and they say what happened to you you know well hes had miracle cure hes had miracle cure well you get the idea you get the idea well now we couldnt handle chronic somatics rapidly in the middle fifties so you had lot of stuff out about dont handle them well of course every time an auditor handled them hed foul up one way or the other so wed say dont handle them all right well thats changed thats changed youre making clears youre making high progress and you have things that can handle them and do handle them this time you got good subjective reality on doing so because i tell you youre not going to run somebody with hidden standard which is always present time problem of long duration hidden standard is always present time problem of long duration you say what would have to happen for you to know that auditing was working hed say well the top of my head would have to stop going up and down up and down and when it stops i know auditing is working and when it doesnt stop then i know auditing isnt you see and thats the way its auditing is working you say how long have you had the top of your head going up and down well ever since i was little boy i can remember the top of my head going up and down you say well thats dandy whose top of whose head went up and down and you start making terminals list you get some pictures you shake it out you handle it by terminals you handle it by pictures and youve got it made now your case is going to make some progress why well although his doesnt appear so actually every time he sits down in chair in conversation much less session he knows the conversations going well because the top of his head isnt going up and down he knows the conversations going badly because the top of his head is he knows he should make the deal because the top of his head is going is not going up and down dont you see hell use it as all kinds of barometers he knows whos going to win the election because when he hears the name mcmillian the top of his head doesnt go up and down these things are fantastic you know and you go researching into them you find out what the score is on it all right well ive given you friday lecture but it is very much to the point you can plow right on and now ill give you the rest of it which is simply this that if you have not now found the goal in the first fifty to hundred and fifty goals or youve not found the terminal in the first thirty or forty terminals given to you by the pc then you are auditing somebody who has rudiments out by which i mean present time problem of short duration probably not present time problem of long duration indubitably so and you will have to handle it before that case makes another single budge forward hes not in any kind of case to be audited at all youd have to youd have to come down on him with terrible crash to get anything even vaguely resembling stable attention on goals when his whole goal is to keep the top of his head from going up and down only he hasnt mentioned it to you on the goals list and you havent been searching enough to ask for it you got it so when you get rudiments in get them in with crash and when rudiments turn up that youve got present time problem of long duration staring you in the teeth well for heavens sakes sail into it man youve got the weapons youve got the tools youve got the armor plate well lets go okay all right now do you feel terribly crushed and abashed because ive been talking to you so accusatively its all right then youll still be able to sleep over the weekend all right well thats okay but dont sleep over your preclears thank you very much xmpbodyhtml
