opening of the 107th congress summary passage in july 1998 of the irs restructuring and reform act hr 2676 pl105206 required number of significant changes in the way the service operates as well as fundamental change in its culture after two years of intensive work irs is well along in the process of converting itself to userfriendly institution which is one of the most difficult tasks the restructuring act rra requires of it the rra was based fundamentally on the report of the national commission on restructuring the internal revenue service this commission was created by congress in its fy1996 appropriations legislation pl10 452 and funded for 15 months the report of the commission vision for new irs recommended the establishment of an irs oversight board change in the organizational structure of the service and the encouragemen t of increased electronic filing but it especially recommended intensified training for staff and more access to them for the public the service has comple ted most of the requirements of the rra the geographic structure of the agency has been change d to functional one the oversight board is in place list of 71 taxpayer protections and rights are being applied although with difficulty in some cases particularly in the case of relief for innocent spouses the office of the taxpayer advocate has opened the irs door to negotiation of those tax obligations that impose hardship irs staff has been assured that the sanctions for taxpayer abuse will not resul t in their removal unless they commit illegal acts willfully the intent of this assurance was to prevent employees from being inhibited in doing their jobs for fear of loss of employment electronic filing is growing in acceptance among individual filers but slowly the matching grants for lowincome tax clinics reached the cap of 6 million in 2001 the century date change y2k was handled without incident supported by an appropriation of 13 billion specifically for that purpose the joint committee on taxation has completed complexity analyses on 10 bills since passage of rra and is preparing report on the general complexity of the tax code some projects however will require more time to reach completion planning for any program is based on agency assumptions about how much funding it is likely to receive the commission on restructuring recommended that funding be appropriated for the irs every three years to make advance planning possible but congress has taken action on this issue the problem which 10 years ago precipitated the journey toward the restructuring lawinadequate computer technologyremains problem for the agency although work is in progress to replace the least useful computers perhaps the most urgent initiative underway at irs is training every initiative taken under rra requires retraining of experienced staff and new training for newcomers the public and tax preparers this report will not be

and reform at the opening of the 107th congress events leading to passage of the restructuring and reform act series of landmark events led to passage of the irs restructuring and reform act of 1998 pl 105206 first in the early 1990s congress recognized that the 1960s era computers the irs was using were out of date and voted funding to replace them the irs spent 4 billion on computers that were not geared to interact because the service had neglected to develop an overall design that would enable it to use new computers to their full capacity1 members of congress who were responsible for oversight of the irs were upset about the wasted resources second monitoring of irs activity by the general accounting office gao by request of congressional members and committees generated more than 40 gao reports between 1991 and 1997 that were critical of irs management procedures and performance third taxpayers complained about the difficulty of reaching an irs adviser by telephone about rude treatment by irs staff and about the burden placed on them by the tax compliance measurement program tcmp if they were selected for the random audit those who were selected were required to provide documentation for every entry in their most recent tax returns in response to the outrage expressed by some subjects of tcmp audit congress eliminated the funding for the program in the fy1996 appropriation leaving the internal revenue servic without even potential means of measuring compliance2 the national commission on restructuring the internal revenue service in the summer of 1995 as

sufficient information to make informed decisions about tax administration and policy new board of directors to serve staggered fiveyear terms appointed by the president with senate confirmati on and reporting directly to him would provide executive branch oversight and continuity to the irs the board would not intercede in matters of tax law tax enforcement or tax legislation the commissioner of internal revenue should be appointed for fiveyear term and should have greater flexibility in hiring firing and salary decisions the irs should receive stable funding for the next three years to facilitate planning the irs must address training operations technology culture and taxpayer education if the irs is to operate efficiently and with customer focus the irs must update its technology and treat taxpayer information as strategic asset to improve customer service and compliance the irs must develop strategic plan to make electronic filing the preferred and most conve nient means of filing for the majority of taxpayers within the next 10 years steps should be taken to improve taxpaye rs ability to recover damages for wrongful actions by the agency and considerable effort should

subsequent investigations by the treasury inspector general for tax administ ration tigta and by the gao 7 found the abuse charges alleged by the witnesses to be unsubstantiated according to press reports8 many members were appalled by the testimony however determination among them that irs agents must treat taxpayer s with respect led to the addition to hr 2676 of strong protections for taxpayers these included 71 taxpayer protection and rights provisions declaration that willful abuse of taxpayers will be cause for dismissal sec 1203 and creation of tigta to investigate abuses by irs personnel in addition rra enlarged and extended the power of the office of the taxpayer advocate on july 1998 president clinton approved the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act

12ibidthis law would give the american people the irs they deserve9 but he also stated that clearly there is more to do to build an irs for the 21st century10 major componen ts of the legislation to restructure and reform the irs pl 105206 rra consists of 11 major components first the rra changed the administrative structure of the irs from geographic structure based on regions to functional structure based on the differing characteristics of the various classes of taxpayers second the law created an irs oversight board whose duties include reviewing the budget and formulating longterm strategies for the irs the board is composed of nine members of whom six must be private life members these six are appointed by the presid ent with the advice and consent of the senate to serve staggered fiveyear terms of the remaining three members one is an employee spokesperson another the secretary of the treasury and third is the irs commissioner board members must submit financial disclosure reports and may never intervene on behalf of any taxpayer the board meets twice monthly and members are paid 30000 annually11 third subsection b of section 1203 of the rra specified 10

as to whether termination is appropriate or some other personnel action should be taken13 fourth the rra expands taxpayer protection and rights of which 71 are spelled out intended to give the taxpayer firmer and clearer foundation on which to defend himself against irs charges of noncompliance the rights and protections include the following the provision on burden of proof cancels the presumption that the irs is always correct in its determinations and under certain specific conditions places the burden of proof upon the service the cap on small claims in the tax court is raised from 10000 to 50000 civil damages up to 1 million may be awarded to taxpayer who is wrongfully financially injured by the irs the threeyear time limit on claiming refunds is suspended if the taxpayer is disabled during that periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30899crs6 suspension of interest and penalties if the irs fails to notify the taxpayer that payment is overdue due process must be observed in irs collection actions including liens and levies taxpayer communication with person authorized to deal with the irs such as an accountant may be held as privileged tax bills may be reduced through offer sincompromise which the irs is required to offer to any delinquent taxpayer and which are subject to negotiation relief for innocent spouses is made more widely available than in the past elimination of the interest differential on overlapping periods of interest on tax overpayments and underpayments fifth the taxpayer advocate management position created in 1996 by the taxpayer bill of rights 2 became more powerful office previously the advocates primary duty was to collect information about reoccurring tax collection problems for publication in required june report to be submitted to the house committee on ways and means and the senate committee on finance since the passage of rra the taxpayer advocate has additional responsibilities he or she is now required to appoint and train taxpayer advocate for each americ an state all of whom will report directly and only to the washington office the advocate also now serves as the final appeal official in the irs with the power to issue taxpayer assistance order tao to reduce or restructure payments due from taxpayer if he believes the requirements made of the taxpayer will cause significant hardship for the taxpayers family the advocate must continue to evaluate problems that come before him creating prioritized list of the 20 most serious problems to present to an annual joint meeting of the tax writing committees the oversigh t committees and the appropriations subcommittees for the treasury under the sponsorship of the joint committee on taxation sixth the rra created new position the treasury inspector general for tax administration tigta its main function is to guard against internal malfeasance but it also watches for external threats to the integrity of the service the tigta must appoint deputy inspector general for inspections and one for auditing sevent h the rra examined irs performance flexibilities this section of contains the provision that prohibits supervisors from using enforcement actions or dollar goals as criteria for evaluating the performance of employees in addition the commissioner under this section has critical pay authority to hire up to 40 individuals who have rare but critical technical skills paying them above the federal scale in amounts that are not more than the 186300 salary of the vice president eighth the issue of electronic filing was examined the irs has been described as drowning in paper with the goal of having 80 of tax forms filed electronically by 2007 the secretary of the treasury is required by rra to devise strategic planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30899crs7 to eliminate barriers to filing electronically and to keep the business of filing competitive he must also assemble an electronic commerce advisory group who will aid the commissioner and congress by advising on methods for keeping filing services private and competitive ninth the rra established matching grants up to 100000 each for law clinics for the poor and nonenglish speaking taxpayers the clinics must be attached to accredited law schools or schools of accoun ting the grants may total up to 6 million each year tenth the rra required that the records of the administration of the irs be made available to the national archives upon written request of the archivist in order that determination may be made as to which records should be retained and which destroyed eleventh the joint committee on taxation is required to undertake complexity analysis of any new law under consideration in committee that will substantially affect individuals or small businesses each analysis is to be delivered to the house ways and means and senate finance committees for inclusion in their committee reports or conference report on the bill under consideration which requirements of the law have been met the first change required by the law is that the service be organizationally restructured the formerly geographic structure of the service which had been in effect since 1952 was required to be changed instead of being divided into regional offices the new structure provides four national divisions that ultimately report to washington this is intended to reduce the layers of management as well as points of entry for taxpayers the four divisions are the wage and investment division led by commissioner john dalrymple and deputy commissioner john duder the wage and investment division serves those taxpayers whose income comes from wages and returns on savin gs the division serves about 90 million filers who represent 115 million taxpayers this is the largest group of taxpayers and the group owing to withholding from wages who have traditionally had the best compliance record according to the irs the small business selfemployed division led by commissioner joseph kehoe and deputy commis sioner dale hart this division serves 40 million taxpayers who are fully or partially selfemployed or are small businesses with assets less than 5 million according to irs this group of taxpayers has the lowest compliance rate because there are records of its earnings except those that they themselves keep and because nothing is withheld from their incomes this group of taxpayers has larger package of forms to file in fulfillme nt of more complex laws that apply to this group one goal of the division is to support the task of form preparation by sending out educational materials working with tax practitioners and offering personal advice to filers at regional and local walkin service officeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30899crs8 14us congress report of the joint committee on taxation relating to the internal revenue service as required by the irs reform and restructuring act of 1998

timeconsuming than expected the restructuring law which was signed by the president on july 22 1998 required the list of nominees to be sent to the senate by january 22 1999 however the members of the board were not sworn in until september 29 2000 the members of the oversight board have wide range of expertise including government budget and procurement matters the needs of small business and large corporations customer service debtor and creditor law technology management and the representation of irs employees14 the members are chairman larry r levitan former partner arthur andersen

government with the interests of the taxpayer15 taken together with the provisions defining taxpayer protections and rights the 10 conditions for dismissal give the rra an unambiguously serious tone one negative result of the new policy came about when in 1999 collections officers were faced with the prohibitions against abusing taxpayers while they were still unsure how serious the service would prove to be about omitting revenue statistics from staff evaluation although the fear engendered by section 1203 was somewh at mitigated by commissioner rossottis repeated clear statement that the prohibited behavior would incur dismissal only if it was willful and not simply misjudgment or misunderstanding many enforcement officers feared losing their jobs and in the year 1999 revenues from enforcement dropped steeply16 taxpayer prote ction and rights of the 71 new or modified taxpayer protection and rights provisions guaranteed to taxpayers by the rra the provision broadening the requirements for relief for innocent spouses seems to be the one the irs is finding most difficult to implement either fully or quickly17 the reasons are first that the administrative process the irs used to implement the old innocent spouse provision had to be reorganized very quickly to deal with the entirely new requirements of rra the provisions of the new law are more numerous more complex and because of required waiting periods take longer to implement for example meeting the requirements of the new law requires that the irs contact the spouse accused of error giving him or her 45 days to reply and then weigh the differences in the testimony of the two separated or divorced spouses to date more than 94 of the claims received are for pre1998 tax years in 1998 the news that congress might pass liberalized innocent spouse law gave hope to so many people that four months before passage of the lawa period in which the neither the exact provisions of the law were known nor whether any law would be passed3000 requests for consideration had reached the irs six months after passage as of february 2000 the irs had received total of 63906 requests and is now receiving on average 2800 new requests per month18 office of the taxpayer advocate and taxpayer assistance orders section 1102 the office of the taxpayer advocate grew from 1976 program in the irs called the problem

irs staff the tigta is also responsible for the security of irs computer systems and for inhouse audits its first major task was to investigate allegations of irregularities carried out by irs enforcement agents that were made in the senate finance committee hearings immediately preceding passage of the rra according to tigta and the gao none of the allegations made in the hearing could be substantiated19 between november 1999 and may 2000 the tigta issued 47 final audit reports of irs departments and investigated over 1600 allegations of criminal wrongdoing and administrative misconduct tigta reported in its semiannual report that irs is not in full compliance with rra in that some supervisors 96 were reported to have used enforcement results in employee evaluations the

discussion of electronic tax administration issues supporting the goal of encouraging taxpayers to communicate electronically with the irs the new committee members are all executives from the taxfiling community who cannot only give technical advise but also help ensure that the systems for filing electronically can be contributed to by multiple companies who will be in competition for the

onehalf of one percent in fiscal year 2000 irs commissioner rossotti expressed concern about the decline in the audit rate rossotti blamed the drop in exam and collection activity on several factors includi ng the longterm decline in staffing the need to assign compliance staff to customer service duties during the filing season and added responsibilities brought on as result of the internal
