time of the aid agreement perform or actively promote abortion as method of family planning or provide financial assistance to any ngo that engages in such activities foreign organization that was direct recipient of usaid grants such as international planned parenthood london ippflondon was required to make the same certification these same conditions however did not apply to aid provided

and family planning international assistance three court challenges in the late 1980s to reverse the policy failed administration officials said that there would be reduction in the us commitment to international family planning efforts that money withheld from ippf and other groups would be redirected to those that complied with the policy that appears to have been the case to some extent although specific documentation exists critics expressed concern not only about the amount of money available but also about the loss of quality providers that resulted from the mexico city policy 1990 study commissioned by usaid found that recipients and subrecipients of us family planning grants had fully complied with the mexico city policy they also concluded that subrecipients did not adequately understand the fine points of the contract clauses and applied unnecessary restrictions on their operations this was due primarily to deliberate application of excessive restrictions in

it became known required all nongovernmental organizations ngos that received population assistance grants from the united states to agree that they would not perform or activ ely promote abortion as method of family planning in other countries the policy which continued through early 1993 when president clinton removed it was highly controversial and resulted in several failed attempts by members

rescinding the 1993 memorandum from president clinton and directing the administrator to reinstate in full all of the requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 1993 president bush further said that it was his conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion either here or abroad1 separate statement from the presidents press secretary stated that president bush was committed to maintaining the 425 million funding level for population assistance because he know s that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services the press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions do not limit organizations from treating

population assistance under the 1973 helms amendment6 us aid could be used directly to pay for the performance of an abortion as method of family planning or for involuntary sterilizations recipients of usaid grants however could use their own funds to engage in abortionrelated activities but were required to maintain segregated accounts for us money in order to show evidence they were in compliance with the abortion restrictions at the august 1984 international conference on population held in mexico city the united states unveiled broad new policy position on population and family planning assistance including more restrictive conditions relating to abortions according to the new policy usaid would terminate support to ngos which perform or actively promote abortion as method of family planning in foreign countries irrespective of whether such activities were funded with money from non us sources although these restrictions did not apply to family planning aid provided directly to foreign governments in countries where abortion was legal usaid would make contributions to governments in those countries through segregated accounts to ensure the funds would not be used for abortions these new restrictions became known as the mexico city policy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30830crs4 7 prohibited abortionrelated activities included funding for 1 procurement or distribution of equipment intended to be used for inducing abortions as method of family planning 2 special fees or incentives to women to coerce or motivate them to have abortions 3 payments to

clauses that would be included in each new grant agreement with coop erating agency ca also referred to as direct recipient or grantee7 the restrictive mexico city clauses actually applied only to foreign ngos which received usaid population funds either as direct recipient or as subrecipient receiving grants through an amer ican ngo recipient under terms of the clauses us cooperating agency had to agree not to provide any usaid funds to foreign ngo as subgrantee unless the foreign ngo certified in writing that it did not and would not during the time of the aid agreement perform or actively promote abortion as method of family planning or provide financial assistance to any ngo that engaged in such activities foreign organization that was direct recipient of usaid grants such as international planned parenthood london ippflondon was required to make the same certification that it did not and would not during the period of the agreement perform or actively promote abortion as method of family planning american ngos that were the direct recipients of usaid population grants however were not required to make similar certifications regar ding their own abortionrelated activities as had been the case under the helms amendment they could perform or promote abortions so long as they used money from nonu s sources according to critics of the mexico city policy us government lawyers had advised policymakers that requirements for american ngos to make the certifications required of foreign ngos would almost certainly be challenged successfully in the courts on constitutional grounds as violation of free speech8 these us ngos however were required to monitor the use of the money and to terminate the subgrant to foreign ngo if the terms of the mexico city clauses were violated the mexico city clauses further did not restrict grants to foreign governments in the same way as funds for foreign ngos causing many critics to charge inconsistency in the new us policy as noted above usaid could disburse funds for family planning programs in countries where abortion was legal and managed by foreign governments or governmentsponsored entities if the grants

nation9 although many major american cas protested the inclusion of the mexico city clauses in new agreements most reluctantly signed in order to remain eligible for us funding10 how many foreign ngos refused to sign the clauses however is unclear ippflondon as direct foreign recipient of usaid grants averaging 1112 million annually was the most widely publicized group that did not sign the clauses and became ineligible for further funding in early 1985 although ippflondon strongly opposed the mexico city policy its officials stated that even if they wanted to the organization could not have complied with the clauses as federation of autonomous family planning associations the ippflondon constitution barred the central organization from setting service policies for its independent associations when the new mexico city restrictions were applied ippflondon said its abortion related work involved about 400000 or 077 of its entire budget11 because it was the responsibility of the american recipient and not usaid to obtain the certification from its foreign subgrantee usaid in most cases did not have direct knowledge of other possible foreign ngos that refused to comply with the mexico city clauses usaid administrator peter mcpherson told house panel in 1986 that in addition to ippflondon there were few other cases of foreign organizations that would not make the necessary certification sos brazilian subgrantee for the pathfinder fund was the only organiz ation he could cite by name12 although it remains unclear how many foreign ngos did not sign the mexico

association for voluntary surgical contraception and by ppfa in may 1983 prior to the mexico city policy fpia had signed cooperative agreement with usaid that extended through december 1987 period in which the organization received about 14 million annually from usaid because of its newly signed agreement in 1983 fpia did not face the requirement to abide by the mexico city clauses until it negotiated new cooperative agreement with usaid in the meantime ppfa filed suit against usaid charging violations of federal statutes and the constitution district court dismissed the legal challenge but court of appeals subsequently ruled that the case did in fact raise constitutional issues and referred it back to the district court the appeals court further directed usaid and ppfa to negotiate new grant agreement excluding the mexico city clauses that would continue in effect until the case was settled as result fpia received usaid funds ranging annually from 47 million to 94 million through fy1990 without application of mexico city see table 1 below when the court rejected ppfas constitutional claims in september 1990 usaid terminated fpias eligibility for population funds14 reallocation of funds withheld because of mexico city us officials asserted that whatever funds were denied or withheld from organizations not willing to sign the mexico city clauses would be reallocated to other family planning programs in other words there would be reduction in the us commitment and amount of funding for international population assistance at the time ippflondon lost its eligibility for usaid funds in early 1985 the agency had anticipated obligating 115 million in fy1985 under its grant agreement with the organization in addition ippflondon had expected to obtain contracts from usaid of 5 million in family planning commodities this combined 165 million represented roughly 25 of ippflondons total budget while the commodities eventually were delivered ippflondon lost the 115 million grant funds usaid said it would redirect to other family planning programs administered through new intermediary relationships usaid administrator mcpherson further said that as result of the reprogramming african countries would receive about 1 million more in family planning aid from the united states than if ippflondon had administered the funds15 in addition usaid withheld 10 million of the earmarked 46 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30830crs7 16 unfpa lost the 10 million not because the administration determined that it performed or promoted abortions in viola tion of the mexico city policy but because it continued operations in china many believed that the chinese government applied coercive family planning practices and us officials said that any

diverted for other development programs close examination of usaid congressional justification documents showing propo sed population aid obligations for fy1985 drafted in early 1984 prior to mexico city and actual obligation amounts that appeared in the fy1987 congressional presentation prepared in early 1986 indicate there were several significant increases among usaid population projects and grants to selected organizations issued by the agencys central population office the pathfinder fund for example received 12 million in fy1985 compared with 7 million estimate projected by usaid in early 1984 family health international received 87 million rather than the 64 million originally requested for fy1985 usaid obligated 139 million for fpia in fy1985 up from the 128 million proposed earlier the population council received 58 million rather than the 34 million requested usaid further obligated funds in fy1985 for about five projects that were not among those listed in its fy1985 congressional presentation including 23 million for natural family planning 35 million for family planning management training and 5 million for expansion and impro vement of family planning programs18 usaid sent to congress number of congressional notifications cns in march and june 1985 informing lawmakers of population aid projects including those noted above that woul d receive obligations exceeding the amounts originally justified in early 1984 although the timing of these cns coincided with the period during which usaid said it was maki ng decisions on how to reprogram funds withheld from ippflondon and unfpa factors other than the mexico city restrictions apparently played role in agency decisions to increase obligations for certain population projects and organizations congress for example appropriated 290 million for population assistance in fy1985 40 million more than usaid requested this required the agency to obligate funds it had not sought or previously justified to congress moreover reprogrammings and the submission of congressionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30830crs8 notifications are routine actions frequently taken by usaid for its development assistance programs as the agency adjusts its current year activities to changing circumstances that have emerged during the 1218 months since submitting its congressional presentation although there appear to be means to precisely document the shifts in funding allocations during fy1985 the increases for projects and organizations noted above most likely resulted from combination of congressional addons for population aid routine adjustments made by usaid in the distribution of its new appropriation and additional funds that became available because of the mexico city

charged that in fact the administration was cutting family planning funds after the mexico city policy went into effect although funding fell to 250 million in fy1986 and to 235 million in fy1987 it came at time of overall foreign aid reductions following enactment of the grammrudmanhollings deficit reduction plan moreover usaid had requested 250 million for each year level reduced by congress in fy1987 possibly to accommodate tripling to 75 million of funding for child survival programs at time of intense budget reduction pressure despite the appropriation reductions population aid as proportion of usaid development assistance spending remained at 163 in fy1986 about the same share family planning programs received during the early 1980s for other mexico city critics the issue was not one of funding levels but of the quality of implementing organizations to them the mexico city restrictions excluded the most experienced and effective international family planning ngos sharon camp of the population crisis committe for example told senate committee that ippflondon was not just one of many private intermediaries used by usaid but represented the worldwide network of indigenous national family planning associations19 monitoring and oversight of mexico city policy in addition to the normal oversight tools available to usaid for monitoring effective and appropriate program implementation by its recipients and subrecipients the mexico city clauses afforded agency officials additional means for scrutinizing the work of its family planning grantees the clauses permitted usaid to inspect foreign subrecipient documents observe and discuss with their staff their family planning activities and review audited financial statements if usaid had reasonable cause to believe that foreign subrecipient had violated the prohibition on performing or promoting abortions officials could inspect appropriate books and records of the subrecipient usaid further could ask recipients to take additional steps to verify the certification that subrecipients were not engaged in abortion work finally agency officials could undertake an independent investigation in the community served by subrecipient to ascertain whether the group performed or promoted abortion as method of family planning it appears however that usaid monitored these programs in routine manner similar to its other agreements making little use of the additional oversight tools for managing family planning programs between 1985 and 1993 assistant administrator richard bissell told house panel in 1989 that he did not believe that agency oversight was especially rigorous20 likewise faye wattleton of planned parenthood testif ied that usaid had never contacted ppfa regarding any concerns over violations of the mexico city clauses agency officials familiar with mexico city policy implementation also do not recall any special or extraordinary procedures taken by usaid to monitor adherence by recipients or subrecipients to the restrictionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30830crs10 21 mexico city policy imple mentation study by john blane and matthew friedman population technical assistance project occasional paper 5 nov 21 1990 22 the effect of the mexico city policy on international family planning op cit p 119 23 prepared by the population crisis committee under the sponsorship of usaids office of populationusaid however commissioned and published report mexico city policy implementation study21 in 1990 to examine what impact the mexico city restrictions might be having on agencyfunded family planning programs the report also appeared at time when several population groups were arguing that the mexico city clauses had been confused and misinterpreted by many subrecipients in way that diminished the effectiveness of their programs mexico city critics claimed that this had led some foreign ngos to terminate the collection of any abortionrelated data to abandon the use of medical textbooks or professional journals that discussed abortion and to end certain types of biomedical research due to fear of losing usaid funds even though these activities were not barred by the mexico city restrictions22 the findings of the 1990 study generally confirmed the views of several us family planning organizations that the mexico city regulations were unclear and misunderstood especially by foreign ngos while the authors found that recipients and subrecipients they studied had reasonably and fully complied with the mexico city policy they also concluded that subrecipients did not adequately understand the fine points of the standard clauses and had difficulty in passing on information to clinic staff particularly those at low literacy level although the study found that this had not had significant impact on most subprojects especially in countries where abortion was illegal and ran counter to religious beliefs and cultural attitudes the authors found evidence in some locations bangladesh turkey brazil pakistan and kenya that project managers had applied unnecessary restrictions on their operations this was due they said in part to misunderstanding of the mexico city policy but more often because of the deliberate application of excessive restrictions in order to avoid any inadvertent action that might risk the loss of funding to remedy the overcautious tendency of subproject management the authors made four recomm endations for usaid to 1 clarify the standard clause by stating what is permitted in areas such as research and the treatment of septic abortion cases 2 revise the standard clause to state that if violation was inadvertent the subrecipient could correct it without losing its access to funding 3 require that cooperating agencies extend more help to subrecipients in understanding the standard clause and 4 publish short easy to read pamphlet explaining what is and is not permitted under the standard clause although usaid took direct action on these recommendations in 1991 the agency sponsored the publication of four page document prepared by the population crisis committee entitled us government clarifies implementation of mexico city policy abortion restriction23 the publication stated that during challenges to the mexico city policy in the courts and before congress by us family planning groups usaid had clarified specific restrictions and acknowledged that foreign ngos may use funds from nonusaid sources for certain types of abortionrelated activities and still remain eligible for us population assistance the pamphlet stated that usaidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30830crs11 policy specified that foreign ngos could 1 conduct demographic and health research on abortion or septic and incomplete abortion 2 perform abortions to save the life of the mother or in the case of rape and incest 3 provide training and equipment to treat septic and incomplete abortions and 4 offer with usaid funds postabortion contraceptive counseling and services legislative challenges to the mexico city policy within months of administration implementation of the mexico city policy lawmakers opposed to the restrictions attempted to reverse them in april 1985 the house foreign affairs committee voted to prohibit the administration from denying funds to ngos that supported voluntary family planning programs hr 1555 during house debate however lawmakers voted 234189 in favor of an amendment deleting the committees position with language allowing the president to deny population aid to any country or organization because of the types of family planning programs that were promoted the senate adopted different approach that was not supportive of president reagans mexico city policy as approved the provision s 960 stipulated that ngos and international organizations could not be subject to conditions that were more restrictive than those applied to foreign governments since foreign governments were not subject to the mexico city terms the administration would either be forced to broaden the policy to direct government aid or drop the restrictions on ngos and internatio nal organizations congress however could not resolve these differences and decided to drop all references to the mexico city policy in the enacted bill pl 9983 in subsequent years mexico city policy critics introduced numerous bills and amendments attempting to alter the administration directives on international family planning and abortion none of these initiatives however were enacted and if they had been presidents reagan and bush would almost certainly have vetoed the bills with congress closely split on the issue it was unlikely that lawmakers could have overridden veto the closest cong ress came to legislating change in the mexico city policy came in 1991 hr 2508 the house and senate each adopted provisions similar to what had passed the senate in 1985 the house stated that population aid funds could not be denied to ngos or international organizations on the basis of condition that did not also apply to foreign governments the senate bill followed the 1985 model that funding for ngos and international organizations could not be conditioned on more restrictive conditions than those applied to foreign governments under the threat of veto from president bush conferees nevertheless adopted the senate language the conference report however was rejected by the house and the legislation was never presented to the president removal of the mexico city policy in one of his first actions at the white house president clinton on january 22 1993 issued memo randum to usaid instructing the administrator to lift the mexico city restrictions and remove their terms
