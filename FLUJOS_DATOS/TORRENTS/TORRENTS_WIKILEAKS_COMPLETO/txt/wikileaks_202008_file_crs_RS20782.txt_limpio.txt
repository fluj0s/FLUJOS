2 years by agreeing to hres 5 following wellestablished practice hres 5 provided for the rules of the 106th congress including applicable provisions of law and concurrent resolutions to be the rules of the new congress but with set of amendments proposed on behalf of the majority party conference hres 5 made several noteworthy rules changes affecting the houses committee system including some jurisdictional shifts between the renamed committee on energy and commerce and the new committee on financial services created to replace the committee on banking and financial services1 by contrast

congressional research service the library of congress crs2 corrections calendar bill placed on the corrections calendar longer must satisfy 3day layover and availability requirements before being eligible for floor consideration during the 106th congress rule xv had provided that the speaker could on any second or fourth tuesday direct the clerk to call any bill that had been on the corrections calendar for 3 legislative days in addition rule xiii had prohibited and continues to prohibit the house from considering most measures reported from committee until the committees report accompanying the measure has been available to members for 3 calendar days excluding weekends and holidays when the house is not in session rule xiii had exempted certain kinds of measures from this 3day rule hres 5 amended rule xiii to add an exemption for bills called from the corrections calendar the resolution also amended rule xvi to permit the speaker on the same 2 days of each month to direct the clerk to call any bill that is printed on the corrections calendar objections to exhibits hres 5 may expedite decisions concerning the use of exhibits in debate clause 6 of rule xvii had provided that whenever there was an objection to using an exhibit the house would decide the matter by vote and do so without debate clause 6 now provides that in case of such an objection the chair may submit the question of its use to the house without debate by implication the chair also now has the discretion to rule on such an objection instead of submitting it for the house to decide by vote this rules change may eliminate the need and opportunity for votes including electronically recorded votes concerning the use of exhibits voting on amendments in committee of the whole hres 5 amends rule xviii to codify recent practice that facilitates voting on amendments in the committee of the whole beginning in 1995 the rules committee frequently had included in its special rules provision that authorized the chair of the committee of the whole to defer at his or her discretion requests for record votes on amendments until later in the amending process this authority was accompanied by the authority to reduce the time consumed by series of electronic votes on amendments so long as the votes occurred without intervening business the chair could reduce the time for the second and any subsequent electronic votes to minimum of 5 minutes each so long as at least 15 minutes was allowed for members to cast the first vote in the series these authorities now have been added to the standing rules making it unnecessary for the rules committee to include them in its special rules the chair of the committee of the whole is empowered but not obligated to exercise these authorities and he or she may do so with respect to any amendments whether in the first or second degree and regardless of whether the measure in question is being considered in the committee of the whole under an open rule restrictive rule or some other procedure naming of public works new clause added to rule xxi bars consideration of any measure amendment or conference report that names public

intent to do so second the resolution added to the same clause new paragraph that bars motions to instruct conferees and motions to recommit conference reports with instructions from including argument it has not been in order to offer motion to instruct or motion to recommit with instructions if the instructions are inconsistent with the restrictions that house rules and precedents place
