congress the measure attempts to address six perceived problems with the current statutes that members identified during th 109th congress 1 that the principal members of the interagency committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius at times seem not to be well informed of the outcomes of reviews and investigations regarding proposed or pending investment transactions 2 that cfius has interpreted incorrectly the requirements under current statutes for investigations of transactions that involve firms that are owned or controlled by foreign government 3 that repor ting requirements under current statutes do not provide congress with enough information about th operations and actions of cfius for members to fulfill their oversight responsib ilities 4 that cfius exercises too much discretion in its ability to choose which tr ansactions it investigates 5 that the definition of national security used by cfius is longer adequate in post september 11th world and 6 that deadlines placed on cfius to complete reviews and investigations of investment transactions do not provide adequate time in some instances for the committee to complete its reviews and investigations this

the proposed purchase of the britishowned po ports1 by dubai ports world2 in early 20063 in particular the transaction spurred some members to question the effectiveness of the relatively obscure

that arose during consideration of the dubai ports world transaction in particular members ge nerally expressed concerns about six areas first members were concerned that the principal members of cfius at times seem not to be well informed of the outcomes of reviews and investigations made by cfius regarding proposed or pending investment transac tions because the duty for reviewing such transactions has been delegated in most agencies to lowerlev personnel second some members argued that cfius was interpreting incorrectly the requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs2 4 executive

discretion in its ability to choose which transactions it investigat and that it needs to be held more accountable to congress for its decisions regarding reviews and investigations of investment transactions fifth some mbers questioned the finition of national security used by the committee as being too narrowly interpreted and out of sync with the post september 11th view of national security last some members expressed their concerns that the time constraints placed on cfius to complete reviews and investigations of investment transactions does not provide adequate time in some instances for the committee to complete its reviews and investigations the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius is an interagency committee that serves the president in overseeing the national security implications of foreign investment in th economy cfius was established by an executive order of president ford in 1975 with broad re sponsibilities and few specific powers4 the committee is housed in the department of the treasury and has generally operated in relative obscurity initially cfius was established with six members but the membership has been expanded over time to twelve through various executive orders the twelve members include the secretaries of state the treasury defense homeland security and commerce the united states trade representative the chairman of the c ouncil of economic advisers the attorney general the director of the office of mana gement and budget the director of the office of science and technology policy th assistant to the president for national security affairs and the assistant to the president for economic policy5 the exonflorio provision the exonflorio

acquis itions and takeovers by foreign persons 31 cfr part 800be appropriate to suspend or prohibit proposed or pe nding foreign acquisitions mergers or takeovers of persons engaged in interstate commerce in the united states which threaten to impair the national security the statute indicates that the president may make an investigation to determine the effects on national security of such investments most impor tantly however congress directed that the president can exercise this discretionary authority only if he determines that two conditions exist 1 other us laws are in adequate or inappropr iate to protect the national security and 2 that he must have credible evidence that the foreign investment will impair the national security for the purposes of this legislation congress purposely did not defi ne national security but intended to have the term interpreted broadly without limitation to particular industry6 in 1988 congress approved the exonflor io provision as part of the omnibus trade act7 through executive order 12661 president reagan implemented provisions of the omnibus trade act and he delegated his authority to administer the exonflorio provision to cfius8 particularly to conduc t reviews of foreign investment to undertake investigations and to make recomme ndations although the statute itself does not specifically mention cfius as result of president reagans action cfius was transformed from purely administrative body with limited authority to review and analyze data on foreign investment to one with broad mandate and significant authority to advise the president on foreign investment transactions and to recommend that some transactions be susp ended or prohibited the committee has 30 days to decide whether to investigate case and an additional 45 days to make its recommendation once the recommendation is made the president has 15 days to act regulations developed by the treas ury department in november 1991 implemented the exonflorio provision9 these regulations created system of voluntary notification by the parties to an investment transaction and they allow for notices of acquisitions by agencies that are members of cfius despite the voluntary nature of the notification firm s largely comply with these provisions because the regulations stipul ate that foreign acquisitions that are governed by the exonflorio review process but that do not notify the committee remain subject indefinitely to divestment or other appropriate actions by the president this process has become one in number of regulatory st eps that firms consider as they undertake merger acquisition or takeover the byrd amendment in 1992 congress amended the exonflorio statute through section 837a of the national defense authoriz ation act for fiscal year 1993 known as the byrdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs4 10 pl 102484 october 23 1992 11 briefing on the dubai ports world deal be fore the senate armed services committee february 23 2006amendment after the amendments s ponsor the provision requires cfius to investigate proposed mergers acquis itions or takeovers in cases where 1 the acquirer is controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government and 2 the acquisition results in control of person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states that could affect the national security of the united states10 this amendment came under particul arly intense scrutiny by the 109th congress as result of the dp world transacti on many members of congress and others believed that this amendment requi red cfius to undertake full 45day investigation of the transaction because dp world was controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government th dp world acquisition however exposed sharp rift between what some members apparently believed the amendment directed cfius to do and how the members of cfius were interpreting the amendment in particular some members of congress apparently interpreted the amendment to require cfius to conduct ma ndatory 45day investigati on without exception if the foreign firm involved in transaction is owned or controlled by foreign government representatives of cfius however argued that there were two factors that controlled their decision not to conduct 45day investigation of the transaction first they argued that the requirements of the exonflorio provision itself precluded them from engaging in 45day investig ation because their initial review did not find credible evidence that the transaction would impair national security basic threshold for cfius to meet in order to invoke the exonflorio provision secondly representatives indicated that they interpret the amendment to mean that 45day investigation is discretionary and not ma ndatory again because of the requirement that transaction must be found to cause an impairment to national security before the exonflorio provision can be invoked cfius representatives also argued that their decision not to launch full 45day investigation of the dp world was the result of an extensive informal review of the transaction prior to the case being officially filed with cfius and as result of formal 30day review during these two reviews cfius members believed that all concerns that had been expressed by members of cfius d been adequately resolved so that by the time of the review member of cfius had any unresolved concerns about the impact of the transacti on on national security they conceded that the case met the first criterion under the byrd amendment because dp world was controlled by foreign government but that it did not meet the second part of the requirement because cfius had concluded during the 30day review that the transaction could not aff ect the national security11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs5 12 weisman jonathan and bradley graham duba i firm to sell us port operations the washington post march 10 2006 p a1 13 king neil jr and greg hitt dubai

congress directed that the president or his designee may consider short list of factors in deciding whether to block foreign acquisition merger or takeove r again the president s broad discretion under the current statute to decide the basis on which he determines whether transaction might impair the national security this list includes the following factors 1 domestic production needed for projected national defense requirements 2 the capability and capacity of domestic industries to meet national defense requirements including the availability of human resources products technology materials and other supplies and services 3 the control of domestic industries nd commercial activity by foreign citizens as it affects the capability and capacity of the us to meet the requirements of national security 4 the potential effects of the transactions on the sales of military goods equipment or technology to country that supports terrorism or proliferates missile technology or chemical and biological weapons and 5 the potential effects of the transact ion on us technological leadership in areas affecting us national security part of congresss motiva tion in adopting the exonfl orio provision apparently arose from concerns that foreign takeovers of us firms could not be stopped unless the president declared national emergenc or regulators i nvoked federal antitrust environmental or secur ities laws through the exonflorio provision congress attempted to strengthen the presidents hand in conducting foreign investment policy while providing cursory role for itself as means of emphasizing that as much as possible the commercial nature of investment transactions should be free from political considerations congress also atte mpted to balance public concerns about the economic impact of certain types of foreign investment with the nations long standing international commitme nt to maintain an ope n and receptive environment for foreign investment furthermore congress did not intend to have the exonflorio provision alter the generally open foreign inve stment climate of the count ry or to have it inhibithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs6 14 crs report

industries that could not be c onsidered to be of national security interest the basic approach of the provision therefore was to presume that foreign investment generally has positive effect on the economy and that it should be encouraged and restricted only in thos cases in which specific transaction had met burden of proof that the proposed inve stor might take ac tion that threatens to impair the national security at the time the exonflorio provision wa s adopted some anal ysts believed the provision could potentially wide n the scope of industries that fell under the national security rubric cfius however is not fr ee to establish an independent approach to reviewing foreign investment transactions but operates under the authority of the president and reflects his attitudes and policies as result the discretion cfius uses to review and to investigate foreig n investment cases reflects policy guidance from the president in addition congre ss did not adopt specific definition of national security when it approved the exonflorio provision instead during review or investigation of foreign investment each member of cfius is expected to apply that definition of national security that is consistent with the legislative mandate of the cfius member as result the cfius process relies on each member applying their own pa rticular definition of nationa l security and making any concerns that arise from such review known to the other members of cfius foreign investors are also constrained by legislation that bars foreign direct investment in such industrie s as maritime operations airc raft banking resources and power14 generally these sectors were closed to foreign investors primarily for national defense purposes prio r to passage of the exonflorio provision to prevent these areas from being subject to foreign control exonflorio prov ision after september 11 2001 arguably the events of septembe r 11 2001 have reshaped congressional attitudes toward the exonflorio provisi on and the manner in which it should be used during discussion about the exonfl orio provision prior to its passage in 1988 the reagan administration opposed defin ition of national security that included essential commerce and national security because the administration argued that the definition was too broa d ultimately the reagan administration succeeded in getting the term essential commer ce dropped from the provision after the september 11th terrorist attacks however congress passed and president bush signed the usa patriot act of 2001 uniting nd strengthening america by providing appropriate tools requi red to intercept and obstruct terrorism15 in this act congress provided for special support for cr itical industries which it defined as systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitatinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs7 16

definition is enhanced to so degree by other provisions of the act which specifically identify certain sector s of the economy therefore as likely candidates for consideration as critical infrastructure including telecommunications energy financial services wa ter transportation sectors17 and the cyber and physical infrastructure services critical to maintaining the national defense continuity of government economic prosperity and quality of life in the united states18 the following year congress adopted the nguage in the patriot act on critical infrastructure into the ho meland security act of 200219 by adopting the terms critical infrastructure and homeland security following the events of september 11 2001 congress demonstrated that the attacks fundamentally altere d the way many members of c ongress and many in the public view the concept of national security as result many in congress and in the public have come to believe that economic activities are separately identifiable component of national security in ddition many in congress and elsewhere apparently perceive greater risks to th economy arising from foreign investments in which the foreign investor is owned or c ontrolled by foreign governments as result of the terrorist attacks the dubai ports world case in particular demonstrated that there was difference between the postsept ember 11 expectations held by many in congress about the role of foreign i nvestment in the economy and of economic infrastructure issues as component of national secu rity and the operations of cfius for some members of congress cf ius seemed to be out of touch with the postseptember 11 2001 view of national secu rity because it remains founded in the late 1980s orientation of the exonflorio provision which views national security primarily in terms of national defense and downplays or even excludes broader notion of economic national security activity within congress and the intense public and congressional reaction that arose from the proposed dubai ports world acquisition spurred the bush administration in late 2006 to make an important adminis trative change in the way cfius reviews foreign investment tran sactions cfius and president bush approved the acquisition of lucent technolog ies inc by the frenchbased alcatel sa which was completed on december 1 2006 before the transaction was approved by cfius however alcatellucent was required to agree to national security arrangement known as special security arrangement or ssa that restricts alcatels access to sensitive work done by lucents research arm bell labs and the communications infrastru cture in the united states the most controversial feature of this arrangement is that it allows cfius to reopen review of the deal and to overturn its approval at any time if cfius believeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs8 20 kirchgaessner stephanie us threat to reopen terms of lucent and alcatel deal mergers financial

transaction cfius reviews and investigations d been portrayed and had been considered to be final as result firms were willing to subject themselves voluntarily to cfius review because they believed that once an investment transaction was scrutinized and approved by the members of cfius the firm s could be assured that the investment transaction would be exempt from any future reviews or actions this administrative change however means that cfius determination may longer be final decision and it adds new leve l of uncertainty to foreign investors seeking to acquire us firms broad range of us and international business groups are objecting to this change in the administrations policy20 overview of hr 556 hr 556 was approved by the house fi nancial services committee on february 13 2007 with amendments the amendmen t offered by committee chairman frank and representative price included six chan ges to the bill as it was introduced on january 18 2007 these changes responded to concerns that were expressed by the bush administration that some of the pro cedures that would have been established under hr 556 would have created new vels of bureaucracy and administrative bottlenecks that potentially could have delayed and discouraged foreign investment the changes would 1 allow deputy secretary of an undersecretary of an agency to approve an investment transaction on behalf of the respective agency instead of requiring the secretary to approve the transaction 2 require the deputy secretary of an agency to certify investment transactions by companies that are owned by foreign government 3 give the director of national intelligence adequate time to consider national security implications instead of requiring minimum of 30 days to examine security implications 4 clarify that agencies act on behalf of cfius in administering agreements to mitigate security concerns that are raised about foreign investor during cfius review 5 stri ke provision that would have allowed cfius to reopen approvals nd would have required the ttorney general to report to congress21 on february 28 2007 hr 556 was appr oved with amendments by the full house the three amendments that were adopted clarified the language of the measure in some cases and added number of new sections in particular the measure added new factor that requires cfius and the president to consider the impact of an investment transaction on u s efforts to curtail human smuggling in approving transaction another change would require cfiu s to notify senators and members of congress if the committee determines that the areas represented by the senator or member would be signi ficantly affected by an investment transactionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs9 hr 556 attempts to addr ess congressional concerns by establishing cfius by statutory authority thereby giving congress direct role in determining the makeup and operations of the committee the measure would have the secretary of the treasury continue to serve as the chairm an of cfius despite the misgivings of some members and the secretary homeland security and the secretary of defense serve as vice chairmen in other respects the bill retains the basic structure of the committee as it presently exists except that it would add the secretary of energy as permanent member of cfius according to the measure the co mmittee would operate under the same time frame that currently exists with 30 days allotted for review 45 days for an investigation and 15 days for the president to make his determin ation the president would retain his authority as the only officer with the authority to suspend or prohibit certain types of foreign i nvestments the measure would also place additional requirements on firms that resubmitted filing after previously withdrawing filing before full review is completed in hr 556 review or investigation would be considered to be complete until it had been approved by majority of the members of cfius and signed by the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of homeland security to insure that principal members of cfius were aware of all reviews and investigations completed by cfius the bill would require cfius to review all covered foreign investment transactions to determine whether transaction threatens to impair the national security covered foreign investment transaction is defined as any merger acquisition or takeover which results in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states the measure places increased requirements on cfius to review investment transactions in which the foreign pers on is owned or controlled by foreign government it is unclear however to what extent the bill would alter the current process the measure would explicitly require cfius to re view all investment transactions in which the foreign person is owned or controlled by foreign government but the measure does not amend or alter the current statute in the area that has been the source of recent differences between cfius and congress in particular the current statute states that the president and through him cfius can use the exonflorio process only if he finds that there is credible evidence that foreign investment will impair national security as result cfius has determined as was the case in the duba i ports transaction that if the committee does not have credible evidence that an investment will impair the national security that it is not required to undertake full 45day investigation it is possible that cfius could continue to operate in this manner regardless of the passage of the measure in addition if cfius does act to investig ate all foreign investment transactions in which the foreign person is owned or c ontrolled by foreign government foreign investors may well regard it as an im portant policy change by the united states toward foreign investment as previously stated the current system presumes that foreign investment transactions are accep table and provide positive contribution to the economy as result the burden is on the members of cfius to prove that particular transaction is threat to na tional security hr 556 however might behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs10 interpreted to presume that investment transactions in which the foreign person is owned or controlled by foreign governme nt are threat to the nations security simply because of the relationship to th foreign government and therefore might require the firms to prove that they are not threat although the number of investment transactions year in which the foreign investor is associated with foreign government is small compared with the total number of foreign investment transactions foreign investors and foreign governments likely will view this as significant change in the traditional us approach to foreign investment the bill attempts to increase the role of congressional oversight by requiring greater reporting by cfius on its actions either during or after it completes reviews and investigations and by increasing re porting requirements on cfius hr 556 would require the secretary of the treasury the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of commerce to sign and approve any review or investigation in those cases in which the foreign person involved in an investment transaction is owned or controlled by foreign government majo rity of the members of cfius would be required to approve the transaction and the president and the chair and vice chairs of cfius would be required to sign off on i nvestments in which at least one member of cfius did not agree with the decision of the majority to approve the transaction the measure would require cfius to provide congress with greater amount of detailed information about its operations hr 556 w ould require cfius to notify specified members at the conclusion of an investment investig ation and to report annually to congress hr 556 also w ould provide for greater reporting on and increased authority for cfius to negotiate provisions with the foreign firms involved in investment transactions to mitigate th impact of the transaction under current statutes cfius has authority to negotiate such agreements with firms and it is not clear that it has any authority to enforce such agreements hr 556 provides for process to track the agreements and to report the progress of such agreements and any changes to the agreements to the members of cfius and to the president the measure also would amend the current statute regarding the meaning of national security and would place add itional requirements on cfius regarding national security reviews the bill would explicitly require the director of national intelligence to conduct reviews of any investment that posed threat to the national security the bill also provides for additi onal factors the president and cfius would be required to use in assessing foreign investments in particular the bill would add implications for the nations critical infrastructure as factor for reviewing or investigating an inve stment transaction cfius national security investigations according to the exonflorio provision and subsequent regulations issued by the treasury department cfius has 30 days after it receives the initial formal notification by the parties to merger ac quisition or takeover to decide whether to investigate case as result of its determination that the investment threatens to impair the national security of the united states if during this 30day period all the members of cfius conclude that the investment does not threaten to impair the national security or if the concerns of any member are resolved the review is terminated if however at least one member of the committee determines that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs11 investment does threaten to impair the national security and if these concerns are not resolved cfius can proceed to 45day i nvestigation at the conclusion of the investigation or the 45da review period whichever comes first the committee can decide to offer recommendation or it can recommend that the president suspend or prohibit the investment the president is under obligation to follow the recommendation of the committee to suspend or prohibit an investment in subsequent amendment the by rd amendment cfius is required to conduct 45day investigation of transaction in any instance in which the foreign entity is controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government which could result in the foreign entity gaining control of the us entity and that could affect the national security of the united states such an investigation is required to begin later than 30 days after cfius receives written notice of the proposed or pending merger acquisition or take over and be completed in more than 45 days hr 556 would establish the committee on foreign investment in the united states as matter of statute and would amend the current procedures for cfius review and investigation the measure would strike out the first two sections of the current statute that deal with investiga tions and replace them with provisions that would provide for the same 30day review nd 45day investigation stages that exist under the current provision but would alter th provision in number of ways first the measure would explicitly indicate that the investigation would be conducted by the committee on foreign investment in the united states which is referred to only as the presidents designee in the current statute next the measure would amend and broaden the language in the current statute regarding national security by indicating that national security for this provision would be construed so as to include those issues relating to homeland security including its application to critical infrastructure the measure would provide fornational security reviews and investigations which are not part of the current cfius process although the director of national intelligence is often asked to participate in cfius reviews and investigations in an important departure from the current pr ocedure cfius would be required to shall review any merger acquisition or takeover to termine the effects of the transaction on the national security of th united states in addition cfius would be required to shall conduct an investigation of transaction if the committee determines that the transaction would resu lt in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states currently cfius has broad discretion to determine which cases it reviews and investigates since its directive states that it may review or investigate transacti on once review has been initiated firm cannot withdraw its notice unless it provide s written request for such withdrawal and the request is approved in writing by the chairperson in consultation with the vice chairpersons of the committee in addition to any entity that is party to merger acquisition or takeover being able to initiate review the president the committee or any member of the committee also could request that cfius revi ew transaction this authority could not be delegated by any memb er of cfius to any person ot her than to an appropriate deputy secretary under secretary or th equivalent these individuals would be able to review transaction that previ ously had been review ed and approved underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs12 certain circumstances 1 if it was later discovered that false or misleading material information had been submitted to cfius 2 if material informati on including documents had been omitted from information submitted to cfius or 3 if party to transaction had intentionally failed to adhere to any mitigating agreements or conditions upon which the original approva l had been granted and other remedy or enforcement tool was available to address such breach of the mitigating agreement the measure also would require the president acting through cfius to conduct national security investigation of the effects of transaction on the national security of the united states and to take any necessary actions in connection with the transaction to protect the national s ecurity of the united states under certain conditions these conditions would be 1 as result of review of the transaction cfius determined that the transactions th reatened to impair the national security of the united states and that the threat had not been mitigated during or prior to review of the transaction or the fore ign person was controlled by foreign government 2 during roll call vote of the members of cfius at least one member voted against approving the transaction 3 the director of national intelligence had identified particularly complex national secu rity or intelligence issues that threaten to impair the national security of the united states and cfius members had not been able to develop and agree on measures to mitigate the threat during review the investigation would be required to be co mpleted within 45 days but the measure would provide for an extension of the dead line of up to an additional 45 days if the extension had been requested by the presid ent or by roll call vote of twothirds of the cfius members during the markup session on the meas ure the house committee on financial services provided an important exception to the requirement that cfius conduct an investigation of transaction if it determines during review that party to transaction is owned or controlled by foreign government instead the measure would not require such an investigation even if cfius had determined during review that the party to transaction wa s controlled by foreign government if 1 it also determined that the transaction w ill not affect the national security of the united states and 2 agreement or condition was require d relative to the transaction to mitigate any threat to the national security also the measure would require the appr oval of majority of the members of cfius and the approval of and signed determination by the secretary of the treasury the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of commerce on any review or investigation in order for the cfius process to be considered final or complete for those cases in which the foreign entity was determined to be controlled by foreign government and at least one member of cfius did not vote in favor of approval the cf ius investigation process woul d not be considered to be complete until the president and the chai rperson and the vice chairperson of the committee signed the committee report to indicate their approval in an other important change durin g the markup session the house committee added the requirement that action by the president is required in certain cases specifically the measure would require th president to approve and sign his approval of an

the president in overseeing the national security implicati ons of foreign investment in the economy president fords 1975 executive order established the ba sic structure of cfius and directed that the representative23 of the secretary of the treasury be the chairman of the committee the executive order also stipulated that the committee would have the primary continuing responsibility within the executive branch for monitoring the impact of foreign investment in the united states both direct and portfolio and for coordinating the implementation of unite d states policy on such investment24 presently the committee consists of twelve members including the secretaries of state the treasury defense homeland security and commerce the united states trade representative the chairman of the council of economic advisers the attorney general the director of the offi ce of management and budget the director of the office of science and technology policy the assistant to the

homeland securitythe measure would establish the members of cfius as matter of statute compared with the present situation in which cfius is creation of various presidential orders cfius would include the same twelve members that currently constitute the committee but the measure would also add the secretary of energy to cfius the secretary of the treasury would continue to serve as the chairperson of the committee but new vice chairperson position would be created and held by the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of commerce the committee would be empowered to take ch testimony receive such evidence administer such oaths in order to carry out review or investigation the committee also would be able to require the attendance and testimony of such witnesses and production of such books records correspondence memoranda papers and documents as the chairperson of the committee determines to be advisable presidential actions hr 556 would leave unaltered the current exonflorio provision which grants the president the authority to take such action for such time as the president considers appropriate to suspend or prohibit any ac quisition merger or takeover by foreign entity of persons engaged in interstate commerce in the united states that threaten to impair the national security the president is required to announce his decision within 15 days after cfius co mpletes its investigation of proposed transaction the president also has the au thority to direct the attorney general to seek appropriate relief including divestment relief in the district courts of the united states in order to implement and force this decision by the president findings hr 556 also would leave unchanged th current exonflorio provision which grants the president the authority to bl ock proposed or pending foreign acquisitions of persons engaged in interstate commerce in the united states that threaten to impair the national security congress dir ected however that before the president can invoke this authority he must believe that the case meets two tests or findings first he must believe that other us laws are inadequate or in appropriate to protect the national security secondly he must have credible evidence that the foreign investment will impair the national security factors used in findings as it is currently written the exonflorio provision includes list of five factors the president may consider in deciding to block foreign acquisition these factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs15 are also considered by the individual memb ers of cfius as part of their own review process to determine if particular tr ansaction threatens to impair the national security this list includes the following elements 1 domestic production needed for projected national defense requirements 2 the capability and capacity of domestic industries to meet national defense requirements including the availability of human resources products technology materials and other supplies and services 3 the control of domestic industries nd commercial activity by foreign citizens as it affects the capability and capacity of the us to meet the requirements of national security 4 the potential effects of the transactions on the sales of military goods equipment or technology to country that supports terrorism or proliferates missile technology or chemical and biological weapons and 5 the potential effects of the transac tion on us technological leadership in areas affecting us national security hr 556 would amend the current fact ors the president and the committee use to evaluate mergers acquisitions or take overs in particular the statute would change the status of the factors to be considered from being discretionary may to being required shall in evaluating trans action also this measure would add four more factors to the five that currently exist these new factors are 1 whether the transaction has security related impact on critical infrastructure in the united states 2 the potential effects of the transacti on on the efforts of the united states to curtail human smuggling and to curtail drug smuggling 3 whether the entity involved is being controlled by foreign government and 4 such other factors as the president or his designee may determine to be appropriate generally or in connection with specific review or transaction the bill would make the united states immune from any liability for any losses or expenses incurred by the parties to an i nvestment transaction as result of actions taken by cfius if the entities did not submit written notification to cfius or if the transaction was completed prior to the completion of cfius review or investigation confidentiality the exonflorio provision codified confidentiality requirements that are similar to those that appeared in executive orde r 11858 by stating that any information or documentary material filed under the pr ovision may not be made public except ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs16 26 50 usc appendix sec 2170c 27 50 usc appendix sec 2170gmay be relevant to any administrative or judicial action or proceeding26 t h provision does state however that this confidentiality provision shall not be construed to prevent disclosure to either house of congress or to any duly authorized committee or subcommittee of the congress the exonflorio provision requires the president to provide written report to the secretary of the senate and the clerk of the house detailing his decision and his actions relevant to any transaction that was subject to 45day investigation27 as presently written there is requirement for cfius or the president to notify or otherwise inform congress of cases it reviews or of the outcome of any investigation hr 556 would provide for the release of proprietary information which can be associated with particular party to committees only with assurances that the information would remain confidential members of congress and their staff members would be accountable under current provisions of law governing the release of certain types of information mitigation and tracking since the implementation of the exon florio provision cf ius has developed several practices that likely were not envisioned when th statute was drafted for instance members of cfius negotiate conditions with firms at times either to mitigate or to remove matters that raise national security concerns among the members of cfius such agreements often are informal arrangements that have an uncertain basis in statute and have not been tested in court these arrangements have been negotiated during the formal 30day re view period or even during an informal process prior to the formal filing of notice of an investment transaction hr 556 would address one concern about cfiuss actions by granting cfius or any agency designated by the chairperson and vice chairperson of cfius the authority to negotiate impose or enforce any agreement or condition with the parties to transaction in order to mitigate any thr eat to the national security of the united states such agreements would be based on riskbased analysis of the threat posed by the transaction also if notifi cation of transaction is withdrawn before any review or investigation by cfius can be completed the measure grants the committee the authority to take number of actions in particular the committee would be able to develop 1 interim protections to ddress specific concerns about the transaction pending resubmission of notice by the parties 2 specific time frames for resubmitting the notice and 3 process for tracking any actions taken by any party to the transaction cfius also would be granted the authority to designate one or more appropriate federal departments or agencies to ne gotiate modify monitor and enforce agreements in order to mitigate any threat to national security the agencies or departments would be required to provide reports on halfyearly basis to cfius and the parties to an agreement would be requi red to report on the imp lementation of anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs17 material change in circumstances furthermore the federal entity or entities would be required to report to cfius on any modification to any agreement or condition that had been imposed and to ensure that any significant modification is reported to the director of national intelligence and to any other federal department or agency that may have material in terest in such modification in addition cfius would be required to develop method for evaluating the compliance of firms that had entered in to mitigation agreement or condition that was imposed as requirement for approva l of the investment transaction such measures however would be required to be developed in such way that they would allow cfius to determine that complia nce is taking place without also 1 unnecessarily diverting cfius res ources from assessing any new covered transaction for which written notice had b een filed and 2 placing unnecessary burdens on party to investment transaction congressional oversight in hearings that were held after the dubai ports world transaction became public various members expressed concern that they were provided so little information under the current statutes that their ability to fulfill their oversight responsibilities was hamp ered in addition some memb ers apparently believed that the current requirements do not provide members with enough information to address public concerns that occasionally arise concerning particular investment transactions such as the dubai ports worl d transaction currently the president is required to report to cong ress on his determination to take action on proposed investment transaction after cfius has completed 30day review and 45day investigation of the transaction the presidents report is required to contain detailed explanation of the fi ndings and of the factors the president used to make his determination the president is also required to provide an assessment of the risk of diversion of defense critical technology posed by an investment transaction if such an assessment is performed and that the asse ssment be provided to any other individual responsible for reviewing or investigating investment transactions under the exon florio provision in addition the presiden t is required to provide congress with quadrennial report which evaluates two issues 1 whether there is credible evidence of coordinated strategy by one or more countries or companies to acquire us companies involved in resear ch development or producti on of critical technologies for which the united states is leading pr oducer and 2 whether there are industrial espionage activities directed or directly assisted by foreign governments against private us companies aimed at obtaining commercial secrets related to critical technologies hr 556 would increase oversight by the congress not later than five days after cfius completed an inve stigation or 15 days after th end of an investigation if the president had deter mined to take actions under the exonflorio provision the committee would be required to provide written report to leaders in both houses of congress and to the chairman and ra nking member of committees in both houses with jurisdiction over any aspect of the tr ansaction and its possible effects on national security specifically at minimum the committee on foreign affairs thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs18 28 pl 94282 may 11 1976 which states that the priority needs of the nation relative to investment in science and technology are 1 promoting conservation and efficient utilization of natural and human resources 2 protecting the oceans and coastal zones 3 strengthening the economy and promoting full em ployment 4 assuring adequate supplies of food materials and energy 5 improving the quality of health care and 6 improving the nations housing transporta tion and communication systemscommittee on financial services and the committee on energy and commerce in the house cfius also would be require d to brief certain congressional leaders if they requested such briefing memb ers of congress and their staff would be subject to disclosure limitations and proprietary information would be shared with congressional committees only under conditions that would assure the confidentia lity of the information under hr 556 cfius would be require d to report annually to congress on any reviews or investigations that it had conducted during the prior year each report would include list of all reviews and investigations that had been conducted information on the nature of the busine ss activities of the pa rties involved in an investment transaction inform ation about the status of th review or investigation and information on any withdrawal from th process any roll call votes by the committee any extension of time for any i nvestigation and any presidential decision or action taken under the exonflorio pr ovision in addition cfius would be required to report on trend information on the number of filings investigations withdrawals and presidential decisions or actions that were ta ken the report also would include cumulative information on the business sectors involved in filings and the countries from which the investments orig inated information on the status of the investments of companies that withdr ew notices and the types of security arrangements and conditions cfius used to mitigate national security concerns the methods the committee used to determine th at firms were complying with mitigation agreements or conditions nd detailed discussion of ll perceived adverse effects of investment transactions on the national security or critical infrastructure of the united states relative to critical technologies the annual cfius report w ould be required to include an evaluation of any credible evid ence of coordinated strategy by one or more countries or companies to acquire us companies involved in research development or production of critical techno logies in which the united states is leading producer the report also would in clude an evaluation of possible industrial espionage activities directed or directly assisted by foreign governments against private us companies aimed at obtaining commercial secrets related to critical technologies for the purposes of this s ection critical technolog ies would be defined as technology defined in the national sc ience and technology policy organization and priorities act of 197628 or other critical technol ogy critical component s or critical technology items ssential to nationa l defense of national security the measure also would require the inspect or general of the department of the treasury to investigate any failure of cfius to comply with requirements for reporting that were imposed prior to the passage of this measure and to report the findings of this report to the congress in particular the repor t would be required tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs19 be sent to the chairman and ranking mber of each committee of the house and the senate with jurisdiction over any aspect of the report including the committee on international relations the committee on financial services and the committee on energy and commerce of the house in addition the measure would require the secretary of the treasury in consultation with the secretary of state and the secretary of commerce to conduct study on investment in the united states particularly in critical infrastructure and industries affecting na tional security by 1 foreign governments entities controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government or persons of foreign countries which comply with any boycott of israel 2 foreign governments entities controlled by or acting on behalf of foreig n government or persons of foreign countries which do not ban organizations designated by the secretary of state as foreign terrorist organizations the measure would require the chief executive officer of any party to merger acquisition or takeover to cer tify in writing that the information contained in the written notification to cfius fully complied with the requirements of the exon florio provision and that the information was accurate and comp lete this written notification would also include any mitiga tion agreement or condition that was part of cfius approval conclusions the proposed dp world acquisition of po while arguably of little economic impact on the us ec onomy could affect public policy on foreign investment that relates to issues of corporate ownership foreign investment nd national security in the us economy the transaction re vealed significant differences between congress and the administration over th operations of cfius and over the objectives the committee should be pursuing in addition the transaction demonstrated that neither congress nor the administration has been able so far to define clearly the national security implications of foreign direct investment this issue likely reflects differing assessments of the economic impact of foreign investment on the us economy and differi ng political and philosophical convictions among members and between the c ongress and the administration the incident also focused attention on the informal process firms use to have their investment transactions reviewed by cfius prior to formal review according to anecdotal evidence some firms apparently believe that the cfius process is not market neutral but that it adds to market uncertainty that can negatively affect firms stock price and lead to economic behavior by some firms that is not optimal for the economy as whol such behavior might involve firms expending considerable amount of res ources to avoid cf ius invest igation or deciding to terminate transaction that would improve the optimal performance of the economy in order to avoid cfius inve stigation while such anecdotal evidence may not serve as the basis for developi ng public policy it does raise number of concerns about the possible impact of the cfius process on the market and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs20 potential costs of redefining the concept of national security relative to foreign investment the recent focus by congress on the committee has also shown that the dp world transaction in combination with other recent unpopular foreign investment transactions has exacerbated dissatisfaction among some members of congress over the operations of cfius in particular some members are displeased with the way the committee uses its discretionary aut hority under the exonflorio provision to investigate certain foreign investment tran sactions as result congress could make number of changes to the cfius process through legislation that has been proposed in the 1st session of the 110th congress the changes could mandate more frequent contact between the committee which ge nerally operates wit hout much public or congressional attention and the congress and enhance congresss oversight role over the committee the dp world transaction also revealed that th september 11 2001 terrorist attacks may have fundamenta lly altered the viewpoint of some members of congress regarding the role of foreign investment in the economy and over the impact of such investment on the national security frame work these observers argue that this change requires reassessment of the role of foreign investment in the economy and of the implications of corporate ownershi p of activities that fa ll under the rubric of critical infrastructure as result some members of congress are looking to amend the cfius process to enhance congresss oversight role while reducing somewhat the discretion of cfius to review and inve stigate foreign investment transactions in order to have cfius investigate larger number of foreign investment cases in addition the dp world transaction has fo cused attention on longunresolved issues concerning the role of foreign investment in the nations overall security framework and the methods that are being used to ssess the impact of foreign investment on the nations defense industrial ba and homeland security most economists agree that there is little economic evidence to conclude that foreign ownership whether by private entity or by an entity that is owned or controlled by foreign government has measurable impact on the us economy as whole others may argue on nonec onomic grounds that such firms pose risk to national security or to homeland security similar issues concerning corporate owne rship were raised during the late 1980s and early 1990s when foreign investment in the us economy increased rapidly there are little new data however to alte r the conclusion reached at that time that there is definitive way to assess the ec onomic impact of foreign ownership or of foreign investment on the economy lthough some observers have expressed concerns about foreign investors who are owned or controlled by foreign governments acquiring us firms there is little confirmed evidence that such distinction in corporate ownership has any measurable effect on the economy as whole for most economists the distinction between domestic and foreignowned firms whether the foreign firms are priv ately owned or controlled by foreign government is sufficiently small that they would argue that it does not warrant placing restrictions on the inflow of foreig n investment nevert heless foreign directhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856crs21 investment does entail various economic costs and benefits on the benefit side such investments bring added capital into the economy and potentially could add to productivity growth and innovation such investment also represents one repercussion of the us trade deficit th deficit transfers dollardenominated assets to foreign investors who then decide how to hold those assets by choosing among various investment vehicles including dir ect investment foreign investment also removes stream of monetary benefits from the economy in the form of repatriated capital and profits that reduces the tota l amount of capital in the economy such costs and benefits likely occur whether th foreign owner is private entity or foreign government
