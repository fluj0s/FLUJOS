requirements states systemwide 277 security policies and specifies requirements for curity services 278 ufouo volume 3 system security architecture and related requiremen ts specifies the 279 security architecture for the kmi as whole and fo r each of its nodes kmi2200v3 280 ufouo for the purposes of these documents the kmi is defined as follows 281 definition ufouo key management infrastructure kmi all partscomputer 282 hardware firmware software and other equipment nd its documentation facilities that 283 house the equipment and related functions and comp anion standards policies procedures 284 and doctrinethat form the system that manages and supports the ordering and delivery of 285 cryptographic material and related information prod ucts and services to users 286 11 u purpose 287 ufouo an introduction to the system is provided in the kmi concept document 288 kmi1001 the system is being implemented in phase s called capability increments as 289 described in the kmi roadmap document kmi1011 each increment will provide new and 290 evolving key management capabilities and services as well as updates or enhancements to 291 existing key management systems the policies state d in this volume are intended to apply not 292 only to capability increment 2 ci2 but also to later cis and to the resulting longterm target 293 kmi 294 ufouo this volume states overall security objec tives states policies for achieving the 295 objectives and states related security requirement s that apply broadly to system components 296 however the policies and requirements stated here are intended to be independent of all but the 297 most basic and necessary architectural concepts though the policies and requirements provide 298 framework for design implementation and operati on they are not intended to imply either 299 security mechanisms to be implemented or strength f mechanisms except where those are 300 specifically mentioned 301 12 u kmi security objectives 302 ufouo the basic security objectives of the kmi are as follows 303 ufouo access control protect all kmi resources from unauthorized use 304 kmi 2200 vol 2 unclassifiedfor official use only 30 sept 2005 security

and 309 correct operation 310 ufouo user authentication verify the identities of system entities before per mitting 311 them to access system resources 312 ufouo user accountability enable managers to trace the initiation of system ctivities 313 to individual users that can be held responsible fo r the consequences of the activities 314 ufouo management control enable managers to 1 configure kmi security 315 characteristics 2 ensure that the system meets pplicable portions of this policy and 316 3 enable interoperation with the ekms and externa l systems see relationship to 317 existing key management systems and external suppor t systems section of volume 1 318 definition ufouo external system an information system other than the ekms 319 separate from the kmi to which the kmi sends reque sts for data needed to support kmi 320 operations and from which the kmi receives request ed data 321 13 u terminology and capitalization 322 ufouo this document uses the following terms to describe and specify the parts of the kmi 323 system these terms and additional terms that are defined in this volume and in volumes 1 and 324 3 are written with initial capital letters when us ed in formal sense ie in policy statements 325 in requirement statements and in other definition statements 326 definition ufouo system entity an active elementie either 1 person or 327 2 set of persons or

permitting the entity to perform any oth er action in the kmi 1783 definition ufouo user authentication security service that verifies user 1784 identity that is claimed by or for system entity that attempts to access the kmi 1785 ufouo user authentication involves two steps 1 the first step is identification which 1786 consists of presenting an identifier that is claime d to be bound to the entity this enables the 1787 entity to be recognized as registered user or sys tem component and to be distinguished from 1788 other such entities 2 the second step is verific ation which consists of presenting information 1789 that proves the truth of the claimed identity 1790 ufouo kmi user authentication services provide basis fo r access control and other 1791 security services and when complemented by audit s ervices ensures accountability therefore 1792 the kmi needs to employ robust user identity authen tication mechanisms and protect their 1793 implementations and associated information manager s need to be able to direct and control the 1794 establishment and maintenance of authentication mat erial identifier credentials and 1795 authentication tokens the specific policies and as sociated requirements for implementing user 1796 authentication service are as follows 1797 ci2sec33a ufouo when system entity attempts to access the kmi without 1798 presenting

maintain some degree of individual user accountability even 2101 when users share group identity that has single authenticator this specification permits the 2102 following three modes each of which supports dif ferent degree of individual accountability 2103 for managing the authentication material for grou p identity 2104 ufouo mode 1 single identifier with single unit of authe ntication material the 2105 sets sponsor registers only one identifier for the identity and the kmi associates the 2106 identifier with only one unit of authentication mat erial 2107 ufouo using mode 1 can ensure that only one mem ber of the group uses the identity at 2108 time for example private key can be held in an authentication token that the sponsor controls 2109 through physical personnel and administrative sec urity means see authentication tokens 2110 section thus mode 1 can locally support some deg ree of individual accountability 2111 ufouo mode 2 single identifier with multiple units of au thentication material the 2112 sets sponsor registers only one identifier for the identity but the kmi associates the 2113 identifier with multiple units of authentication ma terial that are different from each other 2114 ufouo mode 2 can be used in at least two ways 2115 kmi 2200 vol 2 unclassifiedfor official use only 30 sept 2005 security policy and related requirements version 2 2 draft unclassifiedfor official use only page 59 1 ufouo use of the identity can be restricted to one member of the user set at time as in 2116 mode 1 while the sponsor also holds one or more ad ditional secondary tokens as backups 2117 for use in case member of the set loses damages or compromises the primary token 2118 2 ufouo the identity can be used by multiple s et members at the same time each of 2119 which holds one of the units of authentication mate rial for example each member can have 2120 personal token that holds different private key 2121 2122 ufouo either way the sets sponsor controls us age by physical personnel and 2123 administrative security means and thus mode 2 can locally support some degree of individual 2124 accountability 2125 ufouo mode 3 multiple identifiers separately authenticated the sets sponsor 2126 registers multiple identifiers for the identity an d the kmi associates each identifier with its 2127 own unit of authentication material ie unit t hat is different for each identifier 2128 ufouo mode 3 can be used in the same ways as mo 2 in addition management of 2129 individual accountability is somewhat enhanced by t he separate identifiers however the 2130 knowledge of the association between an identifier of the group and the actual identity of the 2131 person or device that is currently using that ident ifier is maintained only by the sponsor and is 2132 not known by the kmi see intended use of group i dentities and shared identities section 2133 337 u authentication of shared identity 2134 ufouo authentication of shared identity must support individual accountability appendix 2135 describes potential ways to design authentication procedures to enable users to access the kmi 2136 in shared identity however this specification supports only the following mode 2137 ufouo single identifier with multiple units of authentica tion material as in mode 2 2138 for group identities the sets sponsor registers nly one identifier for the identity and the 2139 kmi associates the identifier with multiple units f authentication material that are different 2140 from each other however the sponsor does not hold authentication material for the set 2141 members instead each member holds and protects it s own unit of authentication material 2142 and the kmi maintains the association between that information and the set 2143 ufouo each set member that uses the shared iden tity presents the same identifier to the 2144 kmi but each uses different authentication materia l with the identifier when the material is 2145 private key the kmi issues separate x509 public key certificate for each user but all the 2146 certificates have the same kmiunique x500 dn in t he subject field thus the kmi needs 2147 way to learn which key should be used for the verif ication step of the authentication service 2148 brute force method is to try each certificate in wh ich the subject is the shared identifier another 2149 method is to require each set member to present the correct certificate along with the identifier 2150 as is sometimes recommended in internet standards nd done in commercial software 2151 ufouo to establish individual accountability wi thin the shared identity the kmi needs 2152 method for learning the singular identity of user of the shared identifier several methods are 2153 possible given the correct certificate the kmi ca n use the issuer dn and serial number stated in 2154 the certificate to learn by querying the certifica issuer which human user holds the private 2155 kmi 2200 vol 2

documentation required as evi dence 5601 ufouo for example the x509 certificate policy for the us department of defense 5602 dodx509cp requires an applicant for medium or h igh assurance certificate to present at 5603 least one federal government official picture ident ification credential such as dod 5604 identification card or passport or two nonfedera l official identification credentials at least one 5605 of which must be photo id such as drivers lic ense the certificate policy permits other 5606 mechanisms of equivalent or greater assurancesuch as comparison of biometric data to 5607 identities preverified to the standards of the certificate policy and obtained via authenticated 5608 interaction with secured databasesto be used as an alternative to presentation of the 5609 credentials 5610 ufouo the requirements of the certificate policy are unnecessarily vague it is possible to 5611 be more precise in specifying the acceptable creden tials to show this subsection a1 presents 5612 worked example of us government requirement to provide evidence for verification of 5613 identity 5614 ufouo the certificate policy also specifies that requests for certificates in t he name of an 5615 organization shall include the organization name ddress and documentation of the existence of 5616 the organization also the certificate management authority is required to verify that 5617 information in addition to the authenticity of the requesting representative and to verify the 5618 representatives authorization to act for the organ ization these requirements are even vaguer

related requirements version 2 2 draft unclassifiedfor official use only page 167 appendix b u accountability with shared identitie s 5736 ufouo this section provides topdown analysis of potential ways to design authentication 5737 procedures to enable user to access the kmi in shared identity however of the six ways 5738 analyzed this specification supports only the one designated 2a 5739 ufouo the basic strategies that are possible ar as follows 5740 1 ufouo first access singular identity and then switch to s hared identity person or 5741 device first accesses the kmi by presenting and aut henticating an identifier that is associated 5742 with singular identity then the kmi enables the user to switch from the singular identity to 5743 shared identity for which the user is authorized 5744 2 ufouo access shared identity without first accessing sing ular identity person or 5745 device directly accesses the kmi in shared identi ty without first establishing session in 5746 shared identity 5747 ufouo in case 1 the kmi establishes individual accountability by requiring the user to 5748 present singular identifier the kmi can then tie that singular identity to the ensuing session 5749 for the shared identity either through audit recor ds or another mechanism there are two ways to 5750 authorize person or device to switch to the share d identity 5751 1a ufouo shared identifier has authentication material after singular authentication 5752 is successful the kmi enables the person or device to switch from the singular identity to 5753 one of the shared identities for which the singular identity has been authorized without going 5754 through second authentication step access to th shared identity could be controlled either 5755 through an access control list or through attribute certificates issued to singular identities 5756 ufouo in kmi use for case 1a might be to clu ster identities to simplify their assignment 5757 to roles however this specification does not support case 1a because case 2 offers ternatives 5758 that are simpler in terms of user interface and kmi mechanism although perhaps not simpler in 5759 terms of managing identifier credentials 5760 1b ufouo shared identifier has authentication material after singular authentication is 5761 successful the authenticated person or device then presents an identifier that is associated 5762 with shared identity to which the user wants to s witch 5763 ufouo this specification does not support case 1b because case 2 offers ternatives that 5764 are simpler in terms of user interface and kmi mech anism also need has been identified for 5765 case 1b either in kmi or in nonkmi systems 5766 ufouo there are four ways to authenticate per or device that accesses kmi directly 5767 through shared identity in case 2 5768 2a ufouo shared identifier separate authentication material 5769 2b ufouo shared identifier shared authentication material 5770 2c ufouo separate identifiers separate authentication mater ial 5771 2d ufouo separate identifiers shared authentication materia l 5772 kmi 2200 vol 2 unclassifiedfor official use only 30 sept 2005 security policy and related requirements version 2 2 draft unclassifiedfor official use only page 168 ufouo this specification now supports case 2a but not 2b 2c or 2d the r ationale for this 5773 is as follows 5774 2a ufouo shared identifier separate authentication material each person or device 5775 that uses the shared identity presents the same ide ntifier to the kmi but each uses different 5776 authentication material to prove its association wi th that identity 5777 ufouo in case 2a when the authentication mater ial is private key the kmi needs way to 5778 determine which public key to use for the verificat ion step of the authentication service an 5779 implementation could try each certificate in which the subject is the shared identifier but it is 5780 more efficient for the singular user to present the correct certificate along with the identifier as is 5781 commonly done in commercial software 5782 ufouo further to establish individual accounta bility in case 2a the kmi needs way to 5783 determine the singular identity of the user this c ould be done with the issuer dn and serial 5784 number of the certificate with subject alternati ve name extension in the certificate or with 5785 some other mechanism 5786 2b ufouo shared identifier shared authentication material each person or device that 5787 uses the shared identity presents the same identifi er to the kmi and each uses the same 5788 authentication material to prove its association wi th that identity 5789 ufouo this specification does not support case 2b for authentication becau individual 5790 accountability cannot be assured when each singul ar user has the same private key then any 5791 user in the set can masquerade as another user in t he set by presenting the other users certificate 5792 to the kmi or any other system 5793 ufouo there are cases in nonkmi systems and p robably also in kmi where multiple 5794 indistinguishable users need to hold the same priva key for the same identifier but such cases 5795 use the key pair to provide data confidentiality rvice and not authentication service for 5796 example in the groupindividual situation mentio ned above for dms all members of team 5797 may need to be able to decrypt queries directed to the group identifier such cases involve 5798 increased risk that the private key might be compro mised 5799 2c ufouo separate identifiers separate authentication mater ial each person or 5800 device that uses the shared identity presents dif ferent identifier to the kmi and uses 5801 different authentication material 5802 ufouo this specification does not support case 2c for authentication becaus even though 5803 implementation is relatively simpler than for case 2a the result is the same as if separate singular 5804 identities were used 5805 2d ufouo separate identifiers shared authentication materia l each person or device 5806 that uses the shared identity presents different identifier to the kmi but each uses the same 5807 authentication material to prove its association wi th that identity 5808 ufouo this specification does not support case 2d for authentication becau 5809 individual accountability cannot be assured when each singular user has the same private 5810 kmi 2200 vol 2 unclassifiedfor official use only 30 sept 2005 security policy and related requirements version 2 2 draft unclassifiedfor official use only page 169 key then any user in the set can masquerade as ano ther user in the set by presenting the other 5811 users certificate to the kmi or any other system as in case 2b there are cases where 5812 multiple distinguishable users need to hold the sam private key but such cases 5813 confidentiality service and not authentication serv ice for example all members of team 5814 may need to be able to decrypt any message directed to any individual team member 5815 5816 kmi 2200 vol 2 unclassifiedfor official use only 30 sept 2005 security policy and related requirements version 2
