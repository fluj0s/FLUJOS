security comparison of major provisions of s 1214 and hr 3983 summary congress is considering legislation to enhance security at us seaports the september 11 terrorist attack has raised concerns that sea container could be used to transport weapon of mass destruction an interagency commission on crime and security at us ports found that with few exceptions the level of security at us ports was poor to fair this report compares major provisions in s 1214 which passed the senate with an amendment and hr 3983 which passed the house as amended five areas of the legislation are examined federal funding plans and programs for coordinating security efforts to enhance foreign seaport security cargo security provisions and restrictions on access to certain areas within port as of november 12 2002 conferees were working to resolve differences between the house and senate versions of the legislation although both bills cover many of the same issues there are differences in emphasis these differences may be largely explained by the timing of the bills s 1214 was introduced before september 11 while hr 3983 was introduced six months after that date hr 3983 is most concerned with deterring and minimizing damage from possible terrorist act s 1214 is concerned with deterring terrorism but also with reducing drug smuggling cargo theft trade fraud and illegal alien smuggling s 1214 was introduced before the establishment of the transportation security administration tsa in november 2001 and thus contains reference to it hr 3983 is posttsa and calls upon the agency among other things to develop an antiterrorism cargo identification and screening system sidebyside comparison of selected provisions of s 1214 and hr 3983 is provided in table 1 contents introduction 1

introduction the 107th congress is considering legislation to enhance security at us seaports the issue is how to tighten control over maritime commerce in practical manner that does not impede its flow this report provides comparison between major provisions in s1214 the port and maritime security act and hr 3983 the maritime transportation antiterrorism act senator hollings introduced s 1214 on july 20 2001 and it passed the senate with an amendment on december 20 2001 representative don young introduced hr 3983 on march 18 2002 and it passed the house as amended on june 4 2002 both houses have named members for conference committee on the bill as of november 12 2002 conferees were working to resolve differences between the house and senate versions of the legislation this comparison will focus on five areas of the legislation federal funding provisions plans and programs for coordinating seaport security international maritime security provisions cargo security provisions and limitations on access to sensitive areas within port sidebyside comparison of selected provisions of s 1214 and hr 3983 is provided in table 1 although both bills cover many of the same issues there are differences in emphasis these differences may be largely explained by the timing of the bills s 1214 was introduced before september 11 while hr 3983 was introduced six months after that date as the title of hr 3983 implies it is most concerned with deterring and minimizing damage from possible terrorist act s 1214 is concerned with deterring terrorism but also with reducing drug smuggling cargo theft trade fraud and illegal alien smuggling s 1214 was introduced to address security issues raised by the interagency commission on crime and security in us ports the seaport commission the seaport commission was comprised of representatives from 17 federal agencies and cochaired by the maritime administration marad customs service and the justice department it reported its findings in the fall of 2000 and found security at us seaports to be generally poor to fair with some exceptions1 1 the report is available at httpuscgmiloverviewicssrptpdf crs2 s 1214 was introduced before the establishment of the transportation security administration tsa in november 2001 and thus contains reference to it hr 3983 is posttsa and calls upon the agency to collect passenger and crew manifest data and to develop and maintain an antiterrorism identification tracking and screening system for sea containers levels of funding the funding provisions in s 1214 are directed more toward specific areas than those in hr 3983 the seaport commission estimated before september 11 that enhancing security at us ports would cost between 10 to 50 million per port s 1214 would add new title xiv to the merchant marine act of 1936 to authorize and provide loan guarantees and grants for port security infrastructure improvements the loan guarantee regulations would be similar to those that exist under the existing title xi loan guarantee program for shipbuilding and shipyards security infrastructure improvements could include gates fences and lighting surveillance and video systems the bill makes available to the department of transportation dot subject to appropriation 9 million annually for fy2003 2006 for loan guarantee costs and authorizes an additional 26 million annually for the same years according to senate commerce committee summary of the legislation using regular federal credit risk premium calculations this level of funding could provide up to 700 million annually in loans for fy20032006 the bill provides 10 million in annual grants for seaport security enhancements and authorizes an additional 70 million per year in grants the bill provides funding to assist the customs service for the purchase of nonintrusive screening and detection equipment for ocean containers the bill provides from 15 million to 19 million be made available from tonnage tax receipts for each fiscal year 20032006 the bill authorizes an additional 20 million each year for this same purpose for fy2002 only the bill authorizes 145 million to the customs service for 1200 new customs inspectors 300 new customs agents and for purchase of support equipment the bill provides 1 million each year from fy2003 2006 to establish shared dockside inspection facilities at seaports these facilities would be shared by the customs service the department of agriculture and the coast guard for inspecting cargo containers additional funding is provided for establishing local port security committees training maritime security professionals conducting port vulnerability assessments developing technology for detecting criminal activity and other items s 1214 would extend through fiscal year 2006 the increase in vessel tonnage duties that was enacted in 1990 by pl 101508 these tonnage duties would be used to partly offset the spending provisions of the bill hr 3983 does not provide loan guarantees for infrastructure improvements it does provide 83 million in grants to seaports for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2005 like the grants provided in s 1214 the federal grant would not exceed 75 crs3 of the total cost of project unless the dot determines that this requirement should be waved for particular project for projects costing less than 25000 there are matching requirements in either bill both bills require grant applicants to provide the same information to the dot for evaluating grant proposals hr 3983 includes authorization of appropriations for the coast guard see crs report rs20924 homeland security coast guard legislation in the 107th congress for further information plans and programs for coordinating seaport security jurisdiction over us ports is shared by federal state and local governments the federal agencies with the greatest presence at us ports are the coast guard customs service immigration and naturalization service and the department of agriculture these agencies are included in the presidents proposal for new department of homeland security major point of discussion in enhancing seaport security is coordinating the activities of all levels of government as well as the private sector to prevent conflict and overlap of responsibilities while improving information sharing among agencies both bills call for security plans to be developed at the national local and port facility level both bills also require vulnerability assessments be conducted at the port level s 1214 requires the secretary of transportation to establish national maritime security advisory committee this committee would have up to 21 members appointed by the secretary and made up of individuals from other departments and agencies in the federal state or local government including law enforcement the committee would be charged with coordinating seaport security enhancement among local port authorities keeping them informed of developments in security issues and providing guidance for awarding loans and grants for security improvements the committee would disband on september 30 2005 at the local level s 1214 calls for the establishment of local port security committees which would comprise federal state and local government officials law enforcement personnel from all levels of government port authority personnel representatives from port labor organizations and representatives from the private sector the coast guards existing captainoftheport would be charged with establishing these committees at hisher port of jurisdiction the secretary of transportation would be required to develop standards and procedures for conducting port vulnerability assessments at each port that the secretary deems appropriate the secretary could accept security evaluations already completed during the previous five years the local port security committee would review and comment on the port vulnerability assessment the local port security committee would also be consulted in the development of maritime facility security plans these plans would be submitted by each port authority or waterfront facility operator to the secretary for approval the plan would indicate how the overall physical security of the port would be maintained crs4 how access would be controlled to the port and its facilities the procedures for processing cargo passengers and crew and create evacuation plans in case of an emergency s 1214 also calls for the creation of national maritime transportation security plan area maritime security plans and vessel security plans the plans would prescribe procedures for preventing and responding to maritime crimes and terrorism these plans are very similar to the plans in hr 3983 which are described below hr 3983 calls for national maritime transportation antiterrorism plan that is intended to deter and minimize damage from terrorist act the plan would assign duties and responsibilities among federal state and local government agencies and establish system of surveillance to safeguard against and provide the earliest possible notice of terrorist act at the local level hr 3983 calls for area maritime transportation antiterrorism plans that are intended to deter terrorist acts within the area covered by the plan the plan would describe the area covered including populated areas or areas with special economic environmental or national security importance these plans would be developed by coast guard official designated as the federal maritime antiterrorism coordinator and reviewed and approved by the dot hr 3983 calls for vulnerability assessments to be conducted at each port the dot believes have high risk of catastrophic emergency hr 3983 also calls for vessel and facility antiterrorism plans these plans would be prepared by ocean carriers and port facility operators the plans would describe the training drills and antiterrorism actions of vessel or facility personnel to deter terrorism the plans would identify the individual responsible for implementing antiterrorism actions and the individual who would serve as the point of contact with federal officials provisions to increase foreign seaport security some maritime security experts have advocated greater focus on country of origin security rather than limiting security concerns just to us ports of unloading they view maritime commerce as global transportation system which can best be secured by preventing suspicious container from entering the system at the point of origin they assert that it is too late to discover dirty nuclear bomb in sea container when it reaches us port of unloading pushing the borders back is challenge because most countries including the united states have fewer systems in place to examine export cargo than import cargo both bills include provisions that would identify foreign ports with us trade ties that have inadequate security and provisions to enhance the scrutiny of ships and cargo arriving from those ports s 1214 calls upon the secretary of transportation after consultation with the secretary of the treasury to prohibit or prescribe conditions for vessels arriving from foreign port it has identified as not secure in addition the president can deny entry crs5 to vessels arriving from certain foreign ports and suspend trade with certain foreign ports if the president determines that the ports threaten the safety and security of passengers and cargo traveling to or from those ports the bill also instructs the secretary of transportation to report annually to congress all foreign flag vessels that have arrived in the united states whose vessel registration may be suspect hr 3983 like the senate bill also calls upon the dot to identify foreign ports that pose security risk to the united states specifically it charges the dot to identify foreign ports that pose high risk of introducing terrorism to maritime commerce based on the foreign ports cargo screening capability the foreign ports restrictions on access to certain areas and the ports certification of compliance with security standards if the dot finds foreign ports security measures are inadequate it will inform the foreign government and recommend steps to improve security if the foreign port fails to take corrective action within 90 days the dot can prescribe conditions for ships and cargo entering the united states from those ports the bill does not specify what these conditions could include the dot can deny entry if its conditions are not met cargo security provisions provisions to improve the timeliness and accuracy of cargo information submitted by shippers and to improve the physical security of containers themselves are included in both bills sea containers have been primary focus of discussions on port security about seven million containers arrive at us ports per year the customs service reviews manifest information for anomalies and targets specific containers for physical inspection it physically inspects about 2 of imported containers the dot is also concerned with the security of sea containers the dot created task force to examine marine container security issues in october 2001 in february 2002 the task force submitted classified report that according to dot press release made recommendations for improving the quality and timeliness of cargo information that is transmitted to federal agencies and to improve the physical security of the container itself the dot inspector generals office announced in february 2002 that it was conducting an audit of the coast guards hazardous materials container inspection program2 s 1214 would amend the tariff act of 1930 to require carrier to provide cargo manifest information by electronic transmission in advance of port entry or clearance and in such manner time and form as the secretary of the treasury prescribes the bill also requires the customs service to be notified of any improperly documented cargo remaining in port for more than 48 hours customs is authorized to seize and search such cargo the bill would require prearrival electronic transmission of the consignor consignee country of origin and classification code of goods for cargo moving under the inbond system the secretaries of transportation and treasury would be required to establish task force to develop system for tracking containers possibly through the use of global positioning system gps technology and develop standards for container seals and locks to prevent cargo tampering 2 more information available at httpwwwoigdotgovitem_detailsphpitem683 crs6 vessels entering us waters would be required to submit prearrival messages to the coast guard in sufficient time for the coast guard to review the information for security and safety reasons hr 3983 contains provisions specifically directed towards sea containers the bill requires the transportation security administration to develop an antiterrorism cargo identification and screening system for containerized cargo tsa must also develop standards to improve the physical security of the containers themselves including standards for seals and locks the bill requires ocean carriers to provide tsa with crew and passenger manifests in advance of vessels arrival in the united states cargo information must be submitted to the customs service in advance of port entry the customs service would consult with other federal agencies in issuing regulations on submitting cargo information and would share cargo information with appropriate federal departments limiting access to areas within port s 1214 and hr 3983 include provisions limiting access to areas within port hr 3983 specifically mentions development of security cards the tsa is currently developing standardized credentialing system for transportation workers in all modes the cards would use smart card or biometric technologies to securely link the individual to the card3 s 1214 requires that the maritime facility security plan include designation of controlled access areas within port and limited access to securitysensitive information such as passenger and cargo manifests the secretary of transportation may prescribe regulations that require physical searches of persons entering certain port areas security escorts and background checks for persons granted unrestricted access persons granted unrestricted access must not have felony conviction within the previous seven years or release from prison within the last five years the secretary can approve alternative security arrangements for an individual who otherwise would be disqualified from securitysensitive position an appeals process will be available for individuals found to be ineligible for employment hr 3983 calls for the dot to issue transportation security cards which will be used in identifying personnel with access to sensitive areas within the port the dot can deny cards to individuals it believes pose terrorism security risk denial can be based on the fact that the individual has been convicted of felony as defined by the secretary or if the individual would be denied admission to the united states or removed from the united states under the immigration and nationality act the secretary can give consideration to any circumstances surrounding disqualifying act or restitution made by the individual and may consider other factors from which it may be concluded that the individual does not pose terrorism security risk an appeals process will be available for individuals found to be ineligible for security card 3 more information is available at httpwwwtsadotgov crs7 role of the coast guard s 1214 and hr 3983 contain provisions involving the coast guard that are nearly identical in both bills the coast guard is authorized to board vessels with sea marshals to deter or respond to acts of terrorism both bills also would extend the seaward jurisdiction of the coast guard from three miles from shore to 12 miles for further information on the role of the coast guard in homeland security
