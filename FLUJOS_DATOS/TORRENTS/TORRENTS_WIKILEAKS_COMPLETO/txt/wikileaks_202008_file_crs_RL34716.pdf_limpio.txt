do not automa tically forfeit their offices upon conviction of crime that constitutes felony express constitutional disability or disqualification from congress exists fo r the conviction of crime

the status and service of that memb er is not directly affected by any federal statute or rule of the senate ri ghts or privileges are forfeited under the constitution statutory law or the rules of

congress there is comparable senate rule6 congressional discipline indictment each house of congress has th express authority under article i section 5 clause 2 of the united states constitution to punish member for disorderly behaviour and with the concu rrence of twothirds to expel member although the breadth of authority and disc retion within the senate and house as to the timing nature and underlyi ng conduct involved in an internal discipline of member of that body is extensive the trad itional practice in congress in cases where member of congress has been indicted has been to wait to impose congressional discipline such as expulsion or censure against the member until the question of guilt has been at least initially resolved through the judicial system7 members of congress of course like ma ny other individuals have been indicted and charged with various offenses and then been subse quently exonerated in judicial proceedings both the senate and the house have thus been reluctant to remove from congress individuals who have been lawfully elected to represent their constituents based merely upon charges in an indictment howe ver impediment in law or rule exists for ongoing congressional inquiries concurrent with criminal proceedings although such actions may complicate some evidentiary issues in subsequent judicial proceedings and certain intern concurrent congressional inquiries have in the past been postponed or partially deferred because of arrangem ents with the department of justice8 an attempt to mandatorily suspend an indicted or convicted member from voting or participating in congressional proceed ings raises several issues in general elected senators are not in the same situa tion as persons appointed to positions in the government with indefinite tenure nor as private professionals who might be suspended for period of time merely upon suspicion or charges being levied because members of congress are directly elected by answerable to and personally represent the people of their state or district in the congress the authority of either house to mandatorily suspend member from participati on in congressionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34716crs4 9 although early authorities indicated that the power to suspend member from proceedings was an inherent authority analogous to the right of expulsion see cushing law and practice of legislative assemblies section 627 p 2519th ed 1874 substantive arguments and questions have been raised conc erning the power of the house or senate in this regard see for example discussion in ii hinds precedents 1665 1907 regarding action on senators tillman and mclaurin for fighting on the floor of the senate see also deschlers precedents chapter 12 15 h doc 94661 at 187 1976 noting that the house has indicated its more recent vi ew that member could not be deprived involuntarily of his right to vote in the house mandatory suspension members agreed would deprive the district which the member was elected to represent of representation 121 cong rec 10341 april 16 1975 10 srept 97187 supra at 1011 although the committee was of the opinion that its unanimous recommendation of expulsion refl ects its strong conviction that its own determination of this matter and that of the senate must be made independently of the jurys verdict or the outcome of the appeal because the ruling on the appeal was expected to be handed down shortly the committee recommended that the senate proceed expeditiously to final disposition of the forego ing resolution only when judge pratt has ruled on the aforesaid motions 11 the jurisdiction delegated by the senate to the senate select committee on ethics as set out in the committee rules includes investig ating and adjudicating complaints allegations or information that any senator has violated law the senate code of conduct or any rule or regulation of the senate relating to the conduct of any individual in the performance of his or her duty as member or has engaged in improper conduct which may reflect upon the senate rules of procedure sena select committee on ethics s prt 1097 rule 2 2005 see sres 338 88th cong 2d sess sec 2 1964 as amendedbusiness has thus been questioned on grounds of both policy and power because such action would in effect disenfranchise that members constituency deprive the people of their full constitutional representation in congress and would not allow the constituents to replace member such as they could after an expulsion action9 conviction conviction of crime may subj ect member of the senate to internal disciplinary action including re solution for censure of the member up to and including an expulsion from congress upon twothirds vote of the members of the senate present and voting the nate has demonstrated that in cases of conviction of member of crimes that relate to official misconduct that the institution need not wait until all the senators appeals are exhausted but that the senate may independently investigate and adjudicate the underlying factual circumstances involved in th judicial proceedings regardless of the potential legal or procedural issues that may be raised and resolved on appeal10 specific guidelines exist regarding actionable grounds for congressional discipline under the constitutional authority of each house to punish its own members each house of congress s significant discretion to discipline misconduct that the membership finds to be worthy of censure reprimand or expulsion from congress11 when the most severe sanction of expulsion has been actually employed in the senate and in th house of representatives however the conduct has historically invol ved either disloyalty to the united states or the violation

addition to expulsion the senate as an institution may take other disciplinary actions against one of its members includi ng censure or fine the senate like the house of representatives s taken broad

worthy of rebuke or condemnation16 censure by the senate whereby the full senate adopts by majority vote formal resolution of disapprova l of member may therefore encompass conduct that does not vi

before his ection or in preceding or former congress is sustained by the practice of the house sanctioned by reason and sound policy and in extreme cases is absolutely essential to enab the house to exclude from its deliberations and councils notoriously corrupt men who have unexpectedly and suddenly dishonored themselves and betrayed the public by acts and conduct rendering them unworthy of the high position of honor and trust reposed in them but in considering this question and in arriving at the conclusions we have reached we would not have you ndful of the fact that we have been dealing with the question merely as one of power and it should not be confused with the question of policy also involved as matter of sound policy this extraordinary prerogative of the house in our judgment should be exercised only in extreme cases and always with great cauti on and after due circumspection and should be invoked with greatest caution where the acts of misconduct complained of had become public previous to and were generally known at the time of the members election to exercise such power in that instance the hous might abuse its high prerogative and in our opinion might exceed the just limitations of its cons titutional authority by seeking to substitute its standards and ideals for the sta ndards and ideals of the constituency of the member who had deliberately chosen him to be their representative the effect of such policy would tend not to preserve but to unde rmine and destroy representative governmentmisconduct and still sent the member to the senate17 the apparent reticence of the senate or house to expel member for past misconduct after the member has been duly elected or reelected by the qualified electors of state with knowledge of the members conduct appears to reflect the ference traditionally pa id in our heritage to the popular will and election choice of the people18 the authority to expel would thus be used cautiously when the institution of congress might be seen as usurping or supplanting its own institutional judgment for the judgment of the electorate as to the character or fitness for office of an individual whom the people have chosen to represent them in congress19 recall concerning sitting member of the senate or house who is either indicted for or convicted of felony offense it should be noted that the united states
