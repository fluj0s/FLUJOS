ambassador to the us on pakistani president musharrafs visit to saudi arabia classified by charge daffaires michael gfoeller for reasons 14 b nd d 1 s on november 20 saudi arabian ambassador to the us adel aljubeir invited the charge daffaires and executive office staff assistant note taker to his residence for lunch during the meal ambassador aljubeir said that pakistani president pervez musharraf arrived in saudi arabia today november 20 and will meet with king abdullah foreign minister prince saud alfaisal and head of the general intelligence presidency prince muqrin bin abdulaziz after he completes umra in mecca he noted that musharraf will meet with the foreign minister and prince muqrin first and thereafter see king abdullah sometime in the evening the purpose of these meetings said aljubeir is to get readout of the situation and present our point of view to him 2 s aljubeir denied that musharraf had come to the kingdom to meet with exiled former pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif although he carefully avoided ruling out such meeting instead he boldly asserted that we in saudi arabia are not observers in pakistan we are participants he asserted that the saudi government sag had offered sharif pledge of protection and asylum in the kingdom after his ouster by musharraf in return for promise that he would refrain from political activity for ten years he added that sharif had begun to attempt to test the limits of this promise five or six years in his exile sharif broke his promise by conducting political activity while in the kingdom aljubeir charged he added that when the sag had permitted sharif to travel to london he first promised the saudis not to engage in political activity or return to pakistan but he then flew to pakistan from london in direct violation of his commitment 3 s aljubeir expressed considerable disappointment in sharifs broken pledges to the sag he stated very clearly that the sag has worked directly with musharraf to have sharif arrested on his return to pakistan and immediately deported to the kingdom we told musharraf that we would receive him back and then keep him here as an honored guest aljubeir said he added that prince muqrin had been the sags point man in restraining sharif prince muqrin was allowed to reveal the terms of sharifs asylum agreement he noted aljubeir made it very clear that the sag would seek to control sharifs movements in he future even suggesting that he would be kept in state only little less severe than house arrest 4 s aljubeir added that he sees neither sharif nor former prime minister benazir bhutto as viable replacement for musharraf with all his flaws he said of musharraf he is the only person that you or we have to work with now he claimed that sharif would be unable to control the pushtundominated islamic insurgency in the tribal region near afghanistan while bhutto would prove to be too divisive figure to rule the country which he characterized as very tribal much like our own country 5 s aljubeir added that for the sag stability in pakistan is an essential strategic matter since pakistan possesses both nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles from the saudi point of view the policy choice to be made there boils down to drastic choice we can either support musharraf and stability or we can allow bin laden to get the bomb he told the charge 6 s comment as senior royal advisor who has worked for king abdullah for eight years now aljubeirs views generally track very closely with those of the king it seems likely that king abdullah prince muqrin and prince saud alfaisal will offer musharraf pledges of strong support in their meetings today we note that the saudis have an economic hold on nawaz sharif sine he was reportedly the first nonsaudi to receive special economic development loan from the sag with which to develop business while here in exile we will report further information on these meetings as it develops end comment gfoeller
