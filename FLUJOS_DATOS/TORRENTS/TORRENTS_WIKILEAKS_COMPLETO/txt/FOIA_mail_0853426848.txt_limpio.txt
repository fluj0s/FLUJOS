from richard warrick cearsrwaikatoacnz to mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk subject re scengen and cctrain date thu 16 jan 1997 100048 1300 dear mike thanks for your detailed reply concerning scengen and cctrain i was not proposing to incorporate scengen in major way into the training package and i am quite aware of the problems of consistency regarding aerosol effects natural variability etc rather i thought that the training package would be an excellent way to introduce the existence of scengen and magicc to the country teams which are responsible for coordinating national assessments the intention was not to provide intensive technical training in its use the country team members are largely coordinators not technical climate experts in this way when it comes time to actually carry out the national assessments scengen would be recognised as major tool for scenario generation and if appropriate cru could be contacted regarding its application technical training or collaboration you had mentioned to at the ipcc meeting in london that one of your major aims was to get scengen recognised as the standard for scenario generation for impact assessments and i simply thought i saw way of furthering that aim through the cctrain mechanism given the training programmes that you are currently proposing through enrich and others i can understand your fears that we might muddy the waters let pose the following options that we 1 use some hardcopy examples from scengen 2 incorporate demonstration diskette do you have one 3 just mention the existence of scengen 4 not mention scengen at all frankly i am quite happy with any of these the part on climate change scenarios is really only small bit of the overall va training package in any case good luck with your proposals cheers dick from mike hulmesmtpmhulmeueaacuk sent thursday 16 january 1997 0045 to richard warrick cc mkellyueaacuk timcarterfmifi wigleyncarucaredu subject re scengen and cctrain dick and happy new year to you also youve posed tricky one re scengen and my answer about it being incorporated into the cctrain package as component tool is going to have to be let explain we too here have plans to exploit scengen and magicc in trainingeducational context i ran pilot seminar here for unep before christmas on scenario construction although this was using the new windowsunix versions of both magicc and scengen magicc 2 and scengen 2 ipcc 1995 compatible we have rewritten also i have just submitted proposal called sparccs to enrich in dgxii for support package for regional climate change scenarios this would be 2year project with emissions people as well as magicc scengen and our new global historic climatology i think we have good chance of funding with this background i do not want scengen and especially the old dos version leaking out into the climate training community at this stage i am confirmed in this view by thinking that the complex issues surrounding scenario creation and the new ipcc taskgroup on scenarios for the 3rd assessment is grappling with these ask tim carter about it should _not_ be an essential part of vulnerabilityadaptation package and even if you think differently then let suggest the following if you think it should be minor part then i do not think that you need scengen formally incorporated if you think it should be major part then not only do i think you are wrong in thinking so but there is more to the scenario issue than can be supplied by scengen for example you need magicc you need to consider how you handle aerosols and you need to think about natural variability and signalnoise issues my feeling is that by all means use scengen within cears in thinking about the training package and coming up with some offline examples either sample scenarios or guided sensitivity but do _not_ incorporate it in the package by the way scengen does not have imaginery countries if people want more detailed thinking on scenarios then you could always refer them to cru which is what our speciality is i hope you understand my feelings on this i am not trying to be negative but am thinking ahead and about the complexity of the scenario issue i have talked with tim carter recently at some length about some of these things so i will copy this correspondence to him good luck with cctrain anyway and im sure youll come up with something good regards mike at 1441 100197 1300 you wrote dear mike happy new years greetings from downunder i have question for you regarding scengen that relates to training package which cears have agreed to develop for cctrain under unitar cctrain is currently developing about four such training packages pertaining to climate change of which cears has agreed to undertake one on vulnerability and adaptation assessment the va and other packages are supposed to be flexible enough to be used under variety of regional and country contexts these packages build upon existing guidelines and manuals eg carter et als ipcc guidelines and are designed for trainers who will be conducting training workshops for the coordinators of national assessments the cctrain country teams beginning on 21 january tim carter will be here for 3 weeks as will stephanie lenhart us country studies program in order to help with this task the va training modules will closely follow the ipcc guidelines i have proposed developing the package as kind of roleplaying simulation exercise in which the participants carry out miniassessment for hypothetical country one of the major steps in the assessment of course is the development of climate change scenarios i thought it would be very effective to use scengen for this purpose and to make scengen component tool of the training package can i use scengen for this purpose one possible advantage of doing so is that scengen could facto quickly become the standard method used by various country teams in carrying out national assessments for unfccc reporting or is this not an advantage please advise on how i should proceed best wishes to all at cru cheers dick dr mike hulme tel 44 1603 593162 climatic research unit fax 44 1603 507784 school of environmental
