service has estimated that 5 million aliens were residing here unlawfully as of october 1996 of this estimated population about three fifths entered surreptitiously called ewis for entered without inspection and about twofifths overstayed nonimmigrant visas eg tourist visas employment appears to be the primary magnet but there also are other motives for illegal residency for example spouses and children of legal immigrants and certain relatives of citizens may establish illegal residence to bypass long waiting lists for immigrant visas the following are among the disabilities iirira attaches to illegal presence some of these target both ewis and visa overstayers some target ewis only ewis as inadmissible aliens until the 104th congress an alien who entered surreptitiously was removable through deportation proceedings however the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 aedpa pl 104132 made ewis removable through exclusion proceedings which are less favorable to the alien with respect to burden of proof and possible relief from removal the aedpa also potentially made ewis subject to removal under new expedited exclusion proceedings in which an aliens rights were even more circumscribed iirira continued the changes made in the aedpa by making ewis inadmissible aliens the acts term that corresponds to excludable under earlier law iirira further authorized the attorney general to apply expedited removal procedures to ewis who cannot show that they have been continuously present here for 2 years nevertheless the attorney general has declined to exercise this authority under proposed regulationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97295crs2 inadmissibility of illegal residents who left without having been subject to removal proceedings iirira makes an alien who is

authorized stay has expired but who before expiration of authorized status filed nonfrivolous application for change or extension of status unless the alien works without authorization additionally the attorney general may waive inadmissibility for spouse or or daughter of citizen or permanent resident if refusal of admission would result in extreme hardship to the citizen or permanent resident inadmissibility of removed or longterm illegal residents who enter or attempt to reenter illegally iirira makes indefinitely inadmissible an alien who 1 has been ordered removed or has been unlawfully present for an aggregate period of longer than year and 2 enters or attempts to reenter without being formally admitted there is express exception under this rule for acts occurring prior to april

iirira increases from 1 year to 5 years the period during which an alien who was previously removed on arrival is inadmissible this disability period also apparently applies to ewis who are removed after arrival under expedited removal proceedings iirira sets 20year period of inadmissibility for aliens who have been removed on arrival more than once and an indefinite period of inadmissibility for aliens convicted of an aggravated felony apparently these increased disabilities apply only with respect to removals occurring after april 1 1997 separately the inadmissibility period for aliens ordered removed under other provisions ie ordered removed after arrival other than under expedited removal provisions is increased to 10 years with 20year period set for aliens removed more than once and an indefinite period of inadmissibility set for aliens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony inadmissibility under the foregoing rules may be waived by the attorney general iirira and adjustment of status under 245i of the ina section 245i of the immigration and nationality act permits an ewi to adjust to legal resident status without leaving the us once visa becomes available as an immediate relative or under visa preference category iirira increases the application fee for 245i adjustments to 1000 and earmarks at least 800 of this amount for new immigration detention account authority to adjust under 245i sunsets september 30 1997 while 245i generates significant amount of fees some view it as an incentive for family members to reside here unlawfully until visa becomes available to them
