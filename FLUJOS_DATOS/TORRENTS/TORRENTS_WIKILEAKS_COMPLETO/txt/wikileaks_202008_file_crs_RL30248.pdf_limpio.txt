response to concerns expressed by many job seekers nd employers about the delivery of dolfunded employment and training services as well as dissatisfaction with the provision of job information dol launched the onestop career cente r system initiative in 1993 as means to more effectively link the delivery f employment and training services the department of labor received funding for the onestop

information and service delivery system four principles were central to the onestop initiative universality program integration customer choice and performance accountability the department of labo r encouraged states to use these four principles as the basis for cultivating workforce development systems that streamline the delivery of employment and training services to effectively meet the n
