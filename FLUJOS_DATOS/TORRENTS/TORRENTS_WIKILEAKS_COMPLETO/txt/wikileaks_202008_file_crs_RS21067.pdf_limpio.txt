fundamental policy assumption that s changed between the us ratification of the 1992 framework convention on climate change fccc and the current bush administrations decision to abandon the ky oto protocol process concerns costs1 the ratification of the fccc was based at least partially on the premise that significant reductions could be achieved at little or cost this assumption helped to reduce concern some had including those of the fo rmer bush administration that the treaty could have deleterious effects on us competitiveness significant consideration because developing countries are treated differently from developed countries under the fccc further ameliorating this concern compliance with the treaty was voluntary while the united states could aim to reduce its emissions in line with the fcccs goal if the effort indeed involved substantial costs the united states could fail to r each the goal as has happened without incu rring any penalty under the treaty this flexibility would have been elimin ated under the kyoto protocol with its mandatory reduction requirements the possibility of failure to comply with binding commitment intensifies ones perspective on potential costs how confident can one behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21067crs2 2 for further discussion of the foundations for such divergent cost estimates see crs report 98738 global climate change

proposed co2 reduction schemes present large uncertainties in terms of the perceived reduction needs and the potential co sts of achieving those reductions in an attempt to prevent any co2 control program from incurring unacceptable costs several costlimiting safety valves have been proposed to bound costs these safety valves are designed to work with marketbased co2 reduction schemes similar to the tradeable permit strategy used by the acid rain program5 and would effectively limit the unit per ton of emissions control costs sources would pa this report examines four such safety valves 1 straight carbon tax 2 c ontingent reduction sche 3 unlimited permit purchases 4 costbased excess emissions penalties the dilemma price versus quantity in general marketbased mechanisms to reduce co2 emissions focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level quantity or complia nce costs price and allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable for example tradeable permit program ts the amount of emissions allowable under the program ie the number of permits available caps allowable emissions while permitting the marketplace to termine what each permit w ill be worth likewise carbon tax sets the maximum unit per ton of co2 cost that one should pay for reducing emissions while the marketplace determines how much actually gets reduced in one sense preference for carbon tax or tradeab permit system depe nds on how one views the uncertainty of costs involve d and benefits to be received for those confident that achieving specific level of co2 reduction will yield significant benefits enough so that even the potentially very high end of the marginal cost curve does not bother them tradeable permit program may be most appropriate co2 emissions would be reduced to specific level and in the case of tradeable permit program the cost involved would be handl ed efficiently though not controlled at specific cost level this efficiency ccurs because through the trading of per mits emission reduction efforts concentrate at sources at which controls can be achieved at least cost however if one feels more certain of the potential downside risk of substantial control costs to the economy than of the bene fits of specific level of reduction then ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21067crs3 6 finland the netherlands sweden

or just another tax crs report 92623 enr august 4 1992carbon tax may be most ppropriate in this approach the level of the tax effectively caps the marginal cost of control that aff ected activities would pay under the reductions scheme but the pr ecise level of co2 achieved is less certain emitters of co2 would spend money controlling co2 emissions up to the level of the tax however since the marginal cost of control among millions of emitters is not well known the overall emissions reductions for given tax level on co2 emissions cannot be accurately forecast hence major policy question is whether one is more concerned about the possible economic cost of the program and therefore willing to accept some uncertainty about the amount of reduction received ie carbon ta xes or one is mo re concerned about achieving specific emission reduction level with costs handled efficiently but not capped ie tradeable permits model for tradeable permit approach is the sulfur dioxide so2 allowance program contained in title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments also called the acid rain control program the tradeable permit system is based on two premises first set amount of so2 emitted by human activities can be assimilated by the ecological system without undue harm thus the goal of the program is to put ceiling or cap on the total emissions of so2 rather than limit ambient concen trations second market in pollution licenses between polluters is the most costeffective means of achieving given reduction this market in pollution licenses r allowances each of which is equal to one ton of so2 is designed so that owners of allo wances can trade those allowances with other emitters who need them or retain bank them for future use or sale initially most allowances were allocated by the federal government to utilities according to statutory formulas related to given facilitys historic fuel use and emissions other allowances have been reserved by the government for pe riodic auctions to ensure market liquidity there are existing us models of an emissions tax although five european countries have carbonbased taxes6 safety valves as stalemate has continued on strategies to control co2 emissions particularly because of costs fears attention increasingly focuses on the costli miting benefit of carbon tax either as the primary strategy or as component blending carbon tax with the reduction certainty of the tradeable permit system the object is to create safety valve to avert unacceptable control costs particularly in the short term these safety valves limit unit per ton costs of reducing emissions four ideas are identified below carbon taxes generally conceived as levy on natural gas petroleum and coal according to their carbon conten t in the approximate ratio of 06 to 08 to 1 respectively7 however proposals have been made to imposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21067crs4 8 the national commission on energy policy ending the energy st alemate bipartisan strategy

permits at set price generally conceived as part of an auction system where permits are allocated to affected sectors by auction with an unlimited number available at specifi c price the most recent proposal is by the national commission on energy policy which recommends an initial limiting price of 7ton that would increase by 5 annually8 other variations include the resources fo r the futureskytrust proposal which would increase the limiting price 25ton by 7 above inflation annually and the brookings proposal which would set up shortterm market based on 10ton price and longterm market based on market rates9 contingent reduction generally c onceived as declining emission cap system where the rate of decline over time is determined by the market price of permits if permit prices remain under set threshold prices the next reduction in the emission cap is implemented if not the cap is held at the current level until prices decline10 discussions have centered on 2 annual declining cap subject to 5 permit co2 cost cap excess emissions penalty genera lly involves fee on emissions exceeding available permits based on control costs or other economic criteria rather than criminal or civil considerations for example oregons co2 standard for new energy facilities includes fee of 57 cents per short ton on co2 emissions in excess of the standard increase to 85 cents

costfocused strategy with reductions achieved dependent on the tax imposedstrategy can be implemented either upstream or downstream can also be implemented across different economic sectorsstrategy is self enforcingstrategy would generate sizeable revenues that could be recycled or used for other priorities unlimited permits at set pricea transitional strategy from costfocused to reduction focused emission reductions dependent on the price set for excess emissions permitsstrategy places focus on the excess emissions permits initial price and the schedule of any prices increases or excess emissions permit phaseout over time besides requiring the usual monitoring tracking mechanisms of tradeable permit system strategy requires system to separately track allocations of excess emission permitsa low price for excess emission permits could have the effect of flooding the permit trading market discouraging any trading contingent reductionsan interactive strategy where costs determine reductions and reductions determine costs through market mechanism emission reductions dependent on freely functioning permit marketstrategy requires agreement on emission reduction schedules appropriate permits prices to trigger those schedules and the specific price determination mechanism spot vs longterm pricesbesides requiring the usual monitoring tracking mechanisms of tradeable permit system strategy requires major oversight of permit market operationspotential market manipulation to avoid increased reduction requirements is serious issue excess emissions penaltyan incremental strategy where reductions achieved are dependent on the penalty imposedstrategy places focus on initial penalty and any scheduled increases in that penalty over timerequires the usual monitoring tracking mechanisms of tradeable permit system onlystrategy is most similar to existing tradeable permit systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21067crs6 if one uses the existing title iv acid rain control program as baseline the excess emissions penalty option is the most similar while the carbon tax option is the most different the excess emissions pena lty option would work in essentially the same fashion as the acid rain program with the primary difference being the penalty for having insufficient permits at the end of the year under title iv the penalty is intended to be punitive to punish the ffender for breaking the law thus the offender pays fine three time s the estimated cost of control in addition to forfeiting future permit the overriding assumption is that the offender could have reduced his emissions sufficiently but refused to do so under the excess emissions penalty option there is uncertainty as to whether an offender could have reduced his emissions sufficiently at the estimated price and that reductions at cost greater than that price are either socially unacceptable or economica lly unjustifiable hence the penalty is assessed on the basis of socially acceptable or economically justifiable price so that the offender pays cost for his unlawful activity and is encouraged to comply with the law but is not punished beyond what society has deemed reasonable arriving at such an acceptable penalty could be contentious the carbon tax is the most radical compared with the t itle iv program b ecause it dispenses with the permit system approach to emissions control all the pressure under carbon tax scheme is on the timing p ace and level of the tax as there is stigma for not controlling pollution the strength of th is approach is that it is selfenforcing and considerable revenues will be generated that could be recycled to polluters or used for other priorities however us nvironmental policy has generally opposed any approach suggesting polluters right to pollute which the carbon tax approach does grant depending on how the unlimite d permit approach is imp lemented it can look and act lot like carbon tax if the initial llocation of permits is by auction and unlimited permits are available at low price the auction price will equal the unlimited permit price resulting in carbon tax equal to the excess emissions permit price thus without limits on the quantity of permits allowe d the unlimited permits approach is merely carbon tax by anothe r name at least in the short term in addition the unlimited permits system require s the tracking mechanisms of tradeable permit system if it is ever to evolve into permit system as with carbon tax setting the unlimited permit price could be contentious the contingent reduction approach atte mpts to turn both the price and the quantity of reductions into variables solved by the trading market this requires agreements on both the profiles of emissions reductions and threshold price triggers it also puts enormous pressure on the tradin g permit market to produce an accurate price to make the whole system work althoug h in some ways the most innovative the contingent approach also could be the most difficult in terms of arriving at acceptable parameters for the reduc tions and triggers in short employing safety valve shif ts much of the emission reduction debate from compliance targets to the specifications of the safety valve the safety valve becomes the controlling mechanism of th permit tradeable system or the sole mechanism in the case of carbon tax whether this shift would contribute to an acceptable result is not clear
