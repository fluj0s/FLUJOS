internet gambling an abridged overview of federal criminal law charles doyle senior specialist american law division summary this is examination of some of the federal criminal laws implicated by internet gambling and of few of the constitutional questions associated with their application it is federal crime 1 to use teleco mmunications to conduct gambling business 2 to conduct gambling business in violation of state law 3 to travel interstate or overseas or to use any other facility of inters tate or foreign commerce to facilitate the operation of an illegal gambling business 4 to systematically commit these crimes in order to acquire or operate commercial enterprise 5 to launder the proceeds of an illegal gambling business or to plow them back into the business 6 to spend or deposit more than 10000 of the proceeds of illegal gambling in any manner or 7 since passage of the unlawful in ternet gambling enforcement act pl 109347 2006 31 usc 53615367 for gambling business to accept payment for illegal internet gambling internet gambling implicates each of these provisions under some circumstances although prosecution in some instances may be limited by constitutional provisions relating to the commerce clause free speech and due process in most instances impediments are likely to be practical rather than constitutional this is an abridged version without f ootnotes quotations cita tions or appendices of crs report 97619 internet gambling overview of federal criminal law related reports include crs report rs22418 internet gambling two approaches in the 109th congress background american law has always reflected our ambivalence towards gambling antigambling laws were common in colonial america yet even in the northeast where they were perhaps most numerous the lottery was popular form of public finance majority of states continue to outlaw most forms of gambling but most also continue to employ lottery as mean s of public finance and to allow several other forms of gambling as well there are many federal gambling laws most enacted to prevent unwelcome intrusions of interstate or international gamb ling into states where the activity in questionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21984crs2 has been outlawed in some cases internet gambling is not much different than gambling by telephone bettor places his bet with bookie using his computer and email rather than using just his telephone gamblers ve introduced features like proxy gambling gambling for credit and at least the claim of gambling in virtual offshore gambling locale to induce bettors to believe they ve overcome legal prohibitions in fact they have not nevertheless enfo rcement may be uncertain internet gambling cannot be raided in traditional sense and gambling is rarely high law enforcement priority even without the complications that the internet can bring to the table however that may be using the internet to conduct gambling bus iness either involving betting on sporting events or involving form of gambling ille gal under the laws of the state in which any of the players are located will almost certainly involve the violation of one or more federal criminal laws the wire act commentators most often men tion the wire act 18 usc 1084 when discussing federal criminal laws that outlaw internet gambling in one form or another early federal prosecu tions of internet gambling ge nerally charged violations of the wire act in fact perhaps the most widely known of fede ral internet gambling prosecutions united states v cohen involved the conviction upheld on appeal of the operator of an offshore onlin sports book under the wire act in general terms the act outlaws the use of interstate telep hone facilities by those in the gambling business to transmit gamblingrelated information the elements of section 1084 extend to anyone who 1 be ing engaged in the business of betting or wagering 2 knowingly 3 uses wire communication facility 4a for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce i of bets or wagers or ii information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest or b for the transmission of wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as result of bets or wagers or c fo r information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers18 usc 1084a the wire act has been more sparingly used than some of the other federal gambling statutes and as consequence it lacks some of interpretative benefits which more extensive caselaw might bring the act is addressed to those engaged in the business of betting or wagering and therefor apparently cannot be used to prosecute simple bettors in literal sense the act outlaws 1 the transmission of any gamblingrelated information and 2 the transmission of sports bets but the vast majority of prosecutions have involved sports gambling while cases involving other forms of gambling under section 1084 are not unknown at least one federa l appellate pa nel has concluded that the wire act applies only to sports gamblin g and information about sports gambling an accomplice who aids and abets another in the commission of federal crime may be treated as if he had committed the crime himself the classic definition from nye nissen v united states explains that liability for aiding and abetting attaches when one in some sort associates himself with the venture participates in it as in something that he wishes to bring about and seeks by his action to make it succeed with this in mind the department of justice s advised the national associa tion of broadcasters that its members risked prosecution for aiding and abetting when they provided advertising for the online gambling operations in addition to such accomplice liability conspirator who contrives with another for the commission of federal crime is likewise liable for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21984crs3 underlying crime and for any additional fo reseeable offense committe d by confederate in furtherance of the common scheme illegal gambling businesses on the face of it an illegal gambling business conducting its activities by way of the intern et seems to come within the reach of 18 usc 1955 the elements of section 1955 pply to anyone who 1a conducts b finances c manages d supervises directs or f owns 2 all or part of an illegal gambling business that 3a is violation of the law of state or political subdivision in which it is conducted b i nvolves five or more persons who conduct finance manage supervise direct or own all or part of such business nd c has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for period in excess of thirty days or has gross revenue of 2000 in any single day the s ection bars only those activities that involve illegal gambling under applicable state law and that meet th statutory definition of business the accomplice and c onspiratorial provisions atte nd violations of section 1955 as they do violations of the wire act section 1955 can only be applied to offshore internet gambling operations when the gamb ling in question is illegal under state law where either the bettor or the gambling operation are located travel act the operation of an illegal gambling business using the internet may easily involve violations of the travel act the courts often abbr eviate their statement of the acts elements to the following the government must prove 1 interstate travel or use of an interstate facility 2 with the intent to promote an unlawful activity and 3 followed by performance or attempted pe rformance of acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity the supreme court determined some time ago that the travel act does not apply to the simple customers of an illegal gambling busine ss although interstate solicitation of those customers may certainly be covered accomplice and coconspirator liability provisions discussed earlier apply with equal force to the travel act in the case of internet gambling the jurisdictional element of the travel act might be established at minimum either by re ference to the telecommunications component of the internet to shipments in interstate or foreign commerce in or from the united states associated with establishing operations on the internet to any interstate or foreign nexus to the payment of the debts resulting from the gambling or to any interstate or foreign distribution of the proceeds of such gambling the act would only apply to business terprises involved in illegal gaming so that email gambling between individuals woul d likely not be covered but an internet gambling venture that constitutes an illegal gambling business for purposes of section 1955 and is engaged in some form of inte rstate or foreign commercial activity in furtherance of the business will almost inevitably have included travel act violation racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico illegal gambling may trigger the application of rico provisions section 1955 the wire act the travel act and any state gambling felony are all rico predicate offenses to establish the elements of substantive rico offense the government must prove 1 that an enterprise existed 2 that the enterprise affected interstate or foreign commerce 3 that the defendant associated with the enterprise 4 that the defendant par ticipated directly or indirectly in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise and 5 that the defendant participated in the enterprise through pattern of racketeering activity by committing at least two racketeering predi cate acts eg 18 usc 1084 wire act 18 usc 1952httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21984crs4 travel act 18 usc 1955 illegal gambling business rico conspiracies are outlawed in subsection that imposes overt act requirement they are complete upon the agreement to commit rico offense money laundering congress has enacted several statutes to deal with money laundering it would be difficult for an illega l internet gambling business to avoid either of two of the more prominent 18 usc 1956 and 1957 both of whic h involve financial disposition of the proceeds of various state and federal crimes in cluding those under 18 usc 1084 wire act 18 usc 1955 illegal gambling business 18 usc 1952 travel act or any state gambling law if punishable by imprisonment for more than one year section 1956 is really veral distinct crimes 1 launde ring with intent to promote an illicit activity such as an unlawful gamblin g business 2 laundering to evade taxes 3 laundering to conceal or disguise 4 st ructuring financial transactions smurfing to avoid reporting requirements 5 international laundering and 6 laundering conduct by those caught in law enforcement sting in its most basic form the promotion offense essentially involves plowing the proceeds of crime back into an illegal enterp rise like most of the crimes under section 1956 the elements of the promotion offense be gin with financial transaction and the knowledge that the proceeds involved flow fro m predicate offense like illegal gambling the concealment offense shares several co mmon elements with the other offenses in section 1956 the courts have made it clear that conviction for the concealment offense requires proof of something more than simply spending the proceedings of predicate offense the tax evasion and structured tran sactions smurfing offenses shadow the promotion and concealment offenses ta x evasion laundering prosecution requires the government to show that the defendant acted intentionally rather than inadvertently but not that the defendant knew th at his conduct violated the ta x laws similarly conviction for the smurfing offense does not require showing that the defendant knew that his conduct was criminal as long as the government establishes that the defendant acted with the intent to frustrate reporting requirement the international laundering crime replicates the elements of th promotion concealment and smu rfing offenses but not the tax evasion offense and adds an international transportati on element of course proof of the transportation element alone is insuffi cient without the evidence of an intent to promote conceal or smurf th final crime found in section 1956 is sting offense the proscription drafted to per mit the prosecution of money underers taken in by under cover officers claiming to have proceeds in need of cleansing from illegal gambling or other predicate offenses section 1956 does not make sp ending tainted money crime but section 1957 does using most of the same definitions as section 1956 the elements of 1957 cover anyone who 1 in the united states b in the speci maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the united states or c outside the united states if the defendant is an american 2 knowingly 3 engages or b attempts to gage in 4 monetary transaction 5 in or affecting interstate commerce 6 in criminally derived property that is of greater value than 10000 and b is derived from specified unlawful activity unlawful internet gambling enforcement act the proscriptions of the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act are simply stated 1 person 2 engaged in the business of 3 betting or wagering 4 may knowingly accept 5 in connection with participati on of another person 6 in unlawful internet gamblinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21984crs5 7acredit including use of credit car d or b an electronic fund transfer or c any check or d the proceeds of any ot her form of financia l transaction 31 usc 5363 the proscription however is attended by an exhaustive array of definitions qualifications and exceptions that color its construction the act uses the definition of bet or wager to place beyond the reach of the acts proscriptions many forms of activity that otherwise fit the definition but which for the most part are not ordinarily considered gambling it describes bet or wager as the staking or risking by any person of something of value upon the outcome of cont est of others sporting event or game subject to chance upon an agreement or unders tanding that the person or another person will receive something of value in the even t of certain outcome 31 usc53621a the list of common activities exempted from the definition include securities and commodities exchange activities insurance internet games and promotions that do not involve betting and certain fantasy sporting activities the definition of what is not unlawful internet gambling for purposes of the act provides the exemptions for various forms of previously legalized intrastate and tr ibal gambling and sets aside the issue of the legality under the wire act of various forms of internet use by the horse racing industry the definition also exempts certain intrastate and intratribal forms of gambling like state lotteries and indian casinos that operate under state regulations or compacts from the prohibitions of the act if certain age and location verification conditions are met the act features criminal civil and regulatory enforcement mechanisms constitutional questions there have been suggestions that prosecution of illegal internet gambling raises various constitutional issues principal among these are questions as to legislative power under the co mmerce clause restrictions imposed by the first amendments guarantee of free speec h and due process concerns about the regulation of activities occurring at least in part overseas commerce clause congress possesses legisl ative power that cannot be traced to the constitution among its cons titutionally enumerated powers congress enjoys the authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce over the years the supreme court regularly confirmed the normous breath of congresss legislative prerogatives under the commerce clause within the last decade however it has announced series of decisions pointing out that congresss commerce power is not without limit these limitations notwithstanding the federal appellate courts have concluded thus far that the federal gambling statutes directed as they are against an economic activity come safely within congresss legislative authority under the commerce clause first amendment gambling implicates first amendment free speech concerns on two levels gambling is communicative by nature gambling also relies on advertising and wide range of auxiliary communication services historically gambling itself has been considered vice and conse quently beyond the protection of the first amendment there is every reason to belie ve that illegal gambling remains beyond the shield of the first amendment gone howev er is the notion that the power to outlaw vice includes the power to outlaw auxiliary speech when the underlying vice remains unregulated the supreme court made th is readily apparent when it approved an advertising ban on gambling illegal at the point of broadcast but invalidated an advertising ban on gambling lawful at the point of broadcast although the courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21984crs6 acknowledges the ambivalence of american gambling polic ies it does not appear to threaten the basic premise that the first amendment permits congress to outlaw gambling in any form and to ban any speech incidental to illegal gambling due process commentators have suggested two possible due process issues triggered by application of federal criminal law to off shore internet gambling they point to the due process limitations on the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant or subject matter jurisdiction over the gambling activity questions of personal jurisdiction are the more familiar of the two they revolve around i ssues often addressed in civil cases concerning the reach of states long arm statute the supreme court has explained that the due process clause prot ects an individuals liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgments of forum with which he has established meaningful contacts ties or relations by requiring that individua ls have fair warning that particular activity may subject them to the jurisdiction of foreign sovereign the due process clause gives degree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure their prima ry conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit the constitutional touchstone remains whether the defendant purposefully tablished minimum contacts in the forum state the federal appellate c ourts called upon to apply these principles in internet commercial litigati on have concluded that ing nonresident parties doing business on the internet where their custom ers are found does not offend due process requirements yet more than passive internet site is required the critical test is the level of commercial activity associated with the website subject matter jurisdiction although raised ss often is closely re lated it involves the question of when in fairness nonresiden ts can be bound by local law for conduct they committed elsewhere the authority of congress to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction is limited by due process but only few lower court cases have attempted to explain the boundaries those cases suggest that due pro cess insists that the offshore application of federal criminal law be limited to those instances where there is some nexus to the united states some factor to alert an individua l overseas of the need to avoid the conduct condemned in our law
