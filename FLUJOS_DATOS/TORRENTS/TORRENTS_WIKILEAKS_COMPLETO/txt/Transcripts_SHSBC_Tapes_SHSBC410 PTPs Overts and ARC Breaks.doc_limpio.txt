ptps overts and arc breaks lecture given on 10 november 1964 well either you look better or i do wonder which it is oh youre doing all right one isnt somebody audit him you too you look all right whats the date audience 10 november ten november ad 14 saint hill special briefing course well whatll i talk to you about today whatll i talk to you about today ive had lecture sitting back of left ear here for some time that i had just not gotten around giving you i could mention in passingand this is merely in passingthat you have new bulletin out that has to do with auditing styles and youve all done these various styles but youve never had them categorized into levels and the first mistake you will make about the bulletin is that the auditing style is determined by the process being run and the reason you make this mistake is because those auditing styles are so precisely matched to certain processes i want to call to your attention that itthats totally incidental the auditing style given at level is the best style for particular process but that doesnt make it why thats an auditing style these are the progressive stages of auditing necessary to make totally finished auditor and thats the reallyreason for it and each one of those styles is very effective and can be performed rather easily by the auditor at that level so you have auditing styles and dontdont make the mistake of saying well they go with certain processes because they dont you can audit almost any process with almost any of those styles for instance you could probably audit r6 with itsa yes it wouldnt be very effective but you could do it dont you see and so on and thei think youll find that this makes training much much easier because i left this until last had to have all the processes and know where they all fitted and know where the person was going to go you see what level he had to attain in order to move up to the next one after i had all that well i had to decide how is he audited and then i went back over about fourteen years of auditing experience and then i found out that there were only little handful of auditing styles they werent enormous in number they were very few and they could easily be broken down there is an auditing style i should mention between level 0 and level i or between level 0 and level ii that you occasionally use that isnt mentioned in auditing styles and thatswould be version of guiding style which didnt wind up with repetitive process its guiding style that goes into itsa and you do that quite frequently and thats actually coffee shop sort of style it doesnt necessarily fit the dignity of level but its aits combo its cross so its guiding style youre guiding the pc into what he should talk about you very oftenwell it at ii is done with meter dont you see and then you let him itsa we even had process which calls for that particular style and it isnt one of the styles mentioned its combo of two different styles because pure guiding stylei dont want you to make this error eitherpure guiding style which is level ii would be simply guiding the pc into what he was going to run on and many auditors err they dont guide the pc they just let him wander you know they dont head him off they dont practice multiple acknowledgment at the right places you know you can herd up pc just like you can dogies you know you canthe dogie has to behas to be yipped at when he goes too far off the trail you see so what you want to do is you yip at the pc by multiple acknowledgment its actually little trick it isnt covered in the bulletin but its multiple acknowledgment he starts talking about his motherinlaw and we dontwe dont happen to be covering the area of family in this particular session and he wanders off there about his motherinlaw so we say well all right good good well im very glad to know that fine fine all right now ahem it herds him back on the trail again you see and then theresthats the overacknowledgment it has use you see and then theres the underacknowledgment or the halfacknowledgment and you want the pc to go on talking about what he is well you give him these little encouraging nods hmhhhm hmhm hmhm hmhm and youll find out if you do that to somebody hell go on talking about what hes talking about and you can actually use acknowledgment to make person go on talking about what you want him to talk about or reversewise use it to head him off and the only thing you do is just faintly acknowledge and he will go on talking and of course if you heavily acknowledge it operates as stop and you can halt him and that is probablywill be the most adroit use of one of those styles that stands up at levelat level ii guidingstyle actually guidingstyle as such is you guide the pc into something then run repetitive process on it or some process on it thats the pure style its guide and process and guide and process and its just an alternation of that sort of thing and then of course we find this appearing up little bit higher in assessing and processing see we process what we assess its harmonic on it but this other one is very narrowband sort of situation lets find out what we ought to run on this pc and lets guide him around to talking about things so that he can give us enough information so we know what this is all about you see and then the next thing were saying all right good now what communication havent you completed to that person thank you what communication havent you completed to that person thank you what communication havent you completed to that person thank you tone arm starts damping out of the thing and you know youve got it in other words itsyou guide him into something then you run it and at level i you dont guide him into nothing you see and thatyou find out that these fit at actually the stages of development of the auditor and what theyre really compared to is the return of selfdeterminism to the auditor of the ability to occupy viewpoint now as the auditor goes up in class he will partly be going up in case and hes more and more capable of looking at who is there across the table from him see and as such the early levels therefore you must actually never permit level 0 auditor to tell the pc what to talk about off his own bat it would require certain amount of diagnosis you see to use medical term hehed have to know what was wrong with the pc to get the pc to talk about something therefore hed have to go into upper stages and upper grades of auditing in order to run it you see and the mistake you make in training when you make any mistakes at all is not keeping those levels pure and demanding more of the beginner than he can possibly perform you look at this poor poor bloke hes come in almost on public coaudit yes hes had some has lessons you see and you say all right now find out what the problem is all about and get the pc talking about it all right thats your assignment for this evening well that sounds awfully simple to you but youve just left the guy sitting there the idea that he could start and stop somebody else talking will be completely beyond him hows that done now you go in with upperscale ways of bringing this about and you just get yourself into endless complexities your training then starts getting very tangled and very long and the student gets very confused and he cant figure out what youre trying to train him in and he gets the idea that auditing is all impossible anyhow and so forth simply because youre giving him an upper style to do lower style with that hehe hasnt ever advanced to this point dont you see so actually the styles of auditing are arranged very carefully against the ability of the individual progressively to confront his pc and handle pcs now we get the idea of class vi auditor tells class ii auditor well now its very simple just get him talking about the primary buttons you see of his case and watch those things carefully and monitor them down on the emeter and make sure that he itsas them properly and that youve guided him into that and its very simple you can clear him very easily level ii auditor you see all right you come back half an hour later or you get the auditing report and it is the most horrible messedup blackbird pie that ever got wing fluttered in it you know its mess what has gone on well confusion has gone on thats whats gone on because you just gave this guy something thatwuhnu so you see this thing is fitted against the idea that the level 0 doesnt even get tr 1 aparthey just never have had it see and so where do they get their auditing command well they get it off the blackboard or from the auditing supervisor thats where they get their auditing command now what i want all of you pcs to talk to your auditor about is see and you say your jobconsiderations youve had about your job now thats what i want you to talk to your auditor about and the auditor is supposed to sit there and listen and you cant even kick him for not acknowledging dont you see because he doesnt know anything about that and youll find out people can do that just by the hour they just do that bynothing to it thats easy thats easy for them to do but if you tell them to give the pc the auditing command you have now made them take responsibility in their eyes for somebody elses whole life and they ponder this as philosophic impossibility dont you see theyre not upstairs far enough to recognize the relative values of these things and so forth and youre talking against all the confusions that you ever heard of all these confusions now that style of auditing actually we take from psychoanalysis actually we developed that independently because many analysts dont listen you heard the joke about the two analysts coming down in the elevator and one is all worn out and the other one looks bright and happy and the one thats all worn out says how can you possibly go through that many patients in day and look so bright and cheerful and he says doesnt itdoesnt it just about kill you sitting there listening to all that stuff all day long and the bright one says who listens so and youll find that the automatic auditing command was put in by freud not by the analyst the analyst really never gave anybody anything to talk about he sort of just infiltrated it somehow or another told them about something and somehow or other the guy started talkingthey didnt have tr 1 so actually the high point of psychotherapy never attained level 0 now if professionals in this field were not up to developing any higher style of actionevaluating interrupting do the wildest things you seeif they were not up now dont expect some bloke just off the street that youve got in coaudit someplace or some bird who is just starting in wondering if he should be student of scientologysee hes still in this terrific rat maze of puzzlementtaking him and throwing on his back anything above that auditing style and you actually will have to curb yourself from throwing more things on it than that that style is the one oddly enough that you as an auditing supervisor will have the most trouble with its the hardest for you to understand the hardest for you to pass student on the hardest one to find out if hes confrontingis the student confronting or listening its hard to establish its very difficult from viewpoint of supervision its not difficult from its performance but its performance looks difficult to the person because its so simple hes supposed to do that one thing and you know youll have some bird youre training in this some fellow youre training in this he will actually go for days and days and days and days and days before he finally gets the idea of what hes supposed to do and then you sort it outone datum hes got this one datum hes supposed to listen hes not supposed to do anything else hes supposed to listen he finally sorts this out as performance or an action which is pure in its own right and which is performable and then he finds out that he can do it and at that point you have put an auditors feet on the road up and if you miss that then that auditor would be falling off the road all the way up do you see but you could make it so unnecessarily complicated as to how you listened and what you were supposed to do that hed get lose before he began and therefore hed remain in confusion forevermore dont you see so you have to adjust not just your auditing to thisyou can do that easily thats very easybut youve got to adjust your supervision to this and thats what mainly has to be adjusted at that basic style because its very hard to supervise at that level of simplicity oh you take class iv auditor who is competent and capable at class iv he knows very well what should be done for the pc he sees exactly what the pc should be guided into he sees exactly what the pc should be assessed on he sees exactly where that pc should go he sees whats wrong with that case and of course his basic impulse as an auditor is to just run the case toward maximum gain but the mistake he makes is its his running of the case toward maximum gain you got it see then he adjudicates what the session should be by how he would run the case toward maximum gain you follow that well hes shortcircuited it because he isnt running the case now the way to run that case toward maximum gain oddly enough is to run the case at level the case will gain on in the hands of the auditor auditing that case and once youve made that differentiation and snapped out of the valence of the pcs auditor you will see that that would be the maximum gain because now youve made an auditor now that pc is gaining the little bit possible at that level and so youve got it so the material which you have in the way of processes and so on is matched up not against maximum gain its matched upmatched up against the gain attainable in the auditing at that level that we can be sure of see so its matched up against certain gain in the hands of the auditor who will audit it and if the auditor doesnt do anything more than audit that level and run the processes of that level his pc is going to gain regardless of what you or i would do do you see somehow or other theyll struggle inthrough it and theyll wander out of it and theyll get themselves into some sort of aof bettered situation you see for years people were being very successful at the processes we now have at level i havingness trio 8c look at these things man and how were they run well you sat the pc down you told the pc he was supposed to answer the question and you just banged questions at him and he gave you the responses to the questions and you acknowledged them all right well that was all theall you had to know and thats all you had to do and the question was the magic chant and you didnt even have to know it wasnt evit wasnt magic chant you didnt even have to know that it had any sense to it dont you see it was rote process and auditing could go on like that for years so that level has become extreme that it is muzzled thats the style at that thats muzzled level i muzzled auditing weve had it for years we take an acc there are certain number of the students in the acc just arenttheir pcs arent progressing and you listen to them for little while the pc opens his mouth to talk the auditor interrupts you see other things are going on and crisscrossing other things are being entered so we just put muzzle on the pcpardon muzzle on the auditor im afraid that i would regard those people as pcs thats the hobsonjobson there they needed lot of improvement well we put muzzle on the auditor and the pc would gain ive watched it and ive seen pc come right on up under muzzled auditing rather fabulous actuallyactually making fabulous gains nobody being very smart about what process was being picked see so you use of course at those levels the crash bang hammer pound exclamationpoint processesyou know like you know look at that wall walk over to that wall those things require judgment as when to run them they just get broad gains do you see how all that would be so anyway the auditing style is adjusted against the capability of the auditor now unfortunately there are three thingsand now begins what im really talking to you aboutthere are three things which are in the road of every case there are three things there are all those things in the book of remedies of course in the book of remedies you find there are great many different things that can be this way or that way about case but these data have never been set aside and there is nothing that overwhelms these data or overcomes them or fixes them up except addressing them and one is the ptp another is the overt with its companion withhold and the other is the arc break those three things and theyre present potentially in any session at any level anyplace well wed normally handle these things with call in higherlevel auditor at the very low levels dont you see wed handle them by special auditing you joe require special auditing you see that sort of thing youve got to be handled at higher grade we dont try to run into those things headon at 0 and 1 particularly but at ii the door opens and the totality of processes at ii are contained in the book which you now have the book of remedies but the woof and warprug terms weavingof any case is composed of certain mental makeup attitude or combination dont you see of chronic or continuous nature in other words theres continuous case messup you follow i mean hes got this wrong with him all the way along the line dont you see this is wrong with this pc these are the rocks in his head these are the permanent fixtures you might say of the joint well you got those things but then you have the things which keep those things from unraveling i cant think of simile offhand here that would exactlywell yes i can youve got whole big pile of rocks in courtyard and you could move those rocks very easily or demolish them or set them up in an orderly fashion so they could be viewed you could do things with those rocks except that every once in while some lunkhead drops the drawbridge or raises the drawbridge and you cant get across the moat or once in while they shut the gates do you see well the moat and the drawbridge and the gates would be the ptp the overt the arc break all those things just bar entrance to the case they are entrance barriers they keep the case from being entered and of course those things one or another of the three can happen at any time and thats the liability of session and those are the three things which prevent the pc from being insession and oddly enough there arent any others there arent any others there arent large numbers of things which prevent the pc from being insessionthere are just those three given of course the fact that he has an auditor of even indifferent skill the auditor doesnt have to be screaming genius to audit routine cases but sometimessometimes it appears to you that you have to be screaming genius to audit certain case because you just cant seem to get to first base with this case you cant get anyplace with this case you can go nowhere very discouraging and what youre looking at is ptp of chronic or temporary naturecontinuous or temporary nature youre looking at continuing overts or past overts and youre looking at an arc break which may have just occurred or may be of longstanding in other words those three things become six just to the degree of their position in time now youll accuse of expanding it out too far but if you really know your basics you realize im not you see the overt act will go into action when withhold is put on it you have to have restraint before this thing really starts biting dont you see you have to have secrecy involved in the thing you have to have something else involved before you get into any serious messups with this you see you have to have censure now either its the censure of the fellows own decency or censure of the act by the public or social mores or something but theres censure he doesnt think its good or somebody else doesnt think its good and he goes into being made guilty or becoming guilty of this act and then although he is performing the act he will withhold it and what were doing actually is discussing the overtmotivator sequence so when i say overts of course i mean the overtmotivator sequence you see the overt is always prior to the withhold always so the dominant factor there is the overt now what are all of the things we know about handling overts and their consequences and what they track back to and everything else well now this gets encyclopedic see this is lots theres lots to know about overts tremendous amounts there are lots of ways to run themall of them more or less effective there are processes and processes and processes but how do youhow do you classify all these processes and this phenomena and so forth including withholds and missed withholds and everything else well just classify it under the heading of overts now present time problem is peculiar and well named by the way because even though it occurred in the past it can float in present time and its the floatingness of the problem that we find fault with not the fact that somebody has problems its theits the present existence see even though its genus was long ago it still exists as problem because its peculiar to the problem that it hangs up in space and its interesting about the problem that it itself in its examination was what brought over into view of the goals problem mass and gave us all class vi see so its basic mechanism in which thetan engages and its postulatecounterpostulate masscountermass you see is startingis trying to go north and b is trying to go south and there they meet in perfect balance and there they stay and so they hang up in time and theyll just stay there forever youve got one and then the other you see youve got these two forces counteropposed the russians actually have dignified this by calling it dialectic materialism or ecclesiasticism or somethingi dont know their terms very well but i was amazed i went to the trouble of studying this subject that the russians have whipped up to go along with german marxism andyour russian really never realizes that hes following german philosophy and the public at large doesnt know that it was the last of the kaisers official acts to finance the russian revolution he paid for it since rather heavily but the german system probably could be traced back to some philosophical nonsense someplace or another on the line as the foundation of this dialectic materialism or whatever you call it and that is that ideas are only produced by the meeting of two forces its marvelous its marvelous how anybody has made philosophy and deified and enhanced and enshrined the problem by giving it this vast virtue of the fact that the only generating force of ideas anywhere in the universe is when couple of planets collide or something see if you got big idea its because two big things collided if you got little idea its two little things collided if you want real idea whyif you want nice idea why you smack your hands loudly and of course you get an idea i dont quite dig it but anyhow its very interesting im being serious about this by the way there is such philosophy and that is its genus and it is force versus force produces ideas well actually ideas versus ideas produce force but they would not be likely to know that one theyve got their hat on backwards you see its like the doctor he says allall function is determined by structure thats taught thats the basic datum of medical school all function is determined by structure so if youve got your structure out why then the function will go out dont you see and hes never heard of anybody writing story with broken pen see but it can be done you see and the reason we collide with themaside from their own ideas of medical imperialismis very elementary reasonis because we have function precedes structure in other words thiswhat the guy is doing in life influences whats going to be built and made and what he becomes and weve also worked with the idea if youve got your ideas in crosswise why the broken leg wont heal see well the doctor looks at it that if youve got the broken leg in crosswise why then the ideas wont heal and thats why they use shock and surgery to try to cure insanity that they have never succeeded in doing so in the entire history of the thing does not seem to convince them that they must have something backwards there any clever research man would look at this sort of thing and he would say hey well wait minute there must be something wrong with the basic theory but that theory is so enshrined that if you have broken leg you get evil ideas about man see yeah thisit works this way see if youre thinking wrongly it must have been because your brain cells were warped so then of course all you have to do is unwarp the brain cell to make somebody think rightly that theyve never succeeded in doing this does not deter them from believing it implicitly its very funny its backward situation so you see theres lot of ideas about ideas and theres lot of ideas about structure and function but man basically in this culture is more devoted to materialistic ideas that is to say he says that ideas proceed from force man is generatedin the whole field of biology man is generated from mud theyre dramatizing its darwinian implant thats up the line up here you see man comes from mud you see force makes ideas the russian says you see the medical doctor says mental condition is caused by structural upsets see its all proceeding from mass over to well i dont know what they could be hung up in unless theyre just totally overwhelmed in their own problems problem is basically generated by postulatecounterpostulate and if those postulates neither one overwhelms the other youve had it because now force is going to start accumulating on those two points and if the force unfortunately does not overwhelmforce does not overwhelm force b force b does not overwhelm force the thing stays in balance now and the balance then is maintained as long as the balance is maintained you will have these two postulates counteropposed matter how buried or hidden they get and they will be represented by two forces counteropposed matter how big they get and they will remain to marked degree equal because they will only remain that way if they are equal so you see you could have thousands of problems none of which became present time problem you see pc could have the most braincracking problems he ever heard of in his past or background you see without doing very much to the pc whether he solved them or didnt solve them because theyre not held at this delicate point of balance aforce is not exactly opposed to force b dont you see that imbalance there causes it to rock off and go into the distance someplace and actually the solution of problems is more or less performed by unbalancing the postulates or forces which are involved in them you have the north and the south fighting over the 1964 election something like this some arecertain ideas existed in the south and certain ideas existed in the north you see well now that war would still be going on unless somebody had started to change his ideas somebody must have started to change his ideas somebody must have gone into agreement with the north or the south wouldnt have lostsomething or somebody now communism right now is playing footsies with coexistence well you see theyve weakened the force with which theyre pressing against the west and its not going to remain that way youre not going to see forever cold war in fact they could work very hard in russia right now to try to put the cold war back together again and they wouldnt win why because the idea has become unbalanced you see the idea of youve got to fight the dirty capitalist in the west has been watered down now to some degree elsewhere in the world we have the idea that you ought to exist with the communists but actually it hasnt become that watered down i notice they still have all their bases and missiles and so forth pointed in that direction that people are agreeing they should do something about it i notice theyre burning up an awful lot of manpower and petrol down in south vietnam right this minute as conviction that this should not go on dont you see that communism shouldnt go on so the idea against communism is if anything strengthening and the idea of communism against the west is weakening basically because they cant get the materiel that the west has you cant buy powder puffs the way you can from drugstores you see over in new york the populace itselfs havingness is down dont you see so its unsettling them and making them question this philosophy and thats why they popped off papa khrushchev they longer believed totally dont you see they believe that you might be able to do something for instance one of their numberone meni dont know which one is which these days but he is an expert on industrial improvement and its interesting that this man the mostthe most informed man possibly in all of russia isnow finds himself in position of tremendous power in the russian government well hes the boy that studied how to put industry on the road how to bring in these various things and hes the boy who has probably been standing around recommending western reward practiceswestern supervision practices western capitalism has been consistently recommended and is being recommended right this moment to russian industry as the way to get the show on the road that cold war is going to blow up it cant help it because the idea over here is diluting and although were getting some dilution on it in the west we just had presidential campaign fought more or less on the basis of we ought to fight communism which looks like itthere are an awful lot of people still agreeing hm the guy got some votes now you see what im trying to put across to you is if you as an auditor recognized this youd be able to clear cases easily but more important youd be able to get them into session easilythat it isnt every problem see its just that freak which is exactly balancedits postulatecounterpostulate and its forcecounterforce its just that freak is the only one youre looking for and thats the only thing that saves your bacon as an auditor because let assure you if you counted the number of problems which thetan had had on the whole track since the beginning of this universe and you wrote the number up on the wall it would exceed the number of years by considerable because i think that people have more than one problem per year be an unwritable number it would just go on endlessly youd go on writing see and if you as an auditor had to take each one of these up and even though you became very good and could handle problem in minute of auditing you and the pc would be something like million years old apiece by the time you had all the problems of the track audited see youd have been that long auditing the pc at minute apiece you see in other words you got this fantastic overwhelming number of problems which the person has had and youre not interested in any of them and thereforetherefore at lower level yes youll see some pc sittingoh youve got problems and hell go on about these problems and hell go on about these problems and hell delineate problems hell describe problems and hell go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on hour after hour session after session intensive after intensive and youll say why isnt he getting any better well its because nobody has picked up the problem that was balanced perfectly now in actual fact there is problem there he just doesnt happen to have mentioned it and whats very peculiar about this is that any conditionand now were not speaking of general pcs but any condition even neurosis or psychosisis so delicately balanced between postulatecounterpostulate masscountermass that if an auditor just slips it just little bit the guy cant go on holding onto it see this is such an accidental series of forces you see its so accidental that that thing is suspended in time that if youif you just tick it it starts going bzzz bzzz zzzz zzzzwhere is it you know and youll sometimes see dog or something like this thatnot comparing pcs to dogs but you see dog once in while will have sympathetic limp and he willhe will go out racing around the countryside running on all four feet beautifully and then he sees his master dont you see and he wants his master hes supposed to have limp he just remembers see and hell start limping and he limps with great patheticness dont you see hes trying to hold one in dont you see hes trying to hold in service fac of some kind something for which he got paid and something and so forth but he really cant do it and right in the middle of his great pose of holding this thing in why rabbit runs under fence someplace and rowr rowr rowr you know and all four feet on the ground man running like whippet you know forgotten all about it oh i just give that offhandedly youve got athat dog has to consciously hold in the limp dont you see and you will see some poor neurotic sometime or anotheryou will actually see this as an auditortrying for days after you have knocked out ptp or knocked the few little pins out from underneath this delicate balance that its gone and yet hes used to it it isnt gone to the degree dont you see youve triggered this and its sort of way of life you know and youll see this poor person trying to recover this thing you once in while will see this and youll see your tone arm is hanging now between 25 and 30 and it doesnt anymore stay around 55 where it always did dont you see but you sometimes will seewhen this thing particularly became what wed call service facsimile or something like that it had some element of survival in it you see he isnt comfortable about it stillyoull see this confounded thinghell be trying to pick it up and put it back on youllhell want you to audit some more about it or something like this and it never even trembles on the needle you cant even get it to wiggle it gives tone arm action and so forth and yet the pc will be trying to persuade you to audit it some more you see well it was present time problem for so long that it became way of life and hes not adjusted to not having it the reason for that is is hes still got tremendous accumulated forces involved in its solution you see and it isnt there and there isnt any reason you should do anything about it at all it isnt going to interrupt auditing for moment you go ahead and audit him on anything now just as there are these three thingsthe ptp the overt and the arc breakwhich have the moat and the drawbridge and the gates closed you see there are still these rocks in here see and they really got to be moved and straightened out before the guy can do anything at all or before you could do anything whatever well now on those rocks you use processes and those rocks will move providing you can keep the gates open and get across the moat see the rocks you can move them well thats done by routine just to pick up your terminology what we call routine thats rockmoving activity and the only reason the routine will not work is because you couldnt get in the courtyard the routine always works if you can get in the courtyard so if the routine isnt working you then must assume that youre not in the courtyard and the reason youre not in the courtyard will have to do with present time problem long or short duration an overt continuously performed or being performed now or someplace see overt something about overts with withholds mixed up in them and that sort of thing or an arc break which means bypassed charge which means some incomprehensible influence upon him which is making him go bzzzzzzz and he cant tell where its coming from or what it is something has made something go bzzz hes got some charge loose someplace and he doesnt like it its like alike you had very largehoofed donkey with all his hoofs on an organ keyboard you see this charge has all of suddenis alive someplace something is going this way and that way and he cant tell what it is where it is or anything else and thats an arc break its reduction of affinity reality or communication but in actual fact i can tell you exactly what an arc break is is you unwittingly ticked some major restimulation now you understand something was in major restimulation in r6 data track end words root words something and you ticked something that was already in tremendous restimulation in that bundle of the reactive bank and it went bzzz and until you tick it again and key it outand i give you right away that list 1 is perfectly adequate see to key it outwhy the guy is shortcircuited he looks like switchboard that somebody has thrown wire net over hes going bzzzzz therell be something there on the whole track thats going bzzzz and that has various things that can key it in now what youve done is gotten direct short circuit into the bank now thats done in various ways and the things that are in chronic restimulation are very few difficulties with communication is primary that is the primary end word that gets into restimulation theres reason under the sun moon or stars why anybody should communicate about anything except theres an end word on the subject and this is always there its way of life actually you can sit down and ask somebody recall time you communicated recall time you communicated recall time you communicated and they emerge at the other end of the line feeling much better and you can always get tone arm action on it and so forth you should realize youre running 268 gpms all at one fell swoop now one of these things you see then when youwhen you fail to carry out communication cycle on the pc why youre going to knock one of those end words into bzzzzzzzz and hes going to go nyow nyow nyow nyow or mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm or apathy or i cant go on you know or something like this something wild is going to happen exactly what the pc does is probably the root word and if you get the root word to kill somebody or something like that you see that would be quite interesting do you follow nevertheless the lists themselves are tailormade to knock the top off thats got this thing in cockeyed and if you can locate and indicatejust on lets say list 1what has occurred and then tell the pc what it was then this thing goes on liedowndog thing and it just becomes quiet and its quite interesting youve probably had lot of subjective reality on it the mystery at which youre feeling all nyaaww and then somebody says that its soandso and you say oh what actually has happened is is one or another part of the gpms has been yanked madly into restimulation or existence by some life proposition but remember it would have had to have been powerfully in restimulation because of life before little something you did could knock it that extra little flick and of course when you quiet that down by locating and indicating the bypassed charge youve simply dropped it back to former status dontrealize youve not done anything for the pc but youve made himhis casebut you have made him auditable you follow that and thats the total composition of the arc break theres nothing more mysterious about arc breaks than that somebody has just reached in and pulled half manual into dead short you got to get that hand out of there you dont have to straighten up the manual many an auditor makes the mistake of thinking he has to rebuild the whole organ in order to cure an arc break take your hand out of there joe about all there is to it and the sound dies down so this is thethis is the crux foryoull find that things that are in chronic restimulation with men are something like time problemsthese are the big dogs that are always there and bits of items like havingness thats out of an item but that item repeats itself endlessly through the bank these arethese are the things which jaw at men most of the time and of course which they arc break on most and theyll arc break most on communication or time and much less so on problem which is of course an end word but theyll sometimes arc break on problem somebody is giving them more problems and they go zzzzzz but it tapers off then but theres such tremendous gaptheres such tremendous gap between the value of communication and the value of time and the next nearest competitor dont you see that its very silly looking chart you couldnt even draw it on the wall you have these enormous values you see and then somebody tries to tell you that these little marbles lying on the floor dont you see alongside of this mont blanctheres marble in the bottom of the valley alongside of mountmont blanc you see and he says now thats as big as mont blanc somebody is crazy see that couldnt be well that would be the next value that would be the next value and thats havingness as compared to communication and time these are the big dogs communication is the biggest one thats huge its rather unfortunate because its way to hell and gone back in the series its not close to pt at all way back and you can arc break somebody snapperoo on that big one very easily just dont answer him or answer him little bit crosstoned or something like that well this thing is in restimulation all the time and of course time is in restimulation all the time or you wouldnt have any time get late for session sometime youre going to see nice arc break you as the auditor are late for the session see making somebody wait you look in vain for somethingsome significance to the word wait theres significance to the word wait its just time its maladjustments of time somebody throwing the switch off you know wrong way to and the motor isnt now running as smoothly as it did it cant be dramatized dramatization of thethe smooth turnover of the clock going tickatatickatatickata has been interrupted and itll throw it into restimulation and youll have yourself an arc break now knowing that that is the character of an arc break you should therefore at lower levels particularly devote it very exclusively into the lightest possible feathertouch methods of keying it out you dont go after an arc break you know with crash and you certainly dont try to audit one you just assess it pc sitting there not saying word or screaming at you like mad you just go on and assess it you dont care what the pc is doing this is auditing whatever the pc says you dont answer the pc you dont have anything to do with this at all because anything you do further than that youre going to mess it up further see because youre just going to key in that thing harder and the thing to do is to find the arc break fast and find the last keyin of the arc break quickly and expertly and key it out and you find out it all dies down its very very mysterious proposition its almost like waving the magic wand across the booming surf and having it all of sudden go into millpond you know very often an auditor has done this expertly on screaming howling raving homicidal pc and so forth and hes just gone on about his business somehow or other while being almost knocked away from his emeter you see hes managed to keep the pc on the cans and go on with his assessment and never answered the pc all of sudden says all right gets nice big fall on the fact that something or other has gone into restimulation on something or other whatever is on the list dont you see and he simply indicates this in its purity to the pc brrrbow and all of sudden what happened dead calm you know pin drop mile away would be loud compared to the ensuing silence thisthe pcs all right well i dont know why we were worried about this now pc by the waythis isnt necessarily so true that it has to be audited by the way this isnt one of these conditions that has to be audited the pc very often feels guilty of overts against the auditor very often feels guilty of overts against the auditor feels propitiative and that sort of thing and ill give you news theres particular reason to audit it because youre just going to get back into the arc break again so that you might say is one overt you leave alone dont pay any attention to it so he feels propitiative all right let him buy you pack of cigarettes who cares it isnt going to do him bit of harm he can just feel as propitiative as he likes about the subject or as guilty as he likes and it isnt going to hold up his case it isnt going to do him bit of harm providingproviding only that he doesnt get up to such peak that he feels he shouldnt have any auditing because he doesnt deserve it and the way to handle that is not by pulling his overts but by little ratatattat sort of an action of just little bit of itsa on what he deserves or anything its what hes brought up as the reason why well just get it itsaed get it out of the road youll sometimes run into this sort of thing but in actual fact you wouldnt even really have to do that if his case was making any progress hed come out of this too do you follow now this isnt one of these important factors im just giving you some sidelights on it but the arc break is an r6not an r6 action to handle but its r6 materials going into restim in that bank and what youve got to do is neat them up what you actually are doingyou were in there piling up these rocks in the courtyard minding your own business and everything was going along fine and then suddenly you find yourself not even outside the gateyoure clear out there on the meadow looking back at the castle with the pc saying nyooowww or the pc just nuuhhhh nothing the only one thats dangerous is the one that you dont detect that he has at the end of the session and so he doesnt come back for his next session and thats only dangerous because it interrupts auditing you get what happens now if you didnt have recognition of these three thingsthe ptp the overt and the arc breakas being the only three barriersthe only three real barriers to caseyou might have difficulty in aligning all of the different phenomena you find in case because theres tremendous number of phenomena in case oh and just thousands and thousands and thousands of conditions which you could equate up to he wasnt being audited or something he wasnt responding to auditing just be thousands of these things you see but the funny part of it is almost all of them depend on thisthese three things direct handling in other words the major things are those now there are other things which prevent the case from being audited like he doesnt have any money or you havent got any time you know or the auditor hasnt been trained or the pc is being talked at all night long when he should be getting some sleep by his wife who wants him to stay good and sick because after all the will is in her favor and heres some guy auditing this bird you know didnt like that so hes argued at all night well how do you know youve had any gains out of your auditing typical sample question he comes back to session you see at eight oclock the next morning well its just all covered in the auditors code he hasnt had any sleep he would be troublesome case because hes trouble source he is trouble source because he has somebody on the other side of him who is doing him in and hes such knucklehead that he wont knock this off you know its something like somebody hitting himself on the head with hammer all the time because its habitual and he really wont knock it off long enough to let himself recover you see hes trying to cover these two spheres hes trying to propitiate over here to somebody and at the same time trying to get better and he eventually only winds up by trying to make them wrong dont you see by quitting or them wrong by not getting better how he eventually figures this out lord knows but he would eventually figure this out he would first begin to try to prove them wrong by getting better well let tell you if hes trying to get better to prove somebody wrong you have set up the postulatecounterpostulate and so you have continuous ptp running in the session dont you see and if you ever wanted to see graph sit in one place intensive after intensive its to get somebody with chronic ptp which is actually riding in present time which nobody ever does anything with and then you will see that graph intensive after intensive remain exactly the same its the most marvelous thing how that graph can remain poised in that one place he has to be audited pretty clumsily to have all this always missed dont you see because auditing itself chipping away at the case is liable to hit that ptp too see and it only has to take milligram off the side of one of the forces to unbalance it do you see its not really hard trick but if its just blindly ignored and somehow or another never gone into and it somehow or another gets avoided all the way along the line then youre going to see this constant graph constant graph constant graph not necessarily low one not necessary high one just any graph and if you want to see graph that just doesnt change doesnt change doesnt change doesnt change doesnt change well you know very well that the person has chronic present time problem of some kind or another its just not going to shift now theres different behavior on graph for overts oddly enough different behavior overts carry lot of different reactions with them some fellow is just so notthere and so irresponsible that the overt has nothing to do with him and there are various types of responses or reactions to overts somebody is going on doing this but you see theres always some but but itshis attitude toward this type of overt can be varied sometimes its very propitiative you see he just cant help but do this overt and hes getting more and more propitiative but actually overts are source of change they are not source of constant behavior and if you see caseif you see case constantly and continuously shifting but never shifting steadily see you getyou get the idea i mean this case is shiftingit goes up little bit and then it goes down you know and then it goes up little bit and itll go down and around and this intensive he did well on and the next intensive he doesnt do well on you know its sporadic result to auditing dont always blame the auditor there is bunch of overts mixed up in this that the pc is performing or are going into restithey are going into restimulation during the session period or werent touched by sessions do you see this so theres somethingtheres something wrong there well what you get is an instability and it works like this the individual wont let himself get any better if he finds himself improving he yanks himself back downstairs again you got all kinds of odd computations on this like he doesnt deserve to get better and if he got any moreif he got any better he would destroy everybody he mustnt let himself get strong because he might commit this overt again do you see hes oneither he or the society are on check dont you see if the society is on the check well if he commits that overt again hes liable to go to jail see thats society checking him and the people around him see him get more active and know that hes bad man basically and they dont want to see him more active so they see him little more active you find this by the waywe had one up in new york one time many years ago that led the auditors up there theabout the maddest chase i think i have ever seen there was some girl up there somebody didnt have any better sense than to audit somebody who was an institutional case well thats trouble to begin with all right the mad spin that went on from that i listened to for the better part i think of year and half every few weeks i would hear some more about this case it was something on the order of the perils of pauline it was real cliffhanger i felt sorry for the poor girl but there wasnt anything you could do about it the auditor would get the pc and get her somewhere where she could be audited and then would proceed to give her some auditing the girl would come up toward anger and then get loose from the auditor one way or the other and get home and ream everybody out and then would be taken by the family to the local institution andor to the local psychiatrist and knocked into seven different contortions dont you see i think they have seven contortions is what the code is thats joke by the way i was just thinkingthis is very interesting i wonder if there is connection betweenbetween somesome certain practice i know of in india and what theyre trying to do with electric shock because they sure go into contortions anyway thethis poor girl would then manage to escape or get away and the auditor would get ahold of her and hed audit her back up again she would get angry shed go back home ream the family out and this went on for year and half same cycle there was another one that went on for long time in that same vicinity that was more pathetic it was just the fact that the brother conhad the power to sign checks if the girl continued to be non compos mentis its just very sordid commercial affair and the poor girl would get auditing you see and the second shed get any better theyd have her thrown back in the institution and she wasnt bad off but it just got her so rocky after while she didnt know whether she was coming or going it was just the fact that any time she was in an institution then the whole wealth of the familywhich had been left to the brother and the sistercame under his control for the period that she was in an institution and he was the sort of bird that liked to drink and go to vegas and blow dough dont you see so it was just jockey i think auditor seemed to ever be able to do anything about it but these are crazy ones youll see these kind of cycles going at one time or another well theyre not exactly composed of overts theyre composed of the restraints of the society against the pc we must take that into consideration it isnt just the pc himself you see the society could also be chivying up the pc one way or the other thats why ive given you those two examples some mad dance could be going on around your pc dont you see that you yourself have wot not of or havent evaluated the importance of well youd have to handle that youd have to handle the social environment of the pc quite in addition to that but it would give the same symptom of overts is the point im making here see youd have the same behavior the person would get better and get worse and get better and get worse and get better and get worse and that sort of thing well now person who has tremendous number of overts when they remain constant are simply trying to solve present time problem with overts and youll find most anybody is trying to solve problem with overts thats why they commit thesewhy they keep doing these things because they got some problem and it goes back to ptp but the overt itself can be on the part of the society or on the part of the individual during any course of auditing over month or year but not over the course of session so you sometimes wind up with this kind of situation you audit the pc just long enough to get the gates open and the pc leaves the session and gets the gates closed in youryour face and what youve got to have then is sufficient gain so the pc gets up high enough that the gates dont get closed in your face before you get to audit the pc again and that is the primary problem of overts it isnt whether or not society will be damaged i think it will take care of itself until we get around to it by plenty of damage were not worried about like the psychiatrist the total evaluation of the psychiatrist is whether or not people in society will be damaged thats why he has to damage people hes solving the problem of the destructive conduct of people thats the onethats what brings him in close to the police all the time why you always find him inrepresenting people in police courts and all this sort of thing heshis problem is the problem of the societythat people shouldnt act destructivelyand he considers himself sort of mental cop its not for the patient you see its for society that hes operating well that explains most of his inhumanities with regard to the society well his problem is social problem and hes trying to solve it in his own way peculiar as they are but now your problem then at that time would become social problem and you would find yourself having to solve the social aspect of the case because you cant make any progress with the case you sometimes collide with this unwittingly and you just think its out of your control and so you dont handle it but case can commit whole bunch of seriesa whole series continuously of overts with consequent withholds from you which park the case into thud and this is more or less the continuous nochanging overt case that case however does go up and down it doesnt hang like ptp does but thethe guythe guy for whole week goes without hitting any little kids over the head and then hes just got to hit little kid over the head toward the end of the week and this is another overt but you dont hear about this i was very interested one time in pc i was supervising the auditing of to find out that this pc habitually killed animals it was very interesting you know just well animalkill the animal he had to do it dont you see its all very reasonable and the pc was making progress at all and this was the mystery which was being posed what was going on dont you see and eventually why we dug and dug and dug and we finally found out that it wasnt somethingit wasnt an animal the way freud would have had it that the child had killed when they were two by accidentally sitting on it this was thethis was the simple procedure of when cat was seen and nobody else was around then the cat had to be slowly choked to death until it was very dead see so this was what the auditor was going up against you see that gate was closed did this person ever dare be frank with the auditor oh do you see well the pc had the gate shut and intended to keep it shut and therefore there could be communication with the auditor and you saw the result of wobbly type of gain the pc for little while would knock off this sort of thing you see and the force of the process all by itself would start driving the pc up the line now when either society or the pc sees theyre all of sudden getting better and that mustnt happen because they really should stay in very weak stateotherwise theyd be very destructiveso they pull themselves back down again and you see the case going this way on the graph see just up and down up and down but not getting anywhere you know they climb up the well three inches andat night and fall back three inches in the daytime they dont even make it two they fall back three when you get that you know youre looking at continuing overt that isnt well documented i havent got tons of cases against this representation for this excellent reason is you dont find out about them very often its very hard to collect data on because the mechanism of it is withhold see so you suspect more about that level than you ever really find out on broad level because very often auditors are shy about inquiring into the private lives of others to the force and duress necessary to have cracked this one and if the auditorim now talking on the basis of relatively untrained auditor he has diffidence dont you see the personal privacy of the pc is well of course he doesnt know enough about the mind to realize that that personal privacy is what is making that pc have lumbosis and that its just about as safe to have around dont you see as handful of scorpions itas long as this remains terribly private our pc is going to remain awfully sick that doesnt look to to be sensible attitude therefore but nevertheless you find that auditors when they first enter training and that sort of thing you find theyre being very diffident diffident did you ever commit an overt against the hasi well i missed withhold someplace in the group right now all right thats all right i forgive you now somebody some year or two from now is going to come along and say you remember that thousand pounds you missed well i took it and you forgave remember in the session and having asked this question this auditor received the response yes i once stole pen i think it was off the registrars desk or something and the auditor was so relieved to have pulled this overt and knew the pc was now going to get better that stayed in my mind as classic man classic this was an overt so thats the wobbly condition which you find at that level they wont let themselves progress because they would do much worse theyve got it all figured out you see if they catch themselves getting well they put themselves down to the bottom of the well again quick if society sees them getting any better why everybody opens up on them with guns because they know this guy is dangerous dont you see and you get wibblewobble going on but you know that there is areally continuousa continuous type overt there repeating type overt thats what you know about it and thatsthats the key to that gate its continuous repeating type overt theres something going on it happens over and over its happened many times and its been very dangerous and it isnt stealing pen from hasi its little worse than that and not only that but society agrees its worse than that it isnt the personal mores of the individual has now figured it out guys who try to give you overts off the past trackas soon as somebody tries to give some overts off the past track i stamp them down into this lifetime why well if they havent run well on overts in this lifetime why i know that they will then go on the backtrack because ill call to your attention that none of the praetorian guard of rome have any longer any power of arrest thats safe overt to disclose see so i figure the guy is dodging around about something its not that there arent whole track overts good heavens but guy would have to be flying like bird to really be taking responsibility for them look to really call them an overt he would have to have taken some responsibility for his past lives and hed have to take some responsibility and hed have to have some positive memory of this and so forth in other words lot of conditions are there and this rule then it doesnt pervade 100 percent that every time you audited pc and he brought up past track overt he was dodging present life overt im talking about this birdhe hasnt been audited that long or that effectively you understand and hes giving you past track overts oh dont you see were dodging some continuous chain of overts and the proof of this thing isthe proof of this thing is that i have watched several such cases never get any better on auditing and finally have chased it down to that and it was only when i began to load up blunderbuss and say this life brother now where you live this life where you have been john jones now thatswe want something that you have done during this period of time see now when were you born well i was born well youre invalidating my past track yes i know i am thank you what i want to know is i just got to be sure here that in this span from the 21st of june since 1921 or something like that until now whats the date well itsitsits 1964 all right thats fine now during that span of time have you ever done anything that you considered socially reprehensible or that anybody else did oh well theyre always being unreasonable about it unreasonable about what now of course the eat leaps out of the bag see what is this thing now lets find out what this is when we get that one out of the road were into the gates otherwise this overt running can be sometimes used by the pc to keep you outside do you see so running overts can be backfiring proposition and you sometimes can run overts endlessly without ever getting an overt dont you see this becomes then the peculiarities of some failures that you run into in cases this is all covered in dozens of different ways in the book of remedies but now those are the primarythe primary things that are going on and youll find out in the book of remedies that they equate downthe general thing is although it may not be totally plain to you when you look over the remedy you actually are going toward an arc break the person has had in life or is in now or overts or withholds or missed withholds of some kind or another that have been passed up that nobody has found out about and even the pc might not know about or its some kind of lockedup postulatecounterpostulate masscountermass that is in that delicate balance that permits possible case gain see the person is so fixatedhes postulate and hes looking at postulate b and he would so little be postulate b and he is being so much postulate that he is just pinned right there he looks like somebody you know thats just got his eye glued to one of these machines that you drop penny in in the penny arcades you know and somehow or another its gotten busted and continues to run there he is man he just isnt going to take his eye away from that man and he appears to arc break easily he appears to do various other things which are quite peculiar beeautruth of the matter is when you have distracted his attention from what he is so fixated on it hits him so he knows better than to let his attention be distracted from this peephole see he knows that if he takes his eye away from it why somebody is going to hit him he mustnt leave it and so there he is so youre auditing and hes sort of putting you off over here youre sort of auditing at this three or four feet distance you see from the pc and hell sort of handle these things backwards and forwards and you ask him question and so forth you suddenly say to him very searchingly and so forth what was the question i just asked you how does that answer the auditing what question well the question that you wereyou were just asked actually youre talking you knowthis guyall of his attention is fixated right here see and he says well what question are you talking about and you get into some of the silliest discussions when you find yourself in one of these silly discussions realize that youve never had any part of the pcs attention that you dont have the pcs attention in session the pc hasnt been insession youre auditing his right hand so when you have awhen you have situation goingwhen you have situation going that you dont easily comprehend youll find it added up in the book of remedies but you could possibly whip yourself up nice bowlful of remedy yourself if you just carefully took this apart on the basis of is it ptp is it an overt with its withholds and so forth or is it an arc break now youll find out that in general auditing you dont have to fall back on the book of remedies but you find out if your pc has ptp in session and you dont handle it youre going to get into trouble if you try to audit over the top of an arc break youre going to get into trouble and if the pc has committed an overt between sessions that you dont know about youre going to get into trouble so these things youve always got there and theyretheyll be constant thats why im pointing them up they are not then just merely remedy of whole case they take place in the small portion of session so you see then an auditors actions are broken down into two sections and one is the action of routine where hes following through and the other is making the case auditable and receptive to the receipt of the routine now hes got to do that before he can run the routine so the auditor has these two differentwidely differentclasses of action and the huntandpunch proposition of trying to find out what ails this case and that sort of thing is frankly not necessary on all cases you wont find all cases are equally difficult to start fortunately actually its not majority even its minority so tremendous number of people theyll make some distance in other words just on plain repetitive process dont you see and as theyre going upas theyre going up through i and so on theyre not getting so much better that it alarms them you dont have the overt mechanisms jumping in and you know various other factors enter in here to support the grade i auditor at 0 well it doesnt make any difference you see to him and he isnt up there but at i when he finally gets up to level of release then hell put himself back downhill again if youve got an overt mechanism present so therefore we have to bring in the book of remedies at grade ii and all the way along the line from there on up the auditor has to be alert to these in any session which he is conducting hes got to be right on the ball on those three things those are the things that will keep him out when its something more than this and appears to be more than this and appears to be terribly serious and itso forth just knock it off knock it off its one of those three things oh yes i know but its such terrible situation and its so ghastly and the results of this are so awful that it must possibly be more complex than simply ptps or overts or arc breaks i am sorry it couldnt possibly because they are about as bad as you can get and you cant get any further south with the surface manifestations of the case than case in chronic ptp case chronically and continuously committing the same type of overt or somebody who is very badly arc broken and doesnt know what ails him and is just out of control with his switchboard shorted up from one side and one end to the other now when you have those conditions why youve got the chronically failed case he isnt going to destimulate because this is so restimulated dont you see an auditor is going to have to do something about it to make this person auditable so even at level 0 and level i these people exist dont you see and they are in terrible state let assure you they arethey dont improve and anything you doyou point finger at themtheyone or another of these factors will restimulate whatever one is wrong so your proper procedure at those levels would be to turn the pc over to an auditor who knew how straighten the pc up and then turn the pc back over to the original grade just because hes been straightened up at ii or iii is reason he is now in shape to run at ii or iii hes now about in shape to itsa because these processes are pretty heroic if you look them over they comb pcs hair mighty smooth but it sometimes has to be done very roughly trying to get somebody to come up with the actual overt necessary to resolve the case and so forth it can be rather duressful situation well im just going to sit here all night long im perfectly willing to sit here all night long and youre going to sit there all night long and well just wait until you finally do tell what has fallen on this meter and you find the pc saying well all right if you put it that way it was i who threw the handful of tacks down on the gutter that your car ran over and why you had flat tire last night all right now go ahead and shoot this is pretty wild sometimes you come up on this you cant get onto the gradient of communication at all dont you see what are you willing to talk to about and so forth that would work in almost all cases this guy is perfectly willing to talk to you about anything except this one overt well theres only one thing to do from that point on is practically choke it out of him by duress all right i tell you what when youre willing to tell about this we will have some more auditing okay end of session what what happened oh you put it that way im perfectly willing to tell you about it its just sort of nasty habit i have nasty habit i have actually its an impulse to drown girls its quite quite interesting there are ways to approach these smoothly on gradient but in the final analysis it comes up to the fact that its something you have to do and you can be as nice about it or as smooth about it as you want to but remember it is something you have to do and sometimes that exceeds being nice about it well anywayanyway those are the barriers but they exist all the way on up the line now the book of remedies of course falls back and leads to those things one way or the other throughout its length and breadth and it might be rather obscure how some of those remedies do lead to some of those things because they are empirically arrived at the remedies are theyre just things that have worked consistently for long period of time but these three are the dominant ones and these are the three which get in the road of routines and which you have to handle continuously as an auditor so i thought id better sum them up and tell you all i knew about them as rapidly as i could thank you very much
