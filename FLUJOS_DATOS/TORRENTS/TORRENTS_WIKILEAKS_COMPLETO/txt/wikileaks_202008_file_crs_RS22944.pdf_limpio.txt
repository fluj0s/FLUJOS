2071 at 7 cigarette smoke is known as the ftc st method or the cambridge filter method2 under the cambridge filter method machin takes one puff of 2second duration and 35ml volume every minute and smokes each cigarette to specified length3 according to the agency this testing met hod is not intended to replicate actual human smoking4 the machine measures tar nicoti ne and carbon monoxide yields of the different cigarette brands5 cigarettes with tar ratin g above 15 mg are commonly referred to by the industry as full flavor cigare ttes with tar rating of less than 15 mg are referred to by the industry as low or light while cigarettes with tar rating of 6 mg or less are referred to by the i ndustry as ultra low or ultra light6 these descriptive terms that the industry uses are not defined by the ftc or the government in general as the united states stated in an amicus brief to the supreme court7 however an expert witness for philip morris has asserted in price v philip morris inc discussed below that the ftc has given guidance to the industry and others regarding the use of descriptors such as low tar in two ftc consent orders between the ftc and the american brands cigarette company fro m 1971 and 1995 as well as in ftc reports to congress and other agency documents8 the ftc has expressed concerns that th tar and nicotine ratings based on the machine test method tend to be relatively poor predictors of tar and nicotine exposure as smokers of cigarettes with lower tar or nicotine ratings ie light and ultra low cigarettes tend to compensate by taking bigger deeper or more frequent puffs or otherwise altering their smoking behavior to obtain the dosage of nicotine they need9 such compensation may thus affect the amount of tar nicotine and carbon monoxidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22944crs3 10 kovacic supra note 2 at 7 11 id at 10 quoting national institutes of health national cancer ins titute smoking and tobacco control monograph 13 risk s

receive12 the ftc 1966 guidance and the agen cys proposal to rescind it in 1966 federal register notice of public hearing the ftc stated that the cambridge filter method was specified by the co mmission on march 25 1966 as that to be used to support any factual statements of tar and cotine content of the mainstream smoke of cigarettes13 the march 25 1966 statement by the ftc did not mandate that cigarette companies state tar and nicotine yields on tobacco product packaging but rather set forth the type of substantiation the ca mbridge filter method the commission would deem adequate to support statemen ts of tar and nicotine yields if cigarette companies choose to make such statements14 this 1966 guidance indicat ed that such factual statements generally will not violate the ftc act as long as 1 collateral representations other than factual statements of tar and nicotine content of cigarettes offered for sale to the public are made expressly or by implication as to reduction or elimination of health hazards and 2 the statement of tar and nicotine content is supported by adequate records of tests conducted in accordance with the cambridge filter method15 on july 14 2008 the ftc issued notice in the federal register that proposed to rescind its march 25 1966 statement16 the commission reasoned that because the cambridge filter method has serious limitati ons the ftcs

issue continuedconfusing or misleading to consumers who believe they will get proportionately less of the harmful substances from cigarette sm oke by smoking relatively loweryield cigarettes17 the ftc also stated that its initial rationale for permitting such statements belief in 1966 that reducing the amount of tar in cigarette could reduce smokers risk of lung cancer and therefor that providing information about tar and nicotine yields could aid smokers in maki ng informed decisions about the cigarettes they smoked l onger appears valid18 implications of rescission if the agency rescinds its guidance the cigarette industry should longer use terms sugges ting the ftcs endorse ment or approval of any specific test method19 phrases that would need to be withdrawn if the guidance is rescinded would include term s such as per ftc method20 for example the official website for camel cigarettes lists several brands of camel cigarettes as well as their tar and nicotine average ratings per cigarette by ftc method21 the ftc stated that its proposal to rescind the guidance did not addr ess the use of descriptive terms such as low or ultra light because the agency has not provided guidance regarding authorized the use of or created an enforcem ent policy with respect to such descriptors22 however the ftc stated that once it rescinds the guidance on factual statements regarding tar and nicotine such statements would be evaluated the same as any other advertising or marketing claims subject to the commissions jurisdiction the statements could be made as long as they were truthful nonmislead ing and adequately substantiated23 since the ftc noted in its proposal to rescind the guidance that statements based on the cambridge filter method may be confusing or misleading to consumers the rescission of this guidance may lead to ftc enforcement actions in the future24 does the ftc need to even pr opose to rescind its 1966 guidance the proposal to rescind the ftcs march 25

advise the public prospectively of the manner in which the agency proposes to exercise discretionary power26 in this case the ftc advised the cigarette industry as to how it would address factual stat ements based on the cambridge filter method guidance documents do not impose any rights and obligations27 nor do they establish binding norm because they are not finally determinative of the issues or righ ts to which they are addressed28 the apas procedural requirements rega rding noticeandcomment rulemaking do not apply to interpretive ru general statements of policy or rules of agency organization procedure or practice29 therefore while notice in the federal register would be required to repeal rule30 there is similar requirement for the withdrawal of guidance document however it appears that the ftc is publishing notice of its proposal to withdraw the guidance document in the federal register for the sake of clarifying agency policy and perhaps as matter of good governance as the rescission of the guidance may be contr oversial and have c onsequences for the cigarette industry31 select court cases in price v philip morris inc the illinois supreme court partly relied on the ftcs guidance document in conjunction with consent orders and other statements by the agency in determining that cigarette company could not be held liable for light and lowtar labeling under stat consumer fraud statute in the courts view the ftc specifically authorized tob acco companies use of such terms if they were accompanied by clear and conspicuous disclosure of the tar and
