the book of case remedies manual covering preclear dif ficulties and their remedies by l ron hubbardthe book of case remedies 2 dedication to founding scientologist everywherethe book of case remedies 3 how to use this book this is professional text part of the clearing series it does not give the processes on which cases should be run to achieve higher levels it gives the processes you have to use when the case doesnt run on standard processes to use this book properly one does not start or run cases with the remedies given one uses the table of remedies contained herein when the case has not run at all or momen tarily or consistently does not advance on general processes when the case wont run whether for session or for many sessions look the preclear up in the table of remedies and use the prescribed action only long enough to get the preclear running again then return to the regular processes for the level preface for this edition the first edition in 1964 of l ron hubbards the book of case remedies gave auditors necessary points of technology for the last push to the great releasing and clearing successes that followed only year later release grade and clearing technology was completed by l ron hubbard and students were already started on the big one itself the clearing course in one and half years from the first clear we had close to seven hundred more clearsthere is not the slightest question about any part of the route people from every where and all sorts of backgrounds are taking their steps easily the clearing course and the training and release grades leading smoothly to it are all utterly provenly successful any new list of clears as of any date has to be revised upward fast as new graduates finish the clearing course growing and doubling in numbers and to graduate from that course one has attained the state which is philosophys win after thousands of years there were clears before everthe book of case remedies becomes with rons hco bulletins of 9 vember 1967 and 13 january 1968 new book and new technical breakthrough this ex panded edition contains all the material of 1964 it also releases new technology resulting from upper level discoveries by l ron hubbard his text is thus expanded but is not otherwise changed in this editionremember that except for the new materials added in this edition it was written during the last phases of total clearing research release and clear were found in completed clearing technology and result to be higher states than at any earlier time described when ron says clear in this book he is talking about what is now known to be high release levels ot or operating thetan has its levels all yet above clear and its proper courses at the advanced organization only clear can take them or could handle onethe book of case remedies 4 the editorsthe book of case remedies 5 chapter 1 the tradition of scientology once upon time preclears were full of mysteries and unknowns once to resolve case it was necessary to have crystal ball clean record with the archangel michael and lot of luck fourteen active years and tens of thousands of pcs preclears have changed all thatduring this past summer when i had completed the routine 6 pcs own goals re search i was able to review all the levels and stages pc or an auditor scientology practitio ner has to go through what emerged in getting this material into understandable form was that people had in general confused clearing and operating thetans ots clearing many had tried to deify clears and had rarely understood otclears and clearing are actually fully explained in the first published article on dianet ics dianetics the evolution of science and in book one dianetics the modern science of mental health clear is the name of button on an adding machine when you push it all the hidden answers in the machine clear and the machine can be used for proper computa tion so long as the button is not pressed the machine adds all old answers to all new efforts to compute and wrong answers result people who have old fixed answers reacting when they try to think get wrong an swers when they try to solve their current problems such old answers are not cleared rollo is still solving the tantrums of his mother who has been dead for years marybelle is still run ning away from the tramp who attacked her when she was 10 years old so rollo stays home as the solution to the women of the world and marybelle runs madly about as solution toall the uncouth men she sees their friends think theyre bit odd their doctors prescribe pills and we clear the old senseless answers which wont let them get more sensible answers as adding machines or any kind of calculator they would be junked they give wrong an swers to life because they already have hidden answer in their cog wheels they are not clearedwell really thats all clear is clears are beings who have been cleared of wrong an swers or useless answers which keep them from living or thinking the state of clear now the state of being cleared was what confused the issue people wanted to know what theyd be like if they were cleared good question data accumulated but not as fast asthe questions the people cleared would be better feel better act better be more moral etc all that is matter of recordthe book of case remedies 6 but the craving for an absolute caused everyone to put the state called ot in place of the condition of being cleared absolutes in our axioms are unobtainable the state of operating thetan operating thetan is state of beingness it is being at cause over matter energy space time form and life operating comes from able to operate without dependency on things and thetan is the greek letter theta theta which the greeks used to represent thought or perhaps spirit to which an n is added to make new noun in the modern style used to create words in engineering it is also thetan or theta to the nth degree meaning unlimited or vast the traditional concept in brief thetan is an individual spirit or soul or life unit or fifty other things all add ing up to the traditional concept of mans spiritual nature or beingness more radical recent thought departed into adventurous bypaths and announced contrary to more conservative philosophy and usual acceptance that man was an animal made up of brain and bones and possessing soul this may have made the originators of this quaint russogerman school feel less guilty for what they did to men in wars and science but it takes more than marxist psychologist to change every mans basic philosophy forever and 9999 of earths people at least still believe they have souls or are souls only the philosophically illiterate and the agitators for the recent radical schools of psychology suppose they have made inroads in mans belief that he has or is soul only those who seek to enslave man would try to sell the idea of soulless man the rest of us and we comprise remember 9999 of the population of the planet still hold to the concept that we are spirits or spiritual beings and that we go elsewhere when we die only men who have quite thirst for revenge would want others to totally die following tradition remaining with more traditional philosophy and working with what seemed more rea sonable i was able to demonstrate in 1952 the actual existence of this thing called spirit the experiments of exteriorization but wishing to avoid spiritualism or even soul because both had such bulky histories as words i coined the word thetan derived as above and scien tologists ever since have been quite happy with it i should have called it the more traditional greek word psyche perhaps but at that time i saw virtue in being confused with psychologists who explain in their own texts that they dont know what their own name means as they dont know what psyche is and dont believe there is one which rather upsets their title to the word they use for them selves but anyway for better or worse i used thetanthe book of case remedies 7the book of case remedies 8 the ultimate state it soon became quite visible that the spiritual condition could be improved and an ul timate attainment of cause over matter energy space time form and life was possible now this was the ultimate state operating thetan theoretically attainable tran scendence over death and the travails of mortal existence it was dream bold dream but not new dream like everything else we have in scientology it is based on traditional phi losophy the thinking then of every great civilization up to this century not only would have grasped the meaning of this but were themselves seeking to attain it name great name in historical philosophy all right he was trying to attain ot by means of exploration of life thought man or the reason of things only in the last few decades has the dream been challenged by radical few that they teach in universities is only comment that todays universities arent the halls of enlighten ment they were ah well they can all be improved and it would take more than these rebel lious few to smash one of mans great dreams the dream of freedom of spirit the dream of freedom of self the dream of ascending above base matter clear differs from ot so ot was the state of beingnessclear was gradient condition gradual betteringduring studies of the past year all this disentangled and became understood and for the first time was easy to express clear is not gradient up to ot clear is gradient up to homo novis only homo man novis new this is desirable improvement very desirable for anyone an entirely new thing has to be done to make an operating thetanbut one had to know how to make one to find out about one and routine 6 the proc ess that makes an ot starts really at homo novis certainly routine 6 runs best on homonovis the proof is that those scientologists who have been pretty well cleared dont have any trouble at all with routine 6 and those who havent been cleared and particularly those who have had few gains in processing have pretty awful time of it with routine 6 they get bit along with it but its like watching pygmy wrestle with an elephant thus although we have routine 6 my task has been to bring preclears up to clear and then to send them onward to ot the levels to ot this is done and very doable it is by moving the being up to few basic wins with ordinary processing up to level iii and then moving the preclear up to clear level iv and then going for ot which is level vi v being skipped but left in place because it contains known type of technology not needed but necessary to know the existence of to stretch point one is really clearing from level i to level iv but clearing now that ive had chancethe book of case remedies 9 to refine it is itself process that takes skill and ability both to run and receive and one has to get the being up to doing that so being who can do that is release which reaches up to level ii these stages as expressed in levels are all quite real and are getting very precise see chart of gradients fourteen years of work developed lot of knowhow and it all fell into its rightful place when one got to where one could stand high and inspect the ground be low one needed routine 6 and the practical attainability of ot to see where one was with thefellow who just walked in off the street how did one get such fellow from the coal pit to themountain top that was the problem level vi achieving operating thetan cause over matter energy space time form and life level v phenomena encountered but not necessarily

an effect of the environ ment level i achievingrelease one who can get better and knows he has benefited and knows he wont get worse level 0 achievingapprentice scientologist one who knows how to know how to study what life is about homo sapiens gradients of various statesthe book of case remedies 10 chapter 2 handling the preclear at the lowest place on the route up one finds the roughest auditing conditions there is heroic effort that will produce an instantaneous and permanent gain one can produce fast gain that is so fast it unstabilizes the pc its all too sudden and new and thepc cant take it so quick witness the fate of pc who is suddenly exteriorized deprived of body even for few minutes in auditing matter how much better he feels for those few minutes the change is too quick you can exteriorize any pc thats sudden and fast and im permanent so its research tool not an auditing procedure you possibly could clear somebody by some lightning fast means but down hed come again why because you havent cleared enough buttons thats all you left too many wrong answers on the case for the case to be right in new state the secret of preclear gains the secret of handling the preclear is getting the pc wins he or she can have in the world he or she is living in and getting more and more such wins until new gains are accept able and therefore stable after that you can go for broke in clearing and when you have cleared the pc until he can stand unaided and get right answers in the existence he or she is living in you can again go for broke with routine 6 and you eventually have ot be comfortable i speak now from very well substantiated technical height which it took all the four teen years since book one to climb and i find it can be done rather easily if it is done from step to upward step and not subjected to an impatient hit or miss scramble in scrambling one only gets bruised on the rocks this is not to say it takes long time it takes rather steady and orderly time not flying before one can walk so to speak and being able to look up without getting dizzy and to look down without being overcome with the grandeur of ones own climb be comfortable about it is the bywordpeople enroute at comfortable rate are actually unaware of gains they just take them for granted the auditors taskthe book of case remedies 11 the auditors task in handling the preclears case is to guide the pc upward and again upward to comfortable acceptable wins which the pc can have and which therefore will be permanentthe book of case remedies 12 chapter 3 keep the pc getting audited in order to help anyone much less make clears and ots it is necessary to keep the pc getting auditing that sounds rather easy at first glance with all the dazzling goals that can be set for him or her but in actual fact this is the only place auditors fall down obviously you cant clear anybody regardless of the techniques you have if the pre clear wont keep on getting auditing give an auditor preclear to audit and auditors do very well indeed but when the pc blows or just doesnt turn up any more what then thats the end of clearing isnt it the basic problemso the basic problem of making clears and ots is not getting preclears to have audit ing thats easy really its getting preclears to keep on getting auditing and there is where auditors yes and case supervisors fall down the preclear must get wins there are several reasons why it is hard to get pc to go on getting auditing they add up under the heading wins if pc is not getting wins then two things happena since the pc is not getting more able the pc is not earning fast enough or finding the additional time necessary to have auditing andb the goal of attaining higher state is thwarted and this arc breaks the pcif pc is getting wins thena the pc gets more able earns more or finds more wherewithal and accomplishes more in given period of time leaving more time to use for auditing and b the minor upsets or discomforts which accompany even the smoothest auditing are disregarded economics i am sorry to have to mention economics but these play their role operating in soci ety full of economic traps and snares one has to have solution to them or falter and this applies to both the auditor and the pc regardless of whether there is any charge for the audit ing or not freedom from economic acute duress means freedom to get audited or audit and such freedom is bought more easily by ability than chance but persons progress improvesthe book of case remedies 13 the persons control over things long before ot is approached actually long before clear is realizedthe book of case remedies 14 the road is long people dont realize how long the road is they dont want to confront it but theres an awful lot of aberration between an ordinary being and release much less clear release is one who knows he isnt going to get worse the command of release over his time and possessions while not overwhelmingly great compared to clears is yet fabulous compared to one who was never audited at all the necessity for wins so it is vitally necessary to keep the pc getting wins matter how small to keep the pc getting audited this is sometimes hard to do for the traps of life are always yawning for the person near the bottom in fact the closer the person is to the bottom the more likely he or she is to fall into one of lifes snares therefore the closer to the start the person is the more necessary it is to get him wins for the easier it is for him to be thrown about in his routine daily existence as catastro phe is simply arrived at just in day to day living while quite uncleared and as the persons answers in that state are not likely to have high percentage of accuracy the easier it is for him to get into condition where he cant receive further auditing for economic social or other reasons it takes wins to surmount all that if being at any point on the route blows departs for good theyve lost the final attainment even if they did have benefits know the answers so to make releases clears and ots one has to know the answer to how do you keep pc getting auditing to answer that you have to know the answer to how do you handle case that isnt winning and to know that you have to know how do you handle casesand to know that you have to know how do you handle the particu lar kinds and conditions of cases all that must seem very vast and indeed it has been the knowledge has been of highly specialized kind borne out of years of training and experience what do you do when the pc does whatauditing supervisors have been beating their skulls in on such problems for yearstherefore seeing this i developed sort of tablethis table or list gives what to watch for what to look into when it happens and what to run to take care of it now all these processes are old ones theyre tried and trustythe book of case remedies 15 i have not tried in this book to give you the magic processes that assist or release or heal or clear or make ot for this material is not the material the auditor falls down on in this book i have given you the processes that keep pc getting audited when he seems to stop or wants to stop or might stop the fundamental basics given any kind of competent training the auditor must realize only these thingsa if pc be kept getting auditing the most dazzling results can be obtained by fol lowing the processes for those results b if the pc cant be kept at auditing results can be obtainedc that the pc who gets regular wins acceptable to the pc will keep on being auditedd that the pc who doesnt get his small quota of wins will blow ande that the blowing preclear is the only remaining generally unhandled problem in any auditing activity f that the preclear can be handled so as not to blow and to get winsthis book tells you how to do these thingsthe book of case remedies 16 chapter 4 the ptp overt and arc break the three general areas which prevent wins are 1 the ptp present time prob lem 2 the overt act with its withholds of all varieties and 3 the arc break suddendrop in affinity reality and communication the following facts are some of the best sub stantiated facts in the whole of our technology the present time problem 1 the presence of present time problem in session unless handled will prevent all gain if ptp exists in the pc and you try to audit something else and ignore the ptp the pcs personality graph will show change the ta tone arm of the meter will not move well the pc will not make his or her session goals and auditing may eventually cease the overt act 2 in the presence of an overt act undisclosed to the auditor and withheld from him matter how openly it may once have been done the auditing cycle of communication be tween auditor and pc as in trs 0 to 4 cannot occur as the pc is withholding therefore nothing can vanish in the pcs reactive mind and auditing becomes painful the graph will not change nor will the ta move well the arc break 3 in the presence of an arc break the pcs attention is so distracted by the reactive charge that has been bypassed restimulated but overlooked by both pc and auditor that the strain of splitting attention between the charge in the bank and the auditor will operate to worsen the pcs case reduce the pcs graph and freeze the tone arm of the meter therefore one must not pursue an auditing cycle during an arc break but may only locate and indicate the bypassed charge the main point if an auditor doesnt handle these three things competently the pc will eventually cease to be audited now recognizing that these three things the ptp the overt and the arc break are all that really forestall continued auditing it becomes necessary for the auditor to know his bulle tins and be skilled in practice and to be successful in releasing healing clearing or making ots i make attempt here to give all the anatomy and ways of handling the three demons named above the technology is all over the place in bulletins and publications and also i in tend to do book on each onethe book of case remedies 17 here i only wish to point out that if pc gets wins he or she will get more auditing if he gets enough steady auditing on standard processes he or she will go all the way up and only the ptp overt and arc break can prevent the wins and cause the blows so to release heal clear or make ots one has to be an expert on blows their cause and curethe book of case remedies 18 chapter 5 the pc that quits pcs who blow or cease to be audited do so because 1 nobody noticed the rising arc break2 the proper action was not taken in time handling blows therefore one has to do three things in handling pc who is about to blow or who blows blow means leave get out rush away cease to be where one should really be or just cease to be audited these are 1 notice the condition or circumstances leading to blow long before the person does this is probably the single hardest thing to teach according to my experience as it pends on the auditor instructor or scientologist observing and not being so reasonable about the beings condition that nothing is done 2 take the proper action to prevent the blow by proper action is meant to find out what the circumstances preceding the condition have been and then to fit to those circum stances course of action example pc has been running level i only well one wouldnt go into level vi or level iv processes if the pc has been running itsa saying its _______ then obviously there is only the auditors acknowledgement to consider so one only finds out what hasnt been acked acknowledged example if the person has only been studying one finds out what the missed definition was in short base the action on what the being who is blowing was doing just before the blow 3 carry out the course of action effectively dont just find out if the person has withholds pull them example hgc pc is blowing pc was running overts d of p director of processing tells auditor to find the missed withhold auditor comes back and says yes there was one the d of p thinks thats good thats handled then the d of p hears that the pc went back to smokeville in the middle of the intensive checking the d of p finds that although missed withhold registered on the meter and one was pulled there was filthy nee dle afterwards so there were several missed withholds and an ineffectual job was done remedies remedies for threats about blowing or blows are only good if1 the condition is observed 2 what the person has been doing just before is found out and course of action based on that is planned 3 the course of action is effectively car ried out unless these things are done one often finds the person who is blowing is already be yond reach remedies not properly selected or carried out do not seem to work and so get invalidatedthe book of case remedies 19 remedies are quite workable when the above steps are followed but pie that is too sour and requires sugar doesnt get any sweeter if you pour salt into it whereas salt is per fectly acceptable when added to dish that needs salt hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead

auditors need direct mechanical technology to do these three processes effec tively remedy remedy locates the misunderstoods person has in scientology originally it read misunderstood words words of course will emerge in the general run of misunder stoods remedy is done only by listing it must not be done verbally alone it is level iii process the listing question is in the subjects of dianetics or scientology who or what has been misunderstood the item is found on the list and given to the student that is all there is other step the rules of listing all applythe book of case remedies 20 if the student wont have the item it is not correct and the list must be straightened up with the general auditing rules that govern listing remedy b the form of this process is changed it is done by three lists these three may only be done by formal listing and the general tech of listing as governed by level iii tech the lists make the form of an i pt subject list into past list misunderstood list list 1b this is done to locate what in the scientology pt is giving trouble it is done as list and the item is found the listing question isin your studies of dianetics and scientology who or what are you having trouble with the item is found and given to the studentthis step is governed by all the tech of listing list 2b the item found on list 1b is now listed in order to find the past track subject similar to what is giving trouble in present time the listing question isin your past who or what was similar toitem found in list 1bit is highly illegal to limit the question to this lifetimeall the rules of listing applythe item is found and given to the student list 3b the third list of the process is now done the listing question iswho or what was misunderstood inthe item found on list 2bthe book of case remedies 21 the listing is covered by the general tech of listing as found in level iii the item is found and given to the student ________________ this completes the remedy b if floating needle occurs any time during the process with good indicators thoroughly visible in the student the process is concluded at that point the process is used on anyone having trouble studying dianetics or scientology the trouble as it doesnt clear up with remedy is coming from some prior subject more than one of these can be done if all steps are done for each one s d search and discovery of suppression is called an s and d it locates the suppres sives on the case i have several times undercut gotten processes that reach deeper on s dsthe earliest process asked merely who might have been suppressive to the pc this is still valid but i have found 2 flaws in it 1 the auditor does not do listing type s d at all but just chattily brushes it off 2 the list from this question contains an actual suppressive that is passed right over therefore i undercut the question and obtained much better results because the new question reached deeper the new question was who or what might have suppressed you then i recalled an even deeper question this was what purpose has been sup pressed this was given to qual div sh some time ago it would have 2 lists the first is for the purpose as above and the second would be who or what suppressedpurpose found for some reason probably because one did 2 lists this undercut was neglectedtherefore i researched further and developed what we will now use as an s dit is one of these killer processes it is very strong so it isnt to be carelessly doneif you get wrong item on an s d you can make the pc ill so one has to do an s d right and follow all the rules of listing as given in level iii tech also i find now that when list item found is generality multiple subject not spe cific such as dogs or the public the list is simply not complete one does not have to settle for generality and then list the generality he will find that the pc will eventually listthe book of case remedies 22 the specific nongeneral item anyway of course one can also do represent list of general item found if that seems best the real question for an s d was established only when i found purpose all sup pressives have in common and is very fundamental effort in suppressives this effort by suppressives when found then permitted to form the question the key s d question iswho or what has attempted to unmock youunmocking an effort to reduce or make disappear is the primary effort of suppres sives therefore the listing question on test delivers up items totally overlooked by the ear lier types of s d the question needs to be cleared carefully for nonscientology if it has to be re phrased watch out as the meaning may vanish tried to make nothing of you might substi tute but at this writing only unmock has been tested and question for others than educated scientologists will be developed and issued and made part of the enclosure for the book this s d question must be done by listing only and with great care to follow level iii listing tech as it being powerful will backfire on the pc if done carelessly and wrong item is found the item is found by listing and given to the pc which is the end of the process if generality results it may be represented but listing continued will give the same result of single item general item must not be given to the pc as the final result this process will now be standard

by s ds where the person can be processed these are all listing processes and if the auditor is not welltrained and good at the technology of listing not only will good result occur but the pc given wrong item overlisted or underlisted or audited over an arc break or ptp can be made ill pcs who become ill are always to greater or lesser degree pts these questions should not be shown to pc as they

grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 10 august 1973 remimeo hco secseosmaastech secsds of ppts pack pts handling pts potential trouble source there are two stable data which anyone has to have understand and know are true in order to obtain results in handling the person connected to suppressives these data are 1 that all illness in greater or lesser degree and all foulups stem directly and only from pts condition 2 that getting rid of the condition requires three basic actions discover b handle or disconnect persons called upon to handle pts people can do so very easily far more easily than they believe their basic stumbling block is thinking that there are exceptions or that there is other tech or that the two above data have modifiers or are not sweeping the moment per who is trying to handle ptss gets persuaded there are other conditions or reasons or techhe is at once lost and will lose the game and not obtain results and this is very too bad be cause it is not difficult and the results are there to be obtained to turn someone who may be pts over to an auditor just to have him mechanically audited may not be enough in the first place this person may not have clue what is meant by pts and may be missing all manner of technical data on life and may be so overwhelmed by suppressive person or group that he is quite incoherent thus just mechanically doing process may miss the whole show as it misses the persons understanding of why it is being done pts person is rarely psychotic but all psychotics are pts if only to themselves pts person may be in state of deficiency or pathology which prevents ready recovery butat the same time he will not fully recover unless the pts condition is also handled for he be came prone to deficiency or pathological illness because he was pts and unless the condition is relieved matter what medication or nutrition he may be given he might not recover and certainly will not recover permanently this seems to indicate that there are other illnesses or reasons for illness besides being pts to be sure there are deficiencies and illnesses just as there are accidents and injuries but strangely enough the person himself precipitates them because being pts predisposes him to them in more garbled way the medicos and nutri tionists are always talking about stress causing illness lacking full tech they yet have an inkling that this is so because they see it is somehow true they cannot handle it yet theythe book of case remedies 27 recognize it and they state that it is senior situation to various illnesses and accidents well we have the tech of this in more ways than one what is this thing called stress it is more than the medico defines it he usually says it comes from operational or physical shock and in this he has too limited view person under stress is actually under suppression on one or more dynamicsif that suppression is located and the person handles or disconnects the condition di minishes if he also has all the engrams and arc breaks problems overts and withholds audited out triple flow and if all such areas of suppression are thus handled the person would recover from anything caused by stress usually the person has insufficient understanding of life or any dynamic to grasp his own situation he is confused he believes all his illnesses are true because they occur in such heavy books at some time he was predisposed to illness or accidents when serious suppression then occurred he suffered precipitation or occurrence of the accident or illness and then with repeated similar suppressions on the same chain the illness or tendency to accidents became prolonged or chronic to say then that person is pts to his current environment would be very limited as diagnosis if he continues to do or be something to which the suppressive person or group objected he may become or continue to be ill or have accidents actually the problem of pts is not very complicated once you have grasped the two data first given the rest of it becomes simply an analysis of how they apply to this particular person pts person can be markedly helped in three ways gaining an understanding of the tech of the condition b discovering to what or to whom he is pts c handling or discon necting someone with the wish or duty to find and handle ptss has an additional prior step he must know how to recognize pts and how to handle them when recognized thus it is rather waste of time to engage in this hunt unless one has been checked out on all the material on suppressives and ptss and grasps it without misunderstoods in other words the first step of the person is to get grasp of the subject and its tech this is not difficult to do it may be abit more difficult to learn to run an emeter and considerably more difficult to learn how to list for items but there again this is possible and is much easier than trying to grope around guessing with this step done person has real trouble recognizing pts people and can have success in handling them which is very gratifying and rewarding let us consider the easiest level of approach i give the person the simpler hco bs on the subject and let him study them so that he knows the elements like pts and suppressive he may just cognite right there and be much better it has happened ii have him discuss the illness or accident or condition without much prodding or probing that he thinks now may be the result of suppression he will usually tell you it is right here and now or was short time ago and will be all set to exthe book of case remedies 28 plain it without any relief as stemming from his current environment or re cent one if you let it go at that he would simply be bit unhappy and not get well as he is discussing usually late lock that has lot of earlier material below it iii ask when he recalls first having that illness or having such accidents he will at once begin to roll this back and realize that it has happened before you dont have to be auditing him as he is all too willing to talk about this in most in formal manner he will get back to some early thislifetime point usually vi now ask him who it was he will usually tell you promptly and as you are not really auditing him and he isnt going backtrack and you are not trying to domore than key him out you dont probe any further v you will usually find that he has named person to whom he is still connected so you ask him whether he wants to handle or disconnect now as the sparks will really fly in his life if he dramatically disconnects and if he cant see how he can you persuade him to begin to handle on gradient scale this may sist of imposing some slight discipline on him such as requiring him to actually answer his mail or write the person pleasant good roads good weather note or to realistically look at how he estranged them in short what is required in the handling is low gradient all you are trying to do is move the pts per from effect over to slight gentle cause vi check with the person again if he is handling and coach him along always at gentle good roads and good weather level and h and r human emotion and reaction if you please that is simple handling you can get complexities such as person being pts to an unknown person in his immediate vicinity that he may have to find before he can handle or disconnect you can find people who cant remember more than few years back you can find anything you can find in case but simple handling ends when it looks pretty complex and thats when you call in the auditor but this simple handling will get you quite few stars in your crown you will be amazed to find that while some of them dont instantly recover medication vitamins minerals will now work when before they wouldnt you may also get some instant recovers but realize that if they dont you have not failed the auditor can do 3 sds after this with much more effect as he isnt working with completely uninformed person 3 sds only fail because of wrong items or because the auditor did not then put in triple rudiments on the items and then audit them out as engrams triple flow being is rather complex he may have lot of sources of suppression and it may take lot of very light auditing to get him up to where he can do work on suppressives since these were after all the source of his overwhelm and what he did to them might be more important than what they did to him but unless you unburden him he may not get around to realizing thatthe book of case remedies 29 you can run into person who can only be handled by expanded dianetics but you have made an entrance and you have stirred things up and gotten him more aware and just that way you will find he is more at cause his illness or proneness to accidents may not be slight you may succeed only to the point where he now has chance by nutrition vitamins minerals medication treatment and above all auditing of getting well unless you jogged this condition he had chance at all for becoming pts is the first thing that happened to him on the subject of illness or accidents further if the person has had lot of auditing and yet isnt progressing too well your simple handling may all of sudden cause him to line up his case so do not underestimate what you or an auditor can do for pts and dont sell pts tech short or neglect it and dont continue to transfer or push off or even worse tolerate pts conditions in people you can do something about itand so can they l ron hubbard founder lrhntrdthe book of case remedies 30 chapter 6 table of remedies remedy applies to any course student including

the following process what word assessed have you been paid for tense can also be changed to are you being or will you be connected to word assessedthe book of case remedies 42 chapter 8 technical notes note 1 the difference between arc break assessments and by passed charge auditing you do not audit an arc break assessment auditing consists of asking or commanding and acknowledging you dont ask anything or give com mand and then acknowledge while giving an arc break assessment you just do it and indi cate to the pc what reads on the needle you do this until the pc is cheerful again there are several lists only one l1 applies to session the others apply to levels and types of processes only skilled meter operator should do arc break assessments an unskilled one makes only more arc breaks by flubs if an auditor who cant do an arc break assessment has pc arc break that audi tor should find an auditor who can do an assessment and get it done on the pc before pro ceeding with auditing bypassed charge assessment unfortunately also has assessment as part of its name and can be confused with an arc break assessment but bypassed charge assessment is actual auditing level iii here one cleans each smallest read off question but not cleaning cleans before going on to the next question handling originations by the pc and acknowledg ing one never does this with an arc broken pc with an arc break one just ploughs on looking for big read and indicates it to pc note 2 the double arc break if at any time during the handling of pc who is blowy or has blown the pc again arc breaks while doing the arc break assessment locate the charge that has just been bypassed and then b resume handling the charge that wasbeing looked for when the new arc break occurred dont mistake mere criticism and natter which is usually present during an arc break assessment for new arc break note 3 all of the above apply to clay table and any other type of auditingnote 4 in the supervisor remedies i was greatly assisted by mary sue who has pervised more hgcs than any other auditor in the worldthe book of case remedies 43 chapter 9 envoy none of the remedies given above have failed when actually applied in any case which had the symptoms for which the process is recommended they have been used as the routine advice given to auditors for their preclears by my self they have been used in many more instances by mary sue during times she worked as case supervisor or director of processing in many organizations almost all of these processes are quite oldyou will note that these processes do not resolve the preclears main aberrations they only resolve the preclears complaints lack of wins and tendencies to blow while useful even in general processing few would be satisfactory diet for all ses sions always here we are only taking up the troublesome cases the cases that are made troublesome by lack of wins the case situations which absorb the bulk of supervisors time and sap his and the auditors morale i dont at the moment recall any cases or conditions of blow different from the ones given in the tables above and mary sue after some thought couldnt recall any others this does not mean there are others but they would be pretty unusual if there were use by supervisors the apparent exception to the table the case everybody says is different and nut cov ered falls under the australian heading because australians almost never do what theyre asked to do this exception would go somewhat like this d of p to staff auditor use remedy ag on your pc today later staff auditor to d of p that didnt work this routine could be followed by the d of p thinking golly thats different type of case not covered in the table and sitting up half the night working out new approach rather the d of p being wily and wise in the ways of auditors should have said to that didnt work d of p to staff auditor what didnt work and the staff auditor would then have said why getting the pc to think of horrible things to do to her husband which isnt if you care to look remedy ag for being wily and wise myself in these matters i always ask what didnt work and if the answer was what id said in the first place id have then asked the pc what was run and would have found something else had been used by being sure the direction was followed and was done i then have found what did and didnt work and so you have tablethe book of case remedies 44 and in using it to supervise be sure that 1 the condition the pc is manifesting is the one reported 2 the right manifestation is located in the table and 3 the instruction is properly and completely executed only if you do these things can you supervise the auditing of pcs successfully the case supervisor or d of p who doesnt take the three steps above remorselessly will have pcs blow or will have that more gentle blow they just dont keep on with auditing but let us end on happier noteyou have here the secrets of fourteen years of experience with patching up cases and keeping them going im glad i thought of putting it together for youand you are welcome to all the success it bringsgood auditingthe book of case remedies 45 index
