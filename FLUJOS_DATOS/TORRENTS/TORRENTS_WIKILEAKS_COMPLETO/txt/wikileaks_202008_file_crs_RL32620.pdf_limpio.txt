health coverage tax credit hctc federal income tax credit to cover 65 of the cost of qualified health insurance for eligible taxpayers and their family members the credit is refundable so taxpayers may claim the full credit amount even if they have little or federal income tax liability the credit can also be advanced so taxpayers need not wait until they file their tax returns in order to benefit from it eligibility for the hctc is limited to three groups of taxpayers two of those groups consist of individuals who are eligible for allowances financial assistance through the trade adjustment assistance taa program because such individuals have lost manufacturing jobs due to increased foreign imports or shifts in production outside the united states the third eligibility group consists of individuals whose defined benefit pension plans were taken over by the pension benefit guaranty corporation because of financial difficulties eligible individuals cannot be enrolled in certain other health insurance eg medicaid or entitled to other specified coverage eg medicare part the hctc can be claimed for only 10 types of qualified health insurance specified in the statute 7 of which require state action to become effective for tax year 2007 43 states and the district of columbia made at least one of these seven types of statequalified health plans available in the remaining eight states only the three types of qualified health insurance not dependent on state action automatically qualified health plans were available though not necessarily all who were eligible for the credit could avail themselves of these options the hctc is not used widely in 2005 nearly 28000 persons claimed the tax credit out of 350000 potentially eligible individuals possible reasons explaining the relatively low participation rate include barriers to finding qualified insurance and difficulties paying the part of the premium not covered by the tax credit the remaining 35 the 110

credithealth coverage tax credit hctcfor certain workers displaced by international trade and retirees whose private pension plans were taken over by the pension benefit guaranty corporation this report outlines the rules regarding eligibility for the hctc and the types of insurance that may be provided in addition it discusses both federal and state implementation of the credit the report then explores the effectiveness of the credit in reaching targeted populations and discusses related equity and efficiency issues it concludes with brief discussion of recent legislative proposals regarding the hctc 1 g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 the health coverage tax credit2 covers 65 of the premium for qualified health insurance purchased by an eligible taxpayer the taxpayer is responsible for covering the remaining 35 of the premium the hctc is refundable so taxpayers may claim the full credit even if they have little or federal income tax liability the credit

out of 350000 potentially eligible individuals 3 potentially eligible individuals are persons who receive assistance through specific programs that make them potentially eligible for the health coverage tax credit provided they meet other eligibility criteria so while person may be potentially eligible for the hctc it does not necessarily mean that person is in fact eligible possible reasons

to policy makers searchin g for ways to help people acquire and maintain health insurance coverage debates both before and after enactment of the program reflect broader discussion over the use of tax incentives to finance health coverage in contrast to expanding public programs eg medicaid or implementing market reforms the 110 th congress is likely to consider legislation affecting the hctc

employees and their families under specified circumstances such as termination reduction in work hours death divorce or legal separation and other circumstances for limited time employers may charge the beneficiary up to 100 of the premium counting both the employer and employee share plus 2 to cover administrative expenses individuals generally have 60 days from formal notification by the

under another health plan prior to applying for statequalified plan the requirement that creditable coverage immediately precede the application appears in the irs guidance it is not explicit in the

twothirds29 g13g151g152g160g149g142g141g144g142g561g152g143g561g10g5g22g5g561g139g142g151g142g143g146g157g561 one possible reason for the low use of the tax credit among eligible persons is that many workers may be unaware of this benefit in the first place according to one government accountability office gao study at most of the work sites they surveyed more than half of the workers who visited onestop career centers were not aware of this benefit this is despite efforts by federal and state programs local officials unions and others to inform workers of this tax credit program some workers indicated that they would have applied for the tax credit had they known about it 30

made at least one of the statequalified plan types available most states provided multiple plan options these states include the vast majority of hctc eligible individuals in addition eligibles may be able to access one of the three automatically qualified plan options as practical matter however some hctc eligibles continue to face difficulty in finding qualified plan for example the cobra continuation coverage op tion letter in the list under qualified health insurance is available only if the former employer had at least 20 workers and continues to offer health benefits to its remaining workers one study citing federal officials noted that roughly 40 to 60 of hctc eligibles have access to cobra coverage which means cobra is not available to the remaining hctc eligibles 31 moreover those with access must be able to pay the full premium cost plus 2 administrative fee see the discussion in the affordability section below the spousal coverage and individu health insurance options letters i and j have requirements that rule out most eligiblesfor the former one must be married to someone with coverage not largely paid for by their employer for the latter one must have had individual insurance before termination of employment as discussed above majority of states offer at least one statequalified plan option however eight states do not eligibles in those eight states must be eligible for the automatically qualified plans discussed above or they will have qualified plan options available to them 28 data provided to crs by the irs 29 see irs testimony 30 us

the consumer protection requirements guaranteed issue coverage denial based on preexisting conditions and substantially the same premiums and benefits for eligibles and noneligibles reduce the availability and increase the cost of such plans these requirements impose stricter standards on health plans than other federal and most state laws32 as result when the trade act was enacted many health plans sponsored or arranged by states did not meet the consumer protection requirements specified in the statute in order to qualify plan for the hctc states have had either to modify existing plans or to establish new ones sometimes this could be done by administrative action but often it required state legislation for some states approving new plans has been difficult because of budget crises even if approval is achieved budget constraints limit the amount of financial risk states are willing to take patient advocates and others contend that consumer protections in general make access to insurance more equitable and should apply to everyone regardless of insurance status or medical need 33 although such observers acknowledge th consumer protections under the hctc program some argue that those requirements are not comprehensive enough they argue that without broad requirements health plans may still charge high premium to persons with greater health care needs particularly older workers and early retirees making it difficult for them to find affordable coverage 34 g5g152g150g153g149g142g161g146g157g162g561 in addition to finding an available health plan th at qualifies for the hctc eligibles must navigate complicated enrollment system in order to receive the tax credit workers must apply to between two and five public and private entities and frequently must deliver to one or more of these entities hardcopy documents issued by the others 35 this burden was highlighted in responses to dol survey asking state officials for their views on the primary reason for low participation complexity was second only to affordability as the factor mentioned the most36 32 for example the health insurance portability and ccountability act hipaa pl 104191 generally prohibits health plans from imposing preexisting condition exclusions for individuals who previously had 12 months of continuous creditable coverage for the hctc the time period is reduced to three months 33 for example see the national alliance on mental illness public policy platform november 2006 at httpwwwnamiorg and families usa study on consumer protections in state managed care

qualified insurance is available and person has access to the tax credit 35 of the premium is not covered this contribution level may be unaffordable especially considering most hctc eligibles are longer working in the dol survey mentioned above 80 of state officials surveyed mentioned affordability as the primary factor for low use of the tax credit other costs may also be important some people might not apply for coverage since applicants must pay 100 of the premium pending completion of the enrollment process unless that person receives subsidies through the gap filler grant program some might calculate that the copayments deductibles and other costsharing requirements would require sizable out of pocket expenditures

may include the following delays in identifying dislocated workers receiving unemployment benefits who have not yet applied for taa benefits delays in certifying that dislocated workers are eligible for taa assistance loss of eligibility by younger spouse of affected worker when that worker becomes eligible for medicare decisions by some people that health insurance is relatively unimportant even if affordable g7g154g158g146g157g162g561 tax credits often are seen as way to improve tax equity since the savings they yield are not based on taxpayers marginal tax rates in contrast tax savings from deduction or the widely used exclusion for employerprovided insurance vary with marginal rates so taxpayers in higher income brackets receive greater tax savings than those in lowerincome brackets in addition the health coverage tax credits are refundable so lowincome taxpayers can receive the full value of the credit even if they have little or tax liability the 65 hctc rate is available to all eligible taxpayers with qualified insurance regardless of income from the standpoint of inclusiveness this seems equitable considering ability to pay however the one rate is inequitable the 65 rate provides the same dollar subsidy to taxpayers with high incomes and taxpayers with low incomes even though the former can more readily pay for their insurance for example in the case of 3000 selfonly policy the hctc would provide 1950 in tax savings to taxpayers with incomes of 80000 as well as those with incomes of 20000 proposals for more generallyavailable tax credit reflect these different perspectives some would have one rate for all taxpayers while others would phase out the rate for higher income taxpayers another equity issue relates to who is eligible for the tax credit unemployed workers who do not receive taa allowances may question why they are denied the credit particularly if they too have lost their jobs because of competition from foreign firms similarly early retirees

program is run given the complexity involved in enrollment in the program and administration of the tax credits themselves it is not surprising that operational costs would constitute significant portion of overall program costs especially during the startup phase however administrative costs remain high even after few years of operation one study estimated that of the federal funding going towards advance payments in 2007 full third will be spent on administration 37 this leaves only 66 cents for every federal dollar spent on the advance payment component for purchasing health coverage
