tr ust fund investment pr actices and briefly describes the issues involved in changing how the trust funds are invested this report will be updated periodically background social security is financed primarily by payroll and selfemployment taxes as well as by portion of the proceeds from the income taxation of social security benefits the revenues are deposited in the us treasury social security benefits and administrative expenses also are paid from the us treasur by law if social securitys income exceeds its outgo the surplus is credited to the social security trust funds in the form of us government securities the money itself however is used to pay for whatever other expenses the government may have at the time there is parate pool of money set aside for social security purposes that is not to say that the tr ust funds are ephemeral as long as the trust funds show positiv balance they represent authority and an obligation for the us treasury to issue benefit checks in those periods when the programs outgo exceeds its income at th end of calendar year 2007 the trust funds were credited with holdings of 22 trillion1 by the end of calendar year 2012 trust fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20607crs2 2 projected trust fund assets are shown in the 2008 annual report of the b oard of trustees of the federal oldage and survivors insurance and disability

act the attorney general has ruled that certain federally sponsored agency obligati ons may be purchased by the trust funds such securities include those issued by the federal national mortgage association fannie mae the government national mortgage association ginnie mae and other federal credit entities currently the trust funds do not hold such securities 4 the di trust fund held small amount of public issues until february 15 2005 at the end of calendar year 2004 public issues represented 0002 of total investments held by the trust funds data on investments held by the trust funds are available on the ssa website at httpwwwssagovoactprogdatainvestheldhtmlassets are projected to reach 30 trillion in constant 2008 dollars2 section 201 of the social security act provides the following guidelines for trust fund investment 1 funds not immediately in demand for bene fits or administrative expenses are to be invested in interestbearing obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the united states3 2 obligations are to be purchased at issue at the issue price or at the market price for outstanding obligations 3 the managing trustee of the social s ecurity trust funds the secretary of the treasury is required to invest in sp ecial nonmarketable federal publicdebt obligations special issues to the trus t funds that are not available to the general public except where he or she determines that the purchase of marketable federal securities is in the public interest 4 special issues shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the trust funds and will pay rate of interest calculated at the time of issue equal to the average market yield on all marketable interestbearing obligations of the united states that are not due or callable redeemable for at least four years 5 marketable federal secur ities purchased by the trust funds may be sold at the market price and special issue obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest without penalty for redemption before maturity the treasury department has determined that the purchase of marketable federal securities ie public issues would be in th public interest only when it might serve to stabilize the market for treasury issues because an unstable market would be characterized by falling bond pri ces purchases of marketable federal securities at these times would appear to be adva ntageous for the trust funds in practice however open market purchases have been rare although th trust funds have held public issues in the past the trust funds currently hold special issues only4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20607crs3 5 data on trust fund receipts including net interest are available on the ssa website at httpwwwssagovoactstatstable4a3htmlincome

see crs report rl33544 social security reform current issues and legislation by dawn nuschlerthe interest earned on these holdings is cr edited to the trust funds semiannually on june 30 and december 31 and it is done by i ssuing additional federa l securities to the trust funds in calendar year 2007 net interest totaled 1102 billion5 the effective annual rate of interest earned on all obligations in the trust funds in calendar year 2007 was 536 the interest rate earned on special issues purchased by the trust funds in december 2007 was 407 the maturity dates of newlyissued special issues are set by standardized procedure revenues are invested immediately in shortterm issues called certificates of indebtedness which mature on june 30 of each year on june 30 certificates of indebtedness that have not been redeemed are reinvested into longerterm special issue bonds the maturities of these bonds range fro m 1 to 15 years the goal is to have about onefifteenth of them mature each year this means that the average maturity of these longterm bonds is about 7½ years issues although critics have questioned whethe r the current investment policy has constrained the earnings of the trust funds over the years various advisory councils congressional committees and other groups ge nerally have endorse d it it has been justified as ensuring the most safety of principal and stability of interest and as way of avoiding intrusion into private markets it also has been regarded as way to avoid the political influences that would be inherent in investing outside the us government generally the goal espoused has been to place the trust funds in the same position as any longterm investor seeking safe rate of return by investing in us securities and neither advantage nor disadvantage the tr ust funds relative to these inve stors or other parts of the government although interest income was not major factor in the financing of the social security program for most of its history over the past decade or so growing trust fund surpluses and the increasing role of intere st credited to the trust funds as well as interest by some policymakers in preventin g the annual social security surpluses from being used for other government spending purposes have focused attention on the question of alternative investment policies8 in the past several congresses for example bills have been introduced that call for replaci ng the special issues held by the trust funds with marketable federal secur ities such as hr 219 in the 110th congress there also have been calls for investing portion of the trust funds in investment vehicles other than obligations of the us government such as hr 581 in the 110th congress
