conducting onsite inspections under the comprehensive nucleartestban treaty summary united statesrussian federation comprehensive nucleartestban treaty onsite inspection joint tabletop exercise took place in snezhinsk russia from 19 to 24 october 1998 under the auspices of the bilateral ctbt joint working group three the objectives of the exercise were to examine the functioning of an inspection team it in given scenario to evaluate the strategies and techniques employed by the it to identify ambiguous interpretations of treaty provisions that needed clarification and to assess the overall utility of tabletop exercises to assist in developing an effective comprehensive nucleartestban treaty ctbt verification regime to achieve these objectives the united states and russian federation rf agreed that two scenarios would be conducted the first would be developed by the rf who would act as controller and as the inspected state party isp while the united states would play the role of the it the roles would be reversed in the second scenario the united states would develop the scenario and play the isp and act as the game controller while the rf would play the it joint exercise planning team comprised of members of both the us and russian teams agreed on ground rules for the two scenarios and established joint evaluation team to evaluate the entire exercise to meet the limitations of the time available for the exercise the scope needed to be limited the joint exercise planning team decided that each of the two scenarios would not go beyond the first 25 days of an onsite inspection osi and that the focus would be on examining the decisionmaking of the it as it utilized the various activities and technologies to clarify whether nuclear test explosion had taken place hence issues such as logistics restricted access and activities prior to point of entry poe would be played only to the extent needed to provide for reasonably realistic context for the exercise to focus on inspection procedures sensor deployments and data interpretationctbtwgb14ruus1 page 2 each scenario began at the poe and proceeded with several iterations of negotiations between the it and isp instrument deployments and data evaluation by the it by the end of each scenario each it had located the site of an underground nuclear explosion une while this validated the methods employed by each it the evaluation team noted that each it employed different search strategies and that each strategy had both advantages and disadvantages the scenarios highlighted ambiguities in interpretation of treaty provisions related to overflights in addition substantial number of lessons were learned relating to radionuclide monitoring the modeling of seismic background noise in tabletop exercises the problems associated with conveying visual information efficiently and effectively the impact of logistical constraints and the modeling of these constraints on successful osi execution these lessons are discussed more fully in the body of this report although the us and russian participants and the evaluation team agreed that the exercise had met its objectives there were variety of areas identified that could be improved in subsequent osi exercises some of these included reexamination of the methods used to convey visual observation data in an exercise the amount of time compression employed the increased application of logistical constraints on sensor deployment and other it movements and the need for better joint understanding and agreement pertaining to the structure format and other rules of the exercise more time spent on joint planning of the exercise is recommended this report summarizes the lessons learned pertaining to both the technical and operational aspects of an osi as well as to those pertaining to the planning and execution of an osi exercise it concludes with comments from the evaluation team and proposed next steps for future

introduction 11 exercise objectives united statesrussian federation comprehensive nucleartestban treaty onsite inspection joint tabletop exercise took place in snezhinsk russia from 19 to 24 october 1998 under the auspices of the bilateral ctbt joint working group three the objectives of the exercise were the following to simulate the actions of an osi inspection team it including interactions with the inspected state party isp in order to examine different approaches to inspections and to develop appropriate recommendations for the international community to identify ambiguities and contradictions in the interpretation of treaty and protocol provisions that might arise and become apparent in the course of an inspection and that need clarification in connection with the development of the osi operational manual and onsite inspection osi infrastructure to evaluate the efficacy of using tabletop exercises to assist in developing an effective comprehensive nuclear testban treaty ctbt verification regime to identify strong and weak points in the preparation and implementation methods of such exercises for the purpose of further improving possible future exercises 12 exercise implementation to achieve these objectives the united states us and the russian federation rf agreed that rather than conducting one exercise with mixed teams which would require great deal of time to organize and plan two scenarios would be conducted the first would be developed by the rf who would act as controller and the isp while the us would play the role of the it the roles would be reversed in the second scenario for which the us would develop and play the isp while the rf would play the it separate us and russian control teams developed each osi scenario and planned and developed the exercise separate us and russian data teams developed data in advance of the exercises and generated the data during the actual exercises joint exercise planning team comprised of members of both the us and russian teams agreed on number of ground rules for the two scenarios and established joint evaluation team to assess both of the scenarios against the stated objectives this latter group was comprised of two people from the united states and two from the russian federation their task was to observe the functioning of all of the teams and their interactions and to lead the postexercise discussion commenting on the preparation and presentation of the data the strategies employed by the teams in their roles as it and isp and the utility of the exercise as whole the comments from the evaluation team can be found in subsequent portion of this report to effectively examine the issues stated in the objectives the scope of this joint exercise needed to be limited the joint exercise planning team decided that each of the two scenarios should focus on the first 25 days of an osi and that the emphasis should be on the decision making process of the it as it utilized the various inspection activities and technologies toctbtwgb14ruus1 page 4 clarify whether nuclear explosion had taken placeie where how and when the it deployed its permitted sensors and conducted overflight and groundbased visual observation how the it evaluated the data received from those inspection activities and how it then redeployed its inspection sensors and visual observation assets hence issues such as logistics restricted access and activities prior to point of entry poe were played only to the extent needed to provide for relatively realistic scenario and interaction among the teams in the discussions of the exercise given below the reader will note that many of the details of the respective us and russian scenarios have been omitted this has been done for two reasons firstly both the russian and us participants agree that wherever possible this report should not include information helpful to possible violator of the ctbt such as details of possible evasion strategies secondly some details of the scenarios used in this exercise may be used in the future for additional bilateral or multilateral exercises and thus are best not publicly revealed to this end the attempt in this report has been to convey only enough detail to support the discussion of lessons learned 2 scenario descriptions and summary of proceedings 21 russiandeveloped scenario state x party to the ctbt requests clarification of magnitude 40 event detected by the international data centre idc on 3 october 1998 occurring in state state x claims that the ratio of magnitudes of surfacetobody waves indicates high probability that this event is of an explosive nature and since the international monitoring system ims has never previously detected explosive activity at this level in this region of state state x is concerned about possible ctbt noncompliance state responds that there was indeed an explosion on the date specified by state x but that this was chemical explosion carried out at an opencast mine to test new cost effective methods of crushing rock further state claims that previous conventional explosions in this same quarry were detected by the ims as magnitude 25 and 30 events but these did not cause ctbt compliance concerns additionally state states that ims radionuclide stations detected any evidence of noncompliance state x is not satisfied by this explanation claiming that the data provided by state are inconsistent with those of chemical explosion and elaborating on state ys recent intensified efforts to develop its nuclear program for these reasons state x requests an on site inspection of state copy of this consultation and clarification package can be found in appendix i the play of this scenario in which the united states acted as the it and the rf acted as the isp began with the poe briefing which provided general information about the inspection area the base camp the aircraft available for the overflight and other logistical support information the us it began its inspection with an overflight of selected portions of the inspection area while setting up base camp the it also planned routes for ground based visual observations and deployed several seismic and radionuclidemonitoring sensors also in targeted search of selected portions of the inspection area ctbtwgb14ruus1 page 5 the us it initially concentrated on investigating the mines and the radiological waste storage site and interviewing the mine and waste site managers results of the visual observations at these areas were generally uninteresting except for the radiological waste storage site where cerium144 was also detected in radiological swipe sample initial seismic data results indicated 84 event detections on days three and four of the inspection of these only one event involved detection by more than one station when it became obvious that the seismic data included lot of local noise in the data such as heavy equipment or machinery operation which would be detected only by single station the us it began to look solely for multiplestation detections to get reliable events eventually the it detected quite few events consistently occurring near one particular portion of the inspection area and concentrated seismic stations there from plot of all the multiplestation events detected the us it was able to pinpoint hypocenter for the suspect event gas sampling was also done in this area and 37ar was detected in gas sample taken on day 15 22 usdeveloped scenario atlantia party to the ctbt requests clarification from pacifica regarding an ims detected event on 1 november 1998 the event 36 magnitude seismic event was detected at depth of less than 5 km and it occurred in an area of increased ambiguous activity which included tunneling pacifica responds that it was investigating the source of this event but believed it to have been caused by an unintentionally large chemical explosion at commercial surface coal mine located in the vicinity of the reported event pacifica further stated that personnel at the mine had planned ripplefire explosion in the course of routine mining activity but for unknown reasons inadvertently all explosives detonated simultaneously news reports of 41 earthquake in the vicinity of the reported event are also furnished by pacifica to provide another possible explanation for the idcreported event pacifica also draws attention to the fact that other component of the ims detected any evidence of noncompliance including two radionuclide stations and one infrasound station all within 500 km of the event atlantia is not satisfied with this explanation claiming that it is highly unusual that chemical explosion in surface mine could have caused magnitude 36 event such an explosion would require quantity of explosives far in excess of any known mining practices for the type of procedure claimed by pacifica also atlantia claims that if this event had been caused by such large chemical explosion the infrasound station in the area would have detected it for these reasons atlantia requests an onsite inspection of pacifica to clarify whether nuclear explosion had been carried out copy of this consultation and clarification package can be found in appendix ii when the it arrived at the poe they were briefed about the inspection area the base camp and the logistical support that they would be provided by the isp in their initial deployment the russian it deployed 30 seismic stations on days two and three of the inspection in fixed 4km grid concentrating on the large central alluvial valley in the inspection area the reason for this is that the aftershock rate decays most quickly in alluvium the russian it immediately detected aftershocks from the underground nuclear test but had difficulty interpreting the results because the coarse station coverage resulted in relatively poor event location determinations especially depth the russian it continued monitoring up to 21 days when they detected the presence of 37ar in gas sample taken from an area where the aftershocks were occurringctbtwgb14ruus1 page 6 3 osi technical and operational lessons learned each of the following sections provides summary of the lessons that were learned as result of the usrussian joint tabletop exercise as they relate to technical and operational osi issues overflight activities are presented first followed by groundbased visual observations passive seismological monitoring radionuclide monitoring and logistics issues the last section osi overall strategy lessons learned describes the strategies employed by the us and russian teams as they simulated inspectors and members of the isp 31 overflight activities the usrussian joint tabletop exercise raised variety of issues regarding the intent utility and proper conduct of an overflight these issues discussed below specifically pertain to flight platforms flight speed extent of initial search use of realtime dosimeters in flight effects of varying terrain and duration of flights while the opinions of the observers and evaluators regarding the utility of the overflight varied greatly it was clear that in both the russian and us scenarios the overflight fulfilled key missionto narrow the inspection area flight platform this set of scenarios demonstrated the benefit of using helicopter rather than fixedwing aircraft for ctbt onsite inspections even in fullgrid search as employed by the russian it the helicopter had sufficient speed to examine the entire 1000 km2 area and still allow for followon overflights within the 12hour limit additionally the helicopter could hover permitting closein examination of areas either before ground team arrived at location or supplementing the groundbased visual observation when an area was not easily accessible by ground transportation duration of flights the duration of the overflights became an issue early in the tabletop exercise the treaty language is somewhat obscure on the issue of breaking the overflights into segments using information from ground inspections to focus future overflight on areas of interest one evaluation team member remarked that nation would permit the frequent use of brief overflights for many days or weeks as the us it attempted to exercise the intention of the treaty writers according to another evaluation team member was to complete the overflight early in the inspection thus while an it might divide the allotted 12 hours into several flight segments the it should not depend upon access to the aircraft beyond the first twotothree days unless weather conditions safety issues or equipment availability interfere with the possibility of an early overflight extent of initial search differences between us and russian it overflight strategies were most clearly defined in the use of broad area searches by the russians as compared to the searches initiated by the us that focused on unusual aspects of the maps and data supplied by the isp in both scenarios the main purposes of the aerial search were to become more familiar with the area terrain road access and condition and ground transportation possibilities and to locate areas where conduct of an underground nuclear explosion une could be ruled out this strategy was intended to eliminate large part of the map area for immediate consideration ie narrowing the search area the us it focused upon specific areas of interest including places where there were unclear symbols on the map and preidentified cultural features trusting that they had fairly complete maps whereas thectbtwgb14ruus1 page 7 russian it assumed that the maps were not complete and that some cultural features might be missing each approach has its merits and the scenarios did not indicate clear superiority for either approach it was noted that commercial satellite images not used in this exercise will most likely be available to real it that would show extensive road patterns and the larger facilities however overflight observations may still be crucial for finding disturbances that appear to be inconsistent with the surroundings and thus may be indicators of unusual activities use of realtime dosimeters in flight if use of wide spectrum gamma counter were permitted in the overflight this could make broad search quite useful in attempting to identify radioactive sources over the inspection area it was clear that both its in this exercise wished to use some sort of geiger counter or lowresolution sodium iodide naitl detector in the initial overflight even pocketsize ratemeters or chirpers were considered for this purpose effect of varying terrain and weather the terrain vegetation and time of year of an osi will have substantial impact upon the information that may be gathered during visual observations both from the air and on the ground the temperate wetlands used in the russian scenario of this exercise could be muddy and difficult to maneuver in and thick pine and birch forests could make many small roads difficult to see unless one is directly above them similarly intense heat of summer conditions or snow at higher elevations in the desert environment used in the us scenario could have significant impact on it activities and effectiveness equipment and personnel on overflight of the permitted equipment the still cameras and global positioning system locators appear to be the most important simulating the use of binocular views in the exercise was difficult but binoculars would also prove quite valuable during an overflight perhaps more so from fixedwing aircraft than from vibrating helicopter use of video equipment raised problem generated from having the isp provide the photographers if only one photographer is provided then the it could not record from two cameras at once or from still camera and video camera the it will clearly need to negotiate this issue with the isp whether there are two isp photographers or one isp and one it photographer more than one photographer riding along on the overflight would optimize the utility of photography during the overflight flight speed aircraft speed became an issue during this tabletop exercise the russian side requested that speed not exceed 200 kmhr 160 knots air speed from an optics perspective this is reasonable because observations on the ground blur for closein viewing as speed grows both eyeball observation and photographs lose resolution with increased speed speeds greater than approximately 150 knots force the use of unacceptably high shutter speeds with reduced alongtrack image resolution thus helicopters or slow speed highlift fixed wing aircraft will be the aircraft of choice in an osi data synthesis there were significant difficulties in efficiently and effectively presenting groundbased visual observation and overflight data such data are voluminous and complex and require great deal of concentration by the it and extensive preparation by the data teams while some aspects of the presentation of visual observation data in the exercise could be streamlined this difficulty is not unique to the exercise but represents an accurate simulation of the difficulty in presenting such data to the it during real field osi each dayctbtwgb14ruus1 page 8 teams of 10 to 20 people will return to base camp reporting their observations to the other members of the it how will they perform this task in real osi so that everyone is aware of the observations of other team members it will be challenging task to integrate this information as was demonstrated in the exercise the technical training of the inspectors and their ability to focus on the unusual aspects of their observations will be key in the success of an inspection additionally it will be difficult to explain via photographs alone the distinguishing features that were seen either from the air or on the ground the eyebrain combination is far better tool than twodimensional photo consequently rather than suggesting that the presentation of visual data should be improved for the exercises method ought to be developed instead to aid in synthesizing visual observation data with other forms of data collected during an osi 32 groundbased visual observations documentation of visual observations while there were many lessons learned in the usrussian joint tabletop exercise one of the most pronounced was that an it member will be mentally processing much more data directly observed than can effectively be conveyed during simulation exercise either verbally or with photos that are of course taken out of context this emphasizes the subjective nature of visual observations and the necessity for inspectors to be well trained in the art of perception interpretation and communication visual observations will have to be particularly well documented to substantiate and integrate with the other osi data visual observation expertise on its as with other specialized areas of expertise relevant to osis eg field seismology analysis of visual data in the context of an osi requires high level of skill and experience for this exercise both inspection teams included true experts capable of recognizing nuclear explosionrelated visual clues for real osi this high level of expertise may not be available since not all potential inspectors will have experience with nuclear testing and may have less refined technical skills proper combination of expertise in radiology seismology geology mining practice nuclear testing ground and airborne visual logistics as well as the ctbt protocol is essential to conduct thorough inspection interviews during the course of an inspection an it may wish to interview people in and around the inspection area and have informal interactions with isp representatives as was demonstrated in both scenarios while formal interviews may be very important they may involve highlevel isp representatives who may not be knowledgeable enough to provide the details sought thus the informal interactions that take place between the inspectors conducting visual observation and their isp escorts may provide the best information but because interviewees are not always well versed in either treaty provisions or specific sensitivities at their site they may inadvertently provide sensitive information that is unrelated to the purpose of the inspection it is important therefore to strike proper balance in granting inspectors the privilege of interviewing personnel in and around an inspection site while protecting sensitive information ctbtwgb14ruus1 page 9 33 passive seismological monitoring the objective of passive seismic monitoring during an osi is to detect smallmagnitude aftershocks from possible underground nuclear explosion before their rate and magnitude decay to levels too small to detect seismic sensors need to be placed within few kilometres from the source for adequate detection and identification of aftershocks thus the task of the it is to seismically monitor as much of the inspection area as possible in the shortest amount of time this process can be greatly impeded by weather and terrain in addition other seismic sources such as local natural seismicity and mining activities have to be located and identified russian it search strategy in this exercise the russian it approach was to maximize the initial use of sensors toward this end they immediately employed all of the 30 seismic sensors available in 4km grid starting with the alluvial valley in the central part of the inspection area the reasoning behind this approach is based on experience which suggests that aftershock rates decline most rapidly when test is conducted in alluvium every two to three days the russian it would relocate about onethird of the instruments to continue the systematic coverage of the grid with the goal of covering the entire 1000 km2 inspection area this grid deployment was generally not strongly affected by the type of terrain desert mostly open country with good offroad general access in the us scenario the grid approach proved to be extremely effective because the russian it very quickly began detecting aftershocks from the une postulated for this scenario once set of events had been detected by the russian it in this case from mining activities and from the une they allocated one additional seismic instrument from the predesigned grid pattern to double the coverage of events coming from the mining area and continued using the remaining instruments to further extend the grid coverage this single instrument did not sufficiently supplement the detection capability to allow the team to obtain the precise locations especially depth needed to fully discriminate between seismic events related to active mining and aftershocks from une the fact that this additional station did not significantly improve event depth determination was due to feature of the algorithm used by the us data team for event location that was inadvertently not revealed to the russian team the algorithm required that 3 stations detect an event before depth estimate was revealed otherwise the depth was given as zero thus in this case an issue of ground rules had an important impact on search strategy by continuing the grid search the russian it eventually found aftershocks from the earthquake that had occurred in another part of the inspection area this brings up an important question when suspicious phenomenon is found should the it stop the search or continue to explore the whole area united states it search strategy the approach of the us it in the russian scenario was quite different from that of the russian it based on an initial assessment of the inspection area map target areas of interest were identified and prioritized for sensor deployment the initial deployment involved placing two to three sensors at each of five different sites of interest none of which as was later discovered included the actual location of the une not all of the sensors available were initially deployed this approach was partly dictated by the nature of the terrain dense forest few access roads little outcropping rock and many swampy areas after the initial deployment the us it realized that most of the data being received was local noise but there were some events in the central part of the inspection area that looked suspicious additional sensors were then deployed in that area to obtain better characterization eventually sensors from other areas were redeployed untilctbtwgb14ruus1 page 10 about 15 sensors were in place covering about 5 to 10 km2 area this allowed the us it to obtain better understanding of the distribution of aftershocks and eventually to identify the hypocenter of the une within 400 m unforeseen differences in the way the russian and us data teams simulated the seismic data required the us to adapt its deployment strategy the us team initially expected that very local noise events at site would be discriminated and not appear as events to station but the russian control and data teams assumed that discrimination was not possible and included them as events this necessitated deploying additional instruments around potential target and required that detections and locations be based on two or more stations this eliminated the value of any singlestation locations this type of ambiguous data situation is realistic and requires rapid evaluation in the field by the seismologist and immediate changes to the deployment strategy comments on search strategy the us it could have been more aggressive about the initial deployment of seismometers instead of waiting to obtain more information from the overflight or from visits to other sites it would have been more advantageous to deploy as many sensors as quickly as possible because of the nature of the terrain in the russian scenario however gridbased approach would have been difficult to carry out the importance of adapting the deployment strategy as information is gathered was aptly demonstrated by the us and russian it experiences while gridbased search can be very effective given certain terrain conditions an it should also be very flexible in adapting to information as it is collected once set of events is identified sensors should immediately be deployed or redeployed to obtain better characterization of those events effect of terrain and weather on sensor deployment finally the exercise helped to focus attention on the fact that the time needed for deployment of seismic sensors will be strongly dependent on the local terrain and weather conditions and it is important to take this time into account in tabletop exercises in this exercise both its were operating under almost ideal conditions as agreed by both sides since play of logistics was not to be major issue for investigation the logistics of installing seismic stations and the base station for telemetry and processing will in practice have very strong effect on the overall deployment strategy the question of the amount of time needed to deploy instruments set up the overall telemetry and data collection system and integrate operations needs further investigation bolstered by data from real field experience computerized system is required to realistically model the time aspects of the deployment of both seismic and radionuclide sensors 34 radionuclide detection and analysis the purpose of the radionuclide collection and analysis portion of the usrussian joint tabletop exercise was to search for the presence of fresh manmade radioactivity interpret the source of this activity and if possible date the origin of the activity together with visual and seismic information gathered in the inspection area the radionuclide measurements were used to determine the likelihood of possible nuclear test conducted by the isp there were five kinds of samples to be analyzed soil water swipes subsurface gas and atmospheric air for the signature radionuclides listed in table 1ctbtwgb14ruus1 page 11 table 1 signature radionuclides permitted to be reported in this osi tabletop exercise particulate isotope halflife noble gas isotope halflife 95zr 640 d 131m xe 1184 d 95nb 350 d 133m xe 219 d 140ba140la 1275 d 1678 d 133g xe 5243 d 141ce 325 d 135xe 914 h 144ce 2849 d 37ar 350 d 147nd 1098 d the principal analytical tool for simulated radionuclide analysis for this exercise was gammaray analysis from both highpurity germanium hpge and naitl detectors the sodium iodide naitl detector was used on both overflight and groundbased surveys in the grossactivity mode with spectral information being used to identify radionuclides from their gammaray signature the particulate isotopes could be observed in soils water swipes and in atmospheric samples acquired by pumping air through paper filter that was subsequently analyzed with an hpge detector in the case of the noble gases the samples were acquired in either of two ways as subsurface samples gathered by pumping on perforated metal stakes that had been pounded number of metres into the ground or as atmospheric samples collected by pumping air through cold traps and activated charcoal traps in the latter case the xe noblegas isotopes were physically separated from their elemental homologues and counted automatically using betagamma coincidence techniques in simulated unit built especially for the purpose the 37ar samples had to be counted separately in an internal proportional counter due to the low energy of 37ar decay emissions in this exercise the collection and analysis of these samples was notional ie the processes were merely assumed to have taken place but did not actually occur the logistical aspect of the exercise was for the most part ignored though some attempt was made to limit the number of samples that could be processed in any given inspection period to simulate what would be reasonably achieved with the equipment and personnel assumed to be available alternative methods of sample analysis the russian it introduced mobile laboratory for the purpose of collecting and preparing samples for counting as the laboratory was being moved from the field to the base camp this would reduce the average amount of time required for analysis of each sample the us control team allowed the use of this vehicle even though it had not appeared on the list of approved equipment it was felt that while this innovative laboratory could be effective in relatively flat terrain where its travel would be relatively unimpeded its mobility would be limited in rough and rugged terrain such as that found in parts of the inspection area of the us scenario the exclusive use of mobile laboratory might limit sample collection if sampling locations are far from one another but could increase the expected analysis throughput since sample preparation can begin as soon as the sample is in the mobile laboratoryctbtwgb14ruus1 page 12 use of isotope ratios in the development of their scenario the russian exercise planning team chose not to employ more complex radionuclide signatures such as isotope ratios like 133m xe133g xe capable of identifying and dating source terms of the measured activity the russian federation and the united states consider the identification of these source terms and their interpretation critical to the osi mission and therefore they should be exercised as fully as possible the us scenario provided for the measurement and reporting of isotope ratios including xe ratios and particulate radionuclide ratios from diversionary source nuclear reactor just outside of the inspection area boundary however the russian it chose not to investigate this diversionary source relying on seismic information to lead them to the critical location they subsequently obtained subsurface gas samples and identified the location of the une from the presence of 37ar in these samples isotope ratios although measured were not utilized in the interpretation of this scenario constraints on sample analysis certain radionuclide measurement characteristics how long one must count to achieve certain limits for example need to be examined in order to better understand the limits on sample preparation and counting an effective result of gammaray hpge analysis of soil or water sample is either the actual activity of given signature radionuclide for example 64d 95zr or an upper limit of the activity of this nuclide if it cannot be definitely shown to be present sometimes reported as the minimum detectable concentration or mdc there is tradeoff between the length of the counting interval and the precision or mdc and the number of samples that can be counted this choice needs to be examined more closely both to understand the constraints in real osi as well as to simulate more realistically these situations in an exercise noble gas systems the current capability for collecting purifying and counting noble gas samples is largely unknown at this time it is necessary to understand the kind of equipment that is commercially available or in need of development for noble gas sample treatment such equipment should be smaller and more portable than the pacific northwest national laboratory united states department of energy xe automated radioxenon sampleranalyzer arsa system proposed for use by the ctbt ims which was used notionally in this exercise radionuclide gas migration to the surface both the us and russian scenarios included artificial assumptions on the migration of radioactive gas to the surface to permit the it to conclusively find the une when gas samples were collected in the proper locations it should be noted that these radioactive gases may not have made their way to the surface within month or so after the explosion 35 logistics and other osi operational issues while both the united states and the russian federation agreed that logistical issues would not be focus of this joint tabletop exercise favoring instead to examine technical and operational osi issues some logistical issues inevitably arose some assumptions were needed regarding the amount of time needed to transport and deploy instruments in various terrain the capacity of various transportation equipment and other parameters to provide realistic framework within which to conduct the scenarios for example it would be unrealistic that an it could deploy all of its equipment in one day to any location of thectbtwgb14ruus1 page 13 inspection area therefore for the technical and operation lessons learned to be valid the logistical constraints that an it would face need to be simulated although both sides agreed that some logistics needed to be taken into account each side approached this differently this led to some disagreements and provided an opportunity to explore some osi logistics issues in greater detail this section will summarize some of those lessons learned as well as discuss other general osi operational issues sensor deployment times while there is general understanding regarding the length of time required to deploy various sensors more precise data need to be collected to fully comprehend the limitations time terrain weather etc that sensor deployment times will impose in successfully conducting an osi for example the us and russian participants had different opinions about the length of time required to deploy seismic sensors within the inspection area understanding this more precisely could impact for example the choice of search strategy in given area likewise deployment of radionuclide sampling equipment would provide more precise data regarding the resources required to effectively monitor an inspection area such data could also greatly impact osi planning and resource allocation by providing the it leader with greater insight into how to prioritize the necessary inspection activities and techniques based on available resources eg transportation personnel equipment etc it would also provide the it leader with knowledge about which kinds of deployments and processes deplete existing resources most quickly transportation during this exercise it also became clear that there needs to be more advanced agreement on the type and capacities including cargo and passengers of various vehicles used by the it not only for the scenarios but also in planning for an actual osi as there were differing views expressed during the exercise such information is critical to understanding the limitations that an it will encounter during an osi and how logistical constraints will impact the ability to capture the rapidly decaying phenomenology following any event likely to trigger an osi logistical impacts of sample chainofcustody while it is understood that sample chainofcustody will need to be maintained for various types of samples the degree to which this will impact the rate of data analysis during an osi is not yet clear when the procedures for chainofcustody are fully developed it will be necessary to examine the time delays that may be introduced into the sample collection and analysis process to understand how this may impact the conduct of an osi data management and decisionmaking during the course of the exercise it was evident that one of the most challenging aspects of an osi was establishing decisionmaking and data management process not only is it important that the it have data management computer program such as geographic information system to organize and display the data by location the it also needs to determine either in general or prior to particular inspection what criteria will be used in the decisionmaking process during the osi conduct of future tabletop exercises this exercise demonstrated the need to have preplanned and agreed logistics data from which to conduct the inspection so that such issues will not detract from exercises that are designed to focus on the implementation of inspection activities and techniques an initial effort was demonstrated in the russian scenario using computergenerated logistics program which was quite realistic and helpfulctbtwgb14ruus1 page 14 in determining travel times this effort should be expanded for incorporation into future tabletop exercises in addition to supporting more dataintensive exercises such computer based program itself could be tested in logisticsbased tabletop exercise to refine such information for use in future ctbt osi training courses for inspection team members 36 osi overall strategy lessons learned the following section provides some insight into the various actions taken by each of the joint tabletop exercise teams as they simulated an it or an isp team and attempts to reveal some of the factors that impacted the use of that particular teams strategy us it strategy in an attempt to quickly reduce the search area the us it used focused search strategy wherein even initial search activities were concentrated on ar eas features or facilities that were judged to be of higher interest than other areas passive seismic sensors radionuclide sensors and soil gas collectors all were placed near features more likely in the eyes of the us inspectors to be possible locations for possible nuclear test even the initial overflight and groundbased visual observations concentrated on portions of the inspection area that were judged priori to have higher probability of having hidden possible nuclear test the us team search strategy was based on the assumption that massive amounts of material must be hauled into and perhaps out of the location of possible nuclear test thus regions with poor or roads tended to be discounted in favor of areas where loadbearing roads existed the russian scenario included site introduced to divert the inspectors that looked quite similar to emplacements used by the rf at their former nuclear test site at semipalatinsk this site was in fact given only cursory treatment observation and swipe sample collection by the us team because of perceived flaws in the details of the site that did not conform to likely testing practice while this was clearly gamble by the it it paid off by enabling the team to spend more time on other areas and ultimately to locate the une actions of the us it brought to focus the issue of how the 12 hours allocated to the initial overflight will be used issues of what constitutes allowed flight time eg when the clock starts and whether time can be allocated in segments over several days surfaced these issues involve interpretation of the treaty and are being actively discussed by the preparatory commission working group b and need to be well defined in the osi operational manual adverse weather conditions were not played out due to the already severe time constraints of this exercise yet weather under both the russian and the us scenarios could seriously hinder conduct of the osi and could modify the its strategy rain or cloudy weather could have prevented overflights slowing progress in the russian scenario rain could have impeded travel over dirt roads in both scenarios snow cover could obscure any indications of past offroad travel and impede installation of instruments such as seismometers perhaps most importantly extreme low temperatures could severely limit the allowable working time of the it these aspects should be considered in future tabletop exercises russian isp strategy the russian isp like the us isp was generally cooperative in granting permission to the it to go to subsections of the inspection area the russian isp exercised its treatyprescribed prerogatives to take 36 hours at the poe in order to examinectbtwgb14ruus1 page 15 the equipment brought in by the us it mainly to ensure that the equipment met technical specifications and that it did not provide additional measurement sensitivities or other capabilities more generally the russian isp tended not to grant permission to the us it to do anything that was not explicitly permitted in the treaty russian it and us isp strategies in contrast to the initial focused search strategy employed by the us it the russian it consciously chose more systematic gridlike wide area search strategy passive seismic sensors radionuclide sensors soil gas collectors and even the initial overflight were initially spread widely over the entire 1000 km2 inspection area subsequent redeployments of each of those assets then became more focused in gradual way compared with the us team approach which was less systematic the russian it as did the us it asked to use all 12 hours of overflight after its original grid search was completed but did not insist when the us isp introduced relatively low barrier by stating that the requested helicopter was not available for few days the us isp would have been willing if the russian it had persisted to make available fixedwing aircraft four to five days later in this regard the us isp attempted to demonstrate some flexibility regarding the availability of the full 12 hours of overflight time beyond just the first couple of days but called attention to the fact that aircraft are expensive to have on call and that fixedwing aircraft are permissible if less useful platform for osi overflights the us isp like its russian counterpart tended to be quite cooperative in terms of granting permission for the russian it to conduct its activities the sensor deployment strategy of the russian it stressed the assumed us isp vehicle and escort capabilities reflecting the more careful attention by the russians and their logistics computer model to more realistic simulation of at least the temporal aspects of logistics capabilities the us isp was very generous in allowing the russian it to proceed to the inspection area without taking the full time allowed for examining the inspection equipment at the poe while such action allowed the exercise to start off on note of cooperation and allowed the exercise to proceed more quickly without much exercise time being consumed by poe activities it may be unrealistic to expect an isp not to examine osi equipment more carefully at the poeboth from the standpoint of suspicions of surreptitious datagathering capabilities and from the standpoint of allowing the it to arrive at the inspection area earlier when any aftershock activity is more likely to remain and be detectable on the other hand in order to meet the treaty timelines it may be realistic to defer such indepth equipment inspection until arrival at the inspection area when the operational checks are conducted for the inspection equipment note since different views exist on the meaning of equipment inspections it may be useful to clarify such activities in the osi operational manual in more detail because of the time compression employed in this exercise several days of simulated inspection time would pass between periods of data exchange between the isp data team and the inspection team thus the it would get several days of data at one time this often frustrated the russian it because it did not allow daytoday adjustments of the inspection plan that might result from having near realtime data such as telemetered seismic data however in real inspection other data eg soil gas samples that must be collected for severalday period and take considerable time for analysis might not be available for several daysctbtwgb14ruus1 page 16 the russian it wished to have continuous video as well as occasional still photos during the overflight since the treaty says that the isp shall have the right to provide its own camera operator this brings up obvious implications for the number of personnel required to be on the flight at any one time this is matter of treaty interpretation that should be addressed in the osi operational manual 4 exercise planning lessons learned in addition to providing vehicle for understanding various technical and operational issues associated with ctbt onsite inspections the usrussian joint tabletop exercise was useful in gaining insight into the utility of such exercises as tool for examining various osi issues as such it also provided an opportunity to record some lessons pertaining to the implementation of tabletop exercises this section will detail some of these lessons in two sections the first discusses general lessons learned pertinent to exercise development and execution while the second discusses lessons related to data preparation and presentation 41 exercise development and execution while any simulation exercise requires great deal of planning and preparation to successfully execute the planning preparation and execution time required for any such exercise in bilateral or multilateral setting will be significantly greater due to the many complexities that such an environment creates while participants may agree on the objectives of the exercise and even conceptually how it ought to be implemented not everyone will agree as to how this is best accomplished and even though agreement will eventually be reached on these points differences will still remain and not become evident until the actual execution of the exercise this was perhaps the principal lesson learned through this exerciseplanning experience in the course of this tabletops development and execution there were number of instances in which participants failed to reach complete understanding of issues even when everyone believed such issues to have been thoroughly explored and resolved this section of the report will discuss what steps may be taken to minimize the possibility of such misunderstandings between fellow planning team members as well as some of the lessons believed to be relevant and useful to planners of subsequent ctbt osi exercises communication between planning team members much of the success of this exercise is owed to the extensive communication within the us and russian teams as well as between the respective planning teams while not all members of the us and russian exercise planning teams met regularly all of the subject matter experts who needed to communicate with their counterparts did so usually via email early in the planning phase of the exercise participants established how they would communicate and what subjects would be communicated nevertheless disagreements arose during the exercise because of different interpretations of the details of the ground rules designation of an alternate control team head it is important that the primary coordinator on each side have designated alternate who can be called upon in the event the primary exercise coordinator is not available both to continue to interface with members in that team as well as with members of the other planning teamctbtwgb14ruus1 page 17 separation of the control team from the isp and the it the control team should act as an independent entity with clear separation from both the it and the isp the only function of the control team should be manage the play of the exercise and adjudicate any areas of disagreement documentation of agreements made in the preparatory phase of an exercise it is vital to clearly document all of the meetings held and agreements reached among participants this documentation should then be reviewed by all participants and checked for accuracy since all team members will use these documents as reference materials when the scenario and supporting data are generated one particular document developed by the exercise planning team was set of operating assumptions which detailed key elements that would assist in shaping the direction of the exercise for example the operating assumptions included decisions regarding the role of the evaluation team the scope of the exercise and the level of data processing that would have to be done by each it exchange of data at various times during the planning phase of the exercise the us and russian data teams exchanged data to verify formats to be used during the exercise as well as to provide preliminary scenario data such as the consultation and clarification cc package while data exchanges to verify data formatting helped to minimize confusion between the teams more extensive data exchanges should be done in the form of limited practice exercise or dryrun the teams would use mock data to verify what kinds of data the teams would see during the actual exercise additionally since it would be impractical to do practice exercises with the cc package because it contains scenario information each control team could pass the cc package to third party who could verify that the package contained all of the intended information including maps with legends images and other supporting information as an example of the type of problem that can arise the map transmitted to the us it with the cc package did not have legend scale or reference grid this inhibited development of the us it inspection plan there was time to obtain the missing information prior to traveling to the russian federation since the joint usrussian exercise planning team had agreed as part of the operating assumptions that the cc package exchange would take place shortly before the team departed to simulate the length of time real it would have to develop an inspection plan prior checking by third party could have helped to alleviate this difficulty in timely manner method of exercise implementation because this joint collaboration was planned as two scenarios with reversal of roles by the us and russian sides in each scenario there existed between and among the teams combination of mutual encouragement and competition that is each team wanted to perform well its assigned role for each scenario and each it in particular strove to uncover the true nature of the scenario that the other side had constructed this resulted in some intense periods in which certain aspects of genuine difficulty in data generation by the us data team were misinterpreted by the russian it as delay tactics by the us isp this also resulted in accelerated attention to certain areas of the inspection area as opposed to more systematic approach to inspection other methods of implementing bilateral tabletops could be explored that would minimize any feeling of competitiveness between teams and allow both sides to focus more on the process used by the it rather than the inspection results that each it might achievectbtwgb14ruus1 page 18 role of exercise controller the exercise controllers main function is analogous to that of the director of play this individual is responsible for ensuring that all participants understand and execute their roles at the appropriate time and that all are aware of the status of the exercise the controller should be very familiar with the exercise scenarios but should not have any other role during the execution of the tabletop time compression while it is necessary to have some time compression in tabletop exercise that compression should not impede the ability of the exercise to evolve naturally and to reveal relevant issues when time compression is too great participants tend to rush through certain aspects of an exercise and become focused on getting through minimum number of inspection days this places the it members in state of mind not conducive to exploring the inspection area in manner consistent with what would be done in the field and interferes with the natural evolution of the exercise compression of 25 days to simulate 25 days of an inspection is too great four or five days would have provided sufficient amount of time use of individual computers for data generation initially the exercise planning team debated whether the us side could bring its own computers or should rely on the host rf in this case to provide them finally it was decided that certain data team members would bring their own computers this proved to be very important for efficient data production data could be generated in the midst of discussions in the back of the main room or elsewhere in addition data team members were intimately familiar with their own data sets application software and operating systems which permitted rapid data production and analysis the decision to allow us team members to bring their own computers was crucial in assuring the success of this exercise playing logistics in tabletop exercise an innovative approach to track logistics used by the rf in their scenario was computer program designed for number of bookkeeping tasks based on digitized map of the russian inspection area this program kept track of overflight and groundbased visual observations vehicle movement sampling locations and seismic sensor placement this program substantially facilitated the exchange of information between the isp and the it future improvements and additions to the program could result in greater emphasis on the logistical aspects of an exercise such as the metering of travel time the allocation of personnel and their use in the field according to their specific skills such program could ensure that the resources time and equipment and the limited number of personnel with specific skills were actually available to perform specific tasks in addition aspects of an osi such as weather and the results of sample analyses or seismic sensor readings could be played out more efficiently 42 data preparation and presentation presentation of simulated data in tabletop exercise presents unique challenges in real inspection inspectors will be faced with ambiguous or noisy data in an informational sense it is important in the play of the exercise to try to incorporate this uncertainty in hard data such as radionuclide measurement results and seismic data and especially in soft data such as visual observations what is desired is method that forces the inspection team to make decisions in noisy environment that mimics possible real situations both the russian and us data teams approached this problem differently the results are discussed below ctbtwgb14ruus1 page 19 presentation of overflight data the us data team presented summaries of overflight observations in verbal format not photographs member of the us data team orally described what the russian it would have seen at the place where the rf it had said it wanted to conduct visual observation although this approach allowed the us data team to excerpt relevant portions from the materials prepared in advance the russian it did not believe this to be an effective mechanism to convey to them the results of an overflight even though they could ask questions of the us data team who could add extra clues or withhold information depending on what was appropriate at that time in the inspection activities yet the alternative approach of presenting visual data in the form of photographs also had significant problems and limitations as discussed below use of photos and schematics to convey groundbased visual observations the groundbased visual data as presented by the russian data team relied heavily on photographs this resulted in the us it asking many questions that were unrelated to the information that the presenter intended to convey but instead were unique to the photo being displayed while some photos can be invaluable for informing exercise members of the terrain they will be entering too much dependence upon photos may be harmful or distracting to the exercise schematics alternatively provided minimal information focused on particular feature but seemed to speed up the exercise offering the chance to ask questions about features more relevant to the its investigation improving visual data presentation while the use of narrative supplemented with photos and diagrams has been found to be the most effective way to convey visual observation data this approach is very time consuming alternative methods have been explored but would require substantial amount of development to become applicable to ctbt osi tabletop exercises one alternative for conveying data more quickly would be to have number of inspection activities proceeding simultaneously during the course of the exercise for example some members of the it could listen to the visual observation data presentation then summarize it for the remainder of the team this would also simulate more realistically how an infield exercise would proceed automation of seismic data generation during previous internal us tabletop exercise processing of seismic data was carried out manually this proved very time consuming and was limiting factor in the play of the exercise for the joint usrussian tabletop exercise computer programs were used that greatly improved data processing the us data team provided printout of daily event catalogs and plots of event locations which aided the russian it in its analysis and interpretation of the data the turnaround time however for the us data team to produce the data was limited by another factorthe time it took to crosscheck the deployment logistics for each exercise period the russian it would provide the us data team with list of new locations for seismometers which had to be checked to determine how long the deployments or redeployments would take this process which was done manually by the us data team took at least 30 minutes for each exercise period the final seismic data could not be produced until all of the sensor locations were known so the logistical evaluation of the installation became limiting factor in the data team response deployment time checking was not an issue for the russian data team because travel and installation time calculations were built into their computer program future exercises should also include capability preferably automated to calculate the time needed forctbtwgb14ruus1 page 20 transporting and setting up the seismic base station telemetry and analysis equipment as well as base camp radionuclide analysis equipment and quality assurance and sample tracking procedures etc seismic data format initially the russian side wanted to have the it determine event locations from raw p and s wave time pick data provided by the data team the resulting event locations determined by the it using computer code for hypocentral determination would automatically include the uncertainty introduced by station distributions picking errors and the earth velocity model used as would be the case in real inspection while this approach provides maximum realism the us data team argued that such an approach was not practical because of the time needed for the data team to generate travel time data and the time needed by the it to process the data during each period for which new arrangement of seismic stations was in place the data team would need to produce complete set of compressional and shear wave arrival times for each simulated event at each detecting seismic station with consideration of picking errors based on signaltonoise ratios and the seismic velocity model for the inspection area the it would then have to run all of this data through location code with some assumed velocity model to determine the locations of the detected events since data analysis was not considered to be goal of this exercise the joint exercise planning teams decided that even with the use of computers having the it analyze data would require too much time and divert attention from the stated objectives of the exercise in addition prior to the exercise the us control team had insufficient time and resources to automate the exercise and coordinate the computer code with the russian counterparts it was finally agreed that for each exercise period the data team would use set of predetermined event locations and the current station configuration to compute set of detected events with builtin location uncertainties data processing would be required of the it the us and russian sides agreed on most of the important aspects of seismic data processing eg attenuation rates to use for seismic signals aftershock occurrence rates from explosions calibration of sensor signal strength to magnitude signaltonoise ratios for detection and identification formats for data output etc relatively early in the planning stages however since both data teams were still developing the computer codes for seismic data processing when planning meetings took place there inevitably were some differences that arose during the exercise such as the us seismic depth determination algorithm already mentioned another example of miscue in data exchange was the fact that the russian data team did not provide the us it with either table or location map of the detected events this added to the time needed for data analysis by the us it these issues could not be remedied at the time of the exercise because it would involve modification of previously prepared computer codes in future exercises it would be beneficial to verify data formats in detail prior to the start of the exercise this could be accomplished by allocating short period of time during which several data exchanges could take place between data team members and it members utilizing mock data this would preferably be done several weeks in advance of the exercise to allow for modifications of data generation systems an alternative would be to use common computer platform machine and software that all participants are familiar with simulating the effect of noise in seismic monitoring the most substantial difference between the us and russian simulation of seismic data in the exercise was in the manner inctbtwgb14ruus1 page 21 which seismic noise was handled the us data simulation assumed that an automated system or analyst would be able to eliminate most nonnatural noise sources local to single station such as heavy equipment passing the sensor or heavy machinery operating nearby thus for the purpose of the exercise an event detection reported by the data team would be considered to be real seismic event such as an earthquake aftershock mine explosion or explosion aftershock and not local noise even if it were detected by only single sensor the russian data team however took different approach in their scenario the russians wanted to simulate difficulties that could arise from locally generated noise intentional or otherwise hence the bulk of the detected events were singlestation detections indicating very local source the only real seismic events aftershocks from the une were events detected by multiple stations once the us it understood this aspect of the data generated by the russian data team it was relatively easy to identify the source of aftershocks use of 37ar in tabletop exercises 37ar is produced almost exclusively by the interaction of highenergy neutrons with natural calcium in the surrounding medium of nuclear test as such it is virtually forensic smoking gun for the identification of non compliance with the ctbt although the actual transport of 37ar by periodic upward gas flow driven by lowered surface atmospheric pressure known as barometric pumping from the detonation point underground to the surface may take months it is tempting to generate an ad hoc presence in the exercise eg pressurized leak used in both scenarios to construct simpler and more definite signature of noncompliance consequently the removal of 37ar as one of the reportable radionuclides should be considered for future osi exercises in order to require the generation and subsequent interpretation of complex radionuclide signatures that would exercise more realistically the steps an it would need to take in an osi such interpretation of possibly ambiguous radionuclide signatures may be necessary to complete the mission of an actual osi whether possible nuclear test has been executed or not 5 report of the evaluation team the usrussian joint tabletop exercise participants included two russian and two us evaluators who observed and evaluated the exercise the evaluation team members were selected because of their technical expertise as well as their extensive firsthand knowledge of testing issues the ctbt negotiations and preparatory commission discussions regarding the ctbt verification regime the evaluation team provided written statement containing its collective assessment of the conduct of the exercise five additional us observers representing the department of energy doe the arms control and disarmament agency acda and the department of state also attended the exercise and provided their observations to the group informally the following evaluation is based primarily on the report of the evaluation team however it includes input provided by the observers as well the team based its evaluation on the four objectives of the exercise to simulate the actions of the it including interactions with the isp in order to examine different ways the united states and the russian approach inspections and develop appropriate recommendations for the international community to identify ambiguities and contradictions in the interpretation of treaty and protocol provisions that might become apparent in the course of an inspection and that need clarification in connection with the development of the osi operational manual and osi infrastructurectbtwgb14ruus1 page 22 to confirm the efficacy of using tabletop exercises to assist in developing an effective ctbt verification regime to identify strong and weak points in the preparation and implementation methods of such exercises for the purpose of further improving possible future exercises the evaluators and observers concluded that the tabletop exercise succeeded in achieving its objectives it illuminated number of practical issues that will arise during actual onsite inspections under the ctbt the lessons learned will help the united states and the russian federation prepare for implementation of the treaty and lay the groundwork for further bilateral cooperation in this field the group recommended that the experience gained from the exercise be shared with the ctbt preparatory commission in vienna to help it prepare to implement the onsite inspection regime in the treaty including inspector training operational manual preparation and equipment selection the evaluators commented that the scenarios used in the exercise were challenging without being overly complicated allowing both sides to practice several aspects of real inspections an appropriate amount of detail was provided and the scenarios were internally consistent at the same time the evaluators noted that in future exercises the control teams should better define the ground rules and basic assumptions that will be used further these assumptions should be clearly agreed upon in advance and recorded in written form in this exercise participants appeared to begin the exercise with different assumptions regarding certain elements including background seismic noise equipment to be used and certain logistical constraints the exercise highlighted the importance of precision and clarity in communications between the it and the isp team when more than one language is used the availability of highquality interpretation is essential even with the relative simplicity of this exercise and the services of excellent interpreters few misunderstandings and delays occurred owing to communication problems in an effort to improve communication the evaluators recommended that in future bilateral exercises the us team should provide at least one interpreter who is native english speaker in addition all interpreters should be trained for technical as well as nontechnical interpretation in this exercise the large amount of information initially supplied to the it slowed the beginning of the exercise it would be more realistic for the team to have in its possession not only the information developed during the cc process and the debate in the executive council but also the information that would presumably be supplied by the technical secretariatmaps of the region for example the location of all operating nuclear reactors in the area and perhaps relevant unclassified satellite imagery the exercise confirmed that the duration of the exercise and rules imposed influence the effectiveness of the simulation process and decisionmaking in some cases the time compression imposed during the scenarios prevented the it from thoroughly considering data and developing unified deployment and sampling strategy in the future scenarios of similar scope should be allotted at least four days further work should be done to achieve greater realism in the exercise wherever possible in particular it would be useful to exercise logistical issues that could arise duringctbtwgb14ruus1 page 23 an onsite inspection for example future exercises could address issues associated with the geographic separation of subgroups communications chain of command equipment failures illness inclement weather and unexpected logistical problems similarly the interactions between the it and the isp were played out in this exercise in highly cooperative manner which was appropriate for this stage of our work as result the focus was primarily on data collection and interpretation rather than on negotiation in future exercises we may wish to consider more adversarial scenarios in which negotiation and compromise play greater role it would also be useful to further practice interviewing techniques including those for dealing with uncooperative or untruthful subjects the strategies used by the its were effective in gaining relevant information within the constraints imposed by the scenarios both its divided themselves roughly into visual observation and seismic and radionuclide subgroups and operated efficiently there were differences in approach however for example the us it used cautious initial approach both in the use of its initial overflight and the targeted placement of few sensors near suspect sites the russian it alternatively decided to cover as soon as possible the entire inspection area on its initial overflight and to deploy the maximum number of fixed seismic sensors in both scenarios the it discovered the suspect explosion toward the end of the exercise the evaluators noted that seismic and radionuclide sensors and data lend themselves well to simulation the simulation of visual information and the use of such simulated information obtained from overflights and groundbased visual observation are much more difficult in this exercise the latter was rather timeconsuming and not entirely realistic despite the best efforts of the participants realistic exercises in this area may require very elaborate and expensive simulations or perhaps must await exercises in the field the evaluators and observers strongly recommended that the group investigate other approaches to presenting visual information to facilitate future exercises one manner in which to assist with visual observation is to ensure that the it is provided with maps of the region the location of all operating nuclear reactors in the area and perhaps relevant unclassified satellite imagery prior to the exercise in addition visual descriptions of areas could be presented in written form and the it members could respond to that information and request clarification when needed one observer suggested that the it leader provide the rest of the it with report provided by the control team at the end of each inspection day that would describe the main areas of interest observed by the visual observation team this option would also more realistically simulate an actual inspection one of the most useful benefits of realistic simulations is the identification of problems related to differing interpretations of or lack of clarity in the treaty few such issues arose such as whether the initial overflight could be spread out over several days it is important that such issues be identified and resolved in vienna during the development of the osi operational manual before entry into force of the treaty the exercise also highlighted differences in interpretation of the types of equipment that would be used during an onsite inspection for example mobile laboratory although equipment was rejected by the isp during this exercise it seems evident that equipment issues such as certification calibration and registration should be worked out to the maximum extent possible in vienna to minimize problems and delays related to equipment at the poe in addition it should be made clear in advance what equipment for example means of transportation will be provided by the isp at the poe and in the inspection areactbtwgb14ruus1 page 24 in this exercise both its presented brief verbal report to simulate their report to the executive council in longer more realistic exercise detailed written report would be required 51 recommended next steps the evaluation team recommended that another bilateral exercise should be held as soon as it can be properly prepared it should incorporate lessons learned from this exercise as well as greater realism the sides should also move toward cooperative work using real instrumentation in the field the eventual goal should be realistic multilateral trial inspections 6 proposed next steps for usrussian interactions on ctbt osi the exercise evaluators and observers determined that the usrussian joint tabletop exercise was valuable in highlighting policy technical and procedural issues that require resolution both within each national government and within the preparatory commission it also allowed participants the opportunity to work through certain technical issues and operational details associated with onsite inspections in costeffective manner because of the value and success of the exercise it is expected that this joint exercise is the first in line of efforts of this type future activities should occur under the auspices of working group three the group identified three possible next steps as noted below additional bilateral tabletop exercises through the development and implementation process of this first usrussian joint tabletop exercise the participants learned great deal about conducting an effective tabletop exercise the exercise highlighted policy technical and operational issues that need to be resolved before the ctbt preparatory commission completes the osi operational manual additional tabletop exercises would provide an opportunity to flesh out such issues future exercises should address such issues as logistics confrontational or intransigent isp equipment failures managed access inspector illness difficult weather conditions and the continuation phase on an onsite inspection multilateral tabletop exercise the group noted that the preparatory commission would benefit from an exercise like this one such an exercise would provide participants with an opportunity to identify and resolve policy technical methodological and logistics issues associated with conducting an onsite inspection it is worth considering conducting multilateral tabletop exercise in which members of the preparatory commission would participate as inspectors us and russian policy and technical experts could serve as the control team for such an exercise or could participate as inspectors as well directed field exercises the tabletop exercise made clear that adequate osi procedures cannot be established until an equipment list is agreed and there is thorough understanding of the logistics associated with ctbt onsite inspections seismic monitoring radionuclide sampling and visual observations each have associated with them specific logistical requirements and limitations to address these issues in costeffective manner the united states and the russian federation could hold their own internally directed exercises that isolate specific methodologies and technologies at an appropriate time policy and technical experts should build on these field exercises by conducting bilateral field exercises that would enable participants to refine methodologies and techniquesctbtwgb14ruus1 page 25 appendix i russian scenario consultation and clarification package ctbto

experts after completing the consideration relevant materials will be provided to the ctbto in this connection we would like to note that some other facts are known concerning the detection of the anomalous high seismic effect of chemical explosions for instance the results obtained in the course of joint uskazakhstan experiments carried out in july september 1997 at the former semipalatinsk test site ctbto restricted for tabletop exercise usectbtwgb14ruus1 page 32 ctbto restricted for tabletop exercise use c weather conditions along the signal path may have affected the results of infrasonic monitoring unfortunately there are direct confident data on speed of wind and other conditions in the area that could be used for numerical estimates in addition the signal of the explosion in question like the signals of earlier explosion is rather weak and the measurement error is of great importance therefore we believe that there is not any conflict between the parameters we provided of the chemical explosion and the data of infrasonic monitoring d as it is known within the framework of confidencebuilding measures providing technical secretariat with any information on the national use of the chemical explosions yielding higher than 300 tons tnt provided by part iii paragraph 2 of protocol to the treaty is voluntary measure we consider groundless all the doubts about the above explosion however as the evidence of our readiness to cooperation with the organization we clarify that the explosion has not been notified in advance to avoid any preventing actions of the socalled environmental protection movement hampering this extremely important mining activity for the economy of the region we believe the request does not concern in any way the problem related to

idc event 1614221 an unintentionally large chemical explosion has been reported at commercial surface coal mine at the same time and in the vicinity of the idc event initial reports indicate that

simultaneously b an additional possibility for the seismic event recorded as idc event 1614221 could have been an aftershock of the magnitude 41 earthquake that occurred in the vicinity 36985n 166230w on 6 october 2001 see idc event 1609923 pacifica possesses regional seismic capability and is therefore unable to confirm or refute this hypothesis ctbto restricted for tabletop exercise use

onsite inspection request from atlantia atlantia has thoroughly analyzed the data provided in the pacifica clarification response and deems it unsatisfactory b atlantia believes activities possibly

highly unusual even in mining region that frequently uses blasting such an explosion would require quantity of explosives far in excess of any known mining practices for this procedure additionally the ims infrasound station 300 kilometres away would have detected surface explosion as large as the one claimed by pacifica the pacifica hypothesis that idc event 1614221 could have been an aftershock of an earthquake that occurred 26 days earlier is marginally credible however analysis of this event has determined that the first arrival was sharp upward moving wave indicative of an

pacifica cannot offer scientific proof to back up our claim of an explosion at the coal mine since the region is seismically uncharacterized and we do not currently possess the technology to seismically monitor the region our investigation has determined the explosion was caused by human error however we can only offer the newspaper article included as attachment one as further
