s has grappled with issues raised by insurance carriers and other providers of health insurance that offer coverage across state lines carriers and health plan provide rs have appealed to congress for relief from complicated array of 50 states and the district of columbias health insurance laws states are the primary regulators of the business of health insurance right clarified by the 1945 mccarranferguson act nd all states have large body of laws that apply to health insurance states insurance requirements number in the thousands there are more than 1900 laws on benefits alone and can be complicate d even the laws of two states addressing the same matter can differ on many dimensions in addition to the benefits that comprise health insurance products state laws and regu lations require patient protections address how insurance carriers develop the rates charged for their products and describe procedures for approval of those rates state laws and regulations address how entities in the business of selling health insurance f und their enterprises and prepare against the risk of insolvency they are subject to fair marketing practice laws requirements related to the filing of grievances against the plans and appealing plan decisions entities selling health insurance may also be s ubject to state taxes in add ition state laws form the basis for lawsuits against

health policy institute at http wwwstatehealthfactsorg and council for affordable health insurance at httpwwwcahiorgcahi_contentsresourcespdfhealthinsurance mandates2008pdf selfinsured plans offered by large employers are exempt from state laws sometimes large employers choose to forego purchasing trad itional health insurance for their employees instead the employer collects the premium contributions from all employees combines those collections with its own contributions and from those funds pays for health care for workers under ch selffunded plan provider networks may be organized by inhouse health benefits ad ministrators or more likely employers will engage in an administrative servicesonly aso contract with traditional insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22476crs3 carrier or hmo the major difference betw een traditional health plans purchased from indemnity insurance companies and the selff unded coverage offered by large employers besides the preemption of state law is that under selffunded plans the employer retains the risk that one or more of its workers will be in need of costly medical care under traditional health plans that risk is transferred to the insurance carrier or the hmo very large employers are able to selfinsure their employees because the group for which premiums are being collected is sufficiently large to make the risk of having to pay for few expensive people relatively small in ddition because these firms tend to be large they have the more considerab assets of the firm to fall back upon should the health plan costs exceed premiums collected small employers rarely selfinsure because they do not have the large number of employees across which to collect premiums and spread risk nor do they have consider able assets to back up the premium collections the goals of harmonization advocates of bills intended to rationalize th body of insurance laws applying across state lines cite selffunded plan s as examples of the way th small or individual markets for insurance could flourish if regulatory author ity of the states were reduced large self funded employer plans tend to have comprehensive and gener ous benefit offerings offer choice of plans and employees nd to be happy with these plans by reducing the states laws that apply to multistate plans advocates hope that more plan choices would become available to small employers and individuals bills that would allow insurers to forego all or all but one primary states laws could eliminate some state benefit mandates potentially allowing for less costly limited benefit plans to be offered in addition if primary state is one without rate re gulations laws that require premium rates to be averaged acro ss both healthy and less healthy populations lowerpriced plans for healthier subscribers could become available finally advocates hope that by making these changes in the i ndividual market for in surance new covered lives will be drawn into it encouraging new options and higher enrollment and thus improve the overall functi oning of the individual market for insurance the health care choi ce act of 2007 hr 4460 one approach to reducing the number of st ate laws and regulations that apply to insurance products sold across state lines is advanced in hr 4460 the health care choice act of 2007 the stated purpose of the bill when referred to the committee on energy and commerce on december 12 2007 is to pr ovide for cooperative governing of individual health insurance coverage offered in interstate commerce the bill would allow insurance carriers and other issuers of health insurance sold to individuals hr 4460 w ould not apply to health plans bought or sold in the employer group market for insurance to designate state in which it is licensed and qualified to sell health insurance as its primary state the laws of the primary state would govern the sale of individual health insurance policies in that state as we ll as in any other secondary state this would allow the issuer to sell its products in one or more secondary states without complying with most of the insuran ce laws of those sec ondary states thereby simplifying the business of offering health pl ans across state lines primary state would have the sole jurisdiction to enforce its laws in its state as well as in any secondary stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22476crs4 3 personal communication with mila kofman health policy institute at georgetown university june 29 2006under hr 4460 the only provisions of s econdary state that would be retained would be those laws rules re gulations or agreements governing the use of care or cost management techniques provide r contracting network access or adequacy health care data collection or quality assurance secondary states however could require issuers to pay premium and other taxes such as high risk pool assessments register with the secondary states insurance commissioner submit to examinations of their fina ncial condition if th primary states insurance commissioner has not already done so comply with lawful order issued in delinquency proceeding or aninjunction if they have been found to be financially impaired participate in any insurance insolvency guaranty association and comply with certain state laws regarding fraud and abuse unfair claims settlement practices and independent review health insurance issuers would be required to give notice in any coverage offered and at renewal that identifies which state is its primary state and explains that the policy is not subject to the laws and regulations of the secondary state in which the policy is being issued in addition the bill includes provision that would require any policy sold in secondary state to also be offered fo r sale in primary state provision that appears to be intended to establish that all plans be subject to the enforcement authority of regulators of primary state finally the bill establishes federal floor for coverage offered in secondary states in order for those plans to qualify for the ex emption of state insu rance laws the floor consists of requirement s related to plan solvency for st ates to become secondary states they must use riskbased capital formula for determining capital and surplus requirements and an external review requirement for state to be designated as either primary or secondary state it must provide for independent external review issues raised by the harmoniza tion provisions of hr 4460 hr 4460 addresses insurance harmonizati on on considerably smaller scale than other proposals because it focuses only on those plans offered for sale in the individual market for insurance in the individual market there are relatively few states that regulate plan pricing see table 1 in addition under current law sometimes be nefit mandates do not apply to plans sold in the individual ma rket for example requirements that plans cover prenatal care and newbor n deliveries often are not pplicable in the individual market for insurance3 nonetheless some consumer advocates and state insurance commissioners raise concerns about the potentia l negative consequences of removing all but one states authority over such plans opponents raise the concern that insurance issuers will be motivated to designate those states that do little to exercise their regulatory authority as primary states effectively eliminating all or much of the regulation over the business of insurance specifically the loss of some of the states required benefits and many of the consumer protections ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22476crs5 4 us congress house committee on ener gy and commerce subcommittee on health the health care choice act hearing on hr 2335 sic 109th cong 1st sess june 28 2005 washington gpo 2005raised as concern even though h r 4460 does not preempt the laws of all states from applying to these plans there are some states that impose very few requirements on insurers selling policies th bills supporters on the other hand see this as measure of the bills success minimizing the intrusion of state governments in the market for individual health insurance advocates of the bill hope that the remova l of states benef it mandates and rating rules will allow for more and betterpriced pl ans for the majority of the population that is relatively healthy this approach however may result in loss of coverage for some individuals who are less healthy or who are struck by an unexpected illness without rating rules insurers can reduce prices fo r healthy people encouraging more coverage but raise rates for those who are not potentially resulting in loss of coverage for those most in need of it enforcement of primary states laws in secondary state is seen as potential problem with this bill under hr 4460 if secondary state resident finds that the laws of the primary state are being misapplied he or she would be required to seek the assistance of the insurance commissioner of the primary state for correction of this situation concerns have been raised by the national associ ation of insurance commissioners that state regulators would be unable to assist their own constituents in the real world of tight state budgets it will be virtually impossible to assist nonresident consumer in distant state4 enforcement can become more challenging because of the incentive for insurers to migrate to the one or two states that have the least regulatory body framework and staff pot entially increasing the opportunities for fraud and abuse goal of the bill is to create level playing field with respect to state laws for insurers offering coverage across state lines the bill does not however create level playing field between insurers or among c onsumers or providers within state by harmonizing the laws for multistate carriers smaller local carriers could be put at disadvantage their plans would continue to be subject to state mandates rate regulation and patient protections in each state poten tially making those pr oducts more appealing to those in poorer health consumers in one state could find their plans are regulated by another state making it confusing and possi bly difficult to seek enforcement of rights described by geographically di stant primary state finally providers could be required to meet multiple different procedural laws for the multiple primary states that are designated by the carriers with which the providers contract other approaches to harmonizing health insurance regulation in addition to hr 4460 number of legi slative proposals have been introduced in recent sessions whose common purpose is to pr omote uniformity of insurance rules across state lines the approaches typically involve either exempting insurers from state health insurance laws or federalizing such laws at least in part the expectation is that thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22476crs6 5 for comprehensive discussion about general approaches to health insurance reform and relevant bills introduced in the 110th congress see crs report rl34389 health insurance reform and the 110th congress by jean hearneapproaches either separately or collectivel would reduce insurers regulatory burden which in turn would lead to lower health insurance costs5 broadly the federal approach redesignates all or part of state insurance regulation as under federal jurisdiction for example s 334 the healthy americans act specifies benefit standards that would apply to the new plans established under this bill in addition s 334 would impose new rating rules both the benefit standards and rating rules would supercede existing state laws in these regulatory areas similarly s 1783 the ten steps to transform health care in america act would among other reforms establish new federal rating rules in the small group market and new federal benefit standards in both the individual and group markets under s 1783 insurers in the small group health insurance market and individual states would have the choice of complying with current state rating laws or the new federal rating rules similarly all insurers would have the choice of providing benefits in accordance with current state law or the new federal standards the bill would authorize the hhs secretary to establish board for the purpose of developing recomme ndations to harmonize incons istent state laws in four insurance oversight areas form and rate filin g rules market conduct prompt payment of claims and internal revi ew of disputed claims proposals that attempt to fede ralize all health insurance re gulation typically have the goal of universal coverage often such b ills propose to establis h new federal health insurance program an example of such proposals is hr 2034 the medicare for all act this act would establish new fede ral program to provide health benefits to everyone who is currently not eligible for benefits under medicare modeled after the medicare program the federal government would contract w ith private health insurance carriers to offer health benefits under the ne w program however the federal government would specify the rules and standards rela ting to the operation of the new program including benefits costsharing requirement s and payments to health care providers moreover the federal govern ment would establish trus t fund financed by personal income and employer taxes to pay for program costs under the exemption approach the obverse of the federal approach insurers would not be required to comply with specified insurance rules often exemption is targeted to new entities that pool individuals or groups toge ther bill that incorporates features of both exemption and federal approaches is hr 241 the small busi ness health fairness act of 2007 business or trade ssociations would be certified to offer health benefits in the small group market through association h ealth plans ahps ahps would be exempt from large body of state health insurance w including benefits consumer protections grievance and appeals proce dures premium taxation prohib itions on discrimination and fair marketing practices the bill does however maintain state regulatory authority regarding solvency standards and prompt payment laws the bill would place enforcement authority with respect to ahps with the federal government in consultation with the states
