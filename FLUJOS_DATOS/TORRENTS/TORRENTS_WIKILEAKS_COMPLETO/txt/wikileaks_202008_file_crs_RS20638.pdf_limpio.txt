use area but also in any state or local program receiving federal financial assistance and in any instance in which the burden on religious exercise affected interstate commerce rluipa still applies broadly to state and local governmental policies and decisions concerning zoning and landmarking policies and practices that have an impact on religious exercise but its scope otherwise has been narrowed to the religious exercise of persons institutionalized in state and local governmental facilities both the senate and the house gave their approval to the bill by voice vote on july 27 20003 and president clinton signed the measure into law on september 22 20004 background rluipa is the latest chapter in decadelong debate over whether religious exercise ought to be given special protection in law and over congress power to legislate that special protection the debate centers on whether what is known as the strict scrutiny test ought to be applied to burdens on religious exercise that result from government action and has evolved as dialogue between the supreme court and congress the following subsections explain the strict scrutiny test and detail this evolution strict scrutiny the free exercise clause of the first amendment provides in pertinent part that congress shall make law prohibiting the free exercise of religion5 this clause protects religious beliefs absolutely from governmental interference but not religious practice s over the past century the supreme court has used various standards of review in applying the clause to government actions that have impinged on religious practices beginning with sherbert v verner6 in 1963 however the court seemed to settle on the strict scrutiny standard as the basic standard of judicial review in that case the court held that government actions alleged to interfere with religious practice are constitutional only if they can be shown to serve some compelling public interest and to be more restrictive of the religious practice than necessary absent such showing the strict scrutiny test requires the religious practice to be exempted from the governmental action that imposes the burden strict scrutiny in short is balancing test that on its face gives extra weight to the religious interest the smith decision notwithstanding use of the strict scrutiny test religious claims prevailed in only minority of the reported cases in the quarter of century after sherbert httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20638crs3 7 one author found that the supreme court rejected 13 of the 17 free exercise claims it heard during this period and that between 1980 and 1990 the us courts of appeal rejected 85 of the 97 claims they heard see ryan james smith and the religious freedom assessment act an iconoclastic assessment 78 virginia law review 1407 14141417 1992 judge noonan of the us court of appeals for the 9th circuit came up with slightly different count he found that from 1963 to 1988 the supreme court rejected 13 of 19 free exercise claims and the us courts of appeal rejected 60 of 67 free exercise claims see appendix in eeoc v townley engineering mfg co 859 f2d 610 9th cir 1988 noonan j dissenting

intentionally discriminate against religion cases involving denials of unemployment compensation to persons who are unemployed due to conflict between their faith and the requirements of job and what it termed hybrid cases ie cases in which free exercise claim is joined with another constitutional claim 11 the coalition eventually comprised 67 religious civil liberties and civil rights organizations ranging across the political and religious spectrum 12 pl 103141 nov 16 1993 42 usca 2000bb et seq for fuller description of rfras consideration by congress see crs the religious freedom restoration act its rise fall and current status january 21 1999 crs report 97795 as the courts seemed to apply the test with light hand7 and in the 1980s the supreme court itself indicated growing disenchantment with the test by using less protective standard for free exercise claims by military personnel and prisoners8 finally in 1990 in employment division oregon depa rtment of human resources v smith9 the court largely abandoned strict scrutiny as the constitutional test for free exercise cases 54 it said that except in three limited circumstances10 strict scrutiny was longer to be employed as long as laws are religiously neutral and generally applicable the court held they may be uniformly applied to all persons and institutions without regard to any burden or even prohibition placed on their exercise of religion the free exercise clause the court said never relieves an individual of the obligation to comply with valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religion prescribes or proscribes the court asserted that the question of whether religious practices ought to be accommodated by government was matter to be resolved by the political proce ss and not the courts although it admitted that leaving accommodation to the political process will place at relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in religious freedom restoration act rfra this abandonment of strict scrutiny and relegation of religious accommodation to the political process stimul ated the rapid creation of broadbased organization the coalition for the free exercise of religion11 and the introduction by bipartisan sponsors in both the house and the senate of bill to undo smith the religious freed om restoration act rfra after three years of consideration congress enacted modified version of rfra into law in 199312 rfra restored strict scrutiny for free exercise cases albeit as statutory standard rather than constitutional one it provided that statute or regulation of general applicability can lawfully burden persons free exercise of religion only if it can be shownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20638crs4 13 521 us 407 1997 14 the clinton administration and most courts to date view rfra as still applying to the federal governmentto be essential to further compellin g governmental interest and to be the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest rfra made the standard applicable to governmental action at every level federal state and local and extended it to those areas such as the military and prisons that the supreme court had specifically excluded from the application of the strict scrutiny test in the 1980s as the means of enforcement rfra allowed aggrieved parties to bring suit city of boerne texas v flores arguments that rfra violated the constitutional principles of federalism and separation of powers had been raised during its consideration by congress and were subsequently pressed in litigation brought under the statute in 1997 in city of boerne texas v flores13 the supreme court held 63 that rfra was unconstitutional as applied to the states because it violated principles of federalism boerne involved dispute between local catholic church that wanted to expand its sanctuary and the city of boernes designation of the original sanctuary as an historic structure under its historic preservation ordinance under the smith test the church had claim for exemption from the landmarking ordinance because the measure was religiously neutral and generally applicable statute consequently the lawsuit filed by the church invoked rfra as the basis for its claim to an exemption from the ordinance in applying rfra to the states congress had exercised its power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment to enact appropriate legislation to enforce the religious liberty right embodied in the due process clause of that amendment but in boerne the supreme court asserte d that such legislation must reflect congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end and held that rfra failed to meet that test in enacting rfra it said congress not only had failed to develop legislative record that showed extensive denials of religious liberty but also had made rfra so broad that it intruded at every level of government displacing laws and prohibiting official actions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter particularly with respect to the states it stated rfra constituted considerable congressional intrusion into the states traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens as consequence the court concluded rfra reflects lack of proportionality or congruence between the means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved and contradicts vital principles necessary to maintain separation of powers and the federal balance in applying rfra to the states it held congress exceeded its power under the fourteenth amendment thus after boerne state and local governments were longer bound by rfra for them the religiously neutral and generally applicable standard of smith was generally the test governing policies and actions that burdened religious exercise14 the religious liberty protection act there is ongoing debate about whether judicial decisions applying rfra differed markedly in result from those of the presmithhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20638crs5 15 one author found that of the 168 cases involving rfra decided before boerne the rfra claim had been rejected in 143 instances and granted in only 25 see

continued concern over smith and new concern over boerne led bipartisan sponsors in both the house and the senate with the support of the coalition for the free exercise of relig ion to introduce the religious liberty protection act of 1998 rlpa hr 4019 and s 2148 on june 9 1998 as with rfra the measure would have reimposed strict scrutiny standard on state and local governments but this time primarily on the basis of congress power to attach conditions to its spending programs and its power over interstate commerce hearings were held in both the house and the senate but the measure did not get beyond subcommittee markup in the house in the 105th congress in the 106th congress modified version of rlpa was reintroduced in the house on may 5 1999 hr 1691 after another hearing it was reported on june 23 by the house judiciary committee by voice vote16 and on july 15 1999 the full house after some debate adopted the reported version of rlpa without change 30611817 the housepassed version of rlpa would have reapplied strict scrutiny test to state and local government policies and actions that imposed substantial burden on religious exercise 1 in any program or activity they operated which received federal financial assistance and 2 in any situation in which the burden or its removal would have affected interstate commerce in addition rlpa would have imposed strict scrutiny standard on any state or local land use regulation which imposed substantial burden on religious exercise if the regulati on allowed the government to make individualized assessments of the proposed uses to which property would be put it would also have barred such governments from discriminating against religious entities in the land use regulation process as with rfra aggrieved parties could have used rlpa in lawsuits or other proceedi ngs to obtain appropriate relief against state and local governments unlike rfra rlpa also authorized the federal government to bring suit to enforce compliance with the act the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of 2000 during rlpas consideration in the house concerns were raised inter alia that it would have the effect of overriding state and local civil rights statutes barring discrimination rep nadler dny proposed an amendment to limit this effect to small landlords in the case of housing discrimination laws and to small employers and religious institutions in the case of employment discrimination statutes his amendmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20638crs6 18 id at h 5607 19 in the senate hr 1691 was held at the

the senate calendar further action occurred on either measurelost in committee and was rejected on the house floor by vote of 19023418 but the coalition for the free exercise of religion fractured over the issue and the bill stalled19 on july 13 2000 truncated version of rlpa the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of 2000 rluipa was introduced with the full support of the coalition on july 27 2000 both the house and the senate approved the measure and president clinton signed it into law on september 22 2000 the measure 1 imposes strict scrutiny standard on state and local zoning and landmarking laws and regulations that impose substantial burden on an individuals or institutions exercise of religion if the burden is imposed in program that receives federal financial assistance b affects interstate commerce or c is imposed through process which permits the government to make individualized assessments of the proposed uses for the property involved 2 bars state and local governments from discriminating against religious entities in zoning and landmarking processes and from excluding religious assemblies from or unreasonably limiting them within any jurisdiction 3 imposes strict scrutiny standard of review on state and local governments for any substantial burdens they impose on the exercise of religion by persons in state or local institutions such as prisons juvenile detention facilities menta l hospitals and nursing homes if the burden is imposed in program that receives federal financial assistance or b affects interstate commerce 4 allows persons and institutions to use the act as claim or defense against state or local government 5 allows prisoners to use the act but subject to the prison reform litigation act of 1995 which sought to prevent frivolous litigation by prisoners 6 allows the federal government to enforce the act by seeking declaratory or injunctive relief against state and local governments and 7 defines religious exercise broadly to mean any exercise of religion whether compelled by or central to system of religious beliefs and to include the use building or conversion of real property for religious purposes thus in general terms rluipa can now be invoked in lawsuits and other proceedings by individuals and institutions that believe their exercise of religion has been substantially burdened by state and local government zoning and landmarking policies and decisions as well as by individuals in state and local institutions in both situations state and local governments will have to show that the policy or practice that imposes the burden serves compelling public interest and does so in the manner that is least restrictive of religious exercise if that test cannot be met the religious exercise will have to be exempted from the policys application the types of religious practices for which exemption can be sought are broad and inclusive and are not limited to those that are mandated by or central to system of religious beliefs finally it should be noted that the federal government can bring suit against state and local governments to enforce compliance with the act
